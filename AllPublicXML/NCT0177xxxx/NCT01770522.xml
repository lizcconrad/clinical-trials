      It is well known that being overweight or obese increases the risk of health problems, and
      that many people find it difficult to maintain a healthy weight. Worryingly the rise in
      obesity is greater in women than in the male population. One possible reason for this is that
      some women gain too much weight during their pregnancy and find it difficult to lose this
      weight after the birth of their baby. For example, women who gain more weight than
      recommended during pregnancy have been shown to be more likely to carry excess that weight at
      1 and 15 years after pregnancy, compared to women who gained the recommended amount of
      weight.

      There are currently no evidence-based guidelines in the UK for how weight should be managed
      during pregnancy. For these reasons, it is really important that we understand the factors
      affecting weight management before, during and after pregnancy.

      The aim of this research is therefore to find successful approaches to help women manage
      their weight before, during and after pregnancy. This will be completed by understanding the
      knowledge, attitudes, experiences and expectations of women during and after pregnancy and to
      identify the factors (e.g. diet, physical activity, poor social network etc.) which influence
      body weight. This will enable us to suggest better strategies for promoting healthy weight
      changes during and after pregnancy.

      Obesity in women of reproductive age is a major factor facing primary and secondary
      healthcare provision, with half of women of childbearing age in the UK classified as
      overweight or obese (The Information Centre, 2008). The prevalence of obesity in pregnant
      women living in Nottingham City is estimated to be 18.4%, (Wilcox, 2011), compared to 15.5%
      in England as a whole (Heslehurst et al., 2010). Being overweight or obese during pregnancy
      increases the risk of morbidity and mortality attributed to a range of pregnancy-related
      complications (Galtier et al, 2008), with 49% of maternal deaths occurring in overweight or
      obese women (Cantwell et al., 2011). Women who are overweight or obese at conception are more
      likely to develop hypertensive or diabetic complications, to develop thrombosis, and to
      deliver macrosomic babies (Ramachenderan et al, 2008). Associated with this are increased
      rates of delivery complications, postpartum haemorrhage and caesarean section (Galtier et
      al., 2008), with obese women at greater risk of anaesthetic complications. There is also a
      greater risk of infections (Metwally et al, 2007). Risks posed to the baby include congenital
      abnormalities such as spina bifida and oral clefts (King, 2006), and an increased risk of
      childhood obesity and adult metabolic syndrome (Galtier et al, 2008). The societal and
      economic impact of obesity during pregnancy is therefore life-long.

      Excessive weight gain during pregnancy has little positive effect on foetal growth and
      pregnancy duration (Scholl et al, 1995) and is associated with a similar range of adverse
      outcomes as described above (Guelinckx et al., 2008). It is also associated with a greater
      probability of post-partum weight retention. Linn√© et al (2004) showed that both normal
      weight and overweight/obese women who gained excessive weight were more likely to have
      retained more weight 1 and 15 years after pregnancy, compared to women who gained the
      recommended amount of weight during pregnancy.

      Whilst the US Institute of Medicine recommends lower pregnancy weight gain ranges for
      overweight and obese women (IOM, 2009), there are currently no UK evidence based guidelines
      outlining an appropriate BMI-specific weight gain (NICE, 2009). The current UK guide for
      weight gain is 10 - 12.5kg for all women (DoH, 2009). There is concern expressed that women
      are not being informed of the risks associated with obesity during pregnancy, or of the
      importance of a safe weight gain during pregnancy (NICE, 2009).

      A study on the views of health professionals highlighted the issue that dietary information
      is often ad-hoc, and that advice is not linked with weight management (Heslehurst et al,
      2007). Wiles (1998) found that above average weight women felt they didn't receive relevant
      weight management information. NICE (2010) recommended that there was need for research to
      find effective and cost effective approaches to help women manage their weight before, during
      and after pregnancy, including those from disadvantaged, low income and minority ethnic
      groups. In order to develop better strategies for promoting healthy weight changes in this
      population, it is important to understand the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, experience
      and expectations of pregnant women during and after pregnancy in relation to their body
      weight and the behavioural factors which influence body weight. However, there is a paucity
      of research in this field. A recent systematic review (Campbell, et al, 2008) identified just
      8 studies, (in the UK since 1990, with the most recent being conducted in 2004), into the
      views and attitudes to diet, physical activity and weight gain in pregnancy.

      Childbearing may affect attitudes towards body image and this psychological dimension of
      weight is also important in understanding postpartum weight retention. Relatively few studies
      have investigated the effects of risk factors on weight retention in postpartum women.
      Gaining this intelligence from representative population groups is necessary for the
      selection and development of effective strategies to aid the development and commissioning of
      services and pathways to help address maternal obesity and post partum weight management.

      Aim The primary risk factor for retaining weight in the postnatal period is excessive
      gestational weight gain (Linne et al., 2002). However, a number of other factors have been
      associated with an increased risk of weight retention, including high pre-pregnancy body mass
      index (BMI), primiparity, short duration of breastfeeding, stopping smoking, high dietary
      energy intake and low physical activity (Gunderson et al., 2000; Gore et al., 2003; Siega-Riz
      et al., 2004). Childbearing may also affect attitudes towards body image and this
      psychological dimension is important in understanding postnatal weight management.
      Understanding the effects of these risk factors on antenatal weight management is challenging
      and relatively few studies have attempted investigation of these relationships. Much of the
      data is inconclusive or focused on the effect of weight loss on other endpoints, such as
      lactation or infant growth (Dewey et al., 1994; Lovelady et al., 2000). Thus, the principal
      research objective of this project is to conduct a feasibility study to explore women's
      expectations and experiences of antenatal weight management and retention, and to use this to
      identify predictors of excessive weight gain during pregnancy and weight retention up to one
      year postpartum. Women will be recruited from antenatal clinics at Queens Medical Centre
      (Nottingham University Hospitals, NG7 2UH) at either 12 or 20 weeks of pregnancy. Parameters
      of interest will be investigated at recruitment whilst attending the antenatal clinic (12 or
      20 weeks of pregnancy), at follow up during pregnancy by postal questionnaire (20 and 32
      weeks of pregnancy), and at follow up during the postnatal period (2 weeks, 6 and 12 months
      after birth). The questionnaires will assess women's expectations for weight change during
      and after pregnancy, their experiences of antenatal care and knowledge of recommendations,
      and their diet and levels of physical activity. The participants will be women of all ages,
      sociodemographic backgrounds and bodyweights.

      PURPOSE Purpose: The study has a clear purpose to explore women's expectations and
      experiences of antenatal weight management and retention, and to identify predictors of
      excessive weight gain during pregnancy and weight retention up to one year postpartum. It is
      imperative that these research questions are addressed in order to provide the knowledge
      required to develop appropriate intervention strategies. This study has been designed to
      address these research questions in a direct and focused manner, by using a combination of
      tools to collect the relevant information (questionnaire to explore women's expectations and
      experiences, food frequency and physical activity questionnaires). The ultimate aim is that
      the data collected will be used to develop intervention strategies to help women reach and/or
      maintain a healthy weight during the pregnancy and postnatal periods, thus reducing the risk
      of postpartum obesity.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The principal research objective is to conduct an exploratory,
      observational, mixed-methods study to assess women's expectations for weight change during
      and after pregnancy, their experiences of antenatal care and knowledge of recommendations,
      and their diet and levels of physical activity, and to use this information to identify
      predictors of weight change during pregnancy and the postnatal period that could usefully be
      targeted as part of an intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To determine what expectations women have with regards to weight change during pregnancy
           and the postpartum period.

        2. To explore the sources of information which shape the expectations of women in relation
           to pregnancy-related weight change.

        3. To determine whether the following factors are associated with weight change in
           pregnancy:

             1. Pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index.

             2. Diet and dietary habits during pregnancy.

             3. Physical activity during pregnancy.

             4. Pregnancy related symptoms.

        4. To explore whether the following physiological factors predict weight change in
           post-partum women:

             1. Pre-pregnancy weight, pregnancy weight change and postpartum weight

             2. Diet and dietary habits during pregnancy and postpartum

             3. Physical activity during pregnancy and postpartum

             4. Breastfeeding, mixed or formula feeding, time of weaning

        5. To identify whether the following psychological factors result in weight retention in
           post-partum women:

             1. Weight expectations

             2. Body weight and shape concerns

             3. Weight loss self-efficacy

             4. Body satisfaction

             5. Weight loss outcome expectancies

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be pregnant women at 12 or 20 weeks pregnancy attending the 12 and
             20 week antenatal scanning clinics at the Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham

          -  Participants will be able to give informed consent- Participants will be over the age
             of 18

          -  Participants will be able to read English - due to the nature of the study we will not
             be able to print the questionnaires in various languages.

          -  Participants will be of any sociodemographic backgrounds, bodyweights and parity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who do not feel that their literacy or English language skills will
             enable them to complete the questionnaires will be offered the opportunity to have one
             of the research team read the questions and fill in the answers for them. Whilst doing
             this and being sensitive to literacy and language issues, the nature of this
             feasibility study means that the research team will not offer an interpreting service
             or produce documents in languages other than English.

          -  Participants will be excluded from the postnatal phase of the study if they deliver
             their baby prematurely (before 37 weeks of gestation) or do not give birth to a live
             baby. These exclusions are required, as premature birth or fetal loss/still birth
             would be expected to have an impact on psychological and physiological aspects linked
             to weight management which are not relevant to our specific research objectives.
             Information on birth outcome will be gained by accessing hospital records, and only
             women who have given birth to a live baby after 37 weeks of gestation will be
             contacted by the study team in the postnatal period.
