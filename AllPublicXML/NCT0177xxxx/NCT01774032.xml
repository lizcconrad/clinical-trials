             systemic or inhaled corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or
             cytotoxic drugs.

             to study entry.

          -  Participant has donated blood or plasma within 30 days prior to study entry.

             inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks prior to vaccination in this study.

          -  Participant has a functional or surgical asplenia.

          -  Participant has a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Participant has been exposed to an investigational product (IP) within 30 days prior
             to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP
             or investigational device during the course of this study.

          -  Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator.

          -  Participant has any other condition that disqualifies his/her participation in the
