    <textblock>
      The study enrolls patients with non-resectable or borderline resectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC), intraheaptic choalngiocarcinoma (IHCC) or colorectal cancer metastasis.
      Patients are not a candidates for liver transplantation and have only limited extrahepatic
      disease. All patients are treated with radioembolization. Primary endpoint is the percentage
      of patients that can be downstaged to resectability.

      Secondary endpoints are radiologic response to radioembolization,tissue response to
      radiomembolization and systemic immune response and intra-tumoral T-cell response to
      radioembolization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria: - Patients already considered for radioembolization fulfil criteria to
        be included in the study. If radioembolization is not considered by the tumor board,
        inclusion in the study should not be considered.

        - Non-resectable or borderline resectable liver tumors (HCC, CRCM or CCC) as as-sessed by a
        multidisciplinary tumor-board. Non-resectability or borderline resectablily is based
        closeness to essential nonresectable structures (f.e. the portal vein bifurca- tion or
        hepatic vein trifurcation) or insufficient liver volume after resection, general
        performance status of the patient.

        Chemotherapy (mostly applicable to CRCM) should be termininated at least 4 weeks prior to
        enrolling patients in the study.

          -  Concomitant manoevers to manipulate liver volume like portal vein embolization or
             ligation and two-stage resections are allowed

          -  Male or female patients 18-99 years of age

          -  Presentation of the case at the Multidisciplinary Meeting attended by hepatobiliary
             surgeons, oncologists, hepatologists and radiologists

          -  Written informed consent given by the patient

          -  Adequate liver function or kidney function tests, including any of the following. It
             is possible to perform endoscopic or percutaneous stent placement to achieve
             normal-isation of laboratory parameters.

          -  Women who are not breastfeeding and are using effective contraception if sexually
             active, who are not pregnant and agree not to become pregnant during the 12 months
             thereaf-ter. A negative pregnancy test before inclusion into the trial is required for
             women &lt; 50 years. Men who agree not to father a child during participation in the
             trial or during the 12 months thereafter.

          -  Effective contraception

        Patient compliance and geographic proximity

        Exclusion criteria: -Patients with no clinical indications for radioembolization
        (resectable tumors, no need for downsizing)

          -  contraindications on ethical grounds,

          -  women who are pregnant or breast feeding,

          -  significant concomitant disease states (e.g., renal failure, hepatic dysfunction,
             cardi-ovascular disease, etc) as based on above mentioned labaratory values or
             preopera-tive cardiac assessment making the patient unsuitable for major surgery known
             or suspected non-compliance, drug or alcohol abuse, enrolment into a clinical trial
             within last 4 weeks, extrahepatic tumor burden, as evaluated by PET/CT or chest CT.
             Potentially resectable small lung nodules or hilar lymphadenopathy by CT or PET in
             case of MCRC mandate systemic chemotherapy prior to enrolment into this trial if not
             already performed. The patient may be en-rolled into this trial to be downstaged by
             radioembolization after finishing systemic chemotherapy.

          -  Anatomic variant in arteriogram which prevents selective delivery of the chemother-apy
             to the liver (discussed within group of principal investigators)

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 3 months

          -  Candidacy for liver transplantation in the case of HCC
