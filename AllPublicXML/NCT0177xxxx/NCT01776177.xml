  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the clinical effectiveness of long-term omalizumab therapy
      in 240 patients treated over an 8 year period in a real-life clinical setting and to compare
      the pre- and post-treatment clinical characteristics to identify and better understand the
      markers of response to omalizumab.

      To date, there are no established criteria for identifying 'response' to omalizumab therapy.
      Currently, the commonly accepted clinical criterion for omalizumab treatment response is the
      physician's overall assessment, GETE (Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness). Most
      clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of omalizumab treatment after a 16 week treatment
      period and lack the impact of long-term omalizumab therapy.

      Investigators propose multiple approach modules to better assess and identify 'response' and
      to define 'responders' to omalizumab and evaluate the long-term impact in a real-world
      clinical practice. Besides evaluating individual outcome variables, it is important to
      attempt the 'clustering of variables' to further investigate if any baseline clinical
      phenotypes are predictive of better response enabling us to refine the patient population who
      will gain most benefit from therapy.

      Medical records from 240 omalizumab-treated patients will be evaluated. Comprehensive data
      will be collected for any asthma-related event (see evaluation criteria below), omalizumab
      dose, asthma-medications, spirometry, asthma control test (ACT) and any respiratory infection
      and/or antibiotic use since last visit. Data will be analyzed to compare the clinical
      phenotypes and outcome among patients to identify, characterize and define 'responders' and
      'non-responders' to omalizumab. Periodic assessments for demonstrated level of response and
      need for continued therapy will be evaluated quarterly. Also, real-life patient adherence
      data to long-term omalizumab therapy will be analyzed and the factors for withdrawal and
      non-adherence will be identified.

      Reduction in annualized rate of asthma exacerbation, steroid bursts and oral steroid dosage,
      ER/unscheduled doctor's visits, hospitalization and improvement in spirometry and ACT score
      and review of asthma medications will be evaluated quarterly. 'Cluster analysis' will be
      performed by grouping variables (such as age, asthma duration and severity, dosage, therapy
      duration, sensitization profile, IgE levels etc.) in effort to identify groups of responders.
