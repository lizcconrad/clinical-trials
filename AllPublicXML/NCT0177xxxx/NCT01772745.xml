  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic techniques have allowed surgeons to perform complicated intrabdominal surgery
      with minimal trauma. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been recognized since 1987 as the gold
      standard procedure for gallbladder surgery. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was
      developed with the aim of reducing the invasiveness of conventional laparoscopy. In this
      study we aimed to compare results of SILS cholecystectomy and three port conventional
      laparoscopic (TPCL) cholecystectomy prospectively

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-incision laparoscopic procedures have evolved gradually to include a multitude of
      various surgeries. The current literature documents the use of a single-incision or
      single-port access surgery for cholecystectomies, adrenalectomies, splenectomies,
      appendectomies, herniorrhaphies, bariatrics, and colon surgery.

      Total of 100 patients who undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disorders
      will randomly assign to undergo SILS cholecystectomy group (n = 50) or TPCL cholecystectomy
      group (n= 50) according to a computer-generated table of random numbers. Demographics (ie,
      age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score,
      indication for operation, need for conversion to a standard or three port laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy, need for conversion to an open cholecystectomy will be recorded. Outcome
      measures include operative morbidity, operative time, pain score, hospital stay. Morbidity
      will be evaluated by rates of bile leak, wound infection, hospital readmission, and hernia.
