  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study involves very frequent monitoring of breast cancer patient blood levels of
      hs-cTnT Troponin and n-t-BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide) before and after initiation of
      chemotherapy with either adriamycin or trastuzumab in order to define the kinetics of both
      biomarkers during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. Cardiac troponins and BNP are
      frequently elevated after experimental chemotherapy in animal models. Their behavior in
      humans has been inconsistent, with occasional elevations seen, usually within 30 days of
      therapy. Assays for troponin with sensitivity into the pg/ml range have now been introduced.
      A majority of patients greater than age 50 have elevations above the detection limit,
      compared to only 1-3% with conventional troponin assays, and over 90% of diabetics have
      elevations above the detection limit. Moreover, augmented release of high sensitivity
      troponin is detected after exercise or rapid atrial pacing of durations of 10-15 minutes in
      patients with and without coronary artery disease. This improved sensitivity suggests the
      potential for detection and monitoring of cardiac damage after cancer chemotherapy. We
      hypothesized that this new generation of troponin assay would be associated with kinetic
      behavior suggesting ongoing cardiac damage with anthracycline therapy, and possibly also with
      trastuzumab.

      Collect blood samples in two groups of patients (n=10 per group) for amino-terminal brain
      natriuretic peptide (n-t-BNP) and high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT):

        -  Group 1 (adriamycin) will consist of patients beginning clinically indicated
           chemotherapy for breast cancer with a dose-dense (every 2 week) regimen. including
           adriamycin (n=10).

        -  Group 2 will include patients who receive trastuzumab in the adjuvant or (neo) adjuvant
           setting, or in a metastatic setting in a regimen that does not include simultaneous
           adriamycin.

      Blood samples for hs-cTNT and n-t-BNP will be obtained on days pre-treatment, and
      post-treatment days 1, 2, 3, 7, pre-cycle 2, and post-cycle 2 days 1,2,3 and 7. The interval
      for treatment is usually two weeks for adriamycin and three weeks for trastuzumab. We will
      identify frequency of detectible levels above the detection limit and above the baseline,
      peak values and area under the curve. Enrollment of up to 15 per group will be allowed to
      guarantee acquisition of 10 full sets of samples. Lab draw from chemotherapy ports will be
      allowed. We plan to store specimens for future analyses with more sensitive assays in
      development.
