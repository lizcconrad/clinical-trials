  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this crossover trial is to compare the 3-month, mean 24-hour
      intraocular pressure (IOP) control and safety obtained with two popular fixed combinations in
      glaucoma patients insufficiently controlled with latanoprost monotherapy. This study will
      compare the 24-hour efficacy of travoprost/timolol fixed combination without benzalkonium
      chloride given once in the evening, versus the latanoprost/timolol fixed combination given in
      the evening. It is assumed that travoprost/timolol fixed combination will provide better
      quality of 24-hour pressure control.
