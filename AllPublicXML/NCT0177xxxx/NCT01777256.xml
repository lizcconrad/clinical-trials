  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive, dose ranging, Phase II study to investigate the relationship between
      repeat doses of GSK2586184 and the pharmacodynamic effect and clinical efficacy in patients
      with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study will also investigate the safety
      and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK2586184. During the study, up to 3 Interim Analyses
      will be conducted. These are to monitor the pharmacodynamic effect and safety following 2
      weeks of therapy (Interim Analysis 1); and the clinical efficacy and safety of GSK2586184
      following 12 weeks of therapy (Interim Analyses 2 and 3). Subjects who meet the entry
      criteria (approximately 150 to 250) will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive
      GSK2586184 at doses of 50 milligram (mg) twice daily (b.i.d), 100 mg b.i.d, 200 mg b.i.d, 400
      mg b.i.d or Placebo b.i.d. GSK2586184 tablets available in 50 and 200 mg dose strength will
      be administered orally up to 12 weeks.

      Subjects who complete the study will participate in the study for approximately 21 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage Inhibition from Baseline of interferon (IFN) Transcriptional Biomarkers at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(Day1) and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Mean reduction (40%) from Baseline of the IFN transcriptional signature biomarker was monitored at Week 2. Percentage (Per) inhibition (=[(Day x-Baseline)/Baseline]*-100), was the Per reduction from Baseline (Day1) and evaluated in any pre-designated panels of genes i.e. Addenbrookes 1, Addenbrookes 2, JAK439, PD, Panel Stripping, Flare and Transcription. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, baseline, Day, Day by baseline and Day by treatment interactions. Only those Par available at the specified time points were analysed (n=X,X,X,X,X). Different Par may have been analysed at different time points, so the overall number of Par analysed reflects everyone in the Intent To Treat (ITT) Population i.e. Par randomised to treatment, received &gt;=1 dose of study medication and had &gt;=1 valid post dose assessment</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline(Day1), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) is a validated index for assessing SLE disease activity. It is a weighted index in which signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, and physician's assessment for each of 9 organ systems are given a weighted score and summed, if present at the time of the visit or in the preceding 10 days. Modified version of SLEDAI is Safety of Estrogen in Lupus National Assessment (SELENA) SLEDAI where the maximum theoretical score for the SELENA SLEDAI was 105 with 0 indicating inactive disease. Baseline value is defined as Day 1 (pre-dose) SELENA SLEDAI score.</description>

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical events that jeopardize the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition.</description>

Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living.

    <time_frame>Baseline(Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship between dose of GSK2586184 and clinical response was assessed by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and SLEDAI-2K Responder Index 50 (S2K RI-50) scores. SLEDAI-2K is a revised version of the SLEDAI in which the persistent active disease in the items rash, alopecia, mucosal ulcers and proteinuria would be scored as opposed to new occurrences as are measured in the SLEDAI. S2K RI-50 detects a minimum 50% improvement in disease manifestations among lupus participants. It covers 9 organ systems, utilising the same 24 descriptors and reflects disease activity over the previous 30 days. Change from Baseline was calculated as the individual post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Baseline value is defined as the last Pre-treatment value observed.

PK Population comprised of all participants randomised to treatment, who have taken at least one dose. Only participants for whom plasma PK samples were obtained were assessed (represented by n=X,X,X,X in category titles). Different participants may have been analysed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analysed reflects everyone in the Pharmacokinetic(PK) Population.</description>

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36v2 ) is a participant-reported survey of participant health and measures general health-related quality of life. There are 36 items grouped into nine health domains: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, Mental Health, Reported health transition (RHT). SF-36v2 gives a score for each of these domains based on the questions as assessed by participants. The lower the score the more disability and the higher the score the less disability.

    <description>The BFI was developed to quickly measure severity of fatigue in participants as well as its impact on their ability to function over the previous 24 hrs. It consists of nine items that look at fatigue in the past that are rated on a 0 -10 numeric rating scale where 0 is no fatigue or does not interfere and 10 is bad fatigue or completely interferes with activity.

    <description>The BPI is a questionnaire used to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functioning in the following areas: general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, including outside the home and housework, relations with other people, enjoyment of life and sleep. Two sub scores are derived from questionnaire: the worst pain score and the interference score. To derive a valid worst pain score, a minimum of 3 (out of 6) non missing values were required versus 4 (out of 7) for the interference score. Change from Baseline was calculated as the individual post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Baseline value is defined as the last Pre-treatment value observed.</description>
