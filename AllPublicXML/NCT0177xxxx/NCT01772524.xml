          -  Regular use (greater than 7 days) of prophylactic headache medication (any preventive
             medication or supplement with evidence of efficacy from at least 1 placebo-controlled
             trial) within 3 months, or onabotulinumtoxin A within 6 months prior to screening or
             during the 28 day period prior to randomization

          -  Cardiac surgery or cardiac symptoms within 3 months of screening and during the 28 day
