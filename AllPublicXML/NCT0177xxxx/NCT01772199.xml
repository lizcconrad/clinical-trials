  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to assess whether
      GSK239512 can enhance lesion remyelination in subjects with Relapsing Remitting Multiple
      Sclerosis (RRMS). Subjects with RRMS on stable background treatment with either Avonex
      (Interferon-beta1a) or Copaxone (Glatiramer Acetate) are eligible to participate. Subjects
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between placebo and GSK239512, and will continue to be
      managed with their current standard of care therapy (Copaxone or Avonex). The total treatment
      period is 48 weeks, including a standard 4 week titration period and 44 week maintenance
      treatment period (which could be adapted to a 5-week titration and 43 week maintenance
      period, if needed). Titration doses start at 10 micrograms (mcg) and increase up to 80 mcg
      (10 mcg first week, 20 mcg second week, 40 mcg third week, 80 mcg fourth week). Subjects will
      be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose with the objective of titrating to the highest dose
      (80 mcg GSK239512), whenever possible, based on investigator judgement of tolerability. The
      post-treatment follow-up period will be a minimum of 2 weeks in duration following the end of
      treatment at Week 48 or early withdrawal, as appropriate.

             wandering, confusion, disorientation, agitation, or vivid dreams) that has a negative

             risk of tolerability issues during dose escalation, g) Presence or history of
             hallucinations that, in the judgement of the investigator, may increase the safety
