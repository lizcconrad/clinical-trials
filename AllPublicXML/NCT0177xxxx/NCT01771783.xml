    <textblock>
      The primary objective is the characterization of the RAS peptide profiles after single and
      repeated oral administration of a renin inhibitor, an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin
      receptor blocker in healthy volunteers.

      Secondary objectives are the correlation of RAS peptide profiles with pharmacokinetic
      profiles of the different RAS inhibitors and with pharmacodynamic parameters such as blood
      pressure and heart rate. Output of the classic RAS system will be assessed using aldosterone
      concentrations. Fluid and sodium intake will be monitored using sodium concentration and
      total volume in 24h urine.

    <textblock>
      The results of a pilot study have shown that single doses of different RAS inhibitors produce
      characteristic changes of the RAS peptide profiles. In a first step this finding needs to be
      verified in a larger number of healthy subjects. Since it is unknown, whether the changes
      that were observed within hours after a single inhibitor dose are stable over time, the
      profiles also need to be investigated under steady-state conditions of the different
      inhibitors. Comparison of RAS peptide profiles after single dose and under steady-state
      conditions will also allow to detect whether the peptide profiles are altered by compensatory
      mechanisms.
