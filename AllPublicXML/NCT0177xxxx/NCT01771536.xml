  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite several large clinical trials clearly establishing that coronary revascularization
      (i.e. percutaneous coronary intervention - PCI) does not prolong survival or prevent
      myocardial infarction (MI) for stable coronary artery disease (CAD), patients with stable
      angina continue to believe that PCI is performed to improve these outcomes. Additionally,
      recent concerns have emerged of overuse of PCI among patients with little or no angina. Thus
      there is a compelling need to share with patients the risks and benefits of PCI prior to
      treatment to reach an informed decision.

      This study is designed to answer the question of whether a decision aid can improve patient
      knowledge, decisional conflict and patient satisfaction with decision-making compared to
      usual care for the treatment of stable angina.
