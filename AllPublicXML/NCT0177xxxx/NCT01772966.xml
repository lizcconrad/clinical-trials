  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects with chronic neck pain will be randomly allocated to one of two
      intervention groups: real vs control spinal manipulation. They will receive three
      intervention sessions.

      H1: Chronic neck pain patients treated longitudinally over a series of three encounters in
      one week by random assignment to treatment group with either of the dual delivery procedures
      (Intervention 1=typical-control or Intervention 2=control-control) will have a 50% error rate
      of self-report of group allocation at exit interview.

      H2: Patients treated by the typical-control dual procedure over a typical sequence of
      encounters (3 times in one week) will show statistically significant improvement in clinical
      outcomes; defined quantitatively by visual analogue pain scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index
      (NDI), range of motion and pressure algometry; compared to those treated by the
      control-control dual procedure.

      H3: Patients stratified by 'a priori' patient expectation for treatment outcome will show no
      significant difference in self-report of group allocation or clinical outcome measures.

      A total of 372 subjects will be recruited.
