  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery from coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a complex process involving
      physical recuperation and psychological adjustment. The high prevalence of postoperative
      depression in this population may threaten optimal recovery. Peer support over the recovery
      period has promise to mitigate this threat. The purpose of this study was to examine the
      effect of a professionally-guided telephone peer support intervention on recovery outcomes
      including depression, social support and health care resource utilization.

      In a randomized controlled trial, 185 male CABG surgery patients randomly assigned to an
      intervention (n=61) or usual care (n=124) group. Participants in the intervention group
      received weekly telephone calls from a peer volunteer over 6 weeks post discharge. At
      hospital discharge and at 6 and 12 weeks follow up, depression was measured using the Beck
      Depression Scale-II, social support was measured using the Shortened Social Support Scale and
      health care resource utilization was measured using items in the Postoperative Self Report of
      Recovery Questionnaire. Participants in the intervention group were also asked questions
      about their perceptions regarding peer support using the Peer Support Evaluation Inventory.
