    <textblock>
      Current gold standard of bladder outlet diagnosis is pressure flow study. This study is
      invasive time consuming and requires expensive and complex set-up. In this study the
      investigators plan to evaluate an alternative technology that presumably is able to diagnose
      bladder outlet obstruction using a Dynamic Urine Vibration &quot;Holter&quot; based on a Urine Flow
      Vibration Analysis technology. The acoustic vibration sensor is a small device that records
      the vibration due to urine flow. The patient attaches the sensor to the penis using a
      disposable sensor patch for the duration of approximately one minute during one urination.
      The analysis is performed off-line and the results are compared to the results of a standard
      pressure flow study and to the standard free flowmetry test. The innovative technology for
      the diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction is noninvasive, rapid and does not involve
      complex setup.
