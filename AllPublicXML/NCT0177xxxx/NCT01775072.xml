  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether certain genes in cancer may be abnormal.
      When a gene is abnormal this is called a mutation. Most mutations in cancer cells are not
      inherited (passed down from parents) but happen after birth in the cancer itself. Most
      cancers have many mutations. Some of these mutations are important for the cancer cells to
      survive while others are not. The goal of this study is test cancer for certain mutations
      using leftover tumor tissue from a previous surgery or biopsy. Participants will also be
      asked to provide a tube of blood cheek (also known as a buccal) swab, or a saliva sample that
      contains normal genes for comparison.

      The purpose of Part B of this study is to:

      Understand how genetic changes in tumor effect the chance of responding to experimental
      cancer treatment. Understand how the genes in the tumor change overtime in response to
      targeted cancer treatment.

    <description>Patients must have solid or hematologic cancer. for treatment on a . Patients must have undergone pathologic confirmation of their tumor at MSKCC and have either: 1) archival tissue available for analysis, 2) have fresh tissue collection planned as routine standard of care biopsy or part of a research biopsy under another clinical trial(or peripheral blood / bone marrow collection in the case of hematologic cancers) outside of the context of this protocol, or 3)archival tissue .available at an outside facility. For prospective genotyping tissue specimens from the primary site, a metastasis or recurrence will be used based upon the availability and quality of tissue.</description>

    <intervention_name>molecular profiling of tumors</intervention_name>
    <description>Part A is the molecular profiling of tumors. No new tumor biopsies will be performed in the context of Part A. If a pt does have a surgery or tumor biopsy , leftover tissue (or an additional core) from this procedure may be used for molecular profiling. Clinical Assay(s): This testing will be performed in the CLIA-certified Molecular Diagnostics Service laboratory. Research Assay(s): This protocol will also be used as a platform to pilot the use of investigational &quot;next-generation&quot; profiling technologies .including whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing RNA sequencing cell-free tumor DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics, &amp; others. To confirm the findings obtained on these assays using an orthogonal assay, additional sequencing such as Sanger,Sequenom, MiSeq or IMPACT testing may be utilized in either the CLIA or non-CLIA setting Part B: DTC Cohort Pts successfully registered to Part B of this study will be eligible for minimal risk collection &amp; research biopsies.</description>
