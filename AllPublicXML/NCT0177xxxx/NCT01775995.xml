  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common, costly and disabling conditions. It
      is often refractory to treatment, with patients requiring long-term opioid therapy.
      Mindfulness meditation is a promising treatment for chronic pain, mental health and addictive
      disorders. When combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a standard of care for
      CLBP, it may produce additive benefits. The goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is
      to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an innovative behavioral intervention to improve
      the health of adults with opioid-treated CLBP. This RCT will test the hypotheses that, at 26
      weeks, meditation-CBT group participants (meditation-CBT + usual care), compared to those in
      a wait-list control group (usual care alone), will improve health-related quality of life
      (primary outcomes: pain severity and physical function) and reduce opioid medication use
      (secondary outcome). In addition, they will also decrease alcohol and drug use/misuse, and
      improve stress-sensitive measures and economic outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common, costly and disabling conditions.
      Treatment for refractory CLBP includes long-term opioid therapy even though it is often only
      marginally effective. Prescription opioid abuse is a national epidemic. Development of safe,
      effective non-addictive therapies for chronic pain is a national priority. Mindfulness
      meditation is a promising, safe treatment for chronic pain, mental health and addictive
      disorders. When combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a standard of care for
      CLBP, it may produce additive benefits. No study has evaluated the potential of a combined
      meditation-CBT intervention to improve outcomes in patients with opioid-treated CLBP.

      This unblinded 26-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test methods feasibility
      and efficacy of meditation-CBT for improving health-related quality of life (primary
      outcomes: pain severity and physical function) and reduce opioid medication use (secondary
      outcome) among adults with opioid-treated CLBP. Eligible participants are adults at least 21
      years old, with daily CLBP treated with daily opioids (at least 30 morphine-equivalent
      mg/day) for at least 3 months. They will be recruited from outpatient clinic and community
      settings, and randomly assigned to one of two study arms: meditation-CBT + usual care or
      usual care alone. The targeted meditation-CBT intervention will consist of a) therapist-led
      group training (two-hours/week for 8 weeks), and b) at-home meditation practice (at least 30
      minutes/day, 6 days/week). Control participants will be offered the intervention after their
      study completion.

      Outcome measures, collected at 0, 8 (directly post-intervention) and 26 (18 weeks
      post-intervention) weeks will gather data on efficacy and potential mechanisms of action of
      meditation-CBT intervention. This RCT will test the hypotheses that, at 26 weeks,
      meditation-CBT group participants (meditation-CBT + usual care), compared to those in a
      wait-list control group (usual care alone), will improve health-related quality of life
      (primary outcomes: pain severity and physical function) and reduce opioid medication use
      (secondary outcome). In addition, they will also decrease alcohol and drug use/misuse, and
      improve stress-sensitive measures and economic outcomes. Increased pain acceptance,
      mindfulness level or stress reduction are hypothesized to be the mechanistic pathways.

      This study directly addresses national priorities aimed at the development of an effective,
      safe treatment for CLBP and reduction of opioid use. Potential benefits accruing from
      positive findings include improved quality of life and reduced opioid pain medication use
      among patients with refractory, opioid-treated CLBP.

    <description>Averaged pain is the average of 4 responses on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (0=no pain; 10=worst possible pain) from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): 1) describe your pain at its worst in the last week 2) describe your pain at its least in the last week 3) describe your pain on the average 4) describe your pain right now.

In addition to session attendance, experimental participants are asked to practice meditation at home at least 6 days/week, 30 minutes/day during the 26-week study.
Control participants will be offered the intervention after completing the study.
All participants receive usual care for opioid-treated CLBP through their regular clinicians, per their recommendations.</description>

          <title>Opioid Dose</title>
          <description>Daily opioid dose was assessed using the Timeline Followback Method which looked at the past 28 days of opioid use. Medication use reports were verified against the medication bottles. Daily opioid dose was standardized [daily morphine-equivalent dose (MED)] across different opioids for each participant.
This outcome measure for 26 week follow up is expressed as a difference score (change from baseline to 26 week measure), with positive values indicating increased daily opioid dose and negative values indicating decreased daily opioid dose.</description>
          <population>One Meditation-CBT and one Wait-list Control participant did not provide data for this measure at 26-week follow up. Results on this measure are based on the number of participants analyzed.</population>

This outcome measure for 26 week follow up is expressed as a difference score (change from baseline to 26 week measure), with positive values indicating increased chronic pain acceptance and negative values indicating decreased chronic pain acceptance.</description>

This outcome measure for 26 week follow up is expressed as a difference score (change from baseline to 26 week measure), with positive values indicating increased levels of distress from depression symptoms and negative values indicating decreased levels of distress from depression symptoms.</description>

        <description>Cost of medications, health care utilization, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), and lost productivity were assessed.
Medications (past month - self-report, verified against medication bottles): opioids (Timeline Followback), other medications (average daily use); costs for the past 6 months were calculated. Health care utilization (past 6 months): self-reported number of outpatient (medical, mental health, urgent care) and emergency department visits; number of inpatient days. Lost productivity (past 6 months): self-report number of missed work and leisure days. MVAs (past 6 months): self-report number of MVAs.

        <description>Pain sensitivity to thermal stimuli was assessed using standard psychophysical procedures. Thermal stimuli, ranging from 43 to 49oC, were applied to the thenar eminence of the right hand. Each stimulus was rated on two separate, validated 0-20 category-ratio scales assessing pain intensity and unpleasantness.</description>
