      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major worldwide health issue. Figures from the Centers for
      Disease control show that 1.7 million people suffer a TBI annually. Meanwhile the World
      Health Organization recognizes TBI as one of the most significant health issues in developing
      countries. In the military, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most frequent
      sequela of modern war. Dizziness and balance disorders are the most frequent sequela of mTBI
      and account for a significant degree of mTBI morbidity. At the current time, the best
      treatment modality for dizziness secondary to mTBI is vestibular rehabilitation (VR). While
      VR is effective, the therapy is time consuming, not universally successful, and results in
      incomplete recovery by many patients. Work needs to be done in an attempt to improve therapy
      outcomes. This project will study the use of neuromodulation (through stimulation of the
      tongue) as an adjuvant to improve the effectiveness of VR and reduce the time involved in VR.
      Given past work with variants on this minimal medical impact appliance, using the PoNS™
      device to augment therapy may result in a significant improvement in VR outcomes. Given the
      enormous public health and military burden of mTBI, and given that dizziness is a major
      component often responsible for significant morbidity, this project has significant military
      and civilian impact and can be beneficial to those who suffer mTBI worldwide.

      The CN-NINM intervention is an experimental regimen. It has been developed over the last 12
      years at Tactile Communication and Neurorehabilitation Laboratory (TCNL) at the University of
      Wisconsin - Madison. All human subjects testing was performed under IRB approval. The PoNS™
      is an experimental device that has been evolved over this same period at TCNL, and is not FDA
      approved. An Investigator's Brochure and attendant Safety Chart have been developed to
      satisfy requirements for an Investigational Device Exemption, and provide additional context
      with respect to the research proposed here.

      The goal of this work is to test the effectiveness of this device with standard
      rehabilitation therapy on individuals who have operationally induced balance disorders from
      blunt or blast head trauma.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

        1. To compare the effectiveness of active PoNS-2 (PoNS™) device combined with standard
           vestibular rehabilitation to a placebo PoNS™ device with vestibular rehabilitation in
           patients with blast and blunt head trauma induced dizziness over the time period of a
           standard course of therapy.

        2. To compare the effectiveness of active PoNS™ device combined with standard vestibular
           rehabilitation to a placebo PoNS™ device with vestibular rehabilitation in patients with
           blast and blunt head trauma induced dizziness three months after a standard course of
           rehabilitation.

    <description>Posturography for Sensory Organization Test: Utilizing a computerized dynamic posturography (Neurocom Inc., Clackmas, OR) the sensory organization test (SOT) is conducted by measuring postural sway on a force plate under six different conditions as follows 1) Normal Stance eyes open, 2) Normal Stance with eyes closed, 3) Normal Stance with sway referenced visual surround, 4) Sway reference stance eyes open, 5) Sway reference stance with eyes closed, and 6) Sway reference stance with sway referenced vision. The SOT will conduct three trials in each condition and utilize the information to produce a computer generated objective score of balance/posture function. The exam takes less than ten minutes to produce.</description>

    <description>VOR Tests: A Neuro Kinetics IPortal Video-oculography system (Neurokinetics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) with a six degree of freedom accelerometer will be used to (1) document head thrust test findings qualitatively and (2) provide objective measurements of test results. The software will be configured for (1) detection of head thrusts of appropriate direction and orientation (re: earth vertical) and (2) real-time determination of performance parameters (VOR).</description>

    <description>The Functional Gait Assessment Test (FGAT) is a 10 item gait task test in which each task is graded on a 0-3 scale with 0 indicating could not perform and 3 indicating performed without error. Grading is done by an experienced rater. The FGAT produces an ordinal score on a 0-30 point scale and is normed from previous civilian and military studies.</description>

    <description>The PoNS™ device uses electrotactile waveform in conjunction with the Cranial Nerve - Non-Invasive NeuroModulation (CN-NINM) intervention. This involves using both balance and gait training methods to stabilize symptoms, regain balance &amp; gait, and affect the functional transfer of improved stability and mobility to activities of daily living. It is based on a body of work focused on developing the tongue-based human-machine interface and application of this technology for balance, vision, and auditory substitution and more recently as neuromodulation for brain rehabilitation after injury and disease.</description>
