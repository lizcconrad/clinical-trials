      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an anthrax vaccine.
      The vaccine schedule and dose will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and immunogenicity of AV7909 for post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax will be
      evaluated using a randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, double-blind design with
      three immunization schedules and two dose levels in healthy adult volunteers. Safety will be
      assessed by clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis),
      monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, and physical examinations. Reactogenicity
      (systemic and injection site reactions) will be assessed by the subjects using subject
      e-diaries for 7 days after each immunization and by the investigator at in-clinic visits 7
      and 14 days after each immunization, and at other visits, if applicable. Immunogenicity will
      be measured as toxin neutralizing antibody (TNA) response and seroconversion rates.

Reactions were graded using the following scale (note, for redness and swelling, the diameter [greater of two perpendicular measurements] was assessed by the subject using an injection site measurement tool):
Grade 0 (Absent): Symptom not present; Grade 1 (Mild): Symptom present but does not interfere with activities of daily living, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures &lt;3 cm; Grade 2 (Moderate): Symptom causes some interference with activities of daily living, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures 3 - 10 cm; Grade 3 (Severe): Symptom prevents activities of daily living or requires treatment, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures &gt; 10 cm.
For each reaction, subjects are counted once across all vaccinations at the highest reported level of severity.</description>

Clinical laboratory abnormalities are presented as the total of Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), and Grade 4 (potentially life-threatening) abnormalities according to criteria adapted from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research: Guidance for Industry.

        <description>Incidence of solicited systemic reactions and solicited injection site reactions each day for 7 days following each vaccination using subject e-diaries by severity.
Reactions were graded using the following scale (note, for redness and swelling, the diameter [greater of two perpendicular measurements] was assessed by the subject using an injection site measurement tool):
Grade 0 (Absent): Symptom not present; Grade 1 (Mild): Symptom present but does not interfere with activities of daily living, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures &lt;3 cm; Grade 2 (Moderate): Symptom causes some interference with activities of daily living, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures 3 – 10 cm; Grade 3 (Severe): Symptom prevents activities of daily living or requires treatment, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures &gt; 10 cm.
For each reaction, subjects are counted once across all vaccinations at the highest reported level of severity.</description>

          <title>Incidence of Reactogenicity By Severity</title>
          <description>Incidence of solicited systemic reactions and solicited injection site reactions each day for 7 days following each vaccination using subject e-diaries by severity.
Reactions were graded using the following scale (note, for redness and swelling, the diameter [greater of two perpendicular measurements] was assessed by the subject using an injection site measurement tool):
Grade 0 (Absent): Symptom not present; Grade 1 (Mild): Symptom present but does not interfere with activities of daily living, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures &lt;3 cm; Grade 2 (Moderate): Symptom causes some interference with activities of daily living, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures 3 – 10 cm; Grade 3 (Severe): Symptom prevents activities of daily living or requires treatment, or affected area (redness, swelling) measures &gt; 10 cm.
For each reaction, subjects are counted once across all vaccinations at the highest reported level of severity.</description>

Clinical laboratory abnormalities are presented as the total of Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), and Grade 4 (potentially life-threatening) abnormalities according to criteria adapted from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research: Guidance for Industry. Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (September 2007). Within each laboratory parameter, subjects are counted once for their most severe occurrence of clinical laboratory abnormality.</description>
