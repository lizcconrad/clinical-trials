    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common yet under diagnosed condition in hospitalized patients, and the
      incidence have not previously been described in Danish cardiac surgery patients. The present
      study seeks to describe the incidence and duration of delirium in this group of patients,
      before and after the introduction of standardized screening tool and a guideline for
      treatment of delirium after cardiac surgery.

    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common yet under diagnosed condition in cardiac surgery patients, and may cause
      prolonged cognitive impairment and increased risk of complications. Patients are at risk of
      e.g. pulling catheters and lines and may fall attempting to get out of bed. The aging patient
      population present with many risk factors for developing delirium, but diagnostic tools have
      been few. Almost 50% present with hypoactive delirium, which is often not diagnosed, nor
      treated correctly. To optimize effect, treatment should be initiated early, maintained until
      clinical improvement is observed, and then tapered gradually. Recently, Delirium Observation
      Screening scale (DOS scale) was developed and validated in elective cardiac surgery patients
      in the Netherlands, with interesting results. This encouraged us to evaluate the effects of
      systematic delirium screening and treatment in cardiac surgery patients. To our knowledge, no
      prior studies have evaluated use of DOS scale in this context.

      OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence and severity of delirium, and the effects of
      standardized treatment in a population of Danish cardiac surgery patients.
