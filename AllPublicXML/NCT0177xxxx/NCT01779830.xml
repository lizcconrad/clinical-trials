      The aim of this study is to learn how different doses of LY2624803 affect sleep in healthy
      people. The study has four treatment periods. Participants will receive a single dose of
      LY2624803, another sleeping pill, or placebo in each treatment period. The study will last
      approximately 1 month for each participant.
