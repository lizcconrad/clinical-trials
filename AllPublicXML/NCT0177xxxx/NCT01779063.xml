  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is a chronic condition that causes physical and emotional challenges to breast
      cancer survivors. As a progressive condition, lymphedema can result in swelling/fibrosis that
      can impair function, promote infection, and cause discomfort and emotional distress. Daily
      self-care that is required to manage lymphedema is time-consuming, burdensome, and lifelong.
      Previous studies found that about half of breast cancer survivors with lymphedema do not
      complete self-care as directed. Feelings of being helpless to manage the condition, a desire
      to be normal, lack of noticeable results from self-care, and poor social/healthcare
      professional support are barriers to performing self-care on a regular basis. There is a need
      to develop and test interventions to promote effective self-care. Experts suggest the best
      self-care interventions should include patient perspectives and be available a readily
      accessible format. Technological advancements support use of innovative, creative approaches,
      such as Web-based multimedia interventions. Web-based interventions can be used in rural and
      urban settings. The investigators are proposing to develop a Web-based, multimedia
      intervention and a &quot;take home&quot; manual to support self-care in breast cancer survivors with
      lymphedema. The investigators plan to conduct focus groups with these survivors to determine
      the content and delivery format(s) and to help us identify breast cancer survivors with
      lymphedema for the video component. The investigators will then develop an intervention that
      will include self-care demonstrations and other supportive information to help patients to
      cope with the challenges of self-care. The focus groups will reconvene, review the
      intervention, and give us feedback on modifying and refining the intervention. After
      finalizing the intervention, The investigators will recruit more breast cancer survivors with
      lymphedema and provide one half of them an education booklet and the other half the Web-based
      intervention (or an alternative format such as DVD). Then, over 12 months, the investigators
      will periodically assess and compare both groups on self-care behaviors, physical and
      emotional concerns, and other issues such as money spent on lymphedema treatment. The group
      that receives the education booklet will be given access to the Web-based intervention after
      the 12 month follow-up is done, but the investigators will not ask them to complete any more
      forms.

      This project builds upon the investigators prior work that has provided information about
      lymphedema self-care problems and the investigators previous experience in developing patient
      education videos and manuals. By providing accessible, detailed self-care instructions and a
      psychosocial component, this intervention has the potential to improve lymphedema self-care.
      If successful, this intervention can be offered to the larger national and international
      community of breast cancer survivors with lymphedema.
