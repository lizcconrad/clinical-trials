  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if water and three different sugary beverages
      (milk, Orange juice and iced tea) have the same effect on thirst.

      Participants should be in the laboratory at 8.00 in order to collect the values of weight,
      height, total body water, intracellular water and extracellular water in a Segmental Multi
      Frequency Body Composition Monitor (TANITA MC 180 MA®). Then, a blood sample will be
      collected for analysis of blood glucose, osmolality and plasmatic sodium. They will sit at
      individual tables for the duration of the session and were allowed to read, listen to music
      with earphones, or use their portable computers with the exception of internet access to
      minimize visual cues (e.g., unwanted publicity for beverages or visiting Web sites showing
      pictures of food and drinks), which may have effect on thirst. Breakfast will be served at
      9.30 on every occasion and preload stimuli will be offered exactly 60 minutes after breakfast
      (at 10.30). Lunch will be provided at 13.00. Motivational ratings will be first obtained at
      the end of collection of blood sample (baseline or time 0) and every 30 minutes thereafter
      until the lunch time (times 1 through 7). After lunch (time 8), participants will complete
      the last set of ratings and will bring a food diary to record all food and fluid intake until
      00.00 that day.

    <description>Participants will rate their hunger, thirst, nausea, mouth dryness, desire to eat, desire to drink using nine point category scales. The unipolar adjective scales were anchored at each end with labels: 1 = not at all and 9 = extremely.
Participants also rated their liking for the beverage along nine point hedonic preference scales where 1 = dislike extremely and 9 = like extremely.</description>
