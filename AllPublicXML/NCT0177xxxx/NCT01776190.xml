  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting an open-label clinical trial determining the effects of UVA1
      phototherapy on cutaneous lupus (CLE) patients. Past research on systemic lupus (SLE)
      subjects indicates that this treatment is likely to be effective in treating cutaneous lupus
      with few side effects. The fact that most CLE patients are seen at dermatology clinics also
      increases the usefulness of this study because there is a large probability that phototherapy
      treatment will be accessible for many of the patients that stand to benefit from it.

      Study subjects will receive low dose (20 J/cm2) UVA1 phototherapy treatment three times per
      week for 10 weeks. Each treatment will take less than 30 minutes. This period will be
      followed by an eight-week observation phase to assess longer term effects of the treatment.
      Patients will be assessed for disease activity, and blood studies and photos will be
      completed prior to, during, and after phototherapy treatment. Optional skin biopsies of
      affected and unaffected skin will be performed at the beginning and end of the active
      treatment phase.
