    <textblock>
      The treatment of the multisystem autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
      remains a challenge, particularly when there is renal involvement (lupus nephritis). For the
      last 60 years corticosteroids have been the backbone of the treatment of lupus nephritis but
      they are associated with significant toxicity.

      Although randomized placebo controlled trials of Rituximab in non-renal lupus and lupus
      nephritis did not meet their primary end-points, there is accumulating data that suggests
      that B cell depletion with Rituximab may be efficacious in lupus disease refractory to
      conventional therapy. Furthermore, our pilot data suggests that the addition of Rituximab to
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) without oral steroids is at least as effective at inducing a
      renal response as the standard of care therapy comprising MMF and high dose oral
      corticosteroids.

      RITUXILUP is a proof of concept, open labeled, randomized, controlled, multicentre trial that
      aims to demonstrate whether the addition of Rituximab to MMF therapy is useful in treating a
      new flare of lupus nephritis and whether it has a long lasting steroid-sparing, beneficial
      effect with equal efficacy and greater safety than a conventional regimen of MMF and oral
      prednisolone. If successful, this trial has the potential to dramatically change the
      management of lupus nephritis.

      TRIAL SUMMARY

      TITLE RITUXILUP - An open label randomised multicentre controlled trial of RITUXImab and
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) without oral steroids for the treatment of LUPus nephritis

      OBJECTIVES

        1. Is the combination of Rituximab, Methyl prednisolone and MMF as effective in treating
           lupus nephritis as Methyl prednisolone, oral steroids and MMF?

        2. Does the omission of oral steroids increase the safety of the treatment regimen?

      DESIGN This is a 1:1 randomised, international open label, controlled phase III multicentre
      trial

      SAMPLE SIZE A total of 252 patients: 126 patients in each arm (As of April 2017 decided 25
      patients will be maximum recruited following decision to close the study early)

      ELIGIBILITY Children (12 years and above) and adults with lupus nephritis ISN/RPS Class III A
      or A/C, Class IV-G A or A/C, Class IV-S A or A/C, and/or Class V with a urine
      protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) â‰¥ 100mg/mmol.

      TREATMENT

        1. Experimental group - Rituximab, IV methyl prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil

        2. Control group - oral prednisolone, IV methyl prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil.

      PRIMARY OUTCOME The primary outcome is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Rituximab arm in
      comparison to the control arm in the proportion of patients achieving complete renal response
      (CR) at week 52 without the need for steroid prescription.

             -  no worsening in physician's global assessment (PGA) by &gt;10%;

             -  must not have received non-protocol treatment.

        -  Proportion of patients achieving a response as defined by the BILAG-based Composite
           Lupus Assessment (BICLA) at week 52 and annually thereafter as defined by: BILAG-2004
