    <textblock>
      Background : The use of suction drains in thyroid surgery is common practice in order to
      avoid haematoma or seroma, as well as to identify promptly the onset of haemorrhaging that
      might compromise the patient's airway. The aim of this study to determine the effects of
      routine drainage compared to no drainage in thyroidectomy patients.

      Study Design : Total of 400 patients who undergoing total thyroidectomy or lobectomy for
      thyroidal disorders will be randomly allocated to be drained or not. Postoperative
      ultrasonographic (USG) neck examination will be performed for all patients on postoperative
      24th hour by the same ultrasonologist each time. Postoperative pain, complications and
      hospital stay will be recorded. The statistical analysis will be performed and p&lt;0,05 will be
      accepted as an important statistical value (SPSS 16.0 for Windows).

      Patients will include in the study will randomly allocate to drain and non-drain group on the
      basis of computer generated random number table. Patients with substernal goitre or non
      differentiated cancer will exclude from the study.

      According to the thyroidal disorder, total thyroidectomy or lobectomy plus isthmectomy will
      be performed. The operating time will be defined as the time from the first incision to the
      last suture's placement. 4/0 polypropylene sutures will be used subcutaneously for wound
      closure. In the drain group a closed suction drain with negative pressure (Hemovac®) was
      brought out through a separate wound.

    <description>Standard thyroidectomy is proven method for safety. We will perform standard thyroidectomy in this study. In this period, patients will be monitored for bleeding and seroma. Major bleeding rare complication for thyroid surgery but requires re-operation immediately. Many studies suggested that drains may block with clotted blood and do not alert the surgeon, even if major bleeding occurs(1,2,3). We don't use drain routinely in standard thyroidectomy in our clinic for seven years. Bleeding and reoperation rates are similar between the literature and our clinic. The amount of fluid collection in thyroid bed will be assessed by Ultrasonography in postoperative 24th hours. Volume of fluid collection in the operative bed will be calculated by measuring the maximum diameter in three dimensions.Similar results between groups are evidence that the use of drain is not necessary.</description>

    <description>Postoperative pain will be assessed according to a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) on the postoperative sixth hour (POSH-VAS) and postoperative first day (POFD-VAS).The mean VAS scores will be compared drain and non-drain group.</description>

    <description>We will demonstrate there was no significant differences in postoperative complications between subgroups.Similar complications rates will be demonstrate absence of drains for thyroid surgery is safe and efficient.</description>
