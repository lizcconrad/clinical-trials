      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the investigational device,
      RPM,non-absorbable polypropylene mesh made by D Med, in correction of Nasolabial fold.

      Study hypothesis

        -  level of significance: alpha=0.05( two-side)

        -  power of test: (power= 1-beta),power=0.08

        -  H0: P equals P0

        -  H1: P unequals P0

        -  The difference between the changes in the WSRS(Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale) of the pre
           and post rhytidectomy from baseline at 7week after administration is 0.237( P-P0= 0.237)

      1. Benefits

        -  enhancing self-satisfaction and quality of life by improving skin elasticity and
           correcting folds in the nasolabial fold area 2. Risks

        -  erythema, swelling, pain and redness in the facial area generally resolve in 1 week
           3.Duration of study

        -  entire duration: approximate 36weeks

        -  Follow-up period: 7 weeks

        -  Enrollment period: 12 weeks 4. study design

        -  2 step operation process

             -  First step- insert polypropylene mesh under the skin

             -  Second step- pull the polypropylene mesh 3 weeks later
