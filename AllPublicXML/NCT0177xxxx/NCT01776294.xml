      Student Investigator = Thakkallapalli Zeeshan Muzahid. The study aims to assess the
      prevalence of prehypertension among medical students of Andhra Medical College,
      Visakhapatnam, India and its association with other cardiovascular risk factors - overweight
      /obesity, diabetes, lipid profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      275 medical students will be studied and a history taken and examination done with special
      emphasis on recording of Blood Pressure, measurement of height and weight (&amp; Body Mass Index)
      and Waist Circumference in all. Glucose Tolerance Test and Fasting Lipid profile will be
      measured in a random selection of 30 prehypertensives and 30 normotensives.
