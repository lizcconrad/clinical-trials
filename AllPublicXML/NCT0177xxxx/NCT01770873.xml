  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a violence prevention curriculum delivered by
      Big Brothers and Big Sisters staff and mentors can reduce violence involvement for
      assault-injured youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Violent injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among adolescents. The presence of
      a positive adult role model is a well-established protective factor against violence and
      other maladaptive outcomes among youth. Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) is the largest U.S.
      mentoring organization with proven effectiveness in improving youth outcomes. However, these
      programs may be less effective with youth who already are exhibiting involvement in problem
      behavior at the time of program referral. Take Charge!, a mentor- and
      professional-implemented intervention with 10-15 year old assault-injured youth, showed
      promise for improving perceived self efficacy for avoiding violence and for decreasing
      aggression and problem behavior.

      The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a
      research-informed youth development program that adapts the BBBS model to work for
      assault-injured youth. The aims are:

        -  To expand and refine Take Charge! and integrate it with BBBS practices;

        -  To conduct a randomized, controlled trial in which assault-injured 10-15 year old youth
           recruited from emergency departments in Baltimore and D.C. receive either standard
           emergency department follow-up care or the Take Charge! 2 intervention with assessment
           of violence-related, mental health, and educational outcomes;

        -  To conduct a comprehensive process evaluation of Take Charge! 2;

        -  And to accurately measure the costs of the intervention and assess cost-effectiveness.

      Youth violence is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with marked disparities by
      race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. This study is a critical next step in translating
      evidence-based research to real-world settings and practice.
