    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two different formulations of LY2886721. In
      addition, this study will determine how much of study drug (LY2886721) gets into the blood
      steam and how long the body takes to get rid of it after taking each formulation with or
      without a meal. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.
      Each participant may be involved in the study for approximately 7 weeks.

      This study requires 4 periods. In each period, participants will receive LY2886721 as a
      tablet or capsule, with or without food and water. There is a 7 day washout between each
      period.
