  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship among the body fat distribution,
      especially the visceral fat, in patients with age-related macular degeneration in comparison
      to patients with a normal fundus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to examine the relationship among visceral fat, serum
      leptin levels, and high-sensitive CRP (hsCRP), Tnf-alpha, Amyloid alpha and Amyloid Beta
      serum levels in patients with age-related macular degeneration in comparison to patients with
      a normal fundus.
