  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults.
      Despite maximal treatment tumor relapse occurs regularly accompanied by unfavourable
      prognosis. Among other reasons, it is believed that this could be in part due to the
      existence of the so-called tumor stem cells (TSCs), a cellular subfraction within GBM which
      escape therapy by being highly resistant to irradiation and chemotherapy and thus
      constituting the source of tumor recurrence.

      GBM, like many other cancers, show a sub-population of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
      overexpressing TSCs. More specifically, ALDH1A1, a cytoplasmatic isoform of ALDH, proved to
      be a novel stem cell marker in human GBM. In addition, ALDH1A1 has been shown to be a
      mediator for resistance of GBM to temozolomide (TMZ) and a reliable predictor of clinical
      outcome; prognosis of patients with a high level of ALDH1A1 expression was poor compared with
      that of patients with low levels. Consequently, ALDH1A1 may serve as a potential target to
      improve treatment of human GBM through inhibition of the enzyme.

      Disulfiram (DSF) has been used for more than sixty years in the treatment of chronic
      alcoholism because of the unpleasant symptoms it provokes after ethanol intake. The
      underlying mechanism is believed to be the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood, due to
      inhibition of the liver ALDHs. Actually, DSF is a strong inhibitor of ALDH1A1 and relatively
      non-toxic at therapeutic (for chronic alcoholism) doses that can penetrate the blood-brain
      barrier. In addition, DSF has been shown to be cytotoxic on GBM stem-like cells, inhibiting
      the growth of TMZ resistant GBM cells and blocking self-renewal by ~100% , while it has been
      identified as an inhibitor of human GBM stem cells in high-throughput chemical screens.
      Interestingly, a number of these actions were copper-dependent.

      In the current Phase II clinical trial, DSF/copper combination will be tested as an
      adjunctive and concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM. According to
      our hypothesis, initiation of DSF chemotherapy after the resection of the tumor and before
      the introduction of the standard radio-chemotherapy will inhibit ALDH1A1 of GBM TSCs making
      them more susceptible to radio-chemotherapy and possibly reducing the recurrence rate of GBM.
      On the other hand, the addition of copper will probably enhance the cytotoxic effects of DSF
      possibly through augmentation of its pro-apoptotic and proteasomal inhibitory actions.

    <description>Disulfiram/copper combination will be started on the 5th postoperative day and before the initiation of the standard radiochemotherapy (fractionated irradiation with a total dose of 60 Gy with concomitant 75 mg/m2 body surface temozolomide each day, including weekends, during irradiation). After completion of the radiation therapy patients will receive maintenance temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 body surface on Days 1-5 every 28 days for 6 months. Daily administration of disulfiram and copper will take place for the whole study period.
NOTE: Patients may receive additional maintenance temozolomide at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.</description>
