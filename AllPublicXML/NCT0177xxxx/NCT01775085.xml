  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of groups for breast cancer survivors: a
      Meaning-Centered Group and a Discussion Group. Many breast cancer survivors seek help to deal
      with the emotional burden of having gone through the cancer experience. Participation in
      groups offering support often helps cancer survivors cope with stressors of life after having
      had cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. The &quot;Meaning-Centered Group&quot; is
      intended to teach breast cancer survivors how to maintain or even increase a sense of meaning
      and purpose in their lives after treatment for cancer. The &quot;Discussion Group&quot; is intended to
      help breast cancer survivors cope by giving them a place to get support from other breast
      cancer survivors.

      The goal of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of group approaches for
      breast cancer survivors. The study is also testing the benefits and feasibility of conducting
      the groups virtually using a telephone and computer.

    <description>DG is a standardized, manualized group developed by the MSKCC Psychiatry Service and utilized in a similar form in our completed and ongoing RCTs of MCGP. Based on models described by Rogers and Bloch, the essential components include reassurance, explanation, education, encouragement, and permission for expression. The process emphasizes Rogerian concepts (e.g., empathic understanding) and avoids techniques that are not exclusively supportive. The content focuses on education about here-and-now topics relevant to BCS (e.g., maintaining and eliciting social support, financial strains, return to work, physical symptom management), allowing emotional expression and discussion of difficult topics.</description>

             study checklist signed by a physician for patients outside of MSKCC

          -  Post completion of treatment (may be on hormone therapy, such as Tamoxifen or
             monoclonal antibody, such as Herceptin or Pertuzumab)) for any type of cancer as
             confirmed by the medical record at MSKCC, by self-report, or by outside
             correspondence, including a study checklist signed by a physician for patients outside
             of MSKCC

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Access to a telephone, computer (e.g. desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet) and

          -  A score of â‰¥ to 4 on the Distress Thermometer (DT) and indication that this distress

          -  If taking medication for mood, anxiety, depression, thoughts, sensory experiences such
             as hallucinations, or sleep, stable and consistent enough in dosage and use of that
             medication so as to not result in a clinically significant change as determined by the
             study PI/co-PI or, confirmed by reports in the medical record at MSKCC, by selfreport,
             or by outside correspondence, including a study checklist signed by a physician for
             patients outside of MSKCC

          -  Did not participate in Phase 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of or treatment metastatic disease

          -  Significant psychiatric or cognitive disturbance sufficient, in the investigator's
