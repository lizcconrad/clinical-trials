    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare postoperative pain control after minimally invasive
      coronary artery bypass grafting for patients who receive an intercostal block (an anesthetic
      medicine injected in an area under the ribs) in the operating room and IV acetaminophen
      (Tylenol) to those who receive an intercostal block and On-Q pain pump catheter (a balloon
      pump attached to 2 small tubes near your procedure site that automatically delivers pain
      medicine).

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores will be assessed using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (an 11-point scale, 0 through 10, with 0 representing 'No pain' and 10 representing 'Worst imaginable pain'). Pain scores will be entered by nursing staff every 2 hours in ICU, and every 6 hours on the floor for the duration of the hospital stay, an expected average of 4 days.</description>

    <description>Any side effects and need for additional narcotic medication will be collected throughout the duration of the hospital stay, an expected average of 4 days.</description>
