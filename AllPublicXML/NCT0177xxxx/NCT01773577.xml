      Goal: To evaluate the effects of Interoperable Health IT on provider work flow and work
      practices in the ambulatory care setting.

      Interoperable health IT can produce a reduction of barriers in the exchange of health
      information that can allow for more efficient, timely, and a higher quality of patient care.
      This study seeks to evaluate the effects of the implementation of interoperable health IT on
      the work flow of medical providers in the care environments in which they are implemented.

    <textblock>
      Interoperable health IT allows for the reduction of barriers in the exchange of health
      information. Substantial work flow efficiencies and cost reductions may be realized by
      reducing these barriers, and integrating information exchange among different providers and
      healthcare systems. Some of the avenues in which these efficiencies and cost reductions are
      likely to be achieved are through easier access to test results, reduction in medication
      errors, quality monitoring and improvement methodologies, and increased consumer choice. In
      recognition of the potential for these improvements, New York State has provided funding to
      regional entities (Regional Health Information Organizationsâ€”RHIO'S) whose role is to assist
      practice providers in the development, implementation, and integration of these interoperable
      IT systems. New York State has also provided funding to evaluate the technology
      implementations facilitated by the RHIOs. The investigators will be working with health care
      providers that have been assisted by the Greater Rochester RHIO.

      Depending on the unique characteristics of the hardware and software that is developed and
      implemented, there may be variations in operational flow that effect efficiency in the
      ambulatory care setting. The goal of our study is to measure and evaluate the effects of
      interoperable IT systems in the work flow practices of providers that have implemented them
      in the ambulatory care setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Our population will include all of the providers and office workers within the
             ambulatory care settings that have implemented the interoperable IT programs, and are
             required to utilize the systems for their daily job functions. Our research population
             will not include patients, as the participants of our study are the health care
             workers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Our population will be &quot;all inclusive&quot; of all office staff and providers that are
             required to utilize the systems in place in order to perform their day-to-day
             functions. There will be no exclusions except for those under 18 years of age, and non
             English speakers (neither of which are expected to be in the eligible population).
