  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers are a significant problem in institutionalized, elderly, and critically ill
      patients. Pressure ulcers result in significant pain, changing quality of life, and often
      leading to significant morbidity and prolonged hospital stays, and ultimately increased the
      healthcare cost.

      According to the International Pressure Ulcer Prevalence Survey, the prevalence of hospital
      acquired pressure ulcers in the United States was 13.5% in 2008 and 12.8% in 2009. This
      survey also indicated that the highest rate of pressure ulcers is in the long term acute care
      population (22%).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers developed a non-contact optical imaging technology call Spatial Frequency Domain
      Imaging which can identify the tissue regions that are at risk of developing pressure ulcers
      prior to development of irreversible tissue damage. The Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging can
      identify metabolic and biochemical differences in the tissues near bony prominences which are
      at risk for developing pressure ulcers.
