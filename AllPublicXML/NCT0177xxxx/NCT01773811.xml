      The current study proposes to directly measure how processing after participating in written
      disclosure about a traumatic life event affects physical and psychological outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has established the potential for narrative writing about traumatic events
      to result in positive benefits for physical and psychological health. Research has also
      provided evidence that written disclosure may reduce post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      symptoms. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain why written disclosure
      produces positive benefits, but all have focused on processes occurring during the writing
      session. It has been suggested, however, that additional processing may occur after the
      writing exercises are over, yet no research has studied the influence of this processing on
      outcomes. The current study proposes to directly measure how processing after participating
      in written disclosure affects physical and psychological outcomes.
