      Spinal Cord Injured [SCI] patients typically cannot &quot;pee&quot;. Injury to the spinal cord disrupts
      the in-coming and out-going brain signals that coordinate bladder sensation and the emptying
      of bladder. SCI typically causes chronic retention of urine with uncontrolled leakage of
      urine. Some form of tube (catheter) is needed to drain the urine except with the mildest
      forms of SCI. Two types of tubes to drain the urine have been used for many years. These
      types are the urethral (inserted into the bladder through the opening usually used to empty
      the bladder) and abdominal, called suprapubic cystostomy tubes (put into the bladder through
      the abdomen).

      Bacteria (germs) normally live on our skin. Bacteria have sticky surfaces and so they stick
      to catheter surfaces. Bacteria reproduce very rapidly from a few dozen to over a million in
      24 hours. In a warm liquid environment, like urine, bacteria can reach a density of 10
      million per cubic centimeter in 48 hours which causes infection. Oral drugs and
      antibiotic-coated catheters delay this process by a week or two, but within a month 100% of
      patients have bacteria in their urine. Existing drugs cannot eliminate these microbial
      sanctuaries.

      The TBC is a 'closed access' abdominal drainage tube that has a 'cuff' or 'anchor'. It is
      permanently placed in the abdominal muscle to bond with the body's tissue. Another catheter
      is temporarily connected to the TBC that is easily replaceable in the clinic without
      anesthesia or special instruments. It locks to form a water-tight system. Many parts of the
      TBC are coated with an antibacterial substance that will delay the growth of bacteria. The
      TBC has been used with success in multiple animal studies.

      This is a Phase I human clinical trial in which the TBC will be used 10 spinal cord injured
      patients, each of whom will be followed for 12 months or longer. Abdominal catheter exit
      sites will be photographed monthly and tested periodically to document growth of any
      bacteria. Every three months, patients will complete satisfaction questionnaires and their
      urine will be tested for bacteria. Urine will also be tested as clinically indicated.

      Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in permanent paraplegia or quadriplegia in
      approximately 10,000 Americans annually. All patients with SCI have neuropathic dysfunction
      of the urinary bladder. Progressive neurological syndromes such as multiple sclerosis,
      Parkinson's disease, Stroke, hemiplegia and dementia also induce progressive neuropathic
      bladder dysfunction. Neurologic impairment of the bladder causes or contributes to chronic
      urinary retention or urinary incontinence or both. Several million Americans suffer chronic
      neuropathic urinary retention or incontinence or both. Males tend to develop urinary
      retention and females tend to develop urinary incontinence but both genders commonly develop
      elements of both.

      Current management includes [a] indwelling tubes (urethral catheterization or [b] suprapubic
      (abdominal) catheterization, [c] intermittent urethral catheterization [4+times per day], and
      surgical rehabilitation [e.g. use of autogenous intestinal conduits or reservoirs]. No single
      form of management is ideal. A high percentage of elder and disabled patients are poor
      candidates or non-candidates for surgical rehabilitation because of co-morbidities or limited
      life expectancy. A majority of neurologically impaired patients are managed with chronic tube
      drainage of their bladders [e.g. a-c, above].

      Traditional tube drainage of the bladder may be either via the urethra or via an intubated
      fistula in the lower abdomen. Intermittent catheterizationâ€”by the patient or a care
      giver--via the urethra is a well accepted and sometimes used method. This technique is
      occasionally used [by an attendant] in cognitively impaired patients or quadriplegics with
      impairment of the upper extremities. Intermittent catheterization is expensive when provided
      by a professional care giver and is a social and domestic burden when provided by a family
      member. In most chronically impaired [cognitively or physically] patients chronic indwelling
      urethral or suprapubic tubes evolve as the most practical and widely used treatment option.

      Chronic urinary infection and bladder stones are recurrent problems in patients who use
      indwelling tubes. Foley urethral catheters [which are also commonly used as suprapubic tubes]
      are licensed for 30 day use by FDA.

      Indwelling urethral catheters and suprapubic tubes are &quot;open eco-systems' and provide easy
      access to skin flora. Skin microbes migrate along the tubes and gain access to bladder urine
      which becomes colonized in 100% of cases. Both gram-stain positive [gram +] and gram-stain
      negative [gram-] organisms easily gain access to bladder urine. Both type of microbes form
      biofilms on the catheters within 48 hours of colonization. The biofilms are microbial
      sanctuaries that are highly resistant to eradication with antibiotics. Use of antimicrobial
      agents [often for non-urinary indications] may eradicate common urinary pathogens and thereby
      'select' more resistant organisms. Multiple organisms and resistant organisms are commonly
      grown from the bladders of neurologically impaired patients who utilize indwelling urethral
      or suprapubic tubes. Both types of tubes tend to induce bladder spasms and urinary leakage
      thereby soiling under-garments and bed clothes. A majority of such patients smell of
      urine-chronically.

      Urine is normally supersaturated with dissolved salts, notably physiologic concentrations of
      calcium, phosphorus, oxalic acid, and magnesium. Foreign bodies [e.g. the indwelling tube']
      initiate nucleation of the salts which then precipitate and form stones on the catheters. A
      high percentage of neurologically impaired patients have Proteus species of chronic
      bacteriuria. These urea-splitting [urease producing] organisms greatly accelerate formation
      of struvite [magnesium-ammonium-phosphate] stones on the catheters; rapid stone formation may
      necessitate catheter exchanges more frequently than monthly.

      Significant expense attends the chronic use of traditional urinary catheters. Monthly travel
      to clinics and monthly replacement of the drainage catheter and management of febrile
      reactions which may be precipitated by tube changes are routine and expensive. Surgical
      procedures are commonly required to remove bladder, kidney or ureteral stones that develop as
      a consequence of the chronic bacteriuria. Soiled garments and beds and the prevailing order
      of urine cause many disabled patients to be put in to assisted care facilities.

    <description>The anchor is capped and surgically implanted in the extra-peritoneal space of the suprapubic region of pubic hair of the lower abdomen using sutures sandwich and secure the anchor between the rectus abdominis muscle and the detrusor [bladder] muscle. Skin is closed over the implant and the bladder is drained with a Foley urethral catheter. The Phase I implant is left in place for 3+ months to allow fibroblasts and collagen from the adjacent muscles to grow into the porous PTFE and effect robust, water--tight bonding of anchor to both rectus and bladder muscles.
After a local anesthesia is injected, the remaining components of the TBC are connected forming a water-tight union of the anchor to the urinary bladder.</description>

             be accepted for participation. If the protocol is expanded then a Spanish-language
             consent form will be developed and Spanish-speaking candidates will be accepted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have a reversible spinal cord injury or a reversible neurological illness

          -  have been injured less than two years
