    <textblock>
      Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a common cause of vision loss after cataract surgery. In the
      last few years, several new treatments have been tried to address the problem of CME after
      cataract surgery in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The investigators will perform a
      large RCT with the aim to provide more definite evidence-based recommendations for clinical
      guidelines to prevent the occurrence of CME after cataract surgery in patients with and
      without diabetes mellitus (DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of different preventive strategies on
      the occurrence of CME after cataract surgery in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. The
      design of the study is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial. The study
      population will consist of 926 non-diabetic patients and 209 patients with diabetes mellitus
      (DM) who require cataract surgery in at least one eye. All patients will receive a
      phacoemulsification for cataract and placement of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL).

      In the non-diabetic population, the patients will receive either bromfenac 0.09% eye drops
      twice daily starting two days before surgery and continuing 2 weeks postoperative,
      dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops four times daily starting two days before surgery and continuing
      four times daily during the first postoperative week and one drop less per day every
      following week or a combination of both drugs.

      In the diabetic population patients will receive either:

        -  Topical bromfenac 0.09% and dexamethasone 0.1% in the aforementioned dose;

        -  Topical bromfenac 0.09% and dexamethasone 0.1% in the aforementioned dose and a
           subconjunctival injection of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide;

        -  Topical bromfenac 0.09% and dexamethasone 0.1% in the aforementioned dose and an
           intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab;

        -  Topical bromfenac 0.09% and dexamethasone 0.1% in the aforementioned dose, a
           subconjunctival injection of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide and an intravitreal injection
           of 1.25 mg bevacizumab.

      The primary endpoint is the change in central subfield mean macular thickness in the 1 mm
      area (central subfield macular thickness, CSMT) as compared to baseline within the first 6
      weeks postoperative.

      The secondary endpoint is the occurrence of postoperative clinically significant macular
      edema (CSME) within 12 weeks postoperatively. Other study endpoints are mean CDVA in logMAR
      at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively; OCT measured average retinal thickness in the
      central inner circle (3mm), the outer circle (6mm), and the macular volume at 6 weeks and 12
      weeks postoperatively; intraocular pressure at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively.

      In case of clinically significant macular edema, treatment will be initiated and its effect
      will be part of the evaluation at 12 weeks. Medical data of all patients who develop macular
      edema during this study will be checked at least 6 months after surgery.

          -  accepting possible off-label use of intravitreal bevacizumab and/or subconjunctival
             preservative-free TA.

        Exclusion criteria will be different for non-diabetic and diabetic patients. All ophthalmic
        exclusion criteria are applicable to the study eye only, unless stated otherwise.

        General exclusion criteria for participation in this study are:

         15. use of intra- or periocular corticosteroid injection in the previous 4 months;

         16. current use of topical NSAIDs or corticosteroids;

         17. use of systemic corticosteroids (≥ 20 mg prednisolone or equivalence);

         18. history of relevant adverse events, including serious adverse events (SAE), occurring
             after administration of NSAIDs, acetylsalicylic acid, sodium sulphite, corticosteroids

         19. contraindications for use of topical NSAIDs, topical or subconjunctival
             corticosteroids or intravitreal bevacizumab or related drugs;

        Non-diabetic patients with a history of CME will be excluded from participation in the
        study.

        Additionally, diabetic patients will be excluded from participation in case of:

          1. macular edema with a CSMT ≥450 µm;

          2. very severe NPDR or proliferative DR requiring panretinal photocoagulation or
             vitrectomy;

          3. vitreous haemorrhage present during preoperative visit(s);

          4. cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI) or other thromboembolic
             events in the previous 3 months;

          5. a history of recurrent thromboembolic events;

          6. a history of severe systemic bleeding in the previous 3 months;

          7. major surgery in the previous 3 months;
