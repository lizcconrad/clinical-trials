  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to integrate WHO educational material using mobile phone text messaging, target on
      pregnant women in remote rural areas in China. We hypothsized that text messaging can have
      major impact on reducing maternal and infant deaths in rural China because text messaging is
      accessible, acceptable, and affordable.

      1. Sampling method:

           Random sampling method will be used. Counties in Huaihua area of Chinese province of
           Hunan will be randomly allocated to intervention and non-intervention groups.

        2. The intervention:

           Mobile phone text messages containing maternal and newborn health care education
           material will be sent to mothers-to-be at the first, second and third trimester, and
           again postpartum period.

        3. Statistical analysis:

      We will first compare the baseline characteristics (including the average income, adult
      educational level, and maternal and perinatal mortality rates in the past two years) between
      the 2 arms of experiment. For costs data, total costs, costs per participating woman, and
      costs per maternal/infant death avoided will be reported. For primary outcomes, we will
      determine and report rate ratios, risk differences, and numbers needed to treat (NNT) from
      the experimental arm (i.e., mobile phone text messaging), using the usual care arm (no text
      messaging) as the reference. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be expressed as
      the effect measures. We will estimate the adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence
      intervals by regression analysis. Mixed models taking consideration of multi-level measures
      (e.g., mortality and morbidity measured at individual level and intervention measured at
      village level) will be used in the regression analysis (Donner and Klar, 2000).
