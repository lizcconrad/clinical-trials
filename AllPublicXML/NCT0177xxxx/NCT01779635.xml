  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of heparin-grafted membrane versus conventional
      membrane in critically-ill patients with bleeding-risk undergoing continuous renal
      replacement therapy, will effectively prolong the circuit lifespan, without worsening of the
      systemic APTT or underlying bleeding risk.

      Aims and objectives:

      We aim to compare the performance and safety of heparin-grafted AN69 membrane (oXiris,
      Gambro) with the conventional AN69 membrane (M150, Gambro) without systemic anticoagulation
      during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), in critically ill patients with acute
      kidney injury (AKI) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), who has moderate bleeding risk
      and in whom systemic anticoagulation is contraindicated.
