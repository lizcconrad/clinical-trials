  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine that rehabilitation treatment for a partial meniscectomy is more efficient in
      the functional recovery of the knee. Set in the fewest possible sessions, what treatment has
      benefits that last beyond the physical and what is the best cost-effectiveness.

      It is expected that the combination of isotonic and isokinetic exercises in post-meniscectomy
      physiotherapy allows faster and less costly patient rehabilitate than the current isotonic
      protocol.

      Longitudinal randomized single-blind study, 81 patients (27 per group; 3 groups), 18 to 60
      years, underwent surgery meniscus and performing rehabilitation at the University Hospital
      Sant Joan de Reus. The first rehabilitation sessions will be common (manual therapy,
      electrotherapy, proprioceptive reeducation, isometric exercises, bike exercise and
      cryotherapy). From Session 10, will be randomized into 3 groups: group 1 protocol added
      isotonic exercises, group 2 isokinetic exercises and group 3 isotonic and isokinetic
      exercises.

      The principal variable will be the maximum force peak of the muscle. An evaluation of other
      parameters such as knee function (Lysholm Test) and the degree of pain (VAS) will be
      performed.
