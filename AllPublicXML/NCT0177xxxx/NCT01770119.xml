  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease, which can be life-threatening in immunosuppressed
      children. Currently, measles vaccine is not recommended in pediatric orthotopic liver
      transplant recipients, because it is a live-attenuated vaccine.

      We want to assess the influence of immunosuppression on immunity against measles in
      previously vaccinated children and to evaluate the induction of B cell and T cell response
      against measles elicited by vaccination in children at least 12 months after transplantation.

      Eligible children in Group 2 will receive a standard dose (0.5 ml) of MMR vaccine during the
      first medical visit (V1). The lot number and the expiration date will both be recorded on the
      patient's case report form (CRF). A serological evaluation 4-8 weeks after MMR will identify
      children requiring an additional dose given 1-2 months apart, as currently recommended for
      subjects 1 year-old or with limited immune competence (i.e. HIV-infected children).
      Serological evaluation 4-8 weeks after the second dose or at the one-year follow-up will
      identify eventual non-responder requiring a third dose. Three will be the maximal number of
      administrated dose according to this protocol. The persistence of measles-specific antibodies
      will be assessed yearly, when patients come for their routine visit to the transplant center.

      Children who do not need MMR immunization because of protective levels will be monitored
      yearly for maintenance of antibody levels during routine yearly visits/ blood samplings and
      will not have further intervention.

             assay

          -  ≥ 12 months from the time of transplantation and ≥ 2 months from the time of an acute
             rejection episode

          -  Steroids &lt; 2 mg/kg/day, tacrolimus &lt; 0.3mg/kg/day and tacrolimus level &lt; 8 ng/ml for &gt;
