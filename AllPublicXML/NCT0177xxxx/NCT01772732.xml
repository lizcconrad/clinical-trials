  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of Simotinib
      Hydrochloride in NSCLC patients. The secondary objective is to determine the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile and explore the preliminary anti-tumor activity.

             had disease relapse;

          -  Patients have ended their chemotherapy or radiotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to study
             entry and have recovered from any previous toxicity;

          -  EGFR mutation positive (such as E19del、L858R、L861Q、G719X, etc.);

             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
