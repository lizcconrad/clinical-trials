      The project will investigate the roles of cortical regions, sub-thalamic nucleus and
      pedunculo-pontine nucleus in the preparation of volitional movement termination in patients
      with Parkinson's disease (PD)receiving deep brain stimulation. Currently there are two models
      of inhibitory preparation of volitional movements. The &quot;withdrawal mechanism&quot; posits the
      explanation that movement termination is due to the&quot;shutting off&quot; of the activated
      neuralcircuitry, whereas the &quot;inhibition mechanism&quot; suggests that inhibitory neural
      structures are activated to terminate the voluntary movement. These hypotheses were deduced
      from the study of scalp movement-related cortical potential recordings and how the deep
      structures involved in the execution in movement termination is uncertain. Movement
      preparation prior to movement onset (Mon) has been addressed in both scalp recordings of MRCP
      and from recent studies of STN in PD patients. However,the electro-physiologic information
      concerning the role of STN in the preparation of movement offset (Moff)is less understood. In
      our pilot study, we have found that high-beta event-related de-synchronization (ERD)appeared
      earlier (3 seconds prior to Mon) than those of low-beta and alpha for the Mon phasic
      movement.There was no alpha ERD for the Mon tonic movement. Alpha, low-beta, and high-beta
      ERD all appeared about 1 second prior to the Moff tonic movement. These findings suggest that
      STN participates in the preparation of volitional movement termination but via different
      mechanism from that in movement initiation.Unlike asynchronous ERD frequency bands present in
      movement initiation, a simultaneous ERD across wide frequency bands in STN may play a pivotal
      role in terminating volitional movement. Since there is tight connection between the cortical
      regions and STN, it is intriguing to know the relationship of these oscillatory patterns
      between the deep and superficial neural structures. In the current proposal, we will examine
      the patterns of ERD and ERS prior to Mon and Moff of tonic movements in both cortical and STN
      regions and determine the temporal relationship among them.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation. The inclusion criteria for the patient
        selection will be those with motor complications (wearing off, on-off, drug-induced
        dyskinesia). Levodopa challenge test will be conducted to ensure good beneficial response
        of medication in each patient, since this is a reliable indicator to predict the DBS
        effect.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. impairment of cognition that leads unable to fully cooperate with the oral commands
             during operation,

          2. any moderate to severe medical disorders such as poor control of diabetic mellitus,
             functional III or above congestive heart failure, or cancer with distant metastasis
             etc.,

          3. severe mood disorders such as major depression.
