    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether a Photoacoustic flow cytometry
      (PAFC)-based prototype device can detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of
      melanoma patients in vivo, in real time, and do so at detection limits at least one order of
      magnitude below the detection limits of currently existing ex vivo methods.

      Study Population: Approximately 80 subjects will be consented in order to achieve an
      enrollment goal of 75 subjects at this institution in three cohorts as follows:

        1. Cohort #1 will consist of fifteen healthy control subjects, ten of whom will be
           Caucasian and five of whom will be African-American. Subjects in cohort #1 will be used
           to address the calibration goal of Specific Aim #1.

        2. Cohort #2 will consist of 30 subjects who have advanced-stage melanoma will be recruited
           from the Medical Oncology clinic at UAMS, where advanced stages are defined as Stages
           III or IV. Subjects in cohort #2 will be used to address the validation goal of Specific
           Aim #2. Approximately half of the 30 advanced-stage subjects will be Stage III and the
           other half will be Stage IV.

        3. Cohort #3 will consist of 30 subjects with early-stage melanoma will be recruited from
           the Surgical Oncology clinic at UAMS, where early stages are defined as Stages I or II.

      Subjects in cohort #3 will be used to address the detection goal of Specific Aim #3.
      Approximately 10 of the 30 early-stage subjects will be Stage I and approximately 20 will be
      Stage II.

    <description>To validate the in vivo PAFC method of melanoma CTC detection, we will use the PAFC-based prototype device to noninvasively determine CTC concentrations in the blood of subjects who have advanced-stage (Stage III or Stage IV)melanoma, and we will also use current ex vivo methods to determine the CTC concentration in samples of blood drawn from the same subjects.</description>

    <description>To determine whether in vivo PAFC can detect melanoma CTCs at concentrations below the detection limits of the ex vivo methods, we will use the PAFC-based prototype device to noninvasively detect CTCs in the blood of subjects who have early-stage (Stages I or II) melanoma, and we will also use current ex vivo methods to detect CTCs in samples of blood drawn from the same subjects.</description>
