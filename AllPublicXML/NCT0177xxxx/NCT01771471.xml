  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to collect safety and preliminary efficiency information on the use
      of NuQu chondrocytes (cartilage cells) delivered to the center of a lumbar spinal disc to
      treat low back pain.

      This is a Phase II clinical study to collect additional safety data and preliminary
      efficiency of juvenile chondrocytes, delivered in fibrin carrier (NuQu®) to the nucleus of
      lumbar intervertebral discs for the treatment of discogenic pain. This to be accomplished
      through a double blinded, placebo-controlled study of clinically meaningful endpoints
      including validated, subject reported outcomes of pain and disability, health related quality
      of life and subject satisfaction with treatment.

             Board approved Informed Consent Form;

          -  Is at least 21 years of age;

          -  Have central low back pain aggravated by movement and or postural changes
             (standing/sitting);

          -  Have had back pain for at least 6 months, and have failed conservative management

          -  One Grade III or IV (Pfirrmann Scale) degenerated lumbar disc;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current disc extrusion at any level in their lumbar spine; disc bulges or protrusions
             at any level in the lumbar spine resulting in nerve root compression;

          -  Severe disc narrowing (equal to or more than 50% loss of disc height at the targeted
             level);

          -  Type II or III Modic changes at any level;

          -  Type I Modic changes at any level other than the targeted level;

          -  Type I Modic changes at the treated level if maximum height of the changes is 25% or
             more of the vertebral body height;

          -  Osteoporotic compression fracture at any vertebral level;

          -  Lumbar Scheurmann's disease;

          -  Antero or retrolisthesis ≥ 3mm at any level;

          -  Currently experiencing chronic pain generating from any other source, which (in the
             judgment of the investigator) may interfere with the evaluation of back pain, and or
             disability;

          -  Infection at the planned treatment site, history of systemic or local infection, which
             (in the investigator's judgment) may compromise subject participation and/or safety;

          -  Currently diagnosed with immune-deficiency, which in the investigator's opinion may
             compromise subject participation and/or safety;

             hepatic or renal disease, and cardiopulmonary disorders such as COPD, MI and CHF;
             active malignancy or history of malignancy, or diseases of bone metabolism, which in
             the investigator's opinion may compromise subject participation and/or safety;

             Waddell Signs of nonorganic Behavior or any combination of variables in the
             Investigator's judgment that should exclude a potential subject;
