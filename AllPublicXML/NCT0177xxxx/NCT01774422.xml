  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients affected by severe chronic respiratory failure can develop hypercapnic
      decompensation leading to coma and death in a few hours. At present, the main treatment is
      noninvasive or invasive ventilation. The noninvasive invasive ventilation requires a minimum
      of consciousness to insure spontaneous ventilation. In case of noninvasive ventilation
      impossibility, invasive mechanical ventilation is proposed to patients, which is an
      aggressive therapy. Regularly, the patients undergo this aggressive therapy without having
      expressed their opinion. Indeed, a great majority of these patients with severe respiratory
      insufficiency did not anticipate directives in case of respiratory decompensation
      (acceptation of aggressive treatments). Efficiency of these aggressive therapies is still
      uncertain but certainly alters quality of life (discomfort, loss of autonomyâ€¦). After
      complete, clear, loyal and adapted information, a majority of patient do not wish to go on
      these aggressive therapies. At the time of the decompensation, the patients are incapable to
      express an opinion because of the hypercapnic narcosis. An extracorporeal CO2 remover device,
      such as the DECAP CO2, would quickly decrease the hypercapnia what would allow the patient to
      improve his state of consciousness and so to find the conditions of spontaneous ventilation
      required for the noninvasive ventilation. The DECAP CO2 device can be used to stop quickly
      the hypercapnic narcosis and to collect the wills of the patient on the choice of possible
      aggressive therapies. It is in this last condition that we wish to estimate the DECAP CO2
      device.

      After validation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patients include in this
      clinical trial will be randomized between the two arms of the study:

        -  Noninvasive ventilation alone

        -  Noninvasive ventilation associated with the DECAP CO2 device
