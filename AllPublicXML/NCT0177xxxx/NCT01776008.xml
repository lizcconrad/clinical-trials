    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well Akt inhibitor MK-2206 (MK-2206) and anastrozole with or
      without goserelin acetate works in treating patients with stage II-III breast cancer. MK-2206
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using anastrozole and
      goserelin acetate may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.
      Giving MK-2206, anastrozole, and goserelin acetate together may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant MK-2206 (Akt
      inhibitor MK-2206) in combination with anastrozole (goserelin [goserelin acetate] is added if
      premenopausal) in women with clinical stage II or III phosphatidlinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
      3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutated estrogen receptor (ER)+/human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of neoadjuvant MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole
      (goserelin is added if premenopausal) in women with clinical stage II or III PIK3CA mutated
      ER+/HER2- breast cancer.

      II. To estimate the rate of clinical response and radiologic response using the World Health
      Organization (WHO) criteria.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For pre and post-menopausal women separately, to examine serum estradiol levels prior to
      pre-registration, prior to registration, after 2 cycles of anastrozole plus MK-2206 (cycle 3
      day 1) and pre surgery.

      II. To examine the percent change in the apoptotic index after 2 weeks of combination therapy
      with MK-2206 and anastrozole (cycle 1 day 17) relative to apoptotic index after 4 weeks of
      treatment with anastrozole alone (pre MK-2206).

      III. To examine the change in Ki67 levels after 2 weeks of combination therapy with MK-2206
      and anastrozole (cycle 1 day 17) relative to that after 4 weeks of treatment with anastrozole
      alone (pre MK-2206).

      IV. To estimate the proportion of patients whose Ki67 values is at most 10% after 2 weeks of
      combination therapy with MK-2206 and anastrozole (cycle 1 day 17) among those whose Ki67 was
      more than 10% or more after 4 weeks of treatment with anastrozole alone (pre MK-2206).

      V. To examine the pharmacodynamic effect of MK-2206 in combination with anastrozole (or
      anastrozole in combination with goserelin) on PI3K pathway signaling using serially collected
      tumor specimens.

      VI. To explore molecular mechanisms which could affect tumor response to combination MK-2206
      and anastrozole (or anastrozole in combination with goserelin) in PIK3CA mutant ER+ breast
      cancer.

      VII. To examine the PIK3CA mutation status in circulating plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      prior to and following therapy on serially collected peripheral blood (pre anastrozole, pre
      MK-2206, cycle 1 day 17, and at the time of surgery) and to correlate with tumor tissue
      PIK3CA status.

      VIII. To examine PIK3CA mutation status of the residual cancer collected at the time of
      surgery post 4 cycles of neoadjuvant MK-2206 and anastrozole.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK-2206 orally (PO) on days 2, 9, 16, and 23; anastrozole PO
      daily on days 1-28; and goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 (premenopausal
      patients only). Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Standard of care surgery (breast and axillary lymph node surgery) is performed 1-3 weeks
      following the last dose of Akt inhibitor MK-2206.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30-60 days.

    <description>Any woman whose Ki67 value ≤10% on cycle 1 day 17 of combination treatment who does not receive alternative treatment prior to surgery and has no histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and the axillary lymph nodes is considered to have a pathological complete response (pCR). A ninety percent confidence interval for the true pathologic complete response rate will be calculated using the Duffy-Santer approach.</description>

    <description>The Clinical response rate is estimated by the number of patients whose disease meets the WHO criteria of complete or partial response based on physical examination divided by the total number of eligible patients. Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all known disease based on measurements taken at the completion of neo-adjuvant therapy. Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the product of the bi-dimensional measurements of the lesion (total tumor size) between the pre-treatment measurements and the measurements taken at the completion of neo-adjuvant therapy. A ninety percent confidence interval for the true clinical response rate will be calculated using the Duffy-Santer approach.</description>

        <title>Clinical Response Rate</title>
        <description>The Clinical response rate is estimated by the number of patients whose disease meets the WHO criteria of complete or partial response based on physical examination divided by the total number of eligible patients. Complete Response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all known disease based on measurements taken at the completion of neo-adjuvant therapy. Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the product of the bi-dimensional measurements of the lesion (total tumor size) between the pre-treatment measurements and the measurements taken at the completion of neo-adjuvant therapy. A ninety percent confidence interval for the true clinical response rate will be calculated using the Duffy-Santer approach.</description>

Partial Response (PR) is defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the product of the bi-dimensional measurements of the lesion (total tumor size) between the pre-treatment measurements and the measurements taken at the completion of neo-adjuvant therapy. A ninety percent confidence interval for the true clinical response rate will be calculated using the Duffy-Santer approach.</description>
