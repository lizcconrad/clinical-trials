      This study is designed to assess the effect of APOKYN treatment in rapid and reliable
      improvement of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects suffering from delayed or
      unreliable onset of levodopa (L-dopa) action.

    <textblock>
      This Phase IV, Open-Label, Efficacy and Safety Study of APOKYN® is intended to assess the
      effect of APOKYN treatment in rapid and reliable improvement of motor symptoms in PD subjects
      suffering from delayed or unreliable onset of L-dopa action. The study will also include a
      sub-group of 8 subjects to evaluate their gastroparesis and assess their gastric empty with
      other measures to explore if APOKYN has any influence on gastric empty rather than just
      bypassing the stomach with a subcutaneous route of administration.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of APOKYN treatment in rapid and
      reliable improvement of motor symptoms in PD subjects suffering from delayed or unreliable
      onset of L-dopa action (defined below). APOKYN treatment will also be assessed in a sub-group
      of PD subjects suffering from gastroparesis and delayed onset of L-dopa action.

      Delayed or unreliable onset to L-dopa for the study population is defined as impaired motor
      function (tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and/or postural instability) persisting for a
      minimum of 45 minutes after taking a dose of L-dopa because of its delay in onset of action.
      The impaired motor function resulting from delay in L-dopa onset is referred to as &quot;delayed
      ON&quot; and when it occurs upon awakening is referred to as &quot;morning akinesia.&quot;

      Main Study:

      This is a multicenter, multiple-treatment, open-label, outpatient study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of APOKYN in PD subjects with delayed onset of L dopa action. The study
      will have:

        -  Screening - 1-5 days (Visit 1);

        -  Baseline L-Dopa Period - 7 days, continuation of L dopa treatment;

        -  Antiemetic Treatment Period - 3-days; initiation of trimethobenzamide 300 mg tid orally;

        -  APOKYN Initiation/optimum dose identification Period (Visit 2)- variable, not more than
           11 days;

        -  APOKYN Treatment Period - 7 days, immediately upon identification of optimum dose;

        -  Study Discharge (Visit 3)- within 2 days of completion of the APOKYN treatment period.

      Gastroparesis Sub-Study:

      A sub-group of subjects (n=8) from 1 study site that have symptoms of gastroparesis will be
      admitted to the clinic on 2 occasions to undergo gastroparesis procedures and assessments
      (once at the conclusion of the baseline L-dopa period and once at the conclusion of the
      APOKYN treatment period). Note, to do the second gastroparesis assessment, this sub-group of
      subjects will have an extension for one extra day beyond the designated 7 day APOKYN
      treatment period (i.e., it will be 8 days) in order to keep the 7 day diary recording
      outpatient scope of work the same as the rest of the subjects in the study. The second
      inpatient period will be also considered the end-of-study visit for this sub group.

Daily &quot;TTO&quot; for the baseline period will be averaged for each subject and compared to the daily &quot;TTO&quot; for the same subject during the treatment period to assess APOKYN's effect on &quot;TTO&quot;.</description>

    <description>APOKYN (apomorphine hydrochloride injection) is used as needed to treat off-episode motor symptoms, such as muscle stiffness, slow movements, and difficulty starting movements, in people with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).
In the study, subjects will complete an L-Dopa Baseline Period in which they record daily &quot;time to on&quot; following their regularly scheduled L-Dopa morning dose for 7 days. At the end of the baseline period, patients will start trimethobenzamide therapy during a minimum 3-Day Anti-Emetic Pretreatment Period. Patients determined to remain eligible at the end of the required Anti-Emetic Pretreatment Period will be initiated on APOKYN therapy by an investigator. Once the appropriate dose is identified by a study investigator, patients will inject APOKYN at their regularly scheduled levodopa morning dose time (levodopa will be delayed by 40 minutes) daily during a 7-day APOKYN Treatment Period and record &quot;time to on&quot; following the APOKYN injection.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Gastric Emptying Time</title>
        <description>A sub-group of subjects from 1 study site that have symptoms of gastroparesis were admitted to the clinic on 2 occasions to undergo gastroparesis procedures and assessments (once at the conclusion of the baseline L-dopa period and once at the conclusion of the APOKYN treatment period). Note, to do the second gastroparesis assessment, this sub-group of subjects had an extension for one extra day beyond the designated 7 day APOKYN treatment period (i.e., it will be 8 days) in order to keep the 7 day diary recording outpatient scope of work the same as the rest of the subjects in the study. The second inpatient period was also considered the end-of-study visit for this sub group.</description>

            <description>In the study, subjects will complete an L-Dopa Baseline Period in which they record daily &quot;time to on&quot; following their regularly scheduled L-Dopa morning dose for 7 days. At the end of the baseline period, patients will start trimethobenzamide therapy during a minimum 3-Day Anti-Emetic Pretreatment Period. Patients determined to remain eligible at the end of the required Anti-Emetic Pretreatment Period will be initiated on APOKYN therapy by an investigator. Once the appropriate dose is identified by a study investigator, patients will inject APOKYN at their regularly scheduled levodopa morning dose time (levodopa will be delayed by 40 minutes) daily during a 7-day APOKYN Treatment Period and record &quot;time to on&quot; following the APOKYN injection.</description>
