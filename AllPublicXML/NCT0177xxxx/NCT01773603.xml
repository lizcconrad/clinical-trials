  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choosing the best embryo for transfer has become the major challenge in in vitro
      fertilization (IVF). Morphology alone is obviously not enough and time-lapse incubation has
      added embryo development kinetics as another selection criterion.

      This study was designed to select for the top blastocyst to be replaced, while increasing the
      pregnancy chance, with the local legislation regulating the number of embryos to be
      transferred and to establish a morphokinetic standard to be used in our clinical setting.
