  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation trial of paclitaxel in
      combination with defactinib (VS-6063), a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, in patients with
      advanced ovarian cancer. This clinical study is comprised of 2 parts: Phase I (Dose
      Escalation) and Phase Ib (Expansion). The purpose of this study is to assess assess the
      safety (including the recommended phase 2 dose), the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer
      activity of defactinib (VS-6063) when administered in combination with paclitaxel.
      Pharmacodynamic effects will also be examined in tumor biopsies.
