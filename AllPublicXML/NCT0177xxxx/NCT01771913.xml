  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if there is a relationship between the take of
      fat grafts with and without ADSCs and the presence of specific surface markers on the cells
      of the stromal vascular fraction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of patients will be studied. The control will receive centrifuged fat grafts while
      the other group will receive centrifuged enriched fat grafts with ADSCs. The performance of
      both grafts will be assessed through volume measurement employing MRI before and after 6
      months post-op.

    <measure>Volume Maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Volumetry of the reconstructed breasts will be accomplished through MRI and OsiriX software. Osirix software allows breast volume calculation through the determination of regions of interest (ROIs) on an MRI sequence. Once the pre (V1) and postoperative (V2) volumes were determined the following formula was applied: (V2 - V1) X 100/graft volume. The result, expressed in percentage, expresses graft volume persistence.</description>

    <measure>Immunophenotyping</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Immunophenotyping of the fresh stromal vascular fraction of both groups. Immunophenotyping or flow cytometry measures how many cells, in a sample, express a specific surface marker. A surface marker or a group of markers may characterize a specific cell type. The software that accompanies the flow cytometer determines the number of cells (in percentage) that express the tested surface marker.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Fat Necrosis in the Postoperative Period</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Fat necrosis may occur whenever a fat graft is performed and it has clinical relevance. It can emerge as oil cysts or small nodules a little bit painful. In mammograms of normal breasts, fat necrosis present as cysts or micro calcifications that present a benign appearance. In breast reconstruction patients, fat necrosis, despite its benign characteristics, can suggest cancer recurrence.</description>

        <title>Volume Maintenance</title>
        <description>Volumetry of the reconstructed breasts will be accomplished through MRI and OsiriX software. Osirix software allows breast volume calculation through the determination of regions of interest (ROIs) on an MRI sequence. Once the pre (V1) and postoperative (V2) volumes were determined the following formula was applied: (V2 - V1) X 100/graft volume. The result, expressed in percentage, expresses graft volume persistence.</description>

In mammograms of normal breasts, fat necrosis present as cysts or micro calcifications that present a benign appearance. In breast reconstruction patients, fat necrosis, despite its benign characteristics, can suggest cancer recurrence.</description>
