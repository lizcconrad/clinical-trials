    <textblock>
      Gastric bypass surgery resolves type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without the need for diabetes
      therapy in ~80% of patients. Moreover, improvement in insulin sensitivity and glucose
      homeostasis occurs within days after surgery before significant weight loss is achieved. This
      observation has led to the notion that bypassing the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract has
      specific therapeutic effects on insulin action and glucose metabolism. In fact, both surgical
      and endoscopic procedures that bypass the upper GI tract are currently being studied in human
      subjects. Recently, a new surgical technique, duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery (DJBS), has
      been developed specifically to treat T2DM. Data from preliminary studies have shown that DJBS
      results in glycemic control in 87% of overweight and obese patients with T2DM.These subjects
      will undergo metabolic studies at the University Hospital in Sao Paulo before and after their
      surgical procedure. Washington University investigators will: 1) provide technical support
      and guidance to the physicians performing the studies in Brazil, 2) process and analyze blood
      samples obtained from the study at the Washington University Center for Human Nutrition, and
      3) be involved in analyzing the data and writing the final manuscripts. The effects of DJBS
      on the following clinical and metabolic parameters will be evaluated
