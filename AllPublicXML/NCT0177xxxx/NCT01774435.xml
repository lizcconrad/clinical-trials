             significant findings on physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory
             evaluations (hematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis) or 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG). Subjects may continue on their current medication regimen to
             control pre-existing medical and psychiatric (other than schizophrenia) conditions
             including the use of PRN medications.

          8. Subject is currently stable on a 4-, 6-, or 8-mg oral dose of risperidone for 30 days
             prior to admission

        Subject Exclusion Criteria

          1. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to lidocaine or any local anesthetic agent of the
             amide type (local anesthetic used during implant and explant procedures)

          2. Known sensitivity to polyurethane

          3. Hospitalized or required acute crisis intervention for symptom exacerbation in the 30
             days prior to admission as determined by the Investigator

          4. Subject has a history of suicide attempt in the last year, or in the opinion of the

             not limited to, skin cancer, psoriasis, eczema, or atopic dermatitis), evidence of
             recent sunburn, scar tissue, tattoo, open sore, body piercing or branding at the
             intended implantation site that would interfere with the implantation procedure or
             interfere with implant site assessments as determined by the Investigator

          6. History of abnormal scar formation or family history of keloid formation

          7. Have a positive screen for substances of abuse conducted at screening or had any
             history of abuse in the last six months as defined by DSM-IV criteria

          8. Have impaired hepatic (ALT/AST &gt;1.5 times higher than the upper limit of normal) or
             renal function (eGFR &lt;50mL/min)

          9. Previously defined hypersensitivity to risperidone

         11. Electroconvulsive therapy within 6 months of admission

         12. Treatment of coexisting medical conditions that require the introduction of cytochrome
             P450 2D6 inhibitors or inducers

         13. Positive screen for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C Antibody (anti
             HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody and/or antigen

         14. Participation in the treatment phase of a clinical study or receipt of an
             investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug administration on Day 1; for
             investigational drugs with an elimination half-life greater than 15 days, this time
             period will be extended to 60 days

         15. Prior participation in a EN3342 study

         16. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both Endo staff or
