    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, observer-blind, controlled intervention study with parallel
      groups is to study the effect of strength training (2x/week for 6 months) with and without
      additional dietary supplementation (protein-enriched) on muscle strength, function and mass,
      oxidative stress parameters and the immune system in elderly institutionalized persons.

      The participants (n = 120) are recruited from Viennese senior residencies (Kuratorium Wiener
      Pensionistenwohnheime). After a pre-participation screening participants will be distributed
      randomly but stratified by sex and age to one of the 3 intervention groups (cognitive
      training, strength training, strength training + supplement).

      Study participants are eligible if they are male or female with an age over 65 years and if
      their cognitive status as well as their physical fitness level allows to participate at the
      strength training sessions. Exclusion criteria comprise chronic diseases which contraindicate
      the medical training therapy, serious cardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy and
      manifest osteoporosis, medication with anticoagulants or cortisone drugs and also regular
      strength training during the last six months.

      Primary outcome measure is the change in isokinetic torque of knee extensors. Secondary
      outcome measures comprise anthropometric data, functional performance tests, immunological
      and oxidative stress parameters. The change in muscle signaling pathways will be assessed
      from muscle biopsies.
