  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determinate the effect of a pre-treatment with bupropion, a
      dopamine and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor, on the pharmacodynamics and
      pharmacokinetics of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;). The study will
      provide further understanding of the dopaminergic regulation of mood.

    <textblock>
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, &quot;ecstasy&quot;) is widely used by young people for its
      euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE).
      5-HT release mainly contributes to the subjective effects of MDMA whereas NE release is
      involved in the cardiovascular and psychostimulant effects of MDMA. DA mediates the
      reinforcing addiction-related effects of drugs of abuse but it is unclear whether DA
      contributes to the acute effects of MDMA in humans. To determine the role of DA
      transporter-mediated DA release in the acute response to MDMA in humans the investigators
      test the effects of the DA transporter inhibitor bupropion on the physiological and
      subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled cross-over design with four experimental sessions. Bupropion or placebo
      will be administered before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and
      cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma
      samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is that bupropion reduces
      the MDMA-induced increase in positive mood.
