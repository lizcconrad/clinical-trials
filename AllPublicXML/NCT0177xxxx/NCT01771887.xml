  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a disease of great frequency and is a major public health problem. In
      Lebanon, the incidence of diabetes is estimated at 12%, it is expected to double by the year
      2025. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes in Lebanon, the evolution of complications
      of this disease and the lack of studies at this level, it is appropriate to conduct a study
      that aims to evaluate the effects an education program for people with type 2 diabetes on
      their sense of self-efficacy and their ability to self-manage their disease to make them the
      most optimal therapeutic adherence possible. The design of this study is experimental type
      before / after randomization by diabetic patients. Education program delivered to the
      experimental group is the &quot;Accu-Chek Education Program&quot; of Roche. Membership will be assessed
      using a biomarker HbA1c should be &lt;7%, and a questionnaire (Summary of Diabetes Self-Care
      Activities Measure), which measures self-care behaviors. Self-efficacy is measured using the
      Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale. And this before the intervention and 3 months later.
      The sample will be 240 diabetic patients T2. Recruitment will be in outpatient diabetology a
      Hospital located in Beirut. Statistical analyzes used for descriptive variables are measures
      of central tendency, dispersion and frequency distribution. T-test and chi-square will be
      used to compare the socio-demographic characteristics of the 2 groups, experimental and
      control. To test hypotheses and determine the difference in the results of the dependent
      variables of the 2 groups, analysis of variance and covariance are used. The data will be
      processed using SPSS version 14.0.

      1. Following the implementation of a program of education, feeling of self-efficacy
           participants will be higher in the experimental group than in the control group.

        2. Following the implementation of a program of education, self-management behaviors:
           monitoring the diet, the practice of physical exercise, self-monitoring blood sugar,
           taking medications and care feet, participants will be higher in the experimental group
           than in the control group.

        3. Following the implementation of a program of education, the percentage of participants
           who have an HbA1c less than 7 will be higher in the experimental group than in the
           control group.

    <description>education program in 6 hours for groups of 10 people. The content will be divided into 2 sessions with an interval of 2 weeks, the duration of each session is 3 hours. Means active learning, teaching materials in Arabic accompany the content masterful discussions on flipcharts, situation analysis, computer-assisted presentation, demonstration, 150 photos of Lebanese dishes. After, patients receive a 10-page illustrated book, a logbook of diabetes control. 2 weeks after the second education session, each participant will receive 5 calls every 15 days in 2 months. During each call, the research assistant will ask the patient about diet, exercise and self-monitoring, medication and foot care and this according to a checklist.</description>
