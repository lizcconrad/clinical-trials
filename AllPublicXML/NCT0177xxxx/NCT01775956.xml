  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock remains the dominant cause of death in ICU's of the developed world with
      approximately 400,000 cases annually in the US and another 20,000 annually in Canada. While
      many retrospective and prospective reviews of septic shock patients have been undertaken
      worldwide, many key questions remain unanswered. These questions include the true incidence,
      associated morbidity and mortality of septic shock in North America, key factors associated
      with successful management and markers suggesting a high probability of a complicated
      clinical course. Part of the reason for the persistence of these questions, is the fact that
      previous and ongoing reviews of septic shock and severe sepsis have been either limited in
      number (typically &lt;150) or biased by the need to be eligible for specific clinical trials
      (typically, non-eligible patients have not been followed and had data collected.

      We propose to examine specific questions within a temporally comprehensive cohort of septic
      shock patients by review of individual charts using a defined data-extraction template.

      Objectives

        -  Determination of impact of rapidity of implementation of antibiotic therapy, source
           control (where required) and fluid resuscitation on mortality of septic shock

        -  Utility of persistence or increase of vasopressor needs over the 1st 24 hours of shock
           as a predictor of a complicated ICU course (ICU duration &gt; 1 week) or death

        -  Assessment of initial biochemical parameters, co-morbidities and new onset organ failure
           at admission as predictors of a complicated ICU course (ICU duration &gt; 1 week) and death

      Data Collection: Data collection would be performed by a combination of study nurses and 2nd
      or 3rd year medical students hired for the summer for this research project. Research nurses
      and student will be trained by the principal investigator. A minimum of 10% of the charts
      will be randomly audited by the principal investigator to ensure appropriate data extraction.
      This will allow the PI to review and correct any discrepant coding issues and judge specific
      questions (e.g. appropriateness of antibiotics/presence of effective antibiotics or not).

      Data Collection Tool: Attached. In addition, data in the ICU registry includes basic
      epidemiologic data (age, sex, all pertinent medical/surgical comorbidities/risk factors, etc)
      as well as all Apache II

    <description>Analysis will be used to examine critical therapeutic elements of outcome (choice of antibiotics, rapidity of initiation, use of multiple drug combinations, choice and speed of initiation of pressors, choice and degree of fluid resuscitation, etc).
Preliminary analysis of data from 2800 charts suggests an annual incidence of incidence of septic shock in North America (without adjustment for age, sex or socioeconomic status) of approximately 175,000 annual cases, a lower number than has been suggested in some other studies. Further preliminary analysis suggests there is a critical relationship between rapidity of antibiotic initiation and source control implementation following onset of hypotension and outcome in septic shock (Kumar et al, CCM 2006).</description>
