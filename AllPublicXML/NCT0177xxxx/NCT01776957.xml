  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of repeat abortions will be lowest in those women who choose immediate insertion of
      an IUD post-abortion versus those who immediately choose oral contraceptive pills and those
      who indicate all other contraceptive choices including no contraception The provision by the
      health system of IUDs for immediate insertion will result in the lowest health system costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to demonstrate whether there are statistically significant
      differences in the rates of repeat abortions between three groups: 1. women choosing to have
      an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted immediately post-abortion, 2. those choosing to begin
      oral contraceptives immediately post-abortion, and 3. all other choices for post abortion
      contraception including those stating an intention to obtain contraceptives at a later time
      or from an alternate location or to use no contraception. This data will then be used to
      conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of health system provision for cost-free IUDs
      post-abortion. Thus, if providing a free IUD immediately post-abortion significantly reduces
      the rate of repeat abortions, it may be more cost- effective for health system services to
      provide free IUDs at abortion clinics than to field the costs associated with a higher rate
      of repeat abortions.

      The researchers will conduct a retrospective observational cohort study by chart review. The
      researchers propose to review the charts of women undergoing abortions between January 1,
      2005 and December 31, 2006 at Kelowna General Hospital's Women's Services Clinic. The
      researchers will record the following data from each chart: age, parity, gestational age,
      date of index therapeutic abortion (TA), dates of subsequent TAs, contraception used at the
      time of the index conception, contraceptive method chosen post-abortion, and outcome of
      follow-up at two weeks, such as expulsion of IUD. The researchers will also record the
      recurrent pregnancy rates.
