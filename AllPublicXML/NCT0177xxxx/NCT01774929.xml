    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Transdermal Therapeutic
      System (TTS)-fentanyl patch (transdermal patch containing a drug that is put on the skin so
      the drug will enter the body through the skin) in participants with moderate (medium level of
      seriousness) to severe (very serious, life threatening) pain of osteoarthritis (disorder,
      which is seen mostly in older persons, in which the joints become painful and stiff).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (a medical research study in which participants and researchers are
      told which treatments the participants are receiving, &quot;unblinded&quot;), single-arm, prospective
      (study following participants forward in time), study of TTS-fentanyl in participants with
      moderate to severe pain of osteoarthritis. The study will consist of 2 phases: screening
      phase up to 7 days before starting the treatment and treatment phase of 30 days. The first
      patch will be applied by investigator then by participants until 30 days. The dose of
      TTS-fentanyl can be increased, if needed, by 12.5 microgram per hour until adequate
      (reasonably good) pain control is achieved and taking into account the daily dose of
      supplemental paracetamol required by the participant. Other concomitant (given at the same
      time) analgesics (drug used to control pain) will not be used during this phase. Efficacy
      with regard to pain control will be recorded principally by the participant through
      questionnaires in a daily diary. This record will be used to support more detailed
      assessments at study visits on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC) questionnaire. Participants' safety will be monitored.

    <description>The WOMAC is a self-administered; participant reported health status questionnaire designed to capture elements of pain, stiffness and physical impairment in participants with osteoarthritis. It consists of 24 questions (5 questions about pain, 2 about stiffness and 17 about physical function) scored on a VAS of 0 to 10 cm (0 cm=no pain to 10 cm=worse pain). Individual question responses are assigned a score of between 0=extreme and 4=none. Maximum scores for each element differ and therefore, scores were normalized. Total normalized score ranges from 0=worst to 100=best.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic (lasting a long time) primary osteoarthritis pain for more than 3 months with
             Visual Analog Scale (VAS) greater than or equal to 5

          -  Participants having moderate to severe pain (VAS greater than or equal to 5), which
             was not adequately controlled by weak opioids such as tramadol or codeine at optimal
             doses (at least 150 milligram [mg] per day for tramadol or 200 mg per day for codeine)
             for at least 7 consecutive days

          -  Participants who failed from other treatments such as operation or lack of efficacy of
             current treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Skin disease that prevents the use of the transdermal system or which could affect the
             absorption of fentanyl or local tolerability

          -  History or suspicion of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 5 years

          -  History of cardiac, nervous system or respiratory disease which in the investigator's
             judgment precludes participation in the study because of the potential for respiratory
             depression

          -  Confusion, reduced level of consciousness, or concomitant (given at the same time)
             psychiatric disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator, could prevent
             participation in the trial

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding female; female participants of child bearing potential
             without adequate contraception

        <title>Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Score at Day 15 and Day 30</title>
        <description>The WOMAC is a self-administered; participant reported health status questionnaire designed to capture elements of pain, stiffness and physical impairment in participants with osteoarthritis. It consists of 24 questions (5 questions about pain, 2 about stiffness and 17 about physical function) scored on a VAS of 0 to 10 cm (0 cm=no pain to 10 cm=worse pain). Individual question responses are assigned a score of between 0=extreme and 4=none. Maximum scores for each element differ and therefore, scores were normalized. Total normalized score ranges from 0=worst to 100=best.</description>

        <population>ITT population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 post baseline efficacy assessment. &quot;N” signifies those participants who were evaluated for this outcome measure.</population>
