      Trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on safety and tolerability of
      MK-8777 (Org 26576, SCH 900777) in participants with major depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, safety and tolerability study examining MK-8777 in
      participants with major depressive disorder. In Part I of the trial, four different cohorts
      of six participants each will receive multiple rising doses of MK-8777 (ranging from 100 mg
      twice a day [BID] to 300 mg BID) or placebo for up to 16 days. In Part 2, a new cohort of
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive 100 mg BID of MK-8777, 400 mg BID of
      MK-8777, or placebo. Following titration (3 days per step), participants will be maintained
      on the assigned BID dose until Day 27, followed by one day of once a day (QD) dosing, for a
      total of 28 days. There were 11 treatment arms in total for Part 1 and Part 2 (see
      Interventions).

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. A moderate intensity AE is defined as an AE that causes no significant interference with functioning.</description>

    <measure>Part 1: Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Ashberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of treatment (Up to Day 16)</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale designed to assess the severity of depression. The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms: Apparent sadness, Reported sadness, Inner tension, Reduced sleep, Reduced appetite, Concentration difficulties, Lassitude, Inability to feel, Pessimistic thoughts, and Suicidal thoughts. Each of the 10 symptoms are rated on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1=absent to 6=severe. The MADRS score can range from 0 (symptoms absent) to 60 (severe depression), with a higher score indicating more severe depression.</description>

        <title>Part 2: Change From Baseline in the MADRS</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale designed to assess the severity of depression. The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms: Apparent sadness, Reported sadness, Inner tension, Reduced sleep, Reduced appetite, Concentration difficulties, Lassitude, Inability to feel, Pessimistic thoughts, and Suicidal thoughts. Each of the 10 symptoms are rated on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1=absent to 6=severe. The MADRS score can range from 0 (symptoms absent) to 60 (severe depression), with a higher score indicating more severe depression.</description>
