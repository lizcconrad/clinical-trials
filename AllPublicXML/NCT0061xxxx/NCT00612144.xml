  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of early combination therapy with
      Amaryl M with that of uptitration of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 DM
      inadequately controlled by prior monotherapy with metformin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment algorithms for type 2 DM generally employ monotherapy as a first-line pharmacologic
      treatment option. Disease progression renders monotherapy less effective in controlling blood
      glucose over time, with approximately half of the patients requiring additional therapy by 3
      years after diagnosis. As a result, the use of multiple pharmacologic agents to control blood
      glucose is well accepted.

      In combination therapy, selection of suitable drug may be individualized depending on their
      health conditions. However, it is advisable to select drugs having different mechanism
      considering their complimentary action with each other. Therefore, sulfonylureas and
      metformin HCL is the best combination in which &quot;insulin deficiency&quot; and &quot;insulin resistance&quot;,
      the basic two pathophysiologies in type 2 diabetes could be targeted. The efficacy and safety
      of the combination with sulfonylureas and metformin HCL have been proven in numerous clinical
      studies as combination is more effective than monotherapy using each drug in blood glucose
      control.

      Also, new approaches are required in order to attain and maintain good glycaemic control over
      time and aggressive earlier introduction of combination therapy is being increasingly
      recommended over conventional stepwise strategies.
