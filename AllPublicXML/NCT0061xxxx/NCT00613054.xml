      Primary Objective To determine maximum tolerated dose &amp; dose limiting toxicity of Zactima
      when combined w standard dosing of imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea among pts w recurrent
      malignant glioma who are on &amp; not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs Secondary
      Objectives To assess safety &amp; tolerability of Zactima + imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea To
      evaluate pharmacokinetics of Zactima among MG pts on &amp; not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic
      drugs (EIAEDs) when combo w imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea To evaluate pharmacokinetics of
      imatinib mesylate among MG pts on &amp; not on EIAEDs when combo w Zactima &amp; hydroxyurea
      Exploratory Objective To evaluate for evidence of anti-tumor activity of study regimen among
      recurrent malignant glioma (RMG) pts including radiographic response rate, 6-month
      progression free survival (PFS) rate &amp; median PFS

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) angiogenic &amp; Phosphoinositide 3-kinase
      inhibitor/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT) mitogenic cascades are 2 upregulated cell signalling
      pathways in MG that contribute to several hallmark phenotypic features of these tumors.
      Regimen of Zactima + imatinib mesylate represents novel anti-glioma strategy because it
      targets 3 key mediators of dysregulated cell signalling involving VEGF &amp; PI3K-AKT pathways
      including VEGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) &amp; platelet derived growth
      factor(PDGFR). Furthermore by combining Zactima w imatinib mesylate, VEGF &amp; PI3-k/AKT
      pathways can potentially inhibit multiple mediators of each of these pathways. Regarding
      PI3-K/AKT signalling, regimen can inhibit activation of EGFR &amp; PDGFR. Regarding VEGF
      signalling, regimen has potential to inhibit 3 components of VEGFR directed angiogenesis.
      1st, Zactima can directly inhibit VEGFR activation. 2nd, both Zactima &amp; imatinib mesylate can
      indirectly decrease activity of VEGF pathway by diminishing positive input from activated
      PI3-K/AKT signalling. 3rd, imatinib mesylate may inhibit PDGF-regulated pericyte maturation
      of tumor blood vessels.

      We have previously demonstrated that regimen of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea is active
      regimen among recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) pts. Furthermore this activity appears
      substantially better than that reported for imatinib mesylate alone. Although mechanism of
      enhanced activity for imatinib mesylate when combo w hydroxyurea is unclear, it is logical to
      build upon combo of imatinib mesylate + hydroxyurea in subsequent studies rather than
      imatinib mesylate alone. Current study will therefore determine MTD of Zactima when combo w
      standard doses of imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea among RMG pts. Ph II study will then be
      performed, incorporating maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Zactima + imatinib mesylate in order
      to evaluate anti-glioma potential of regimen.

    <description>Pts will start treatment on day 1 of cycle 1 w Zactima, imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea. All 3 agents administered in continuous daily, oral manner. Imatinib mesylate dose 400 mg/day for pts not on EIAEDs &amp; 1000 mg/day for pts on EIAEDs based on previous studies demonstrating that pts on EIAEDs require significantly higher doses of imatinib mesylate &amp; that such doses are safe &amp; well tolerated. Dose of hydroxyurea 500 mg twice day. Dose level of Zactima will be increased in successive cohorts of pts as described below.
Cohorts of 3-6 pts will accrue at each dose level until MTD is defined. Each cohort will consist of a mini of 3 newly enrolled pts. Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted. Cohorts may be expanded at any dose level for further elaboration of safety &amp; pharmacokinetic parameters as required.
Treatment cycle is defined as daily administration of Zactima + imatinib mesylate &amp; hydroxyurea for 28 days for purpose of scheduling evaluations.</description>
