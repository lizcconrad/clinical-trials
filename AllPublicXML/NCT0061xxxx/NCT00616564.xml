  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-dose IL-2 treatment for metastatic melanoma has been approved by the FDA in 1998.
      Studies of GM-CSF plus IL-2 have not addressed the approved dose and schedule. This protocol
      will study the combination of HD-IL2 and GM-CSF given the potential synergistic interactions
      discussed above.

      The primary objectives of this phase II multicenter trial are to:

      Determine the 1 and 2-year survival of patients treated according to protocol. Assess the
      safety and toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      The secondary objectives are to:

      Determine the freedom from progression (FFP). Measure the response rate (RR). Obtain
      immunological data from the use of this regimen in vivo (as separate project: Moffitt?).

      The proposed study is a multicenter phase II trial of HD-IL-2 in combination with GM-CSF.
      GM-CSF will be started 7 days before day 1 of HD-IL-2 and will be continued for 4 weeks to
      day 28, encompassing two cycles of HD-IL2. The first 9 patients will be closely monitored for
      unexpected toxicity.
