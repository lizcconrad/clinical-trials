          -  epilepsy was classifiable according to the ILAE Classification;

          -  &gt;= 4 partial onset seizures during the 4 weeks preceding the Selection Visit and were

             Baseline Period to qualify for randomization;

          -  unsatisfactory current AED treatment in terms of efficacy and/or safety;

          -  stable AED treatment consisting of no more than two AEDs.

          -  treatable seizure etiology;

          -  epilepsy secondary to a progressive cerebral disease or any other progressively
             neurodegenerative disease, including Rasmussen and Landau-Kleffner diseases;

          -  history of status epilepticus which required hospitalization during 3 months prior to
             the Selection Visit;
