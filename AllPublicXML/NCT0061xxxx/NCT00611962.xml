    <description>Oxaliplatin was provided in clear glass vials sealed with a rubber stopper and an aluminum seal with a flip-off cover. Each vial contained 50 or 100 mg of active ingredient with 450 or 900 mg, respectively, of lactose monohydrate as excipient
Paclitaxel was supplied as single dose vials of 30 mg/5 mL or 100 mg/17 mL.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven germ cell cancer: gonadal (including ovarian) or extragonadal,
             seminomatous or non seminomatous, or clinical presentation of a GCT with elevated AFP
             level and/or hCG level (&gt; or =to 100 x ULN) when a biopsy was not available

          -  Metastatic GCT patients:

          -  Progression disease defined as &gt; 10% increase in hCG and/or AFP markers (and/or
             documented progressive disease [PD]) during a platinum-based chemotherapy or less than
             6 months after the last cycle (in the case of growing non seminomatous tumor, without
             increased markers, a histological documentation of malignant tumor was required, to
             exclude growing mature teratoma)

          -  At least 1 prior line of chemotherapy containing CDDP + etoposide; (prior regimen with
             high dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell support was permitted)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS (ECOG PS) grade &lt; or =to 2

          -  At least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion by imaging (CT scan) of &gt; or =to 20 mm
             outside an irradiated area OR significantly increased tumor markers &gt; 2 x ULN (on &gt; or
             =to 2 consecutive tests, even in the absence of measurable lesions)

          -  Age &gt; or =to 18

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve

          -  Neutrophil count &gt; or =to 1500/mm3

          -  Platelets &gt; or =to 100,000/mm3

          -  Renal function:Creatinine &lt; 3 x ULN

          -  Liver function:Transaminases &lt; or =to 2.5 x ULN, total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN (if liver
             metastases, transaminases &lt; or =to 5 x ULN)

          -  Laboratory values obtained in the week preceding study entry

          -  Neurosensory &lt; or =to grade 1 NCI CTC

          -  Signed informed consent obtained prior to all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant high-dose steroids (except for antiemetic prophylaxis)

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding or absence of contraception in sexually active patients

          -  Prior treatment with oxaliplatin or taxanes

          -  History of second malignancy, except for cured non melanoma skin cancer or excised in
             situ cervical carcinoma

          -  Symptomatic cerebral and/or leptomeningeal metastasis (irradiated brain metastases not
             requiring corticosteroid treatment were allowed)

          -  Treatment with another experimental drug or anticancer agent or participation in
             another clinical study within 30 days prior to study

          -  Other serious illness or uncontrolled infection

          -  Psychological, social or geographical situation preventing regular follow-up

          -  Primary tumor in brain/central nervous system
