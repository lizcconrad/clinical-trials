    <textblock>
      This study is meant to assess potential inhibitory effects of GSK376501 on CYP450 isoenzymes
      3A4, 2C8, 2C9. subjects will receive probe compounds and systemic levels of these substrates
      will be compared pre and post dosing of GSK376501.

             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).
