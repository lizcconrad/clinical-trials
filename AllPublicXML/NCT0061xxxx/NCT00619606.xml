  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparative study which compares the end-tidal carbon dioxide and oxygen saturation levels
      of patients during endoscopy which have used either the new oral-nasal oxygenating device
      (TwinGuard), or a standard bite block plus nasal cannulae using an equivalent flow rate of
      oxygen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia is common during endoscopy. Following sedation induction, oxygen saturation falls
      moderately in most patients, whilst some drop to unacceptable levels. To monitor such changes
      endoscopic practices routinely use oximeters and capnography.

      TwinGuard is an all-in-one device which incorporates a bite block with the functionality of
      nasal cannula as well as monitoring expired air (carbon dioxide)

    <description>A system consisting of an endoscopic bite block that fits together with a nasal cannula. After gastroscopy, the bite block is discarded leaving the patient receiving oxygen in recovery.An optional carbon dioxide sampling device fits with the TwinGuard in endoscopy to monitor expired air.</description>
