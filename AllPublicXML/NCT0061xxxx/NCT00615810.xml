  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether patients switching their backbone from Kivexa to
      Truvada, who already have raised total cholesterol prior to switching, have an improvement in
      their total cholesterol after 12 weeks of treatment. If an improvement is demonstrated the
      study aims to show whether this has a beneficial effect on the patient's overall
      cardiovascular risk and long term prognosis.

      This protocol is a Phase 4, open label, randomized, UK multi-center, controlled study to
      assess the effect on lipid profile of switching from a stable HAART regimen of Kivexa + EFV
      to once daily Atripla in adult HIV 1 infected subjects with raised cholesterol.

      At Baseline, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment groups:

      Treatment Group 1: switch to Atripla Treatment Group 2: Continuation of previous stable HAART
      regimen of Kivexa + EFV Initiation of treatment with study drugs must take place within 24
      hours after Baseline visit. At Week 12, subjects in Treatment Group 2 (continuation of Kivexa
      and EFV regimen) will switch to Atripla. Treatment in both groups will continue through Week
      24
