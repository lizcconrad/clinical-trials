    <measure>Primary Endpoint Will be the Change From Baseline in Average Pain Score Over the Last 7 Days of the Maintenance Phase.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 (Maintenance Phase-MP)</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline (BL) was calculated as the value of the average diary pain score for the last 7 days of the MP minus the value of the average pain score at BL (post wash-out period, including the average of the last 7 available entries prior to/including the diary pain measurement on Titration Day 0). Based on their pain experienced during the previous 24 hours, participants assessed their pain every evening at bedtime in an electronic diary by choosing the appropriate number on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): 0, no pain; 1 to 3, mild; 4 to 6, moderate; 7 to 10, severe pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2 and 4 of the Maintenance Phase in Mean In-clinic Pain Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2 and 4 (Maintenance Phase - MP)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated their pain during the previous 24 hours at all clinic visits using an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): 0, no pain; 1 to 3, mild; 4 to 6, moderate; 7 to 10, severe pain (10=worst possible pain). Change in In-clinic Pain Assessment was calculated by subtracting the average score on the NRS at Week 2 and Week 4 (values for each week were observed cases) of the MP from the average score on the NRS at Baseline (the last non-missing measurement prior to taking study drug).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Rescue Medication Tablets Taken Per Day During the Maintenance Phase (MP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 Maintenance Phase</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the number of acetaminophen tablets taken during the previous 24 hours in a participant diary. Rescue medication was summarized as the mean number of doses taken per day during each week of the Maintenance Phase (MP) and the mean number of doses taken during all MP weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity Score at Each Week During the Maintenance Phase (MP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 (MP)</time_frame>
    <description>Least square mean (LSM) of pain intensity was calculated from the NRS score entered by the participants in their diaries at each week during the MP. Participants rated their pain during the previous 24 hours at all clinic visits using an NRS: 0, no pain; 1-3, mild; 4-6, moderate; 7-10 (worst possible pain), severe pain. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the value of the average of the LSM of the NRS score at each week during the MP (the last 7 available diary entries in the MP were used, provided at least 3 existed) from the average Baseline value of the LSM of the NRS score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Classified as Responders, With a 50% and 30% Pain Reduction From Baseline to the Last 7 Days of the Maintenance Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 Maintenance Phase (MP)</time_frame>
    <description>Responders were defined as participants achieving a mean &gt;=50% or &gt;=30% pain reduction based on the NRS score from Baseline to the last 7 days of the MP. Those participants who did not have at least 3 diary entries in the MP, those who withdrew during the Titration Phase (TP), and non-completers (NC: who did not complete the study) were classified as non-responders. The number of responders and responders including non-completers from Baseline to the last 7 days of the MP were reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of the MP (Included All Participants Who Completed Week 4 of the MP and Who Terminated Early During the MP) in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Maintenance Phase (MP) (Week 4).</time_frame>
    <description>Change from BL (average value of MOS Sleep Scale score including Overall Sleep Problem [OSP] Index at end of MP minus average BL value) to the end of the MP was summarized for the OSP Index, in addition to the following subscales of the MOS Sleep Scale: Sleep Disturbance; Sleep Adequacy; Snoring; Awakening with Shortness of Breath or with a Headache; Somnolence; and Optimal Sleep. Each item was transformed to a scale with a range of 0-100. For each subscale, except Optimal Sleep, higher scores indicate a greater level of what was being measured (i.e., more snoring, more sleep adequacy, etc.).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of the MP (Included All Participants Who Completed Week 4 of the MP and Who Terminated Early During the MP) in Sleep Quantity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Maintenance Phase (MP) (Week 4).</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in sleep quantity was calculated by subtracting the average value of sleep quantity, calculated in hours, at the end of the MP from the average Baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Phase in Optimal Sleep Based on the Sleep Quantity Domain of the MOS Sleep Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Maintenance Phase (MP) (Week 4).</time_frame>
    <description>Optimal Sleep was based on the Sleep Quantity domain of the MOS Sleep Scale and included the options of &quot;Yes&quot; if sleep quantity was 7-8 hours, and &quot;No&quot; otherwise. &quot;Improved&quot; indicated a change in response of no at baseline to yes at the end of the MP, &quot;Same&quot; indicated no change in response, and &quot;Worse&quot; indicated a change in response from yes at baseline to no at the end of the MP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Overall Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of Maintenance Phase (MP) (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>For the PGIC assessment, participants were asked to assess their overall status since they initiated the study drug to the end of the Maintenance Phase using a 7-point categorical scale: 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse. All participants who completed Week 4 of the Maintenance Phase and participants who terminated early during the Maintenance Phase were assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Score on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) at the End of the Maintenance Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Maintenance Phase (MP) (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM assessed the participant's overall satisfaction with treatment, including subscales to assess effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction. Raw scores from the scale were transformed into a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated greater satisfaction with treatment. TSQM was reported at the end of the MP. Participants who completed Week 4 of the MP and who terminated early during the MP were assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scores on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) at the End of the MP for All Participants Who Completed Week-4 of the MP and Who Terminated Early During the MP</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Maintenance Phase (MP) (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF assessed pain intensity, pain relief from medication, and pain interference with function over the previous 24 hours. Pain intensity was assessed by the mean of 4 intensity items rated on a 0-10 categorical scale: 0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Pain interference was assessed by determining the mean of the 7 interference items on a 0-10 categorical scale ranging from 0=does not interfere to 10=completely interferes. The level of pain relief provided by treatment was assessed on an 11-point categorical scale ranging from 0% to 100%</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scores on the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (SF-36) at the End of the MP for All Participants Who Completed Week 4 of the MP and Who Terminated Early During the MP</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Maintenance Phase (MP) (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Least square (LS) mean calculated based on participant's assessment of SF-36,a quality of life questionnaire consisting of 36 items grouped into 8 domains. These 8 domains further grouped into 2 overall summary measures,physical health and mental health. Higher scores on SF-36 represented better state of health. Physical/mental components summarized the data of all the physical/mental domains of SF-36 and higher scores represented better state of health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scores for Reported Health Transition at the End of the MP for All Participants Who Completed Week 4 of the MP and Who Terminated Early During the MP</measure>
    <time_frame>End of maintenance Phase (MP) (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The least square (LS) mean score for reported health transition was calculated based on the scores (ranging from 1 to 5) given by the participant in answer to the following question: &quot;Compared to 1 year ago, how would you rate your health in general now?&quot;. Lower numbers represent a better state of health.</description>

          <title>1: Retigabine</title>
          <description>Arm Description: Participants started on a total daily dose of 150 milligrams (mg) and were titrated to their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) up to a maximum of 900 mg daily using retigabine 50 mg and/or 100 mg tablets. The dose was increased by 150 mg each week and administered 3 times daily (TID) in equally divided doses. In the Maintenance Phase, retigabine was administered in equally divided doses to maintain the participant’s MTD. Participants with moderate to severe side effects during the first week at their MTD and who had attained at least dose level 3 (450 mg) were allowed a one level dose reduction (150 mg). Participants unable to maintain the MTD discontinued the medication. In the Taper Phase, the dose was reduced by one-third during each of the first two weeks, and the study medication was stopped by the third week during the 3-week duration.</description>

          <description>Arm Description: Participants started on a total daily dose of 150 milligrams (mg) and were titrated to their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) up to a maximum of 900 mg daily using retigabine 50 mg and/or 100 mg tablets. The dose was increased by 150 mg each week and administered 3 times daily (TID) in equally divided doses. In the Maintenance Phase, retigabine was administered in equally divided doses to maintain the participant’s MTD. Participants with moderate to severe side effects during the first week at their MTD and who had attained at least dose level 3 (450 mg) were allowed a one level dose reduction (150 mg). Participants unable to maintain the MTD discontinued the medication. In the Taper Phase, the dose was reduced by one-third during each of the first two weeks, and the study medication was stopped by the third week during the 3-week duration.</description>

            <description>Arm Description: Participants started on a total daily dose of 150 milligrams (mg) and were titrated to their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) up to a maximum of 900 mg daily using retigabine 50 mg and/or 100 mg tablets. The dose was increased by 150 mg each week and administered 3 times daily (TID) in equally divided doses. In the Maintenance Phase, retigabine was administered in equally divided doses to maintain the participant’s MTD. Participants with moderate to severe side effects during the first week at their MTD and who had attained at least dose level 3 (450 mg) were allowed a one level dose reduction (150 mg). Participants unable to maintain the MTD discontinued the medication. In the Taper Phase, the dose was reduced by one-third during each of the first two weeks, and the study medication was stopped by the third week during the 3-week duration.</description>

        <description>Least square mean (LSM) of pain intensity was calculated from the NRS score entered by the participants in their diaries at each week during the MP. Participants rated their pain during the previous 24 hours at all clinic visits using an NRS: 0, no pain; 1-3, mild; 4-6, moderate; 7-10 (worst possible pain), severe pain. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the value of the average of the LSM of the NRS score at each week during the MP (the last 7 available diary entries in the MP were used, provided at least 3 existed) from the average Baseline value of the LSM of the NRS score.</description>

        <description>Change from BL (average value of MOS Sleep Scale score including Overall Sleep Problem [OSP] Index at end of MP minus average BL value) to the end of the MP was summarized for the OSP Index, in addition to the following subscales of the MOS Sleep Scale: Sleep Disturbance; Sleep Adequacy; Snoring; Awakening with Shortness of Breath or with a Headache; Somnolence; and Optimal Sleep. Each item was transformed to a scale with a range of 0-100. For each subscale, except Optimal Sleep, higher scores indicate a greater level of what was being measured (i.e., more snoring, more sleep adequacy, etc.).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to the End of the MP (Included All Participants Who Completed Week 4 of the MP and Who Terminated Early During the MP) in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale Scores</title>
          <description>Change from BL (average value of MOS Sleep Scale score including Overall Sleep Problem [OSP] Index at end of MP minus average BL value) to the end of the MP was summarized for the OSP Index, in addition to the following subscales of the MOS Sleep Scale: Sleep Disturbance; Sleep Adequacy; Snoring; Awakening with Shortness of Breath or with a Headache; Somnolence; and Optimal Sleep. Each item was transformed to a scale with a range of 0-100. For each subscale, except Optimal Sleep, higher scores indicate a greater level of what was being measured (i.e., more snoring, more sleep adequacy, etc.).</description>

        <title>Mean Score on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) at the End of the Maintenance Phase</title>
        <description>The TSQM assessed the participant's overall satisfaction with treatment, including subscales to assess effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction. Raw scores from the scale were transformed into a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated greater satisfaction with treatment. TSQM was reported at the end of the MP. Participants who completed Week 4 of the MP and who terminated early during the MP were assessed.</description>

            <description>Arm Description: Participants started on a total daily dose of 150 milligrams (mg) and were titrated to their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) up to a maximum of 900 mg daily using retigabine 50 mg and/or 100 mg tablets. The dose was increased by 150 mg each week and administered 3 times daily (TID) in equally divided doses. In the Maintenance Phase, retigabine was administered in equally divided doses to maintain the participant’s MTD. Participants with moderate to severe side effects during the first week at their MTD and who had attained at least dose level 3 (450 mg) were allowed a one level dose reduction (150 mg). Participants unable to maintain the MTD discontinued the medication. In the Taper Phase, the dose was reduced by one-third during each of the first two weeks, and the study medication was stopped by the third week during the 3-week duration.</description>

        <description>The BPI-SF assessed pain intensity, pain relief from medication, and pain interference with function over the previous 24 hours. Pain intensity was assessed by the mean of 4 intensity items rated on a 0-10 categorical scale: 0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Pain interference was assessed by determining the mean of the 7 interference items on a 0-10 categorical scale ranging from 0=does not interfere to 10=completely interferes. The level of pain relief provided by treatment was assessed on an 11-point categorical scale ranging from 0% to 100%</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Diary Pain Score to the Last 7 Days of the Maintenance Phase by Post Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) Subtype &quot;Irritable Nociceptors&quot;</title>
        <description>Participants were stratified into four different PHN subtypes based on the NPPE. Participants with pain, abnormal sensitization of the specific receptor (irritable nociceptors), and with minimal sensory loss were stratified in the&quot;irritable nociceptors&quot; subtype. Based on their pain experienced during the previous 24 hours, participants assessed their pain every evening at bedtime in an electronic diary by choosing the appropriate number on an 11-point NRS: 0, no pain; 1 to 3, mild; 4 to 6, moderate; 7 to 10, severe pain.</description>

The dose was increased by 150 mg each week and administered 3 times daily (TID) in equally divided doses. In the Maintenance Phase, retigabine was administered in equally divided doses to maintain the participant’s MTD. Participants with moderate to severe side effects during the first week at their MTD and who had attained at least dose level 3 (450 mg) were allowed a one level dose reduction (150 mg). Participants unable to maintain the MTD discontinued the medication. In the Taper Phase, the dose was reduced by one-third during each of the first two weeks, and the study medication was stopped by the third week during the 3-week duration.</description>
