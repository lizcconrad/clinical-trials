  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic treadmill exercise has been shown to improve walking, cardiovascular fitness and
      thereby risk factor profiles in chronic stroke patients (Macko et al., Stroke 2005). The
      proposed project is a randomized controlled trial in geriatric stroke patients with chronic
      disabilities to investigate potential mechanisms of treadmill therapy. The hypothesis is
      tested that 3-months of aerobic treadmill exercise induces structural brain plasticity and
      reorganization. The outcome measures are walking ability, gait pattern, cardiovascular
      fitness and brain morphology. This study will elucidate fundamental mechanisms of brain
      adaptations linked to task-repetitive aerobic lower extremity exercise. These mechanisms will
      not only lead to a better understanding but may also help to identify predictors of treatment
      response.

      40 patients aged over 60 years with lower extremity paresis after a first-ever clinical
      stroke longer than 6 months prior to study inclusion will be recruited from: 1) The Geriatric
      Rehabilitation Clinic at the Robert-Bosch Hospital in Stuttgart 2) the Dept of Neurology,
      University Hospital in TÃ¼bingen. Subjects will be randomized to 3 months progressive graded
      aerobic treadmill exercise training (TAEX; 3 times/week, duration 10-45 min) or an attention
      control group (CON). Because we expect that localization and size of stroke affect therapy
      outcomes, stratified randomization will be used to balance entry into groups.

      We hypothesize that 3 months of treadmill gait training but not conventional care leads to
      improvements of cardiovascular fitness and gait and to brain reorganization (structural
      plasticity) in regions in which functional adaptations have been demonstrated using fMRI in
      previous studies. The specific aims are:

        -  To assess reorganization by comparing cortical thickness, cortical density and fiber
           tract morphology before (time point 0), and after therapy (3 months) using T1-weighted
           3D-MPRAGE images, voxel based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging.

        -  To correlate brain reorganization with improvements in walking velocity, and analysis of
           gait patterns (parameters, swing time, stance time, gait symmetry).

        -  To correlate brain reorganization with location and size of the index stroke lesion and
           of diffuse white matter damage (subcortical vascular encephalopathy). Lesion and white
           matter damage will be evaluated based on T2-weighted FLAIR sequences.
