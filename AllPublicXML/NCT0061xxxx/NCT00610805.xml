  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a feasibility study of aggressive CV risk factor management directed by preventive
      cardiology compared to usual care. We will determine: 1) the efficacy of a preventive
      cardiology program compared to usual care in slowing the progression of carotid IMT and
      plaque, and 2) the effect of a preventive cardiology program versus usual care at achieving
      CV risk factor target goals.

      We hypothesize Lupus patients randomized to the preventive cardiology program will have less
      cardiovascular progression over two years than those lupus patients who are given standard
      care for cardiovascular risk, defined by carotid intima-media thickness and plaque.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit 30 eligible patients from the Lupus Center of Excellence outpatient clinic.
      Patients will either be randomized into a preventive cardiology program for aggressive
      treatment, or randomized to usual care (1:1 ratio) in a single-blinded, randomized trial of
      24 months duration. In this feasibility trial we hope to identify and refine any limitations
      in anticipation of designing a larger, randomized intervention study.

      For both arms of the study, at baseline, 6 month, 12 month, 18 month, and 24 month visits (5
      visits in total) all patients will be seen by Dr. Elliott, Principal Investigator. Visits
      will include an interview, fasting laboratory tests completion of questionnaires regarding
      demographics, socioeconomic status, health status, and risk factors (traditional,
      inflammatory, and lupus-specific). Dr. Elliott will perform the physical examinations on all
      patients and complete the lupus-specific disease activity and damage questionnaires. At the
      Baseline visit, 12-month visit, and 24 24-month visits, all patients will have a carotid
      ultrasound.

      Cohort 1: Preventive Cardiology Program arm: Above and beyond the standard care, which is
      listed below, the patients in this arm will be aggressively treated by the cardiologist. As
      deemed prudent, the following may be prescribed: antihypertensives, lipid reducing agents,
      anti-platelets, further cardiac testing, and behavioral modifications. No standard care
      treatment will be withheld.

      Cohort 2: Standard Care arm: The PI will send a letter of all testing results to their
      designated PCP. No standard care treatment will be withheld.
