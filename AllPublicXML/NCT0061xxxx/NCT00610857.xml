      Immunity to melanoma appears to be central to disease control in the adjuvant and advanced
      disease settings. Spontaneous regression has been reported in melanoma, suggesting a role for
      host immunity, indirectly supported by the presence of lymphoid infiltrates at primary
      melanoma associated with tumor regression.

    <description>Specific Aim #1: Test the hypothesis that the combination of IFNa-2b and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody will improve the response rate in patients with recurrent inoperable AJCC stage III and stage IV melanoma. Our therapeutic target is achieving, with acceptable toxicity, a 20% or better rate of objective response, CR or PR by RECIST criteria, as compared to the 5% to 10% expected in patients eligible for study. Study size is planned in terms of our primary efficacy endpoint, objective response.</description>

    <description>One course of therapy consists of three cycles (1 cycle=28days). Anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody (15 mg/kg i.v.) will be given during the first cycle only. HDI will be given all three cycles - cycle 1: 20 MU/m2 i.v. on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 a week (MTWRF) for 4 weeks; cycle 2: 10 MU/m2 s.c. 3 days a week (MWF) for 4 weeks; and cycle 3: 10 MU/m2 s.c. 3 days a week (MWF) for 4 weeks.
Response assessment will be carried out at day 56 and day 84. Every patient will receive 3 cycles regardless of response status after the first 2 cycles. However, a patient may be taken off therapy in the event of clinical progression at the discretion of the treating physician.
Patients without evidence for disease progression after 3 cycles may be offered additional cycles two weeks after completion of the third cycle. Therapy will continue for a maximum of 12 months.</description>

             or compromise participation in the clinical trial.

          -  Active infection or antibiotics within one-week prior to study, including unexplained
             fever (temp &gt; 38.1°C).

          -  Treatment with any investigational product within 28 days of registration.

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis),
