  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic disorder that affects the amount of
      steroids that the body forms. The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency
      (21OHD), which leads to cortisol deficiency and causes the development of mature masculine
      characteristics in newborn, prepubescent, and grown females, and prepubescent males. Prenatal
      treatment with dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has been shown to reduce the masculinization
      of genitalia. However, the long-term effects of dexamethasone on the children who received it
      as fetuses and on mothers who were exposed to it while they were pregnant have not been
      determined. This study will investigate potential long-term adverse side effects of prenatal
      dexamethasone treatment in children and young adults who received dexamethasone as fetuses
      and their mothers who were exposed to it during pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAH is a genetic steroidogenesis disorder. The most common form, 21OHD, leads to cortisol
      deficiency and, in turn, an excess of androgen, a hormone that promotes the development and
      maintenance of male sex characteristics. As a result of this androgen excess, prepubescent
      males and newborn, prepubescent, and grown females exhibit mature masculine characteristics.
      Prenatal treatment with dexamethasone, a corticosteroid that decreases androgen levels, has
      been shown to prevent the development of abnormal genitalia in female infants. The long-term
      effects of this treatment, however, have not been evaluated. This study will determine
      whether prenatal dexamethasone treatment causes any long-term side effects by examining
      children and young adults who received dexamethasone as fetuses and their mothers, who were
      exposed to dexamethasone while pregnant.

      This study has three parts. In Part 1 of the study, participants will provide written consent
      for release of their medical records from their physicians. Participants' physicians will
      then complete a medical form and/or provide copies of selected medical records for each
      participant. Parts 2 and 3 can be completed in 1 day. In Part 2 of the study, participants
      will complete questionnaires in their homes. Participants will answer questions about the
      following experiences: medical procedures, such as hormone treatment and genital surgery;
      education; work; hobbies; play activities and chores during childhood; identification with
      the male or female gender; relationships with parents; interest in being a parent; and
      overall adjustment. Part 3 of the study will consist of neuropsychological testing at the
      study site. This testing will focus on memory, attention, and overall cognitive abilities.
