      Elective outpatient endoscopy for children can be safely performed under general anesthesia
      with either propofol (1) or ketamine (2) infusions. Both infusions have an advantage over
      general anesthesia with volatile agents because they do not require intubation. The goal of
      both infusions is to have the patient breath spontaneously without reacting to the endoscopy
      which is a noxious stimulus. Patient movement, stridor and vomiting are can interrupt the
      procedure and increase overall OR time. Propofol also carries the added risk of causing
      apnea. This side effect is not commonly seen with Ketamine. Our hypothesis is that Ketamine's
      profile makes it a superior drug to Propofol for elective outpatient endoscopy because of
      reduced profound intra-operative interruptions and faster recovery time. We plan a study of
      pediatric patients ages 1 to 10 years old undergoing elective outpatient endoscopy. The
      patients will be randomized to receiving either a Ketamine or Propofol infusion, and the
      intra-operative interruptions will be documented by the anesthesiologist. The Post Anesthetic
      Care Unit (PACU) time to recovery will be monitored and recorded by a third party.
