          4. For the index episode, patients have to have already been on two types of adequate
             doses of antidepressants for no shorter than 4 weeks for each medication or already on
             two types of antidepressants for 8 weeks in total even if the doses of the drugs have
             not been adequate due to side effects. The medication has not been changed for at
             least 4 weeks prior to the study entry.

          5. A score of 2 on at least one of the three sleep items of the 17-GRID-HAMD and a score
             of 8 or more on the ISI.

          6. A score between 8 and 23 on the 17-GRID-HAMD.

          7. Agreement to the requirements that i) no change of medication will be allowed during
             the first 4 weeks of their study period, and ii) all the treatment sessions both of
             bBT-I and of TAU will be audiotaped for the purpose of checking their adherence to the
             protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          5. Patients with duration of depression shorter than 2 months

             during sleep, judged by their clinicians.

          7. Patients who engage in work involving night-shift, which might influence sleep status
