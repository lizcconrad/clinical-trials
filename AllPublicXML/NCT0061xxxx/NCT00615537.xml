  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is designed as a pilot study for the use of laser ablation for local control of
      symptomatic (e.g compressive) benign thyroid masses in 20 patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid nodules are a very common clinical finding, with an estimated prevalence (based on
      palpation) ranging from 3% to 7% among the general population. With the widespread use of
      ultrasound (US), clinically unapparent thyroid nodule prevalence has dramatically increased
      with estimates at 20% to 76% in the general population. Moreover, 20% to 48% of patients with
      a single palpable thyroid nodule are found to have additional nodules when investigated by
      US.

      Laser ablation therapy offer potential for the thermal destruction of soft tissue structures.
      The ability to deliver large doses of energy via small flexible fiberoptics makes laser
      therapy ideally suited for percutaneous treatment of unwanted tissue masses.

      In this study we propose to treat symptomatic soft tissue thyroid masses in the head and neck
      region using a new FDA-cleard laser ablation system to safely and effectively debulk the
      tissue and therefore improve symptoms. Real time US monitoring will be performed of the
      ablation front to ensure complete treatment of the target lesion. All ablated regions will be
      followed by US with Doppler to document changes in size and vascularity. Local effects on
      thyroid function for thyroid mass treatment will be measured on follow-up.

    <intervention_name>Laser Ablation of Thyroid Nodule</intervention_name>
    <description>Laser ablation using a laser generator, disposable fiberoptic laser fiber, cooling catheter and pump, will be performed under conscious sedation. Ultrasound will be used to localize masses. Local anesthesia will be administered both intradermally and subcutaneously. The laser applicator will be placed into the mass and laser energy will be delivered at 15W for 30-120 seconds. Real-time ultrasound monitoring of the ablation front will be used to ensure complete treatment of the target lesion. In larger masses applicators may be placed of the applicator into multiple locations. The number of locations will be determined by the treatment team, and based on lesion morphology, size, location, and accessibility.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented benign thyroid nodule, or cold thyroid
             nodule as documented by thyroid scan.

          -  Patient has been evaluated by endocrinology and endocrine surgery and has been deemed
             suitable candidate for procedure.

          -  The patient's nodule(s) size and number must be no larger than 5cm and a maximum of 3
             nodules, respectively.

          -  All nodules must be greater than 1cm from the expected location of the recurrent
             laryngeal and vagus nerves determined under ultrasound.

          -  Required initial laboratory values: T3, T4. TSH, and Thyroglobulin (for treated
             metastatic lymph nodes)

          -  All patients must understand and sign a study-specific informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Thyroid mass in contact with trachea or esophagus.

          -  Uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis that cannot be corrected with FFP and
             platelets prior to procedure. (Platelets must be â‰¥ 70,000/ul.)

          -  Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, antiplatelet medications, or
             warfarin must be discontinued prior to the procedure for a time period that is
             appropriate given the drug half-life and the drugs known antiplatelet activity (e.g.
             aspirin for 7 days and ibuprofen 24 hours). Low molecular weight heparin preparations
             must be discontinued 24 hours prior to procedure.
