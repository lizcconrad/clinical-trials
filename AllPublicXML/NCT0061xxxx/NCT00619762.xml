    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, open-label study will assess the clinical outcomes of the LTM
      product in three planned analyses. The primary objective of this study is to prospectively
      assess the clinical outcomes associated with the use of LTM in two-stage (expander then
      permanent implant) immediate post-mastectomy breast reconstruction.

    <time_frame>At the time of expander/implant exchange (Stage II),</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of 3 histology parameters, fibroblast infiltration, immune cell response &amp; revascularization, expressed as frequency distributions. Samples evaluated for presence of fibroblasts (cellularity), neovascularization &amp; immune cell response using 4 pt scale. Fibroblast Infiltration: 1=None,2=Few,sparse,3=Moderate,4=Dense. Revascularization:1=None,2=Few randomly dispersed capillaries,3=Moderate; mostly homogenous distribution of new vessels,4=Significant,uniformly distributed vessels; both capillaries and arterioles. Immune Cell response: 1= None,2=Few,normal healing response,3=Moderate,4=Significant;above expected presence for healing. 4 high power(HP)fields reviewed &amp; if uniform in appearance/cellular distribution, 4 considered representative of sample as a whole. If non-uniform distribution observed, 3 HP fields of &quot;sparse or light&quot; distribution &amp; 3 HP fields of dense distribution counted &amp; results averaged. Tissue sample then assessed for overall acellularity &amp; expressed as %.</description>

      <recruitment_details>17 women were identified &amp; consented to participate in the study. All were enrolled and received study product. Of the 17 women, 5 underwent unilateral reconstruction and 12 underwent bilateral reconstruction for a total of 29 breasts evaluated in the study. Patients were recruited from Hospital settings in PA, IL, Washington DC, NY, and VA.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label study with no control arm. All enrolled women/breasts remained in the study through expander/implant exchange up through the Month 3 post-exchange visit.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Evaluation of 3 histology parameters, fibroblast infiltration, immune cell response &amp; revascularization, expressed as frequency distributions. Samples evaluated for presence of fibroblasts (cellularity), neovascularization &amp; immune cell response using 4 pt scale. Fibroblast Infiltration: 1=None,2=Few,sparse,3=Moderate,4=Dense. Revascularization:1=None,2=Few randomly dispersed capillaries,3=Moderate; mostly homogenous distribution of new vessels,4=Significant,uniformly distributed vessels; both capillaries and arterioles. Immune Cell response: 1= None,2=Few,normal healing response,3=Moderate,4=Significant;above expected presence for healing. 4 high power(HP)fields reviewed &amp; if uniform in appearance/cellular distribution, 4 considered representative of sample as a whole. If non-uniform distribution observed, 3 HP fields of “sparse or light” distribution &amp; 3 HP fields of dense distribution counted &amp; results averaged. Tissue sample then assessed for overall acellularity &amp; expressed as %.</description>
