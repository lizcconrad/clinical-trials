      Patients practicing Tai Chi will exhibit significant improvements in primary outcome measures
      of balance, and secondary outcomes of gait, physical performance, Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale, Falls, muscle strength.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who have:

          -  A diagnosis of idiopathic PD, with a disease severity rating of stage I to IV on the
             Hoehn and Yahr scale (Hoehn &amp; Yahr, 1967)

          -  At least 1 score of 2 or more for at least 1 limb for either the tremor, rigidity, or
             bradykinesia item of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)

          -  Stable medication usage

          -  Not participated in a structured exercise program (i.e., not involved in any routine,
             organized physical activity program lasting 30 minutes or more per day, such as a gym
             program or regularly scheduled instructor-led exercise class) in the previous 2 months

          -  Ability to stand unaided or walk independently; had a personal physician's or
             neurologist's clearance for participation; and had a willingness to be assigned to
             intervention conditions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who:

          -  Participate in any other behavioral or pharmacological research study

          -  Have cognitive decline (Mini-Mental State Examination score, â‰¤ 24) (Folstein et al.,
             1975)

          -  Have self-reported diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or other severe neurological (stage
             III and IV PD)

          -  Have evidence of progressive or debilitating conditions (metastatic cancer, severe
             heart or lung disease, crippling arthritis) or severe losses in vision and hearing
             that would limit their tolerance to testing and training procedures, that would
             interfere with study participation

          -  Are unavailable during the study period.
