          -  Hemoglobin &gt; or =to 10 g/dl

          -  AST/ALT &lt; or =to 2.5 times normal superior institutional limit

             hypertension)

          -  Any other malignancy diagnosed within 5 years previous to the gastric cancer, with the
             exception of &quot; in situ &quot; cervix carcinoma or non-melanoma skin cancer
