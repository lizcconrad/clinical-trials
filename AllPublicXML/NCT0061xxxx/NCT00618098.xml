  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Octaplex (human prothrombin complex
      concentrate) can reverse the effects of anticoagulants when compared to the standard
      treatment of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that the efficacy of Octaplex as a
      reversal agent in patients under vitamin K antagonist therapy with the need for urgent
      surgery or invasive procedures was not clinically inferior to that of FFP.

      The secondary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      Octaplex compared to FFP in patients under vitamin K antagonist therapy with the need for
      urgent surgery or invasive procedures.

    <description>INR is determined 15 minutes after the end of each infusion. Each dose (mL/kg body weight) was calculated as = ln(INR/1.4)/0.52. The maximum dose for initial treatment was not to exceed 5500 IU. If the INR is ≥ 1.5 after the initial infusion, additional infusions will be repeated until the INR was &lt; 1.5. Octaplex (500 units, IU) is supplied in vials and was reconstituted with 20 mL of Water for Injection (Ph.Eur.).</description>

    <description>INR is determined 15 minutes after the end of each infusion. The initial dose is 10 mL/kg for a participant with an initial INR of &lt; 3 and 15 mL/kg for a participant with an initial INR of ≥ 3. If the INR is ≥ 1.5 after the initial infusion, additional infusions of 5 mL/kg will be repeated until the INR was &lt; 1.5. Fresh frozen plasma is supplied by the blood bank at each study site and will be prepared and handled according to the site's standard practice.</description>

          -  Patients who have need for urgent surgery or an invasive procedure up to 8 hours after
             admission or identification of a patient currently hospitalized, where oral or
             parenteral vitamin K therapy is deemed too slow in its action for reversal of coumadin
             or warfarin anticoagulant effects.

          -  Patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 or above.

          -  Patients who have given written informed consent or for whom written informed consent
             has been obtained from the patient's legal representative on their behalf.

          -  Patients able and willing to comply with the procedures laid out in the study

          -  Patients with thrombocytopenia of &lt; 80,000 or a history of heparin induced
             thrombocytopenia (HIT).

          -  Patients having received heparin of any type or any non-coumadin or warfarin
             anticoagulant immediately prior and/or intended to be given within the first 1 hour
             post-infusion.

          -  Patients who have received vitamin K more than 3 hours prior to the infusion of study
             drug.
