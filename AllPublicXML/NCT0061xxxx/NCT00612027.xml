      Under daily routine conditions and without any intervention by the sponsor regarding the
      selection of subjects, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic decisions (medicinal and non-
      medicinal therapy, dose, duration, etc.), routine assessments, the participating physicians
      (i.e. general practitioners and internists) are asked to document relevant data related to
      esomeprazole therapy in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with acid
      associated gastrointestinal symptoms can be included.
