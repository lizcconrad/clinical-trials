  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, open-label, single-arm, dose escalation study. Part I will define the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and optimal dose of SPI-1620 and evaluate its PK and PD
      properties. Once the MTD for SPI-1620 is identified, a second phase of the study will focus
      on dose escalation of docetaxel studied in groups of 3-6 patients. This part of the study
      will assess the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of docetaxel administered with
      the optimal dose of SPI 1620 defined in Part I.

      This is a 2-part, open-label, single-arm, dose escalation study. Part I will define the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and optimal dose of SPI-1620 and evaluate its PK and PD
      properties. Eligible patients will receive SPI-1620 delivered intravenously over one minute
      on Days 1, 8 and 15. On Day 8 patients will undergo a series of four H215O PET Blood Flow
      (BF) scans which will be used to assess alterations in BF induced by SPI-1620 in tumor and
      non-tumor ROIs (Region of Interest). Fifteen minutes after receiving SPI-1620 on Day 15,
      patients will receive docetaxel, 60 mg/m2, administered by infusion over 1 hour. Accelerated
      dose escalation of SPI-1620 will be employed: one patient will be treated at each dose level
      with 100% increases between dose levels. If any grade 2 or higher, related AE occurs, the
      trial will revert to 3-patient cohorts with 40% dose escalation between groups. There will be
      no intrapatient dose escalation. Dose escalation will continue until there is either no
      further increase in tumor blood flow as assessed by H215O PET scan, or until significant
      toxicity is observed. Once the MTD for SPI-1620 is identified, a second phase of the study
      will focus on dose escalation of docetaxel studied in groups of 3-6 patients. This part of
      the study will assess the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of docetaxel
      administered with the optimal dose of SPI 1620 defined in Part I. If 60 mg/m 2 was tolerated
      in Part I then up to six patients in Part II will receive docetaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m2
      once every 3 weeks. If this is tolerated the next group of patients will receive docetaxel
      100 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks.
