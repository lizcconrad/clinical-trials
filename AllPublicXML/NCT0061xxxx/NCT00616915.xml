  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wellbutrin (bupropion) is an effective antidepressant (Thase, M 2005). It exists in instant
      release (IR), sustained release (SR) and extended release (XL) forms. The IR formulation was
      never approved for use in Canada. The XL formulation allows for once daily dosing.

      Wellbutrin is both a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and as such increases
      the synaptic concentration of both neurotransmitters. This adds to its positive effects on
      cognition, apathy, tiredness and executive functioning. The increased activation may be also
      responsible for some of its side effects such as initial insomnia and reduced sleep
      efficiency, especially when taken at night.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wellbutrin SR formulation cannot be given as more than 150 mg as a single dose and higher
      doses are commonly required for the treatment of depression; they also have to be given at
      least 8 hours apart in order to avoid peak plasma concentrations and to reduce the risk of
      seizures (incidence of 0.1% at doses Â£ 300 mg). The twice a day dosing may result in
      complaints of insomnia and may necessitate discontinuing the medication or adding a sleep
      promoting agent. The benefit of once-daily dosing cannot be understated given treatment
      adherence is typically lower in depressed patients than their non-depressed counterparts;
      further, the 8 h dosing interval of bupropion SR is likely to have lower adherence compared
      with traditional bid dosing (i.e., morning and evening); thus, it is not difficult to imagine
      patients missing 30-50% of their second dose given the difficulty of recalling to take the
      second dose at work or school. The review of Fava et al. (2005) plots the relative PK
      profiles of XL and SR and notes the significantly lower bupropion concentration at bedtime,
      which is likely to reduce the occurrence of insomnia. Therefore, Wellbutrin XL may improve
      adherence by eliminating the second dose and Wellbutrin XL also avoids the high plasma drug
      concentrations at bedtime, as seen with bupropion SR, which are associated with insomnia.
      Further, the smoother pharmacokinetic profile of Wellbutrin XL may improve overall
      tolerability compared with Wellbutrin SR.
