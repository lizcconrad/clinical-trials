  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testosterone(T) has known effects on many organ systems, although many of its metabolic
      actions are unrevealed. T is an anabolic hormone stimulating protein synthesis but this
      effect has barely been investigated in controlled studies. It also has lipolytic actions
      influencing body composition, but little is known of its regional impact on fat tissue. T
      affects insulin sensitivity. There is an increased incidence of hypogonadism in type 2
      diabetes, and among patients with hypogonadism there is an increased incidence of type 2
      diabetes. The actions of testosterone on glucose metabolism are unknown.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to:

      Investigate the lipolytic effect of testosterone on muscle and fat tissue. To gain insight in
      the intracellular mechanisms of testosterone on lipolysis and investigate possible regional
      differences in lipolysis and changes in body composition.

      Finally to investigate the effect of short term experimental hypogonadism and acute
      testosterone substitution on cytokines, insulin sensitivity and protein metabolism.

      The trial is a randomised double blinded cross-over study of 4 x 2 days with an interval of 1
      month in between. 12 healthy young men will receive GnRH treatment over a 3 month period and
      examined on 4 occasions with various degrees of T substitution and placebo . The examinations
      take place at the Research Lab within the Medical Department M.

      The investigations are deemed relevant to the understanding of the interrelationship between
      male hypogonadism and type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis is that T has beneficial effects on
      carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. The generated knowledge would therefore hopefully
      improve prophylaxis, screening and early treatment of both group of patients.

    <description>The trial is a double blinded, randomised cross-over study of 4 x 2 days with an interval of 1 month in between. 12 healthy young male participants will receive the GnRH-agonist leuprorelide 7,5 mg s.c. 3 weeks before examination on 3 occasions, and a fourth day without intervention.
The four days will include treatment on the examination day, Day 1 with:
Placebo (hypogonadism after leuprorelide injection)
Testosterone gel 50 mg applicated in the morning at 06.00 am (physiologic substitution - after leuprorelide injection).
Testosterone gel 150 mg applicated in the morning at 06.00 am (supra-physiologic substitution - after leuprorelide injection).
No treatment.</description>
