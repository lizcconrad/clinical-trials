  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are developing and experimentally evaluating two variants of a 10-episode, brief
      (12 minutes per episode), infotainment-style television series targeted at parenting
      practices, to determine the potential value of television for bringing evidence-based
      parenting practices to parents. The study compares an &quot;information-only&quot; version of the
      television series against an &quot;enhanced&quot; version that is designed to actively promote parents'
      adoption of the targeted strategies. Both versions of the series are compared against a
      waitlist control group. The media series is derived from the Triple P Positive Parenting
      Program.

    <textblock>
      The mass media, and television in particular, hold significant potential as part of a
      population-wide strategy for bringing evidence-based parenting practices to a broad range of
      parents experiencing challenges raising their children. The potential of television for
      affecting parenting has received very little research attention, however; thus, little is
      known about how media messages to affect parenting practices might be optimally designed.
      This study will develop and experimentally evaluate two variants of a 10-episode, brief (12
      minutes per episode), infotainment-style television series targeted at parenting practices,
      derived from the Triple Pâ€”Positive Parenting Program (Sanders, 1999). A sample of 300
      families of children ages 3-6 years with somewhat elevated disruptive behavior problems will
      be randomized to (a) receive a standard &quot;information-only&quot; version of the series that
      includes only modeling and demonstration of target parenting skills, (b) receive an enhanced
      &quot;behavior activation&quot; version of the series designed to actively promote parental behavior
      change, through elements addressing attributions, self-efficacy and expectancies, social
      support, and emotional reactivity, or (c) a waitlist control group. Measures of parents'
      parenting practices, cognitions, affect, and social support, and children's disruptive
      behavior problems, will be obtained at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up.
      The relative efficacy of the standard and enhanced versions of the Triple P Media Series in
      improving these outcomes will be examined, as well as moderators of these effects, such as
      baseline level of behavior problems and parental stress. This study will further our
      understanding of the potential value of television programming for improving parenting
      practices.
