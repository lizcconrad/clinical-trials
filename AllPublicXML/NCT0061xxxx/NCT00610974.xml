    <textblock>
      The research proposed here will determine the effect of a novel treadmill gait training
      strategy using a robotic gait trainer (the Lokomat) on functional ambulation in people with
      SCI. The effect of the new therapy will be evaluated by analyzing changes in functional
      ambulation and gait patterns during walking.

      Community-dwelling individuals with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury will be recruited. In
      total, 20 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of 2 types of
      body-weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) with the Lokomat, which differ only in the
      level of assistance that the Lokomat provides to the leg movements while walking. Therapy for
      both groups will take place 3 times/week for 12 weeks. During each session, participants will
      first complete a 10-minute warm-up period followed by 45 minutes of the assigned therapy.
      Rest breaks will be provided as needed, but participants should complete 45 minutes of
      walking per session.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. motor-incomplete SCI due to non-progressive lesion (e.g. trauma, ischemia) at least 12
             months ago

          2. 19 to 65 years of age

          3. use of standing or walking as part of typical activities of daily living

          4. controlled spasticity (stable administration of anti-spasticity medication) for the
             duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             contra-indicated

          5. existing skin irritation or open wounds/sores in lower extremity areas in contact with
             the leg cuffs of the Lokomat or body weight support harness
