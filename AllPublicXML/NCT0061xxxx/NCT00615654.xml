      Objective: To investigate whether patients undergoing aquatic physiotherapy in groups improve
      their functional capacity, by means of the distance covered in the six-minute walk test
      (6WT), and to compare this with a control group. Methods: Forty women that had not been
      practicing regular physical activity for one year were randomly allocated either to the Study
      Group (SG) to undergo an aquatic physiotherapy program in groups applied twice a week,
      including aerobic exercises, muscle strengthening and relaxation for 12 weeks, or to the
      Control Group (CG), which did not do any physical activity. Both groups maintained their
      treatment with medications. All patients underwent two evaluations: one at the start and the
      other after 12 weeks.

    <description>The aquatic physiotherapy program for the SG was applied twice a week, in groups of six to seven people, with sessions lasting 40 minutes, over a 12-week period. The Control Group protocol included maintenance of the individuals' medication therapy and absence of any physical activity during the study period.</description>
