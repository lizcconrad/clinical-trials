      Primary Objective to estimate 6-month progression free survival probability of patients with
      recurrent malignant glioma treated with Etoposide + Bevacizumab.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate safety &amp; tolerability of Etoposide + Bevacizumab among
      patients with recurrent malignant glioma (RMG).

      To evaluate radiographic response, progression free survival &amp; overall survival of patients
      with recurrent malignant glioma treated with Etoposide + Bevacizumab.

      Exploratory, single-arm, ph II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of combinatorial
      regimen consisting of Etoposide + Bevacizumab among patients with RMG. Primary endpoint of
      study is probability of progression-free survival at 6 months. Important secondary objective
      is to further assess safety of Etoposide &amp; Bevacizumab for patients with recurrent malignant
      glioma.

      If study demonstrates that combinatorial regimen of Etoposide + Bevacizumab is associated
      with encouraging anti-tumor activity among patients with RMG, further assessment of regimen
      in additional phase II &amp; possibly phase III studies, will be considered.

    <description>Percentage of participants surviving six months from the start of study treatment without progression of disease. PFS was defined as the time from the date of study treatment initiation to the date of the first documented progression. Progression was defined as greater than or equal to a 25% increase in the product of the largest perpendicular diameters of any enhancing lesion or any new enhancing tumor on MRI scans.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with complete or partial response as determined by the following criteria: complete response was defined as complete disappearance on MR/CT of all enhancing tumor and mass effect, off all corticosteroids (or receiving only adrenal replacement doses), accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination; partial response was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in tumor size on MR/CT by bi-dimensional measurement, on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids, accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination. A confirmation of response was not required.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with complete or partial response as determined by the following criteria: complete response was defined as complete disappearance on MR/CT of all enhancing tumor and mass effect, off all corticosteroids (or receiving only adrenal replacement doses), accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination; partial response was defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in tumor size on MR/CT by bi-dimensional measurement, on a stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids, accompanied by a stable or improving neurologic examination. A confirmation of response was not required.</description>
