        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean 24-hour Average Pain Intensity (API) Score at the End of Maintenance Treatment (EOMT) Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) Data</title>
        <description>Baseline and EOMT values are the calculated means of the daily 24-hour API scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization (Baseline) and the earliest date of Week 13 visit/Withdrawal visit/last dose of study drug (EOMT). Participants used a hand-held diary to rate their average pain intensity over the preceding 24 hours, using an 11-point PI-Numerical Rating Scale (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). LOCF was used if less than 4 days of diary data were provided. Change from baseline was calculated as EOMT score minus Baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Current Morning Pain Intensity Score at EOMT Using LOCF Data</title>
        <description>Current pain is defined as the participant's assessment of pain intensity &quot;right now.&quot; Participants recorded their current morning pain intensity in the morning upon wakening using an 11-point PI-NRS (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Baseline and EOMT are as defined for the primary endpoint. Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the baseline score. An ANCOVA model with baseline value, BMI, grouped center as covariates was used.</description>

Baseline and EOMT are as defined for the primary endpoint. Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the baseline score. An ANCOVA model with baseline value, BMI, grouped center as covariates was used.</description>
          <population>ITT Population. There was one participant in the GEn 1200 mg group and two in the 2400 mg group who did not complete enough post-baseline evening diaries to calculate a score for the EMOT timepoint.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dynamic Allodynia at EOMT Using LOCF Data</title>
        <description>Dynamic allodynia (pain in response to a standardized light touch stimulus, a foam brush applied with light pressure to the site of maximum pain) was assessed by an 11-point PI-NRS (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Baseline and EOMT are as defined for the primary endpoint. Change from baseline was calculated as the EOMT score minus the baseline score. An ANCOVA model with baseline value, BMI, grouped center as covariates was used.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving Various Levels of Percent Reduction From Baseline in the Mean 24-hour Average Pain Intensity Score at EOMT Using LOCF Data</title>
        <description>Baseline and EOMT scores are the calculated means of the 24-hour average pain scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization and EOMT, respectively. Percent reduction from baseline was calculated as the [(EOMT score minus the baseline score)divided by the baseline score], multiplied by 100. The PI-NRS is an 11-point scale (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine) by which a participant assesses their 24-hour average pain intensity.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset of Sustained Improvement in the 24-hour Average Pain Intensity Score</title>
        <description>Sustained improvement in the 24-hour average pain intensity score is defined as at least 2 consecutive days on which the 24-hour average pain intensity score is &gt;=2 points less than the mean 24-hour average pain intensity score at baseline. Time to onset is measured from baseline and was calculated as the first day of event minus the last day of baseline and is expressed in days. Baseline score is the calculated mean of the 24-hour average pain score for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization.</description>
