      Objectives:

      To define role of O6-Benzylguanine (BG) in restoring Temodar (temozolomide) sensitivity in
      patients with Temodar-resistant malignant glioma.

      To further define toxicity of combo therapy using Temodar + BG.

      2 separate strata accrued independently of each other: Stratum 1-patients with Glioblastoma
      Multiforme (GBM). Stratum 2-patients with Anaplastic Glioma [anaplastic astrocytoma (AA),
      anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed (AA and AO)] .

      BG at 120mg/m2 administered intravenously over 1 hour followed immediately by 48-hour
      infusion at 30mg/m2/24hrs. Temozolomide 472mg/m2 administered orally, in fasting state,
      within 60 minutes of end of the 1-hour administration of BG infusion. Treatment cycles may be
      repeated every 28 days following dose of Temodar from previous cycle.

      Temodar has been well tolerated by both adults and children with most common toxicity being
      mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea and vomiting,
      constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain,
      diarrhea, lethargy, hepatotoxicity, anorexia, fatigue and hyperglycemia. Hypersensitivity
      reactions have not yet been noted with Temodar. As in the case with many anti-cancer drugs,
      Temodar may be carcinogenic. BG toxicities include agitation, lethargy, nausea, vomiting,
      rapid heart rate, elevated liver functions, &amp; leukemia; but, not with BG as single agent.
      Transient lymphopenia has been seen with BG as single agent.

    <description>Objectives of study are to define role of BG in restoring Temodar sensitivity in patients with Temodar-resistant malignant glioma and to further define the toxicity of combination therapy using Temodar + BG. 2 separate strata accrued independently of each other: Stratum 1-patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Stratum 2-patients with anaplastic glioma (AG).
BG at 120mg/m2 administered intravenously over 1 hour followed immediately by 48-hour infusion at 30mg/m2/24 hours.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients have recurrent/progressive Malignant Glioma (MG). Stereotactic biopsy at time
             of recurrence/progression is only required if radiation-induced necrosis is suspected

          -  Patients have MG resistant to Temodar, which is defined as &gt; or = to 25 percent
             increase in tumor growth on contrast enhanced MRI/CT within 8 weeks of last dose of
             Temodar

          -  Age &gt; or = to 18 years

          -  Evidence of measurable enhancing disease on contrast-enhanced MRI, unless medically
             contraindicated.

          -  Interval of at least 2 weeks between prior surgical resection/ 4 weeks between prior
             radiotherapy/chemotherapy, and enrollment on protocol unless there is unequivocal
             evidence of tumor progression. However, patients treated with chemotherapy agents such
             as VP-16 who would normally be retreated after shorter intervals may be treated at
             usual starting time even if less than 4 weeks from last prior dose of chemotherapy

          -  Karnofsky performance score &gt; or = to 60 percent

          -  Hematocrit &gt; 29 percent, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,500 cells/microliter,
             platelets &gt; 100,000 cells/microliter

             Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) &amp; bilirubin &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  For patients on corticosteroids, they must have been on stable dose for 1 week prior
             to entry, if clinically possible, and dose should not be escalated over entry dose
             level

          -  Signed informed consent approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to patient
             entry
