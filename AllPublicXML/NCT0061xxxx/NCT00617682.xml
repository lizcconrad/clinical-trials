      The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether immunization with 9-valent
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PNCRM9) during the third trimester of pregnancy interferes
      with active antibody production in offspring immunized with PNCRM7 (Prevnar) in the first six
      months of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There were 24.5 million physician visits for otitis media (OM) in 1990 with estimated
      treatment and indirect costs of $5 billion. Because of its major public health impact and the
      troubling increase in antibiotic resistant organisms, vaccine strategies to prevent OM are
      being tested. We previously proposed an efficacy study to determine if immunization with
      pneumococcal vaccine during pregnancy protects offspring against early infant OM, which is an
      important predictor for recurrent and chronic OM. Recent data from an efficacy trial in
      California demonstrated that infants immunized with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      (PNCRM7) at 2, 4, 6 and 12 - 15 months were protected against invasive pneumococcal disease
      after 7 months of age. Since licensure of this vaccine, questions have been raised about
      whether maternal immunization with a pneumococcal vaccine during pregnancy suppresses active
      antibody production in offspring who are immunized with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine (PNCRM7). The main objective of this study is to investigate that question. We will
      also evaluate vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and fetal antibody transfer among women who
      receive 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PNCRM9) at 30 - 35 weeks of pregnancy,
      determine persistence of maternal and infant antibody 13 months after birth, evaluate opsonic
      activity of maternal and infant antibody, and determine the relationship between breast milk
      and serum antibody in lactating women.

          -  Plans to continue HealthPartners insurance coverage until infant is 13 mos old; mother
             and child will receive care in staff model clinic participating in the study, and
             obstetric care will be provided by a HP obstetrician/CNM with delivery at affiliated
             hospital.

          -  Plans to reside in Twin Cities metro area until infant is 13 mos old.

          -  Has a residence phone and a back-up phone contact.

             and cytotoxic agents), a genetic defect, HIV infection, or other causes that may
             reduce antibody response to active immunization.

          -  Vaccination may be delayed because of a current or recent febrile illness depending
             largely on the severity of the symptoms and their etiology. Although a severe or even
             a moderate febrile illness is sufficient reason to postpone vaccinations, minor
             illnesses, such as a mild upper respiratory infection with or without low-grade fever,
             are not generally contraindications.
