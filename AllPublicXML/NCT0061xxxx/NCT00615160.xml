      To evaluate the efficacy of PTK-ZK on metastatic melanoma either as a single agent treatment
      or in combination with standard chemotherapy according to RECIST criteria. Further to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of PTK-ZK in patients with metastatic melanoma either as
      a single agent treatment or in combination with standard chemotherapy

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase II study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of PTK-ZK in the treatment of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma
      who do not qualify for surgical resection:

        -  progressive locoregionary disease not to be controlled by surgical measures

        -  distant metastasis other than brain metastasis not eligible for surgical resection or
           radiotherapy All patients will be treated with PTK-ZK 1250mg administered orally once a
           day for treatment cycles of 28 days. In case of unacceptable toxicity the dose can be
           reduced to 1000 mg and further on to 750 mg daily.

      Patients in Arm B additionally receive intravenous DTIC 850mg/m² on day 1 of each cycle.

      After informed consent is given by the patient a biopsy from a metastasis should be taken
      before the first intake of study medication and at the end of cycle 2 to specify markers of
      angiogenesis and MVD (Micro vessel density).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed nonresectable metastatic melanoma Stage III or IV (AJCC 2002)
             including patients with unknown primary melanoma,

          -  Progressive disease, defined as an increase of tumour volume according to RECIST
             criteria, within the last 6 months,

          -  Fulfilling the minimum RECIST requirements for evaluation of tumor response,

          -  At least two cutaneous or soft tissue lesions that can be biopsised prior to and after
             treatment, respectively,

          -  Able to undergo either contrast-enhanced CT scan or contrast-enhanced MRI scan for
             tumor assessment,

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months,

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2,

             medication

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of PTK/ZK (i.e., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea,
             vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, bowel obstruction, or inability to swallow
             the tablets).
