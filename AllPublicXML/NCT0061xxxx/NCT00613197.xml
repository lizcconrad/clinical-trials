    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of EpanovaTM Soft Gelatin
      Capsules at a total daily dose of 4g (4x 1g capsules) to maintain remission (Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index CDAI &lt; 150) in CD patients in whom remission, stable for at least three months
      and no longer than one year, has been induced by corticosteroids, azathioprine/6-MP,
      methotrexate, 5-ASA or antibiotics.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the:

      efficacy of Epanova versus placebo by Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Investigator and
      Subject Global Ratings, employment status and use of CD related medical visits in subjects
      with CD in remission

      safety and tolerability of Epanova

      ability of Epanova to maintain the quality of life of CD patients in remission

             followed

          2. Diagnosis of Crohn's disease confirmed by radiological studies or endoscopy or
             surgical pathology within 36 months prior to randomisation

          3. In remission for at least 3 months, but no longer than 12 months; remission being
             defined as meeting both of the two conditions: (1) clinically in remission with a CDAI
             of less than 150 and (2) off steroids and/or immunosuppressants for at least 3 months,
             if remission had been induced with such medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Intolerance of omega-3 fatty acids or known allergy to fish or fish products

          2. Ongoing CD therapy with: 5-ASA compounds, steroids, immune modifiers, systemic
             antibiotics, tube feeding, defined formula diets or parenteral nutrition

          3. In 3 months prior to randomisation received: systemic steroid therapy, azathioprine,
             6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, probiotic products or preparations
             containing fish oil

             the surgery)
