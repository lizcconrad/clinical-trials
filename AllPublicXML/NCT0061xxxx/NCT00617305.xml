      To evaluate the change from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and other
      hemodynamic parameters, following the addition of ambrisentan to background phosphodiesterase
      type-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) therapy in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who
      have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to PDE-5i monotherapy.

      The study was originally designed as a 2-arm, double-blind, randomized study in which
      patients received ambrisentan or placebo for 24 weeks, and then received ambrisentan blinded
      to dose for 24 weeks. With Protocol Amendment 2 (12 June, 2009), the study was switched to
      single-arm, open-label treatment, and all patients remaining in the placebo arm were switched
      to open-label ambrisentan treatment. Patients who enrolled after Amendment 2 all received
      open-label ambrisentan.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change from baseline in pulmonary
      vascular resistance (PVR), and other hemodynamic parameters, following the addition of
      ambrisentan to background phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i) therapy in subjects
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to
      PDE-5i monotherapy.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the change from baseline in other
      clinical measures of PAH following the addition of ambrisentan to background PDE-5i therapy
      in subjects with PAH who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to PDE-5i monotherapy.

      The safety and tolerability of ambrisentan/PDE-5i combination therapy will be evaluated
      throughout the study. In addition, long-term efficacy will be examined.

    <description>The primary analysis of this secondary outcome measure is mean change from Baseline to Week 24. The changes from Baseline to Weeks 4, 12, 36, and 48 were also evaluated.

    <description>The primary analysis of this secondary outcome measure is mean change from Baseline to Week 24. The changes from Baseline to Weeks 12, 36, and 48 were also evaluated. Lower scores and decreases from baseline represent improved functioning and QOL. The CAMPHOR survey was not assessed at Week 4. The total CAMPHOR score scale ranges from 0 (good) to 25 (poor). A reduction in score over time represents improvement in this patient population.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis of this secondary outcome measure is change from Baseline to Week 24. The changes from Baseline to Weeks 4, 12, 36, and 48 were also evaluated. WHO categories are 1 to 4 with the worst category being 4. Improvement is represented by a change in category to a lower number (for example, change from category 3 to 2), and deterioration is represented by a change in category to a higher number (for example, change from category 2 to 4). No change is represented by no change in category (for example, category 2 which remains 2).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were enrolled in 16 study sites in the US. The first patient was screened on 09 April 2008, and the last patient was enrolled on 28 July 2010. The last patient observation was on 25 July 2011. Originally a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, it was changed to open label on 12 June 2009 due to slow enrollment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>65 patients were screened; 8 were randomized (3 to ambrisentan and 5 to placebo) prior to study conversion to open label. The remaining patients were assigned to ambrisentan treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR), Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change from baseline in PVR, and other hemodynamic parameters, following the addition of ambrisentan to background PDE-5i therapy in subjects with PAH who have demonstrated a sub-optimal response to PDE-5i monotherapy. A decrease in measurement value (dynes sec/cm^5) indicates improvement for this patient population.</description>

        <description>The primary analysis of this secondary outcome measure is mean change from Baseline to Week 24. The changes from Baseline to Weeks 4, 12, 36, and 48 were also evaluated. The dyspnea index measures the degree of breathlessness after completion of the 6MWT using a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no breathlessness and 10 indicating maximum breathlessness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) Quality of Life (QOL) Survey Overall Score Measured at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 (LOCF)</title>
        <description>The primary analysis of this secondary outcome measure is mean change from Baseline to Week 24. The changes from Baseline to Weeks 12, 36, and 48 were also evaluated. Lower scores and decreases from baseline represent improved functioning and QOL. The CAMPHOR survey was not assessed at Week 4. The total CAMPHOR score scale ranges from 0 (good) to 25 (poor). A reduction in score over time represents improvement in this patient population.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class (LOCF) Measured at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48.</title>
        <description>The primary analysis of this secondary outcome measure is change from Baseline to Week 24. The changes from Baseline to Weeks 4, 12, 36, and 48 were also evaluated. WHO categories are 1 to 4 with the worst category being 4. Improvement is represented by a change in category to a lower number (for example, change from category 3 to 2), and deterioration is represented by a change in category to a higher number (for example, change from category 2 to 4). No change is represented by no change in category (for example, category 2 which remains 2).</description>

        <description>The time to clinical worsening was defined as the time from enrollment to the first occurrence of death, lung transplantation, hospitalization for PAH, atrial septostomy, or initiation of chronic parenteral prostanoid therapy. Results are presented as the Kaplan-Meier estimate (% probability) of having clinical worsening after a given time.</description>
