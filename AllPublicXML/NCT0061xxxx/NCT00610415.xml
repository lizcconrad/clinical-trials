        Inclusion Criteria:1. Patients with malignant tumors seen at the Stanford University Cancer
        Center. Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and will
        have been seen in the Stanford Head and Neck Oncology Program. A decision to undergo
        surgery at Stanford will have been made, prior to recruiting patients for the study, and
        prior to obtaining the samples during surgery. (Histological confirmation of the diagnosis
        need not be made prior to obtaining consent.) 2. A definitive resection of a malignant
        tumor is planned. 3. Surgeon judgment that the definitive procedure will not be compromised
        by including

          -  FNA

          -  Core needle biopsy

          -  Cup forceps or punch biopsy of&lt;4mm. 4. Informed consent documented prior to procedure
