      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pretreatment with atorvastatin protects
      against atrial fibrillation following off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery is the most common arrhythmic complication that may
      increase incidence of congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and stroke, which
      increase the length of hospital stay, the rates of re-hospitalization, and cost of care. Its
      pathogenesis is multifactorial, and its prevention and management remain suboptimal.
      Recently, observational evidence has suggested that patients who have undergone previous
      statin therapy have a lower incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pretreatment with atorvastatin protects
      against atrial fibrillation following off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
