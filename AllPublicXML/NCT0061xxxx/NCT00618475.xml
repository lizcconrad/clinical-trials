  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is second in frequency only to hypertension as a comorbid condition for End Stage
      Renal Disease (ESRD) patients. The presence of depression has been linked to lower quality of
      life, more medical comorbidities and shorter lifespan. This project represents the first
      known attempt at a standardized intervention for depression in ethnically diverse ESRD
      patients. The study will be conducted at the Parkside Center for Dialysis. Patients will be
      randomly selected for screening until 80 subjects meet entry criteria and agree to be
      randomized. Once subjects are screened and enrolled in the study they are randomly assigned
      to either a treatment or wait-list control condition. After 3 months, the intervention will
      be completed and both groups will be reassessed. After an additional 3 months, both groups
      will have received the intervention and pre and post measures for both groups will be
      available as well as 3 month follow-up for the 1st intervention group.

      The following measures will be collected: to obtain a full DSM-IV diagnosis the SCID I and
      SCID II will be utilized. The BDI will provide a self-report measure of depression. The
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a measure designed specifically for medically
      ill patients, will also be administered. Additionally, the Young Schema Questionnaire, a
      measure which seeks to identify maladaptive (both depressive and anxious) cognitive styles,
      will be administered. A quality of life measure designed specifically for dialysis patients
      (KDQOL-SF) will also be given as a means of measuring patient's overall coping and
      functioning. To better understand the patient's perceptions of their health and illness the
      Illness Effects Questionnaire will be administered. A demographic information sheet will be
      completed by the subject in which personal, ethnic, and illness information is collected.
      Detailed information about the subject's mental health history and treatment as well as
      current medications will be gathered. Data from routine dialysis laboratories (hemoglobin,
      creatinine, albumin, Kt/V) will be extracted from the chart.

      The intervention will take place in individual format while the subjects are being dialyzed.
      The intervention will be 10 sixty minute -long weekly sessions spread over not more than 3
      months. It will include both cognitive and behavioral skills focused on alleviating
      depressive affect and identifying maladaptive patterns of thought and behavior. This study
      would lay the groundwork for future clinical research by helping to develop a culturally
      competent clinical intervention and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of adapting
      psychosocial intervention for a medically complex culturally diverse population.
