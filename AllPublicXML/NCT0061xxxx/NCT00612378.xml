      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the acute ability of GFX to reduce
      glabellar furrowing.

      Patients who have presented to the investigator for correction of glabellar furrows, as
      classified per the Rated Numeric Kinetic Line Scale Score for Facial Wrinkles Secondary to
      Hyperkinetic Function (Note: Class 1 or Higher)7 (Appendix N) are candidates for this study.
      All patients must consent to the procedure and agree to complete their post treatment
      evaluation visit.
