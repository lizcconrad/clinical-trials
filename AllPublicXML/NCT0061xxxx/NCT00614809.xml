  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized open-label uncontrolled phase II trial evaluating efficacy and
      toxicity of gefitinib in patients with asymptomatic advanced NSCLC who was benefitted by
      first line chemotherapy. Patients with stage IV NSCLC who have one or more asymptomatic brain
      metastasis who was benefitted by first line chemotherapy will receive oral gefitinib 250mg
      once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. These patients' direct DNA
      sequencing of tumor tissue EGFR exons 18-21 will be analyzed The response was evaluated by
      RECIST criteria after the patient received gefitinib 6 weeks.If the patients present with
      progress disease of brain metastasis after the therapy of gefitinib, the patients will
      receive irradiation of brain metastasis.If the response is stable disease,partial response or
      complete response,he will be examined by brain MRI every 12 weeks.
