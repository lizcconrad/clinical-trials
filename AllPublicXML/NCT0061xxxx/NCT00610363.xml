  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a clinical research study to determine the safety and effectiveness of an
      experimental drug called rilonacept in participants with gout who were beginning another
      additional treatment. Participants participated in this study for approximately 24 weeks.
      Rilonacept was being studied for use in preventing gout attacks in participants who had gout.

    <description>A gout flare was defined as participant reported acute articular pain typical of a gout attack that required treatment with an anti-inflammatory therapeutic: had at least 3 of the following 4 signs or symptoms: joint swelling, tenderness, redness, and pain and with at least 1 of the following: rapid onset of pain, decreased range of motion, joint warmth or other symptoms similar to a prior gout flare. Number of gout flares per participant was reported for this outcome measure. For drop-outs, only flares occurred before Day 84 were counted, regardless whether the flares occurred during the treatment period or not.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) to Day 84 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to complete a telephone diary by calling the IVRS daily beginning at the baseline visit (Day 1) through the follow-up visit (Day 154) and reported their general well-being, gout symptoms, and weekly study drug administrations. At the onset of pain from a gout flare, participants were to answer additional diary questions regarding their gout flare and had to continue daily flare assessments until they reported the flare had ended. If a flare occurred just prior to the follow-up visit (Day 154), participants were to continue completing the daily diary until the flare resolved. Gout flare pain was assessed on a scale from 0 to 10 (with 0=no pain and 10=severe pain) within the past 24 hours.</description>

          <description>Gout flare was defined as acute articular pain typical of a gout attack that required treatment with an anti-inflammatory therapeutic: had at least 3 of the following 4 signs or symptoms: joint swelling, tenderness, redness, and pain; and with at least 1 of the following: rapid onset of pain, decreased range of motion, joint warmth or other symptoms similar to a prior gout flare.

        <description>Participants were asked to complete a telephone diary by calling the IVRS daily beginning at the baseline visit (Day 1) through the follow-up visit (Day 154) and reported their general well-being, gout symptoms, and weekly study drug administrations. At the onset of pain from a gout flare, participants were to answer additional diary questions regarding their gout flare and had to continue daily flare assessments until they reported the flare had ended. If a flare occurred just prior to the follow-up visit (Day 154), participants were to continue completing the daily diary until the flare resolved. Gout flare pain was assessed on a scale from 0 to 10 (with 0=no pain and 10=severe pain) within the past 24 hours.</description>
