    <textblock>
      The primary goals of this exploratory/developmental (R21) study are to evaluate the
      feasibility and acceptability of a MBSR intervention for caregivers of patients with
      dementia, and to estimate the effectiveness of program outcomes on standardized measures of
      perceived stress, psychological distress and caregiver burden. We will randomize 60
      caregivers 1:1 to participate in: 1.) an intervention arm consisting of a MBSR program that
      includes 8 weeks of group instruction in mindfulness meditation techniques followed by home
      practice, or 2.) an active control arm consisting of a standard 8 week Community Caregiver
      Education and Support (CESS) program.

      We anticipate that caregivers will be interested in participating in the intervention, be
      open to randomization, and have good rates of compliance with the program. It is also
      expected that MBSR program participants will evidence a trend toward better outcomes than
      CESS participants on primary outcome measures of perceived stress, psychological distress and
      perceived caregiver burden.

      Substudy The purpose of this proposal is to add a physiologic outcome sub-study to the
      Balance project that will examine four biological markers correlated with stress in
      caregivers participating in the study intervention. The Balance Study is a recently funded
      NIH randomized controlled pilot study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention for caregivers of patients with
      dementia. Balance is randomizing caregivers (N=60) into equal numbers to participate in
      either an intervention arm consisting of a MBSR program that includes eight weeks of group
      instruction in mindfulness meditation techniques followed by home practice or an active
      control arm consisting of a standard eight week community Caregiver Education and Social
      Support (CESS) program. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the feasibility
      of adding physiologic markers to the Balance Study; 2) examine changes over time in
      individual study participants on four biological markers correlated with stress including
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), D-dimer, DHEA-S and telomere length; and 3) to examine preliminary
      differences between MBSR and CESS groups on four biological markers. The addition of
      physiologic outcomes to the Balance Study presents an emerging opportunity to increase the
      competitiveness for our NIH R01 application.
