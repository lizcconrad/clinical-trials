      The purpose of this study is to look for an improvement in progression free survival with the
      combination of bevacizumab, carboplatin and pemetrexed in patients with newly diagnosed
      advanced/metastatic non small cell lung cancer. Overall survival and safety will also be
      assessed.

      Carboplatin: AUC 5 IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 Pemetrexed: 500mg/M2 IV over 10 minutes on
      day 1 Bevacizumab: 15mg/kg IV over 90 minutes on day 1 (if rate is tolerated the 2nd dose may
      be decreased to 60 minutes and subsequent doses to 30 minutes This regimen will be
      administered every 6 weeks for up to a maximum of 6 cycles if the patient tolerates the
      treatment and has stable disease. Bevacizumab will be continues if tolerated for up to 1 year
      at every 3 week intervals.

      Folic acid 1mg by mouth daily, Vitamin B12 1000 ug IM every 9 weeks and Dexamethasone 4mg by
      mouth twice a day and and antiemetic may be prescribed by the physician investigator to help
      reduce side effects associated with the Pemetrexed. The Folic acid and Vitamin B12 will
      continue until 3 weeks after the end of treatment.

      Physical exams, vital signs and blood work will be done prior to each chemotherapy cycle. A
      urine dipstick to check for protein in the urine will be done prior to the first treatment
      and before cycles 3 and 5. A CAT scan of the chest will be done pretreatment, prior to cycles
      3 and 5 and at the end of treatment.
