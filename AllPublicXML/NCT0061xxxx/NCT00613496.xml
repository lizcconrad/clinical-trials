  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental data suggest that angiotensin II-antagonists reduce the atrial expression of
      prothrombotic adhesion molecules and oxidative stress parameters. The present study is
      designed to investigate the effects on angiotensin II-antagonist irbesartan to reduce the
      amounts of circulating oxidative stress markers and adhesion molecules in patients with
      persistent atrial fibrillation.

      Primary Objective:

      The aim of the study is to assess that blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor reduces
      systemic levels of oxidative stress markers and adhesion molecules by more than 25% compared
      to placebo in patients with persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation.

      Primary Target Parameter:

      The primary target parameter is defined as reduction of systemic levels of oxidative stress
      markers and adhesion molecules (hsCRP, ICAM, VCAM, MCP-1, vWF, TGFβ1, TNF-α, Interleukin-6,
      8isoProstaglandinF2α)

      Secondary Target Parameter:

      The secondary Target Parameters are defined as number of cerebrovascular events, number of
      intermediate medical visits for cardiovascular reasons without hospitalisation, number of
      hospitalisations for cardiovascular reasons and GFR.
