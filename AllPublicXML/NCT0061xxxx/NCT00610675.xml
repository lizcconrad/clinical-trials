    <textblock>
      This trial is a 52-week, open-label extension trial to investigate safety and to explore
      efficacy of Org 50081 (Esmirtazapine) in participants who completed Protocol 176001 (P05706)
      (NCT00482612) or 176002 (P05707) (NCT00506389). Participants who have completed Protocol
      P05706 or P05707, and are willing to continue treatment with Esmirtazapine, can participate
      in Protocol 176004 (P05708) after signing informed consent.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward occurrence in a participant who is administered any pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not it is related to the IMP.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Sleep Time at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Total Sleep Time (TST) is a subjective time recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary in response to the question &quot;How much time did you actually spend sleeping?&quot;. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged. Missing values were imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, where the last available assessments prior to the scheduled observation were averaged.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sleep Latency at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep Latency (SL) is the time from when the participant went to bed up to the the time the participant actually fell asleep, recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged. Missing values were imputed by the LOCF method, where the last available assessments prior to the scheduled observation were averaged.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Wake Time After Sleep Onset at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Wake time after sleep onset (WASO) is, if the planned waking time is on or after the time of final awakening, as follows: total time from falling asleep to the time of planned wake up minus the total sleep time. If the planned waking time is before the time of final awakening then WASO is as follows: total time from falling asleep to the time of actual final awakening minus the total sleep time. All times were recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged. Missing values were imputed by the LOCF method, where the last available assessments prior to the scheduled observation were averaged.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Awakenings at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Number of awakenings is a subjective number recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged. Missing values were imputed by the LOCF method, where the last available assessments prior to the scheduled observation were averaged.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Sleep Scale at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Sleep is a subjective number on a Visual Analog Scale recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary. The scale ranges from 0 to 100, where very poor is rated at 0, up to excellent, rated at 100. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged. Missing values were imputed by the LOCF method, where the last available assessments prior to the scheduled observation were averaged.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Satisfaction With Sleep Duration Scale at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with Sleep Duration is a subjective number on a Visual Analog Scale recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary. The scale ranges from 0 to 100, where very unsatisfied is rated at 0, up to fully satisfied, rated at 100. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged. Missing values were imputed by the LOCF method, where the last available assessments prior to the scheduled observation were averaged.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward occurrence in a participant who is administered any pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not it is related to the IMP.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Sleep Time at Week 52</title>
        <description>Total Sleep Time (TST) is a subjective time recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary in response to the question &quot;How much time did you actually spend sleeping?&quot;. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged. Missing values were imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, where the last available assessments prior to the scheduled observation were averaged.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Wake Time After Sleep Onset at Week 52</title>
        <description>Wake time after sleep onset (WASO) is, if the planned waking time is on or after the time of final awakening, as follows: total time from falling asleep to the time of planned wake up minus the total sleep time. If the planned waking time is before the time of final awakening then WASO is as follows: total time from falling asleep to the time of actual final awakening minus the total sleep time. All times were recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged.

The scale ranges from 0 to 100, where very unsatisfied is rated at 0, up to fully satisfied, rated at 100. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707. Data at baseline and at week 52 were collected every morning and evening for 7 consecutive days, and these data were then averaged. Missing values were imputed by the LOCF method, where the last available assessments prior to the scheduled observation were averaged.</description>

          <description>Satisfaction with Sleep Duration is a subjective number on a Visual Analog Scale recorded by the participant in an electronic sleep diary. The scale ranges from 0 to 100, where very unsatisfied is rated at 0, up to fully satisfied, rated at 100. Baseline values were calculated by averaging baseline values from base trials P05706 and P05707.
