      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      capecitabine, erlotinib hydrochloride, and bevacizumab that can be given in combination with
      radiation to patients with pancreatic cancer.

      The Study Drugs:

      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the
      growth of blood vessels.

      Capecitabine and erlotinib hydrochloride are designed to interfere with the growth of cancer
      cells.

      Study Drug Dose Level:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will begin receiving
      capecitabine, erlotinib hydrochloride, and bevacizumab. The dose you receive will be based on
      how many participants have been enrolled before you, and on the safety data that are
      available. The first group of enrolled participants will be given low doses of capecitabine,
      erlotinib hydrochloride, and bevacizumab. If no intolerable side effects occur, the next
      group will be enrolled at a higher dose level. This process will continue until researchers
      find the highest dose of capecitabine, erlotinib hydrochloride, and bevacizumab that can be
      given without intolerable side effects occurring. The study doctor will tell you what dose
      you will be receiving and how it compares to the doses other participants have received.

      Study Drug Administration:

      On Days 1, 14, and 28, you will receive bevacizumab through a needle in your vein. Your first
      infusion will last about 90 minutes. If you tolerate the drug well, the next infusion will
      last about 60 minutes. If the 60-minute infusion is well tolerated, all other infusions will
      last about 30 minutes.

      On each day that you receive radiation, you will take capecitabine and erlotinib
      hydrochloride by mouth in the morning and evening with food.

      Radiation:

      You will receive radiation once a day on Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. This
      schedule will be continue for 5 1/2 weeks or 28 doses.

      Study Visits:

      Every week while you are on study, you will have the following tests and procedures
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing.

        -  You will repeat the same health questionnaire that you filled out at screening.

      Bevacizumab and Surgery:

      If at any time during the study the tumor can be removed surgically, you will have surgery. A
      separate consent form would be used. Because bevacizumab may slow the healing of wounds,
      study participants may not have surgery within 10 weeks after the last bevacizumab infusion.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain on study for up to 5 1/2 weeks. You will be taken off-study early if the
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      End-Of-Study Visit:

      Four (4) to 6 weeks after you finish radiation, you will have an end-of-study visit with the
      following tests and procedures performed:

        -  You will have a complete physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have chest x-rays and CT scans of the abdomen.

        -  You will repeat the health questionnaire.

      Additional Experimental Therapy:

      If you appear to be benefitting from the experimental therapy, the study doctor may decide to
      continue your experimental therapy after the end-of-study visit. This would be daily
      erlotinib hydrochloride, with bevacizumab infusions every 2 weeks unless the disease gets
      worse or intolerable side effects occur. You would have study visits once a month, with the
      same procedures as you did during the weekly study visits (except for the questionnaires).

      This is an investigational study. Capecitabine, bevacizumab, and erlotinib hydrochloride are
      FDA approved and commercially available. The use of capecitabine and bevacizumab for
      pancreatic cancer and in combination with erlotinib hydrochloride is investigational. At this
      time, the 3-drug combination is being used in research only.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

    <description>Complete response (CR) — complete disappearance of clinical evidence of a tumor. Partial response (PR) — 50% or greater decrease in sum of products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measured lesions compared to baseline. Stable disease (SD) — no significant change in disease status. Progressive disease (PD) — a 25% increase in the area of malignant lesions &gt;2 cm2 or in sum of products of the longest perpendicular diameters of individual lesions in a given organ site. If only one lesion is available for measurement, a 50% increase in the size if the area of the lesion was 2 cm2. The appearance of new lesions will also constitute progressive disease. Comparisons of tumor size made with previous smallest measurement in patients who have attained a partial response or with baseline measurements in patients with stable disease. Tumor progression also defined as significant clinical deterioration that cannot be attributed to treatment or other medical conditions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          2. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years of age. There will be no upper age restriction.

          3. Cytologic or histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients can have
             tumor originating in any part of the pancreas. Islet cell tumors are not eligible.
             Only patients with non- metastatic, unresectable disease are eligible. Patients who
             cannot undergo resection because of underlying medical problems are also eligible.
             Patients with regional nodal disease are eligible.

          4. All patients must be staged with a physical exam, CXR, and contrast-enhanced helical
             thin-cut abdominal CT. Unresectability is defined by CT criteria: a) evidence of tumor
             extension to the celiac axis or superior mesenteric (SM) artery, or b) evidence on
             either CT or angiogram of occlusion of the SM vein or SM/ portal vein confluence. If a
             tumor does not meet this definition and is found to be unresectable at surgical
             exploration, then that tumor is considered unresectable.

          5. Patients may have received prior chemotherapy but not prior radiation therapy to the
             upper abdomen.

          6. Bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,500/ul. Platelets
             &gt;100,000/ul.

          7. Hepatic function: Total bilirubin less than 5mg/dL. If the patient required an
             endobiliary stent, the bilirubin level must have declined on consecutive measurements
             indicating adequate biliary decompression; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 5 times
             the upper limit of normal.

          8. Renal function: BUN &lt;/= 30 mg%, creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 mg% and creatinine clearance &gt;/=
             30ml/min (estimated as calculated with Cockcroft-Gault equation). Note: In patients
             with moderate renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) at
             baseline, a dose reduction to 75% of the capecitabine starting dose is recommended.

          9. Patients must have signed informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of the study, and are aware that participation is voluntary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior abdominal radiotherapy.

          2. Imaging (CT or MRI) or endoscopic evidence of direct duodenal invasion by tumor.

          3. Prior therapy with bevacizumab, cetuximab, or gefitinib. Prior therapy with erlotinib

             to a monoclonal antibody.

          6. Prior unanticipated severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy or known
             hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil.

          7. Proteinuria at baseline or clinically significant impairment of renal function as
             demonstrated by urine dipstick for proteinuria &gt;/= 2+ (patients discovered to have &gt;/=
             2+ proteinuria on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine
             collection and must demonstrate &lt;/= 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).

          8. Prior history of cancer within the last five years except for basal cell carcinoma of
