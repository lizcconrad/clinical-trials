  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers have previously demonstrated loss of heterozygosity in a region on chromosome
      18q, associated with osteogenic sarcomas in bone affected by Paget's disease. The loci used
      in this study are specifically described by those authors as showing loss of heterozygosity
      in 6 of 7 affected families.

      Once a specimen is obtained DNA will be isolated for paraffin-embedded tissue and peripheral
      blood. Osteosarcoma samples from paraffin embedded, formalin-fixed post-surgical tissue
      samples will be obtained for the proband and father. Matched normal spamples will be obtained
      from these individuals as adjacent normal tissue from the post-surgical specimens

        This is a familial study therefore the only inclusion/exclusion criteria would be that
        subjects must be a blood relative and over the age of 18. The subjects are proband and
        father along with unaffected blood relatives. Their peripheral blood will act as a control
        and provide information to delineate the inheritance from the father, as seen in the son.
