    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-arm, Phase I, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib in combination
      with erlotinib (Arm A) or pazopanib in combination with pemetrexed (Arm B) in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 (in each arm) to receive
      escalating doses of pazopanib and erlotinib or pazopanib and pemetrexed. Dose escalation
      schemas for each study arm are described in the protocol. For each arm, the MTD regimen will
      be defined as the highest dose combination of the agents where no more than one out of six
      patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity. Six to twelve additional patients in each arm
      will be studied with the MTD regimen to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. In arm A
      (erlotinib), a run-in phase with each drug separately will allow an evaluation of
      pharmacokinetics with each drug separately and also for the two drugs in combination. This
      will allow an assessment of potential drug-drug interactions. Pharmacokinetic endpoints will
      be AUC, Cmax, tmax and t1/2 of pazopanib, erlotinib, and pemetrexed, as well as pemetrexed
      clearance before and after administration of pazopanib in the extension cohort of Arm B.
      Antitumor activity will be assessed using RECIST criteria.

    <description>Pazopanib and erlotinib are to be combined at different specified dose levels until an optimally tolerated dose level is identified. Pazopanib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, PDGFR-alpha and beta, and c-kit and erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitor, are to be combined in an effort to simultaneously block two tightly woven cell signaling pathways.</description>

    <description>Pazopanib and pemetrexed are to be combined at different specified dose levels until an optimally tolerated dose regimen is identified. Combination of an anti-VEGF therapy (such as bevacizumab) with systemic chemotherapy has demonstrated increased clinical efficacy in comparison with systemic chemotherapy alone in several malignancies. Hence, pazopanib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, PDGFR-alpha and beta, and c-kit, was chosen to be combined with pemetrexed, a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, in an effort to determine if an anti-angiogenesis inhibitor would enhance the activity of the approved chemotherapeutic agent pemetrexed.</description>

        following criteria are met:

          -  Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study specific
             procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up.

             ·Procedures conducted as a part of routine clinical management of the subject (e.g.,
             blood count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signed informed consent may be

             specified in the protocol.

          -  Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor that has
             failed standard therapy or for which there is no standard therapy. Subjects for whom
             erlotinib or pemetrexed are standard therapy may also be entered.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  ECOG Performance status must be ≤1.

        10^9/L) Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ration (INR) (≤ 1.2 X upper limit
        of normal (ULN)) Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (≤ 1.2 X ULN)

        clearance (≤ 50 mL/min) Urine Protein to Creatinine Ratio (UPC)2 &lt; 1

          1. Subjects may not have had a transfusion within 7 days of screening assessment.

          2. If UPC ≥ 1, then a 24-hour urine protein must be assessed and 24-hour urine protein
             must be &lt;1 g protein to be eligible.

               -  Measurable disease on CT scan.

               -  A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:
                  • Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
                  pregnant), including any woman who has had:• A hysterectomy

               -  A bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy)

               -  Subjects not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total
                  cessation of menses for ≥1 year and be greater than 45 years in age, OR, in

               -  Subjects must discontinue HRT prior to study enrollment due to the potential for
                  inhibition of CYP enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins (see Section
                  8). For most forms of HRT, at least 2 4 weeks must elapse between the cessation
                  of HRT and determination of menopausal status; length of this interval depends on
                  the type and dosage of HRT. If a female subject is determined not to be
                  post-menopausal, they must use adequate contraception, as defined immediately
                  below.

               -  OR of Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum
                  pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment,
                  preferably as close to the first dose as possible, and agrees to use adequate
                  contraception. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and
                  in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the physician,

               -  An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

               -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and is
                  the sole sexual partner for that female.

                  investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days
                  after the last dose of investigational product.

               -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or
                  film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

        Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug interactions.

        Female subjects who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of
        study drug and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 14 days
        following the last dose of study drug.

        A male with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to enter and participate
        in the study if he uses a barrier method of contraception or abstinence during the study.

          -  For Arm B (pemetrexed plus pazopanib) subjects:

          -  Must be able to permanently discontinue aspirin dose of ≥1.3 g/day for ≥10 days before
             through ≥10 days after pemetrexed disodium treatment. All subjects should be able to
             interrupt intake of NSAIDs with longer half lives (e.g., nabumetone, piroxicam,
             oxaprozin) for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed
             disodium administration.

          -  With mild to moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl from 50-79mL/min) should avoid taking
             NSAIDs with short elimination half lives (e.g., fenoprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen,
             tolmetin, meclofenamate) for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days
             following administration of pemetrexed disodium.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             be re-assessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of 24 hours. The mean
             SBP / DBP values from each blood pressure assessment must be &lt; 140/90mmHg in order for
