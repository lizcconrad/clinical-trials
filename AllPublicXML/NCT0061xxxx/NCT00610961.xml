  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increase immunosuppression in our transplant population has led to an unacceptable rate
      of patients at risk for BK virus nephropathy. Reducing induction immunosuppression by
      switching from Thymoglobulin to Simulect will reduce the incidence of serum positivity for BK
      by PCR.

      Our standard of care has been changed from Thymoglobulin to Simulect and now patients were
      enrolled in this observational trial to gather data on their outcomes related to BK viremia
      and rejection rates. Two groups of patients were compared.

      Retrospective (historical or control) group of subjects: patients who had received a kidney
      transplant and were inducted with Thymoglobulin prior to study initiation.

      Prospective group of subjects: patients who is scheduled to receive kidney transplant and
      will be inducted with Simulect (Basiliximab).

      Inductions in both groups was/is Standard of Care at a time of treatment.
