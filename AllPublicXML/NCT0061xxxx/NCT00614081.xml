    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to optimize and validate this MR-based GFR measurement in patients
      with a renal transplant, compared with the reference method, the Cr51- EDTA method: to select
      the most accurate combination of post-treatment of renal MR images and then evaluate its
      intra- and inter-rater reliability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cr51- EDTA method is considered the reference method for measurement of glomerular filtration
      rate (GFR). However, this method requires several hours and several blood and urinary
      samplings. Therefore, the ability to get access to this parameter with a simple, valid and
      reliable method would be a significant progress in clinical follow-up of patients with renal
      disease. Contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI is now able to give this access to functional
      parameters as GFR, rapidly and non invasively, becoming an alternative to Cr51-EDTA method.
      If the acquisition method has been optimized, some problems remain unsolved: is the movement
      correction worthwhile for the accuracy of the measurement ? Which model provides the most
      accurate results ? What is the best way to calculate the total GFR (addition of all the
      voxels or the product of a mean value by the cortical volume)? These questions can be
      answered only by a comparison with a reference method.

      The reference method will be performed after standard hydration, with intravenous injection
      of 100 µCi of Cr51- EDTA and urinary and blood samplings every 30 minutes during 3h. Dynamic
      MRI will be performed with fast 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences during 5 minutes after
      injection of a third of a clinical dose of gadolinium. Post-treatment of images will be done
      on an off-line program allowing movement correction, conversion of signal intensity into
      concentration and application of different models. 8 combinations of post-treatment will be
      tested and compared to the reference method.
