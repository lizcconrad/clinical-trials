      The objective of this study is to collect an image library of diagnostic digital mammograms
      using the Carestream CR mammography system from patients who have histological-conformed
      breast cancer to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this system for detection of breast
      cancer.

    <description>Each subject will have routine clinical care imaging obtained and 4 standard mammogram views (RMLO, RCC, LMLO, LCC) using CR mammography. If routine mammograms were obtained on a day previous to enrollment in the study, those images (4 views; 2 views for mastectomy patients) will not be repeated for this study; only the CR images will be obtained.</description>
