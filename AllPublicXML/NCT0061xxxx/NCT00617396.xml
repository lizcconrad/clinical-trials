  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: We are proposing to examine, via open label trial, the use of Seroquel® for patients
      with moderate to severe functional bowel symptoms who are not receiving adequate relief from
      their symptoms on their present regimen of SNRI or TCA antidepressant agents.

      Participants: Primary eligibility will be determined of patients at The UNC Center for
      Functional GI &amp; Motility Disorders Clinic who score in the moderate to severe range on the
      Functional Bowel Disorders Severity Index (FBDSI ≥ 37) who have failed or have incomplete
      treatment responses of medications including at least one prior trial of antidepressant
      medication.

      Procedures (methods): We will monitor several patient and symptom related outcomes, as well
      as evaluate health related quality of life, psychological distress and related psychosocial
      measures to determine if the addition of Seroquel® over and above the use of an
      antidepressant improves clinical response based on an adequate relief measure as well as
      selected secondary outcomes. We will also determine when treatment benefit is related to
      effects on pain, the associated psychological co-morbidities seen in this population, or both
      factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UNC Center for Functional GI &amp; Motility Disorders Clinic frequently receives referrals
      for patients with chronic and treatment refractory symptoms of abdominal pain and bowel
      dysfunction. Many of these patients are diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, painful
      functional constipation or functional abdominal pain syndrome using Rome III criteria. The
      presenting symptoms of the referral population are frequently in the severe range, with
      patients having intensely painful symptoms, Axis I and Axis II co-morbidities, and impaired
      health related quality of life. Failure of multiple standard treatment attempts prior to
      referral is customary for patients seen in our clinic. Additionally, a greater number of
      patients only experience a partial response to standard treatment. We are therefore
      attempting to address these patients utilizing novel treatment strategies such as we propose
      here.
