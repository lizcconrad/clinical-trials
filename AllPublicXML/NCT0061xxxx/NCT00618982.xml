  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib is a new drug, which is approved under the brand name Nexavar for the treatment of
      advanced kidney cancer. It is also currently being tested in various other cancers. Sorafenib
      works by stopping the development of new cancer cells and new blood vessels. By stopping the
      growth of new blood vessels around a tumor, it is believed that sorafenib prevents the growth
      of kidney cancer tumors.

      This is an &quot;open-label&quot; study which means that the patient, the doctor and Bayer Healthcare
      will know what tablets the patient is taking. All patients in this study will receive
      sorafenib tablets. Sorafenib is taken orally as a tablet (two tablets are taken twice a day).
      Treatment with sorafenib will continue until the patient's tumor grows larger or spreads
      further or if the patient has intolerable side effects. The dose of sorafenib that the
      patient will receive in the study will increase at certain points during the patient's
      treatment, as long as the patient is not experiencing side effects and the patient's tumor
      has not grown.

        <description>Tumor Response of a subject was defined as the best tumor response observed (by independent central assessment) during trial period assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.0) criteria. Confirmed Complete Response (CR) was defined as disappearance of tumor, Partial Response (PR) was defined as a decrease of at least 30% in the sum of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) was defined as steady state of disease, and Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of measured lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Radiological assessments were performed every 8 weeks (2 cycles) from start of the treatment. After completion of 6 cycles of treatment at the highest tolerated dose level, assessments were performed every 12 weeks for up to 34 months.</time_frame>
        <population>The population for the analysis of primary efficacy variable was the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population defined as the patients treated for at least 6 months with 4 months at their highest tolerated dose.</population>
