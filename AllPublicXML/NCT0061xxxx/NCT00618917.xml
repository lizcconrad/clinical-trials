      This is a Phase I-II study evaluating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of swallowed
      MnSOD plasmid/liposome (PL) transgene given as protection against radiation-induced
      esophagitis during concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy with thoracic radiation
      in subjects with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      This is a Phase I-II study evaluating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of swallowed
      MnSOD plasmid/liposome (PL) transgene given as protection against radiation-induced
      esophagitis during concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy with thoracic radiation
      in subjects with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase I of the study
      will assess the feasibility and safety of MnSOD PL by dose escalation in 3 cohorts of 3
      chemoradiotherapy subjects each (Cohort1 = 0.3 mg/dose, Cohort2 = 3 mg/dose, Cohort3 = 30
      mg/dose). The highest dose completed (as determined by toxicity monitoring for 8 weeks from
      initial treatment) will be the starting dose for Phase II. Phase II will examine the efficacy
      of MnSOD PL by assessing the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 esophagitis in 27 additional
      chemoradiotherapy subjects. Incidence of esophageal toxicity, as well as clinical response to
      the combination of chemoradiotherapy with MnSOD PL are the outcomes of interest.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented NSCLC including squamous cell carcinoma,
             adenocarcinoma (including bronchoalveolar cell), and large cell anaplastic carcinoma
             (including giant and clear cell carcinomas) and poorly differentiated non-small cell
             lung cancer. Totally resected tumors are excluded.

          -  Subjects must be without evidence of M0.

          -  Subjects with T1 or T2 disease with N2 or tumor stage 3, lymph node metastasis 1-2 (
             stage 1) disease (Stage IIIA) are eligible if they are medically inoperable. Subjects
             with T4 with any N or any T with N3 disease are eligible. Radiographic evidence of
             mediastinal lymph nodes &gt;2.0 cm in the largest diameter is sufficient to stage N2 or
             N3 disease. If the largest mediastinal node is &lt; 2.0 cm in diameter and this is the
             basis for stage III disease, then at least one of the nodes must be proven positive
             cytologically or histologically.

          -  Subjects with tumors adjacent to a vertebral body are eligible as long as all gross
             disease can be encompassed in the radiation boost field. The boost volume must be
             limited to &lt; 50% of the ipsilateral lung volume.

          -  Subjects with a pleural effusion that is a transudate, cytologically negative and
             non-bloody are eligible if the radiation oncologists feel the tumor can still be
             encompassed within a reasonable field of radiotherapy. Exudative, bloody, or
             cytologically malignant effusions are ineligible. If a pleural effusion can be seen on
             the chest CT but not on chest X-ray and is too small to tap, the subject will be
             eligible.

          -  Subjects must be deemed a suitable candidate for protocol treatment by both Radiation
             Oncology and Medical Oncology

          -  Subjects must have a Performance Status &gt; 70 (Karnofsky Performance Scale).

          -  Subjects Weight loss &lt; 10% in 3 months prior to diagnosis.

          -  Subjects must be male or female &gt; 18 years.

          -  Subjects must have had no prior systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy to the
             thorax, or total surgical resection.

          -  At least 3 weeks since formal exploratory thoracotomy and the subject has recovered
             from surgery, or 1 week from diagnostic thoracoscopy.

          -  Laboratory values must be as follows: (See Section 6.1 of the full protocol for
             required timing): Granulocytes &gt; 2,000/ml, Platelets &gt; 100,000/ml, Hemoglobin* &gt; 8
             mg/dl, Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x normal, Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/n (24 hour or
             calculated, forced expiratory volume at one second &gt; 800 cc. Note: *Physician can
             maintain a subject's hemoglobin with the use of Erythropoetin or transfusions
             prophylactic use of G-CSF (colony stimulating factor, is not permitted).

          -  Subjects must have a MRI or CT brain scan within 4 weeks prior to study entry to rule
             out asymptomatic brain metastases.

          -  Subjects must be informed of the investigational nature of the study and sign an
             informed consent form and have no serious medical or psychiatric illnesses that would
             prevent informed consent.

          -  No history of serious cardiac disease that is not adequately controlled.

          -  Female subjects must be non-pregnant and non-lactating. Female subjects of
             childbearing potential must implement an effective method of contraception during the
             study. All women of childbearing potential must have a pre-study negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study entry.
