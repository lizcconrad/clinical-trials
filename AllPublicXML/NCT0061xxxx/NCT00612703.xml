        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent must be obtained and documented according to
             International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)- Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the
             local regulatory requirements, and permission to use private health information in
             accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) prior
             to study-specific screening procedures

          -  A histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is advanced, metastatic,
             and/or inoperable following prior standard chemotherapy, and/or for which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, there is no alternative therapy, or for which monotherapy
             with erlotinib is appropriate

          -  ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anti-cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents
             within four weeks of first dose (patients currently on erlotinib monotherapy may be
             enrolled into the study without a washout)

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose

          -  Central nervous system metastasis unless it has been stable for ≥ 3 months after
             treatment and patient has no neural symptoms

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Significant gastrointestinal disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could
             interfere with the absorption of ARQ 197 and/or erlotinib (e.g. significant,
             uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease or extensive small bowel resection)
