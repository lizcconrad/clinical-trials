  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dept. of Anesthesiology currently has a database of subjects whom had surgery and
      received either Aprotinin or Amicar in the OR. The current viewpoint is that Aprotinin is
      more harmful than Amicard. In an effort to see what the long term outcomes were for subjects
      whom had surgery here at Upstate, it was decided to look at long term death rates to see if
      any differences. A student t-test will be used to determine statistical significance where a
      p value of &lt;0.05 will be deemed significant. Using data from 462 subjects that had undergone
      cardiac surgery at SUNY Upstate Medical University, CABG only and the long term mortality
      rate from the Mangano, et.al. publications, the unadjusted mortality for the two drugs are
      Aprotinin 5.4% and Amicar 1.2%. A power analysis was performed using the hospital mortality
      rates of 5.4% and 1.2% with the sample size in the propensity data and a p-value of 0.05. The
      result was a power of 81.7%.

      Charts for 462 subjects will be reviewed from 2002-2005 based on the surgery performed. From
      each chart, the subject name, date of birth,and social security number will be recorded along
      with the state of residence and year of surgery. This information will be transferred to a CD
      that is encrypted and password protected. The CD will be sent via FedEx overnight to the
      Center for Disease Control(CDC), National Death Registry. The CDC will use the information on
      the CD to extract death outcomes for each subject's information provided. Once all
      information is complete, the CDC will transfer on to a CD that is encrypted and password
      protected and return to our office via FexEx overnight. The information on the CD will then
      be used to determine what the long term death rates were for subjects here at SUNY Upstate
      Medical University and stored in an anonymous database. Once the information is verified as
      accurate, the CD will be destroyed and no identifying information will be kept. The CDC will
      also destroy the information after 60 days, with no links to the identifying information.
