      This is a 28 day study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of pazopanib eye drops on the
      central retinal thickness of AMD patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib has been formulated as an eye drop for the topical treatment of age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in a first
      study conducted in healthy volunteers (MD7108238). In the present study, three dosing
      regimens of pazopanib eye drops, administered for 28 days, will be evaluated in subjects with
      occult or minimally classic subtypes of choroidal neovascularization due to AMD. This study
      is designed to measure pharmacological activity of topically administered pazopanib in target
      tissues (choroid and retina) of patients with AMD by weekly evaluation of central retinal
      thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Evaluation of efficacy will be
      performed on an exploratory basis by weekly measurement of visual acuity. The ocular and
      systemic safety and systemic pharmacokinetics of pazopanib treatment for 28 days will also be
      evaluated.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Central Retinal/Lesion Thickness (CRLT) as Measured by the Carl Zeiss Meditec Stratus Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Scanner at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -3 to -1) and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>CRLT was measured by the Carl Zeiss Meditec Stratus OCT scanner based on the manual measurement of the distance between the inner and outer retina, inclusive of subretinal fluid and any choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as measured in the central 1 millimeter (mm) area of the 7 mm Posterior Pole Scan. OCT scans/images were collected by trained and certified photographer and analyzed by investigator. Two datasets were used for analysis namely Last observation carried forward (LOCF) which included missing assessment for a participant who completed at least 7 days of pazopanib eye drop replaced by the last non-missing assessment post 7 days of pazopanib eye drop treatment. OC dataset included a missing assessment at any scheduled time was considered unevaluable and was not imputed. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Central Retinal/Lesion Thickness (CRLT) as Measured by the Carl Zeiss Meditec Stratus Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Scanner at Day 29</title>
        <description>CRLT was measured by the Carl Zeiss Meditec Stratus OCT scanner based on the manual measurement of the distance between the inner and outer retina, inclusive of subretinal fluid and any choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as measured in the central 1 millimeter (mm) area of the 7 mm Posterior Pole Scan. OCT scans/images were collected by trained and certified photographer and analyzed by investigator. Two datasets were used for analysis namely Last observation carried forward (LOCF) which included missing assessment for a participant who completed at least 7 days of pazopanib eye drop replaced by the last non-missing assessment post 7 days of pazopanib eye drop treatment. OC dataset included a missing assessment at any scheduled time was considered unevaluable and was not imputed. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) [Number of Letter Read on Standardized Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Charts at Day 29</title>
        <description>BCVA was measured in the study eye using the ETDRS grading charts consists of at least 24 to 78 letters placed at a test distance of 4 meters. There were 7 cut off points in visual acuity on ETDRS grading chart: 15 to 29, 10 to 14, 5 to 9, -4 to 4, -5 to -9, -10 to -14 and -15 to -29 letters. Grade 15 to 29 indicates no impairment in vision and grade -15 to -29 indicates worst impairment in vision. Analyses were done for two sub-efficacy-populations. One sub-efficacy population included all participants in the efficacy population with a YES for retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP)/retinal choroidal anastomosis (RCA) NONE field from Digital angiography reading center (DARC) FA form in study eye. The other included all participants in the efficacy population with a YES for eligible field from DARC FA form in study eye. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline calculated as subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Day 29.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neovascular Size, Total Lesion Size, Fluorescein Angiography (FA) Leakage Area of Measurement, FA Blood Area of Measurement as Measured by FA at Day 29</title>
        <description>FA uses FP to capture images of injected dye circulating throughout the retinal blood vessels to assess leaking, swelling or circulation problems caused by various eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy and wet macular degeneration. The parameters assessed were CNV size, Classic CNV size, FA blood area of measurement, FA leakage area of measurement and total lesion size. A protocol fluorescein angiogram was to be obtained at Day 29. Images were evaluated by investigator for eligibility determination, and by a central reading center for determination of PD effect. Data has been presented for change from baseline in change in eye characteristics in the study eye at Day 29. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Neovascular Size, Total Lesion Size, Fluorescein Angiography (FA) Leakage Area of Measurement, FA Blood Area of Measurement as Measured by FA at Day 29</title>
          <description>FA uses FP to capture images of injected dye circulating throughout the retinal blood vessels to assess leaking, swelling or circulation problems caused by various eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy and wet macular degeneration. The parameters assessed were CNV size, Classic CNV size, FA blood area of measurement, FA leakage area of measurement and total lesion size. A protocol fluorescein angiogram was to be obtained at Day 29. Images were evaluated by investigator for eligibility determination, and by a central reading center for determination of PD effect. Data has been presented for change from baseline in change in eye characteristics in the study eye at Day 29. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>
