    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oxybutynin chloride oral osmotic
      therapeutic system (OROS) on patient-reported outcomes after 12 weeks of treatment by dose
      escalation in participants with overactive bladder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective
      (study following participants forward in time) Phase 4 study of oxybutynin chloride OROS in
      participants with overactive bladder. The total study duration will be 12 weeks and will
      include following visits: Screening (Week -2), Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6 and 12. Participants
      will receive oxybutynin chloride OROS tablet at starting dose of 10 milligram (mg) orally
      once daily. The dose will be adjusted by 10 mg every 2 weeks up to first 6 weeks, based on
      the criteria for evaluation of optimal dose. The optimal dose obtained in first 6 weeks will
      be continued up to Week 12. Maximum allowed dose will be 30 mg per day. Efficacy will
      primarily be evaluated by assessment of goal achievement (percentage of participants who show
      a score 4 or 5 in the Likert scale for treatment goal) at Week 12. Participants' safety will
      also be monitored at each visit.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Response to Patient's Perception of Treatment Benefit (PPTB) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, 4, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PPTB was used to assess participant's perception about treatment benefit and satisfaction of the study drug. Regarding benefit, participants indicated whether they had any benefit obtained from the treatment. If yes, then the participants indicated whether it was weak benefit or strong benefit. Regarding satisfaction, participants indicated whether they were satisfied with the treatment. If yes, then they indicated if the treatment was slightly satisfactory or very satisfactory. If no, then they indicated if the treatment was slightly unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) Score at Week 6 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, 12 or early discontinuation (ED)</time_frame>
    <description>The OAB-q was used to evaluate influence of overactive bladder symptom on health-related quality of life (HRQL). It consisted of 2 parts: Symptom bother (6 items) evaluating how much symptoms related to overactive bladder were bothering in the last 4 weeks and HRQL (13 items) evaluating how general symptoms related to the bladder influenced life in the last 4 weeks. Each item was rated on 6-point Likert scale: 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Total score range: 6 to 36 for symptom bother and 13 to 78 for HRQL. Transformed score calculated as ([Actual total raw score - lowest possible value of raw score]/range)*100 for symptom bother where higher score indicates greater symptom bother and as ([Highest possible raw score-Actual total raw score]/Raw score range)*100 for HRQL where higher scores indicate better HRQL. Transformed score range: 0-100 for both, symptom bother and HRQL.</description>

        <description>Participants assessed their bothering for overactive bladder symptom by completing POSQ rated on a 5-point scale: how much they were bothered by urinary urgency (strong micturition desire indicated) in the past two weeks. The responses were indicated as: 1 (not bothered at all), 2 (slightly bothered), 3 (average), 4 (strongly bothered) and 5 (very strongly bothered). Number of participants with change from Baseline in the response to this question at Week 12 was reported.</description>

The responses were indicated as: 1 (not bothered at all), 2 (slightly bothered), 3 (average), 4 (strongly bothered) and 5 (very strongly bothered). Number of participants with change from Baseline in the response to this question at Week 12 was reported.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all participants who received study drug at least once and had data for efficacy evaluation (goal achievement in treatment) available. Here 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) Score at Week 6 and 12</title>
        <description>The OAB-q was used to evaluate influence of overactive bladder symptom on health-related quality of life (HRQL). It consisted of 2 parts: Symptom bother (6 items) evaluating how much symptoms related to overactive bladder were bothering in the last 4 weeks and HRQL (13 items) evaluating how general symptoms related to the bladder influenced life in the last 4 weeks. Each item was rated on 6-point Likert scale: 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great deal). Total score range: 6 to 36 for symptom bother and 13 to 78 for HRQL. Transformed score calculated as ([Actual total raw score – lowest possible value of raw score]/range)*100 for symptom bother where higher score indicates greater symptom bother and as ([Highest possible raw score-Actual total raw score]/Raw score range)*100 for HRQL where higher scores indicate better HRQL. Transformed score range: 0-100 for both, symptom bother and HRQL.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Mean Voiding Frequency at Week 6 and 12</title>
        <description>Mean voiding frequency for 24 hours was calculated as sum of total voiding frequency divided by the number of days when micturition chart was completed. Participants completed micturition chart for 3 days at Baseline, Week 6 and 12/ED. Mean daytime voiding frequency for 24 hours was calculated as sum of total daytime voiding frequency divided by the number of days when micturition chart was completed. Mean nighttime voiding frequency for 24 hours was calculated as sum of total nighttime voiding frequency divided by the number of days when micturition chart was completed. Nighttime voiding was defined as voiding during the sleep cycle. Percent change was calculated as (change value/Baseline value)*100.</description>
