  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if daily and twice daily administration of BIIB021 is
      tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors are anticipated to have clinical activity in solid
      tumors because Hsp90 is required for the folding, activation, and assembly of many proteins
      involved in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis. The maximum tolerated dose
      (MTX) for BIIB021 administered twice weekly in a phase I study in subjects with advanced
      solid tumors have been defined at 600mg. It is now reasonable from a safety perspective and
      desirable from a pharmacokinetic perspective to evaluate more frequent dosing intervals in
      solid tumors with the goal of providing more sustained and completed inhibition of Hsp90.
