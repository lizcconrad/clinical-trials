  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multi-center, open-label, single-arm clinical trial to be conducted in
      the United States. In approximately 55 centers, approximately 75 eligible locally advanced
      unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer subjects will be enrolled to receive first-line
      therapy of gemcitabine and panitumumab.

      Enrollment closed after 3 patients were enrolled. This voluntary action was prompted by the
      announcement that the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S0205 trial (NCT00075686), A Phase III
      Randomized Open Label Study Comparing Gemcitabine Plus Cetuximab (IMC-C225) Versus
      Gemcitabine as First-Line Therapy of Patients with Advanced Pancreas Cancer, did not meet its
      primary endpoint of improving overall survival).

    <measure>Overall Survival at 1 Year</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The survival time is calculated from Study Day
1 (ie, the first day that a participant receives study treatment with the gemcitabine regimen in combination with panitumumab) to the date of death due to any cause.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 25 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival was defined as the time from Study Day 1 to the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause (whichever comes earlier). Disease progression is determined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria or per physician's assessment based on symptom progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Overall study</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Response defined as the percentage of participants with complete or partial response (CR or PR), as defined by modified RECIST. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR: Either at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters (SLD) and no progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesions, or, the disappearance of all target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease and no new lesions.</description>

    <description>Panitumumab 6 mg/kg was administered intravenously (IV) before gemcitabine on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7, and then every 2 weeks (day 1 and 15) of each subsequent 4-week chemotherapy cycle. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 was administered IV once weekly (on Day 1) for 7 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest period. In subsequent cycles, gemcitabine was given once weekly (on Day 1) for 3 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Panitumumab and gemcitabine treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, death, or study withdrawal occurred.</description>

Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 was administered IV once weekly (on Day 1) for 7 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest period.

CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR: Either at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameters (SLD) and no progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesions, or, the disappearance of all target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease and no new lesions.</description>
