    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm trial; the primary objective
      is to assess the comparability of the performance of the IDev SUPERA® nitinol stent to a rate
      derived from a meta-analysis of studies on iliac stents approved by FDA for treating subjects
      with de novo or restenotic lesions in the common and/or external iliac arteries.

             by visual estimate.

          5. The target lesion(s) can be successfully crossed with a guide wire and dilated.

          6. The target segment of subject's lesion(s) is between 4 and 10 mm in diameter and less
             than 110 mm in length.

          7. Subject has angiographic evidence of a patent femoral outflow artery in the target
             limb.

          8. Subject has provided written informed consent.

          9. Subject is able and willing to adhere to the required follow-up visits and testing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of other non-target arterial lesions requiring treatment within 30 days of
             the procedure.

          2. The target lesion(s) has adjacent, acute thrombus.

          3. The target lesion(s) is highly calcified or was previously treated with a stent.

          4. Subject has a pre-existing target iliac artery perforation or dissection of the target
             iliac artery prior to initiation of the IDev implant procedure.

          5. Subject has an abdominal aortic aneurysm contiguous with the iliac artery target
             lesion. Subject has a pre-existing aneurysm or dissection of the target iliac segment.

          6. Subject with aortic or iliac aneurysm that is likely to require repair within the next
             9 months.

          7. Subject has a post-surgical stenosis and anastomotic suture treatments of the target
             vessel.

         15. Subject has the following laboratory values:

               1. international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5,

               2. serum creatinine level greater than 2.5 mg/dL.

         16. Subject requires general anesthesia for the procedure.

         17. Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the study.

         18. Subject has a co-morbid illness that may result in a life expectancy of less than 1
             year.

         19. Subject is participating in an investigational study of a new drug, biologic or device
             at the time of study screening. NOTE: Subjects who are participating in the long term
