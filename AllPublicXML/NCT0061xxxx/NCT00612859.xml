    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical findings indicate that LEV has some anxiolytic potential. There is
      reason to believe that compounds with anxiolytic activity may have broad clinical utility
      across the anxiety spectrum. This trial was intended to explore LEV's utility in adults with
      social anxiety disorder.
