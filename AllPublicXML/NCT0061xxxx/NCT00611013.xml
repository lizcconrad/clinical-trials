      Evaluating novel MR imaging techniques on volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is twofold. The first aim is to evaluate new MRI techniques developed
      by the investigators of this protocol on human volunteers. The second aim is to assist other
      investigators who need to use MR images obtained on this device for their own research. MR
      images and/or spectroscopy data will be acquired from the participants in this protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy normal volunteers for imaging protocol optimization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with implanted surgical clips (hemostatic clips) or other ferromagnetic
             material,

          -  Patients engaged in occupations or activities which may cause accidental lodging of
             ferromagnetic materials, or who may have imbedded metal fragments from military
             activities,

          -  Patients with permanent (tattoo) eye-liner or with facial make-up (severe eye
             irritation has been reported),

          -  Patients with compromised thermoregulatory systems (e.g. certain cancer patients),

          -  Patients with metallic implants, because they may cause artifacts in diagnostic images
             due to magnetic field distortion,

          -  Patients with implanted prosthetic heart valves,

          -  Patients with pacemakers, neuro-stimulation devices,

          -  Pregnant patients (the safety of magnetic resonance examination has not been
             completely established for embryos and fetuses),

          -  Subjects who have received orthodontic work involving ferromagnetic materials,

          -  Subjects who have claustrophobia, and

          -  The patients unwilling to participate in the study or fail to sign the consent form.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding will be excluded from the contrast
             enhanced MRI studies.

          -  Subjects who had allergic response to contrast agents previously will be excluded from
             contrast enhanced MRI studies.

          -  Subjects with known history of asthma, allergic conditions, severe renal
             insufficiency, sickle cell anemia, chronic hemolytic anemia, gastrointestinal
             disorders will also be excluded from contrast enhanced MRI studies.
