  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical practice indicates that Quetiapine has sedating properties, and its sedative effects
      may play an important role in restoring quality of sleep in patients with various psychiatric
      conditions who frequently experience sleep disturbances as part of their illness. It is well
      known that depressive disorders are very frequently associated with significant sleep
      disturbance. Sleep disruption is a feature of Bipolar Disorder during both Depressed and
      Manic/Hypomanic episodes. Considering that Seroquel has good antidepressant properties
      (Calabrese, 2004), the investigators suggest that Seroquel's effect on sleep architecture
      contributes to its antidepressant properties.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the objective (polysomnographic) change in sleep quality before and after
      introduction of Seroquel (Quetiapine) in treatment of patients with Bipolar Depression or
      Major Depressive Disorder.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the objective (polysomnographic) and subjective changes in sleep quality parameters
      before and at different stages after introduction of Seroquel (Quetiapine) treatment,
      longitudinally, and to correlate these changes with measures of illness severity.

      Study Design:

      Prospective polysomnographic (PSG) study of patients before and after treatment with Seroquel
      (Quetiapine). PSG recordings will be done three (optional four) times during the study:
      before starting the Seroquel (Quetiapine) (baseline), at day 2 to 4 (early) and day 21 to 28
      (longer term). (Optional fourth PSG can be done at day 42-56). PSG will be completed at
      patients home with a portable PSG.
