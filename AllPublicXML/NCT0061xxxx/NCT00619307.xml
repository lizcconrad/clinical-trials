  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess patient satisfaction with respect to the incidence of flu-like symptoms (FLS) in
      patients with multiple sclerosis transitioned from current Rebif (subcutaneously injected
      interferon beta-1a, 44 mcg three-times-weekly) to the new formulation of Rebif (RNF) while
      receiving ibuprofen either prophylactically or only when necessary (PRN) after the occurence
      of flu-like symptoms.

    <description>Subjects, currently on Rebif® 44 mcg three times a week, using Rebiject II as an injection device and having received Rebif® full dose 44 mcg three times a week for at least 6 months, should not administer Ibuprofen before the first Rebif New Formulation injection. If flu-like symptoms occur after the 44 mcg Rebif New Formulation injection then the subject can administer 400 mg ibuprofen. This should only be administered after the Rebif New Formulation injection and not before the Rebif New Formulation injection.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were enrolled from 16 July 2007 and attended the last visit on 11 April 2008. One hundred and twenty three subjects gave informed consent and 117 were enrolled. Of these, all were treated except one subject scheduled to receive prophylactic ibuprofen, who withdrew consent before treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There were 17 active centres, 6 centres in France and 11 centres in Germany. Screening visit took place within 2 weeks of randomisation. Six subjects were screening failures.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Transition With Prophylactic Ibuprofen</title>
          <description>subjects received ibuprofen as prophylactic treatment against FLS on days when RNF 44 mcg tiw was injected (3 times weekly). Mandatory 400 mg of ibuprofen was administered prophylactically 30 to 60 minutes before each RNF injection.
Optionally the subject could take another 400 mg 6 hours after the first ibuprofen dose or upon waking if more than 6 hours later and if necessary a third dose of 400 mg 6 hours later, adding up to a maximum of 1200 mg within 24 hours.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Transition With PRN Ibuprofen</title>
          <description>subjects were instructed not to administer ibuprofen before the first RNF injection. Ibuprofen was taken solely as needed, PRN, after RNF injections to alleviate the symptoms of FLS. If FLS occurred after a RNF injection, then the subject could administer the first dose of ibuprofen 400 mg. The second dose of ibuprofen 400 mg could be taken 6 hours after the first ibuprofen dose or upon waking if more than 6 hours later and if necessary a third dose of 400 mg 6 hours later, adding up to a maximum of 1200 mg within 24 hours of RNF injection.</description>
