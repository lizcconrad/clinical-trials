  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nitric oxide (NO)gas is effective in the
      treatment of venous ulcers of the lower leg.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SUbjects were divided into two Groups - one receiving 200ppm NO gas delivered topically to
      the wound area for 8 hours a day for 6 weeks. The other Group (control arm) received Standard
      of Care (compression) for 22 weeks.

          -  Has used any investigational drug(s) within 30 days preceding randomization

          -  Is unable to manage self-treatment

          -  Is pregnant, nursing mother or a woman of child bearing potential who is not using an
