    <textblock>
      To show that the use of intravenous levetiracetam(LEV;Keppra)for seizure prevention in
      patients in the Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit will result in fewer side effects compared
      to the current standard of care anticonvulsant and will be at least as effective as the
      current standard of care in preventing clinical and sub-clinical seizure activity.

      To show that the use of intravenous levetiracetam(LEV;Keppra)for seizure prophylaxis in the
      Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit will result in fewer adverse effects compared to the current
      standard of care anticonvulsant(phenytoin) and will be at least as effective as phenytoin in
      preventing clinical and sub-clinical seizure activity.

    <measure>Extended Glasgow Outcome Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at discharge; 3 and 6 months following injury</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 8 point validated scale that measures disability after brain injury. It is assessed through an in person exam or by phone interview at hospital discharge, 3 months and 6 months after injury. The categories are: 1 = dead; 2 = vegetative state; 3 = severe disability, low level; 4 = severe disability, high level; 5 = moderate disability, low level; 6 = moderate disability, high level; 7 = good recovery - low level; 8 = good recovery - high level. Specific questions and activities are assessed to determine into which category the patient falls.</description>

    <measure>Disability Rating Scale (DRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Discharge; 3 and 6 months following injury</time_frame>
    <description>The Disability rating scale (DRS) is frequently used in the rehabilitation literature as a measure of disability. It is a reliable, easily performed test that assesses 8 items (eye opening, verbalization, motor response, feeding, toileting, grooming, level of functioning, employability), and assigns each a numerical score ranging from 0 - 5 based on the category. The domains these 8 items are felt to assess include: alertness, cognition for self-care, dependence, and psychosocial adaptability. The scoring range is from 0-30, with increasing disability levels assigned to higher numerical values. The total DRS is then dichotomized into favorable (disability = none, mild, partial or moderate disability) and unfavorable (disability = moderately severe, severe, extremely severe, vegetative state, extreme vegetative state, death) outcomes. A DRS score of 0-6 was favorable, with any score greater than 6 categorized as unfavorable.</description>

    <baseline>
      <population>One patient was enrolled at 17 years of age. His age was unknown at the time of admission to the hospital after his trauma, and based on body size/habitus he appeared to be a young adult. It was later discovered that he was only 17, but turning 18 in 3 days. The PI decided to allow his participation in the study at the parents request.</population>

        <title>Extended Glasgow Outcome Score</title>
        <description>This is an 8 point validated scale that measures disability after brain injury. It is assessed through an in person exam or by phone interview at hospital discharge, 3 months and 6 months after injury. The categories are: 1 = dead; 2 = vegetative state; 3 = severe disability, low level; 4 = severe disability, high level; 5 = moderate disability, low level; 6 = moderate disability, high level; 7 = good recovery - low level; 8 = good recovery - high level. Specific questions and activities are assessed to determine into which category the patient falls.</description>

        <title>Disability Rating Scale (DRS)</title>
        <description>The Disability rating scale (DRS) is frequently used in the rehabilitation literature as a measure of disability. It is a reliable, easily performed test that assesses 8 items (eye opening, verbalization, motor response, feeding, toileting, grooming, level of functioning, employability), and assigns each a numerical score ranging from 0 - 5 based on the category. The domains these 8 items are felt to assess include: alertness, cognition for self-care, dependence, and psychosocial adaptability. The scoring range is from 0-30, with increasing disability levels assigned to higher numerical values. The total DRS is then dichotomized into favorable (disability = none, mild, partial or moderate disability) and unfavorable (disability = moderately severe, severe, extremely severe, vegetative state, extreme vegetative state, death) outcomes. A DRS score of 0-6 was favorable, with any score greater than 6 categorized as unfavorable.</description>
