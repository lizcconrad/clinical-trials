  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exenatide twice daily has been studied in Japanese type 2 diabetes patients. A once-weekly
      version of exenatide is currently being evaluated. Study GWBW is the first study of exenatide
      once weekly in Japanese patients. This study is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability
      of exenatide once weekly in Japanese patients and determine whether the dose selected for US
      and European development is appropriate for Japanese patients with Type 2 diabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body weight ≥50 kg.

          -  Have suboptimal glycemic control as evidenced by an HbA1c defined by the following
             criteria: *6.5% to 10.0%, inclusive, at study start for patients managed with diet
             modification and exercise or treated with oral antidiabetics drug but not alpha
             glucosidase inhibitor or meglitinide derivatives; *6.5% to 9.5%, inclusive, at study
             start for patients treated with oral antidiabetics including alpha glucosidase
             inhibitor or meglitinide derivatives.

          -  Have been treated with diet modification and exercise alone or in combination with a
             stable regimen of oral antidiabetic drugs (sulfonylurea, metformin and
             thiazolidinedione) for at least 2 months prior to study start. In the case of patients
             with concomitant use of sulfonylurea, the dose of sulfonylurea must not be more than
             maximum recommended dose. The patients with concomitant use of alpha glucosidase
             inhibitors (Glucobay® [acarbose], Basen® [voglibose], or Seibule® [miglitol]) or
             meglitinide derivatives (Glufast® [mitiglinide] or Fastic®/Starsis® [nateglinide]) can
             be included in this study, but these drugs must be discontinued after confirmation of
             eligibility at study start.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have donated more than 200 mL of blood and component blood donation
             within one month of study start, or those who have donated more than 400 mL of blood
             within three months of study start.

          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

          -  Have participated and received at least one dose of exenatide or other GLP-1 analogs
             in this study previously, or any other study using exenatide or other GLP-1 analogs.

          -  Are treated with any exogenous insulin within 3 months of screening.

          -  Are continuously treated with any of the following excluded medications within 3
             months of screening (more than 7 days per 1 month): *Drugs that directly affect
             gastrointestinal motility, including Nauzelin® (domperidone), Primperan®/Terperan®
             (metoclopramide), Ganaton® (itopride), Acenalin® (cisapride), Gasmotin® (mosapride),
             or Cerekinon® (trimebutine).

          -  Females who are breastfeeding.
