  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy (response rate [RR], time to progression and survival) of
      oxaliplatin as a single agent and oxaliplatin in combination with 5 FU in patients with
      advanced/metastatic endometrial cancer pretreated with one prior chemotherapy regimen
      containing cisplatin (CDDP) or carboplatin and to define the safety profile of each arm of
      the above mentioned regimens in these patients
