  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if we can find a new way to test how certain Multiple
      Sclerosis (MS) medications work in the body and to better understand how the medicines change
      certain substances (cells) found in the immune (protective) system.

      Blood test will be drawn by doing the following:

        -  Use a new method called the &quot;Immuknow®&quot; Test to see if this method will help to better
           understand how MS medicines work.

        -  Measure certain levels of immune cells in a new way, to see if it this will help to
           understand the body's response to MS medicines.

      These methods will test those with MS who are not taking any MS medications, to help us
      compare the results.

      About 100 subjects will be enrolled in this study at the Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center
      at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Biogen Idec, Inc. of Cambridge, MA, is paying for this study
      to be done.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of various therapies
      (immunomodulatory as well as immunosuppressive) on ATP levels in CD4+ cells and to determine
      whether the &quot;ImmuKnow®&quot; assay is an appropriate screening tool to assess the immunocompetence
      of potential Tysabri patients.

      Secondary objective is to correlate the expression of ATP in CD4+ cells with CD4+ cell count.

      Tertiary objective is to examine the level of regulatory T-cells (CD4+ and CD25+) in MS
      patients and its possible correlation to the therapy used, and how well a recently proposed
      marker of regulatory T-cells, LAP, correlates with CD25 marker.
