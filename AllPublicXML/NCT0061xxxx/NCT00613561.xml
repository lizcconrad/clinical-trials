    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that children with severe primary immunodeficiencies will
      benefit from early stem cell transplantation utilizing a reduced intensity conditioning
      regimen. This regimen is associated with a low risk of complications and will lead to
      correction of the underlying immunological defects.
