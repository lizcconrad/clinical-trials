      &quot;Safer Sex Skills Building&quot; in Pregnant Women: Dace Svikis, (Psychology, Ob-Gyn, Psychiatry)
      PI, Diane Langhorst (Social Work) and Nichole Karjane, (OB-Gyn) Co-Investigators). This study
      will focus on increasing Safer Sex Skills development among pregnant women at high risk for
      HIV infection. The &quot;Safer Sex Skill Building&quot; (SSB) program developed by El Bassel and
      Schilling (1991, 1992), has demonstrated efficacy in national studies in reducing sexual risk
      for HIV and other STD transmission. This manual-driven, gender-specific intervention has
      proven effective in reducing sexual risk behaviors in both methadone maintenance and
      outpatient drug-free patients. To date, however, the intervention has not been tested with
      pregnant drug abusing women who may actually be at increased risk if they stop using condoms
      or continue drug use during pregnancy. This study will examine SSB, a targeted behavioral HIV
      prevention and risk reduction intervention in two samples of pregnant drug abusing women.
      Using a 2x2 design, a randomized clinical trial will compare the five-session SSB group
      intervention to a one-session standard group HIV Education intervention (SE). Study findings
      will provide benchmark data on the efficacy of SSB for HIV and STD prevention in a diverse
      sample of pregnant drug abusing women.

    <description>Test the effectiveness of an intervention for reducing sexual risk factors for HIV infection in two samples of pregnant drug-using women. The intervention, Safer Sex Skills Building (SSB)(El Bassel and Schilling (1991, 1992)), is a manual-driven, gender-specific group intervention delivered by mental health counselors. To date, its effectiveness has not been examined in pregnant, drug using women. The proposed study will examine the effectiveness of the intervention in both drug treatment (RBHA, N = 200) and prenatal care (PCC, N = 200) settings. Using a randomized clinical trial design, the study will compare the five-session SSB group intervention to a one-session standard group HIV Education session (ED). Study hypotheses: that women in the SSB intervention will have better outcomes (e.g., fewer unprotected penetrative sexual behaviors) than women in the control group (ED).</description>
