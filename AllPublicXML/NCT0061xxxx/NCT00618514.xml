    <textblock>
      This trial was designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial of the
      FDA-cleared Vari-Lase Bright Tip Fiber compared to commercially available standard bare-tip
      laser fiber (control) to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of laser ablation for the
      treatment of varicose veins associated with reflux within the great saphenous vein (GSV) and
      to provide additional data concerning patient satisfaction. Within this evaluation, subject
      limbs were randomized to one of two (2) treatment groups utilizing a 1:1 randomization ratio.
      If a subject required treatment of only one limb, that limb was randomized to a treatment
      group. If a subject required treatment of two limbs, the first limb was randomly assigned
      treatment and the second limb was assigned the other treatment (the opposite treatment of the
      other limb). The data was analyzed by treated limb (versus treated subject).All study data
      were analyzed under the principles of intent-to-treat, in which data are analyzed according
      to the assigned randomized group regardless of the treatment actually delivered. Subjects
      were followed at one week, one month, and six months.

      This trial was designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical trial of the
      FDA-cleared Vari-Lase Bright Tip Fiber compared to commercially available standard bare-tip
      laser fiber (control) to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of laser ablation for the
      treatment of varicose veins associated with reflux within the great saphenous vein (GSV) and
      to provide additional data concerning patient satisfaction. Subjects were pre-screened
      utilizing standard of care data (including documented evidence of reflux within the GSV) for
      the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure that they were eligible for treatment in
      the investigation. Prior to laser treatment and after signing an informed consent form, study
      eligibility assessments were completed including physical assessment of target limb(s),
      duplex ultrasound of GSV segment(s) targeted for treatment, symptom assessment, medical
      history, and digital photos of targeted limbs. Upon enrollment, targeted limbs were
      randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive the Vari-lase Bright Tip Fiber or the control treatment.
      If the subject required treatment of two limbs, the first limb was randomized and the second
      limb was assigned the other treatment (the opposite treatment of the other limb). Immediately
      post procedure, subjects were assessed for adverse events and a physical assessment of the
      treated limb(s) was performed. Subjects were also asked to complete a subject pain and
      satisfaction questionnaire. Subjects were followed at one week, one month, and six months.
      Follow-up included a physical assessment of treated limb(s), symptom assessment, adverse
      event assessment, and completion of a subject pain and satisfaction questionnaire.
      Additionally, a duplex ultrasound assessment was conducted at one week and six months and
      digital photos were taken of the treated vein segment(s) at one week and one month. The data
      was analyzed by treated limb (versus treated subject). All study data were analyzed under the
      principles of intent-to-treat, in which data are analyzed according to the assigned
      randomized group regardless of the treatment actually delivered.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change of Subject Symptoms in Treated Limb From Baseline to 6 Months Using Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>VCSS is a physician's evaluation of 10 pre-determined clinical signs or attributes of venous disease (pain, varicose veins, venous edema, skin pigmentation, inflammation, induration, number of active ulcers, active ulcer duration, active ulcer diameter and compression therapy). Each attribute receives a score from 0-3 (0=absent and 3=severe). The best total overall score is 0 (all ten attributes are absent) and the worse overall score is 30 (all ten attributes are severe). Each treated limb was evaluated and scored at baseline and at 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change of Subject Symptoms in Treated Limb From Baseline to 6 Months Using Venous Disability Score (VDS).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>VDS is a physician's evaluation of a patient's ability to work an eight-hour day with or without a support device (i.e., compressive therapy, limb elevation). The patient is scored on a scale of 0-3 (0=asymptomatic and 3=unable to carry out usual activities (patients activities before the onset of disability due to venous disease) even with compression and/or limb elevation). The score represents the degree of disability caused by the venous disease with the best score being 0 and the worse score being 3. Each treated limb was evaluated and scored at baseline and at 6 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change of Subject Symptoms in Treated Limb From Post-procedure to 6 Months Using Patient Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain Scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject completed a questionnaire to rate his/her pain. The scale is from 0-10 (0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable). Each treated limb was scored by the patient post-procedure and at 6 months to determine the improvement after treatment at the 6-month time point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Reporting an Excellent Satisfaction Score at 6 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject completed a questionnaire to rate their satisfaction with the laser treatment. The score was reported as excellent, good, fair or poor. The best score of excellent was defined as &quot;I am very satisfied with the laser treatment&quot; and the worse score of poor was defined as &quot;I am not satisfied with the laser treatment.&quot; Each treated limb was scored by the patient at 6 months to determine the percent satisfaction at the 6-month time point.</description>

        <title>Percent Change of Subject Symptoms in Treated Limb From Baseline to 6 Months Using Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS).</title>
        <description>VCSS is a physician’s evaluation of 10 pre-determined clinical signs or attributes of venous disease (pain, varicose veins, venous edema, skin pigmentation, inflammation, induration, number of active ulcers, active ulcer duration, active ulcer diameter and compression therapy). Each attribute receives a score from 0-3 (0=absent and 3=severe). The best total overall score is 0 (all ten attributes are absent) and the worse overall score is 30 (all ten attributes are severe). Each treated limb was evaluated and scored at baseline and at 6 months.</description>

        <title>Percent Change of Subject Symptoms in Treated Limb From Baseline to 6 Months Using Venous Disability Score (VDS).</title>
        <description>VDS is a physician’s evaluation of a patient’s ability to work an eight-hour day with or without a support device (i.e., compressive therapy, limb elevation). The patient is scored on a scale of 0-3 (0=asymptomatic and 3=unable to carry out usual activities (patients activities before the onset of disability due to venous disease) even with compression and/or limb elevation). The score represents the degree of disability caused by the venous disease with the best score being 0 and the worse score being 3. Each treated limb was evaluated and scored at baseline and at 6 months.</description>

          <description>Each subject completed a questionnaire to rate their satisfaction with the laser treatment. The score was reported as excellent, good, fair or poor. The best score of excellent was defined as “I am very satisfied with the laser treatment” and the worse score of poor was defined as “I am not satisfied with the laser treatment.” Each treated limb was scored by the patient at 6 months to determine the percent satisfaction at the 6-month time point.</description>
