  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find out if some people are more likely to get melanoma, a form
      of skin cancer, than others. People respond to the environment in different ways. Some may be
      born with genes that make them more likely to get this type of skin cancer. Genes are made up
      of DNA. DNA damage is one of the first steps in developing cancer. Each person has many ways
      to repair normal damage to their genes. Some people may have a lower level of this repair and
      that may make them more likely to get cancer. Some genes are important for DNA repair. The
      genes we want to test are thought to affect the rate at which DNA can be repaired. We also
      want to find out if sun habits are related to these levels of DNA repair or genetic
      mutations.

After establishing eligibility for the study, we will send the potential control a letter further explaining the purpose of the study and its requirements. An interviewer will then call to arrange an appointment. During the interview, the subject will sign informed consent, be given the public health questionnaire, have 30 ml of blood drawn, and undergo the skin examination of arms and back.</description>

        Second or multiple primary melanoma cases will be identified at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
        Cancer Center, the Yale University Pigmented Lesion Clinic, or from among those subjects
        who participated in the earlier case-control study in Connecticut.

        First primary melanoma cases will be identified and referred to the study staff by
        participating physicians on the Melanoma Disease Management Team at Memorial
        Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

        Random digit dialing will be used to locate 100 population-based controls for this study.
        We will use telephone prefixes in Connecticut

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases will be patients 18 years or older with a histologically confirmed, second or
             multiple primary melanoma. These will be sequentially selected from subjects seen at
             Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center or the Yale University Pigmented Lesion Clinic.

          -  Controls will be patients 18 years or older with a histologically confirmed first
             primary melanoma diagnosed no earlier than 12 months prior to the study start date.
             One control will be selected per case. These patients will be referred to the study by
             the Melanoma Disease Management Team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
             Controls will be frequency-matched to cases on the basis of sex and age (within 10
             year age groups).

          -  Healthy controls will be subjects 18 years or older recruited from the general
             population through random digit dialing. These subjects will have no history of
             melanoma. They will also be frequency matched to cases on the basis of sex and 10-year
             age group.

          -  The subject must have a histologically confirmed malignant melanoma.

          -  Cases may have an in situ melanoma as the second primary.

          -  Melanoma Controls may have only one primary melanoma.

          -  Healthy controls should have no history of melanoma.

          -  The subject's physician consents to his/her patient's participation in the study (if
             the subject has a diagnosis of melanoma).

          -  The subject has consented, in writing, to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Karnofsky status less than 60 (see Appendix). This will be evaluated by the physician
             treating the subject for melanoma at the time permission is given for participation

          -  Patient had chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the last 6 weeks.
