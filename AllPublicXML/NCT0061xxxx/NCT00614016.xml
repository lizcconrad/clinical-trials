    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of ST20 after
      oral administration of a single-dose. In addition, a comparison of the pharmacokinetics and
      exposure of a single dose of ST20 under fasting and non-fasting conditions will be assessed.
