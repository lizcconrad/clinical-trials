    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of repeating dTpa booster in
      adults 10 years after previous booster vaccination with dTpa in a prior clinical study. Only
      subjects who received booster vaccination in the previous clinical study are eligible for
      participation in this study.
