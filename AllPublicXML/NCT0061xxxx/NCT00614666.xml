    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if nikkomycin Z is safe when administered at
      different dose levels for 14 days. The study will also determine blood levels and urinary
      excretion of nikkomycin Z in relation to dose administered. Patients with mild forms of
      Valley Fever pneumonia will be eligible to participate and will be allocated to receive
      treatment with nikkomycin Z (various doses) or a placebo. A secondary goal of this study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness and dose response of nikkomycin Z in an exploratory analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year there are 50,000 new U.S. cases of coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever). The majority
      of these illnesses occur as a result of endemic exposure in Arizona and California. The
      benefits of antifungal therapy for uncomplicated disease are not currently established.
      Current therapies for serious and complicated forms of coccidioidomycosis are only partially
      effective and in themselves are unable to eradicate the fungus from sites of infection,
      commonly resulting in breakthrough infection and/or relapse. Nikkomycin Z is effective in the
      mouse model and results in improved microbiological response over fluconazole.

      The goals of this study include: 1) Evaluating the safety and tolerance of nikkomycin Z
      following administration of multiple doses (50 mg Q 12 h to 750 mg Q 8 h) for two week and 2)
      Evaluating the pharmacokinetics of nikkomycin Z after single and multiple doses in
      relationship to dose. The study will include patients with uncomplicated Coccidioides
      pneumonia (mild illness) which will allow exploratory analysis of efficacy and dose response
      based on biomarkers.

    <description>Stage I: Multiple rising doses. Doses packaged on a unit dose basis in 50 and 250 mg capsules. Subjects take 1-3 capsules per dosing block for 14 days unless ADE or study withdrawal. Dose escalation unless a dose-limiting adverse effect is noted. Subjects assigned to BID dosing will receive 28 doses and subjects assigned to TID dosing will receive 42 doses.
50 mg BID (n=8) vs placebo capsule BID (n=2)
250 mg BID (n=8) vs Placebo capsule BID (n=2)
500 mg BID (n=8) vs Placebo capsule BID (n=2)
750 mg TID (n=8) vs Placebo capsule TID (n=2)
At least 4 subjects complete lower dose before randomization includes next higher dose, thus there are 4 arms for active intervention and corresponding placebos.
Stage II will be a single dose level selected based on pharmacodynamics and safety from Stage I for 20 additional subjects using 4:1 randomization.</description>
