  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of erlotinib as first line treatment in patients with
      locally advanced/metastatic (stages IIIB/IV) NSCLC, with clinical predictors of response to
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib), such as female gender, never-smoking
      status and adenocarcinoma histology. Furthermore, erlotinib-sensitivity will be correlated
      with the presence of EGFR mutations in exons 18, 19 and 21, in this population

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial of erlotinib versus placebo, with more than
      700 patients demonstrated that therapy with this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) prolongs
      survival after first or second line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Statistically
      significant and clinically relevant differences were observed for overall and progression
      free survival in favour of erlotinib. Moreover, several clinical factors had been correlated
      with response to gefitinib or erlotinib, including never smoking status, female gender, Asian
      ethnicity and adenocarcinoma histology (especially bronchioalveolar carcinoma).
