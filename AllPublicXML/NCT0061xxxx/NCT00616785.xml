      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, cisplatin, and etoposide work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving
      combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer
      that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of induction chemotherapy comprising irinotecan hydrochloride
           and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced, unresectable stage III non-small cell
           lung cancer.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of radiotherapy administered concurrently with etoposide and
           cisplatin chemotherapy after induction chemotherapy in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of induction chemotherapy comprising irinotecan hydrochloride
           and cisplatin in these patients.

        -  To assess whether this induction chemotherapy regimen will improve patient survival when
           compared with outcomes from the predecessor study, SWOG-9019.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dose-dense induction chemotherapy comprising irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV and cisplatin IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      2 courses.

      After completion of induction chemotherapy, patients undergo radiotherapy five days a week
      for approximately 7 weeks. Patients receive concurrent chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV
      on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV on days 1-5 and 29-33.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 6 weeks.
