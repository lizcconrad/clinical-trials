      RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and
      methotrexate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sunitinib together with combination
      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sunitinib when
      given together with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate to see how well they work in treating
      patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of metronomic dose
           cyclophosphamide and methotrexate with continuous dosing sunitinib malate. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the time to disease progression in patients with metastatic breast cancer
           treated with metronomic dose chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate
           combined with continuous dosing of sunitinib malate. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate in patients receiving this treatment.

        -  To determine the duration of response in patients receiving this treatment.

        -  To determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the feasibility by assessment of toxicities of this regimen and number of
           voluntary withdrawals from the study.

        -  To correlate outcome measures with possible surrogate markers including serial
           measurements of circulating tumor cells and circulating endothelial cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sunitinib malate.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily. Beginning 14 days later,
           patients also receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-21 and oral
           methotrexate twice daily on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment with sunitinib
           malate, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate repeats every 21 days* in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive sunitinib malate at the maximum tolerated dose determined in
           phase I and cyclophosphamide and methotrexate as in phase I.

      NOTE: *Course 1 includes 2 weeks of sunitinib malate alone followed by sunitinib malate,
      cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate for 21 days

      Blood samples are collected periodically for measurement of circulating tumor cells,
      circulating endothelial cells, and VEGF levels.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 2
      months for 1 year.

    <description>Patients in each cohort were followed for DLT for at least 8 weeks (2 week lead-in with sunitinib and 6 weeks of treatment with sunitinib and metronomic cyclophosphamide and methotrexate) before opening accrual to the next dose level.
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT):
≥ grade 3 anemia that does not resolve with appropriate growth factors afebrile grade 4 neutropenia that does not resolve with growth factor support after ≥ 7 days
grade 4 neutropenia associated with fever (1 reading of oral temperature &gt; 38.5 ºC or 3 readings of oral temperature &gt; 38.0 ºC in a 24 hour period)
≥ grade 3 thrombocytopenia
≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities, except those that can be controlled to grade 2 or less with appropriate treatment.
Inability to resume treatment with any of the study medications within 14 days of stopping due to treatment related toxicity.</description>

≥ grade 3 anemia that does not resolve with appropriate growth factors afebrile grade 4 neutropenia that does not resolve with growth factor support after ≥ 7 days
grade 4 neutropenia associated with fever (1 reading of oral temperature &gt; 38.5 ºC or 3 readings of oral temperature &gt; 38.0 ºC in a 24 hour period)
