    <textblock>
      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure a receptor in the
      brain that is involved in inflammation. Certain neurological disorders, possibly including
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are associated with increased inflammation in the brain. This
      study may help elucidate the relationship between FTD and inflammation.

      Patients with FTD and healthy volunteers who are 35 years of age or older may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination,
      electrocardiogram, and blood and urine tests.

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

        -  Whole body PET scan: PET uses small amounts of a radioactive chemical called a tracer
           that labels active areas of the brain so the activity can be seen with a special camera.
           The tracer used in this study is [11C]PBR28. Before starting the scan, a catheter
           (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in the arm to inject the tracer. Pictures are taken
           for 1 hour. This short scan is done to determine if [11C]PBR28 binds to the subject s
           receptors, since a number of people do not have binding. Subjects who have binding
           continue with brain PET and MRI scans, described below.

        -  Brain PET imaging: Before starting the scan, a catheter is placed in a vein in the arm
           to inject the tracer,&lt;TAB&gt; and another catheter is placed in an artery in the wrist to
           obtain blood samples during the scan. The subject lies on the scanner bed. A special
           mask is fitted to the head and attached to the bed to help keep the person s head still
           during the scan so the images will be clear. An 8-minute transmission scan is done just
           before the tracer is injected to provide measures of the brain that are helpful in
           calculating information from subsequent scans. After the tracer is injected, pictures
           are taken for about 2.5 hours, while the subject lies still on the scanner bed.

        -  Blood and urine tests are done the day of and the day following each PET scan.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI scan is done within 1 year (before or after) of
           the PET scan. This procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of
           the brain. The subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a tube-like
           device), wearing earplugs to muffle the noise of the machine during the scanning
           process. The test takes about 1 hour.

      Objective:

      Abnormal immune responses and inflammatory mechanisms have been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by focal atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes.
      Evidence supports the presence of inflammation in FTD; however, the relationship between
      inflammation and FTD pathogenesis is poorly understood. In addition, there is evidence of
      inflammation in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a condition characterized by seizures
      originating from the mesial temporal lobe.

      In response to brain inflammation, microglia are activated and over-express the peripheral
      benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). In normal conditions, PBR is expressed in low numbers.
      Measuring PBR density can identify areas of brain inflammation, because activated microglial
      cells in these areas express more PBR than microglial cells in resting conditions. Positron
      emission tomography (PET) imaging can quantify PBR density in vivo using radioligands that
      bind to PBR sites. One PBR-specific radioligand,
      [11C]1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195), has been used to
      identify areas of brain inflammation in patients with FTD. Unfortunately, [11C]PK11195 has
      several limitations, such as low brain uptake and low specific signal. A recently developed
      radioligand, [11C]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine (PBR28), has higher
      affinity than [11C]PK11195 for PBR. [11C]PBR28 has never been used to study inflammation in
      FTD.

      To further study brain inflammation in dementia and TLE, we wish to include patients with
      Alzheimer disease (AD) and TLE.

      Study population:

      In this protocol, we wish to evaluate 20 patients with FTD, 50 100 patients with AD, 20
      patients with TLE, and 30 55 healthy volunteers.

      Design:

      Subjects will undergo a dedicated brain PET with [11C]PBR28, as well as a brain MRI. In AD
      patients and controls, 11C PBR28 PET and MRI will then be repeated after an interval of one
      year but no more than 5 years.

      Outcome measures:

      Outcome measures will be the amount of 11C PBR28 binding in the brain in FTD patients, AD
      patients, TLE patients and in healthy controls. We will quantify the radioligand s brain
      uptake, washout, plasma clearance, and distribution volume using compartmental modeling.
      Distribution volume is proportional to the density of receptors and is equal to the ratio at
      equilibrium of uptake in brain to the concentration of parent radiotracer in plasma. 11C
      PBR28 binding will also be compared between baseline and follow-up scans to determine the
      change in binding related to evolution of AD pathology and that related to normal aging.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD
             patients with or without motor involvement may be included. FTD patients with either
             the frontal variant (also known as the behavioral variant) or the language variant of
             FTD may be included. AD and FTD patients must either meet capacity criteria to consent

          -  Laboratory tests with clinically significant abnormalities.

          -  Prior participation in other research protocols or clinical care in the last year such
             that radiation exposure, including that from this protocol, would exceed the
             guidelines set by the Radiation Safety Committee (RSC).

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding.

          -  Positive result on urine screen for illicit drugs.

          -  Subjects who cannot lie on their back for extended periods of time.

               2. with an MRI finding consistent with a brain tumor, trauma or arterial-venous
                  malformations

               3. with seizure activity within 24 hours prior to the study.
