      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Iocide oral rinse as a treatment for
      Oral Candidiasis in any patient including but not limited to patients receiving radiation
      therapy or who have previously received radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, or
      patients positive for HIV/AIDS or are transplant patients.

      A four-week study has been designed as an assessment of the clinical cure and mycological
      eradication of oral Candida isolates in 40 cancer patients referred by radiation oncologists
      during the course of his/her treatment. An estimated 35 patients will be evaluable at the end
      of the study. Candida infection is defined as positive clinical signs (white plaques) with
      positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and positive cultures. Colonization is defined
      as a positive culture without signs of clinical infection.

          -  With signs and symptoms of oral candidiasis as determined by investigator(s);

          -  Females using an effective contraception method during study.

          -  Patients must be able and willing to comply with study requirements, and have full

             to initiation of protocol specified procedures.

          -  Participating female subjects must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures during
             the trial. Before entering the study, women of childbearing age will be tested for
             pregnancy with a urine pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History, or current evidence, of any significant acute or chronic medical or
             psychiatric condition that would render examination difficult or invalid or prevent

          -  Inability to use an oral rinse;

          -  Use of concomitant medication that, in the opinion of the Study Director, might

             phenytoin, lithium, coumadin or Iodine containing preparations [use of iodized table
             salt is acceptable]). Steroids, therapeutic doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             agents, estrogen therapy agents and oral contraceptives are OK to use as long as the
             baseline dose remains steady through the end of the study;

          -  Use of antifungal medication in the last 30 days, purported sensitivity or allergy to
             iodine;
