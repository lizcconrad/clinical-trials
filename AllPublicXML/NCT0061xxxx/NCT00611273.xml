          -  Has no medical contraindication

          -  Presents for correction of glabellar furrows, as classified per the Rated Numeric

             1 or Higher)

          -  Is at least 18 years of age

          -  Signs a written informed consent

             score

        Exclusion Criteria: The patient will be excluded if:

          -  Has had an injection of botulinum toxin to the target area within the previous 4
             months and still exhibits a positive cosmetic effect to the glabellar frown.

          -  Has had silicone, fat, collagen or a synthetic material placed in the glabellar region
