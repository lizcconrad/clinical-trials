      Background: Mortality from severe malaria remains ~15% despite the use of the most rapidly
      parasiticidal antimalarial therapy, artesunate. Adjunctive treatments may improve outcome.
      Our overall goal is to determine if adjunctive treatment with L-arginine is safe and improves
      outcomes in severe malaria. In studies to date, we have shown that L-arginine is safe in
      moderately severe malaria, increases nitric oxide production and improves endothelial
      function. We now propose to extend these studies to patients with severe malaria.

      Aims: To determine the safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      L-arginine infusion in severe malaria.

      Hypothesis: L-arginine will improve endothelial function, lactate clearance time and tissue
      oxygen delivery compared to saline with no clinically significant adverse effects.

      Methods: Based on previous pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations, we propose a phase 2A
      randomised controlled trial of L-arginine vs saline in severe malaria, each given over 8
      hours. If safety is demonstrated this will be followed by a phase 2B open-label study of
      24-hour infusion of L-arginine in severe malaria with safety and preliminary efficacy
      compared with the 8 hour infusions given in phase 2A.

      The primary outcomes will be the improvement in endothelial function and lactate clearance in
      patients given L-arginine infusion compared with those who received saline. Among the
      secondary outcomes will be safety and the effect of L-arginine vs saline on tissue oxygen
      delivery (NIRS).

      Data from both phase 2A and 2B will be used to generate a pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic
      model.
