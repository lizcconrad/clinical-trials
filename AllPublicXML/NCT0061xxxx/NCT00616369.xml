  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether an association exists between certain
      genes/protein levels and the development of various cardiopulmonary diseases. It is hoped
      that this project will provide valuable insight into the understanding of these diseases.

      There are two main groups of participants in this trial:

      Group 1: Patients that are enrolled in either or both of previous studies: X980515002 study
      (Identification of Genetic Markers for Primary Pulmonary Hypertension) and or X030403017
      study (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Database)

      Group 2: Participants with the diagnosis of any of the previously listed Cardiopulmonary
      Diseases who are ≥15 years of age

      Group 1: For those patients who have had blood samples drawn as a result of participating in
      the current protocol, Identification of Genetic Markers for Primary Pulmonary Hypertension
      study (X980515002), we would like to use their previously obtained blood and continue to draw
      samples (12mL; less than 3 tablespoons) ONLY if they change disease therapies. With each
      disease therapy change, blood will be drawn at baseline, at 3-4 month, at 6-8 month, at 12
      month, and at 24 month visits. These current X980515002 participants WILL sign a consent form
      to participate in this new trial. As for the X980515002 expired patients, we would like to
      use the previously obtained data ONLY in part for this study that was collected as a result
      of the X980515002 study.

      For those patients who participated in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Database study
      (X030403017), these participants WILL also sign a consent form to participant in this new
      trial. We would like to use the previously obtained data from the X030403017 in part with
      this study. With each disease therapy change, a 12mL (less than 3 teaspoons) blood sample
      will be drawn at baseline, at 3-4 month, at 6-8 month, at 12 month, and at 24 month visits.
      As for the X030403017 expired patients, we would like to use the previously obtained data in
      part for this study that was collected as a result of the X030403017 study.

      Group 2: After signing a consent form, these participants will have a 12mL (less than 3
      teaspoons) blood sample drawn at baseline, at 3-4 month, at 6-8 month, at 12 month, and at 24
      month visits. With each disease therapy change, the blood draws (12mL samples) will begin
      again at baseline and continue through the 3-4, 6-8, 12, and 24 month visits.
