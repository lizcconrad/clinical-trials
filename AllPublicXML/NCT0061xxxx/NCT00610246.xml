    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the combination of radiation treatment and an
      anti-angiogenic drug called sorafenib (or BAY 43-9006 or Nexavar) to determine the effects of
      this combination on cancers but also on side effects of radiation treatment. This study will
      also determine the highest safe dose of sorafenib that can be given with radiation treatment.

    <description>Sorafenib orally for one week prior to radiation, then concomitantly for two weeks with radiation and then for one week following completion of radiation. Each anatomic cohort will dose escalate independently. Dose level 1 is 200mg of sorafenib. If full oral dose (400mg orally, twice a day) is reached in a given cohort then an additional dose level will open where sorafenib treatment is extended following radiation for a total of eight weeks.</description>
