  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compared the 24-hour spirometry profile of indacaterol with that of placebo and

    <measure>24-hour Post-dose Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) After 14 Days of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose on Day 15 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of FEV1 measurements at 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post Day 14 dose measured on the morning of Day 15 in each treatment period. The model used for analysis contained the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate. The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak FEV1 During 4 Hours Post Morning Dose on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (from 0 to 4 hours post morning dose)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. The peak effect on Day 1 was defined as the maximum FEV1 during the first 4 hour on that day. FEV1 measurements taken within 6 hour of rescue use were set to missing before the peak FEV1 (0-4 hour) was calculated. The model used for analysis contained the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate. The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</description>

          <title>Peak FEV1 During 4 Hours Post Morning Dose on Day 1</title>
          <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. The peak effect on Day 1 was defined as the maximum FEV1 during the first 4 hour on that day. FEV1 measurements taken within 6 hour of rescue use were set to missing before the peak FEV1 (0-4 hour) was calculated. The model used for analysis contained the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate. The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</description>
