  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary patency of the GORE PROPATEN Vascular Graft is equivalent to or better than
      disadvantaged autologous vein graft in an infragenicular peripheral bypass application at 12
      months.

    <textblock>
      Primary patency is defined as hemodynamic evidence of blood flow through an open graft that
      has maintained uninterrupted patency and has not previously undergone a revision to restore
      blood flow. A disadvantaged autologous vein is defined as meeting at least one of the two
      following criteria: (1) Any autologous vein(s) other than greater saphenous vein deemed
      usable by the Investigator; (2) Usable ipsilateral or contralateral autologous greater
      saphenous vein that meets any of the following criteria: (a) Diameter of less than or equal
      to 3.0 mm; (b) Inadequate length requiring splicing; (c) Poor quality vein that is either
      sclerotic or phlebitic.

    <measure>Major Adverse Event Occurrences Through One Month Post-procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>one month post-index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The number of Major Adverse Event occurrences through one month post-procedure. A major adverse event requires significant therapy, including unplanned increase in the level of care, permanent sequelae, hospitalization, or death. This outcome measure presents the number of Major Adverse Event occurrences (i.e. - one patient could have multiple occurrences), and differs from the Serious Adverse Events reporting measure, which presents the number of patients that have been affected by a Serious Adverse Event.</description>

    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Assisted primary patency is defined as hemodynamic evidence of blood flow through an open graft that has previously undergone revision(s) within the graft to restore blood flow prior to occlusion. The number of patients analyzed at 1 month post-procedure does not equal the number of patients originally enrolled into the study. This is due to the fact that a number of enrolled patients did not have their 1 month follow-up visit (or failed to attend their 1 month visit) prior to the termination of the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as Evaluated by the SF-36v2® Health Survey From Baseline Through One Month Post-procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 Health Survey asks 36 questions to measure health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The responses to these questions can be presented as physical component summary and mental component summary scores. An increase in score from baseline indicates an improvement in the patient's condition and a decrease in score from baseline indicates a decline in the patient's condition. The subscale and total score ranges from 0 to 100 but is normalized so that a score of 50 is the population mean, with a standard deviation of 10.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient requires below-knee bypass secondary to severe claudication, rest pain or
             tissue loss due to peripheral arterial occlusive disease.

          2. Patient meets the disadvantaged autologous vein criteria described in Section 4.1.

          3. Patient has a post-operative life expectancy greater than one year.

          4. Patient is at least 21 years of age.

          5. Patient is able to comply with all study requirements and be available for follow-up
             visits at 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36-months post-procedure.

          6. Patient is willing and able to provide written, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has had a previous instance of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2 (HIT-2)
             or has known hypersensitivity to heparin.

          2. Patient requires an infragenicular bypass for reasons other than peripheral arterial
             occlusive disease.

          3. Patient requires sequential extremity revascularizations or other procedures that
             require use of additional vascular grafts.

          4. Patient is in need of, or is scheduled for, a cardiac surgical procedure or a
             different vascular surgical procedure within 30 days of study procedure. However,
             inflow procedures that facilitate the bypass are permitted, as long as they are not
             performed at the same sitting as the bypass procedure.

          5. Patient has been previously randomized for this study.

          6. Patient has active infection in the region of graft placement.

        <description>The number of Major Adverse Event occurrences through one month post-procedure. A major adverse event requires significant therapy, including unplanned increase in the level of care, permanent sequelae, hospitalization, or death. This outcome measure presents the number of Major Adverse Event occurrences (i.e. - one patient could have multiple occurrences), and differs from the Serious Adverse Events reporting measure, which presents the number of patients that have been affected by a Serious Adverse Event.</description>

          <description>The number of Major Adverse Event occurrences through one month post-procedure. A major adverse event requires significant therapy, including unplanned increase in the level of care, permanent sequelae, hospitalization, or death. This outcome measure presents the number of Major Adverse Event occurrences (i.e. - one patient could have multiple occurrences), and differs from the Serious Adverse Events reporting measure, which presents the number of patients that have been affected by a Serious Adverse Event.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 Health Survey asks 36 questions to measure health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The responses to these questions can be presented as physical component summary and mental component summary scores. An increase in score from baseline indicates an improvement in the patient's condition and a decrease in score from baseline indicates a decline in the patient's condition. The subscale and total score ranges from 0 to 100 but is normalized so that a score of 50 is the population mean, with a standard deviation of 10.</description>

        <population>The number of patients analyzed at 1 month does not equal the number of patients originally enrolled into the study, due to the fact that a number of enrolled patients did not have (or failed to attend) their 1 month follow-up visit prior to the termination of the study.</population>
