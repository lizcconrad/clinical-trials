      Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral topotecan when administered with Temodar
           to patients with malignant glioma

        -  To characterize any toxicity associated with the combination oral topotecan and Temodar.

        -  To observe patients for clinical antitumor response when treated with oral topotecan and
           Temodar.

      Subjects are patients with glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) or grade 3 or
      greater WHO astrocytic, oligodendroglial or mixed glial tumors, which were initially
      diagnosed by histologic examination of biopsy/resection. Modified classical &quot;3+3&quot; phase I
      design used to determine maximum tolerated dose of topotecan in combination with Temodar.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histology: GBM, AA or grade 3 or greater WHO astrocytic, oligodendroglial or mixed
             glial tumors which were initially diagnosed by histologic exam of biopsy/resection

          -  Age: &gt; or equal to 18 years

          -  Performance Status: Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; or equal to 60% at study entry.

          -  Renal Function: Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/dL.

          -  Hematologic Status: The following baseline studies will be required before entry:
             total granulocyte count &gt; or equal to 1000/microliter; platelet count &gt;
             100,000/microliter

          -  Hepatic Function: Serum SGOT &amp; total bilirubin &lt; or equal to 2.5 times ULN.

          -  Note: All lab parameters must have been obtained within 1 week of registration

          -  Consent: Signed informed consent, approved by IRB, will be obtained prior to
             initiating treatment

          -  Corticosteroids: For patients currently on corticosteroids, patients should be on
             stable dose for 1 week prior to study entry, if clinically possible.

          -  Prior Therapy: Interval of at least 2 weeks between prior surgical resection or prior
             radiotherapy (XRT) or 1 week from completion of chemotherapy and all toxicities are &lt;
             or equal to grade 1 &amp; enrollment on this protocol unless there is unequivocal evidence
             of progressive disease.
