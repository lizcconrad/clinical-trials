    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to determine the response rates when Revlimid® is
      combined with Doxil® and Dexamethasone (Dd-R) in newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma. The study
      will also evaluate the side effects caused by the combination of these three drugs. This
      therapy is investigational in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma.

      Revlimid® is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it
      may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Revlimid® is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and Multiple
      Myeloma, two different types of blood cancer. It is currently being tested in a variety of
      other cancer conditions. In this case it is considered experimental.

      Doxil® is a form of chemotherapy. It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/
      refractory Multiple Myeloma in combination with Velcade.

      Dexamethasone is a steroid. It is also approved by the FDA, but not for the treatment of
      Multiple Myeloma. It is considered a standard part of most myeloma therapies for newly
      diagnosed patients.

      Induction Phase:

      Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with active disease, will be treated with Dd-R as
      outlined below:

      All patients will also receive Levaquin 500 mg by mouth (PO) every day (QD) [or if allergic
      receive amoxicillin 250 mg PO twice a day (BID)], acyclovir 400 mg PO BID or Valacyclovir 500
      mg BID and aspirin 81 mg PO QD daily while receiving Dd-R. Aspirin will continue through
      maintenance. For patients who cannot tolerate aspirin, low molecular weight heparin or
      therapeutic doses of coumadin may be used in place of aspirin.

        -  Doxil® 30 mg/m^2 on day # 1 to be repeated every 28 days

        -  Dexamethasone 40 mg per day for 4 days (days 1-4) every 28 days

        -  Revlimid® 25 mg PO daily on days 1-21, followed by 7 days of no therapy, repeated every
           28 days

      Maintenance Therapy:

      Patients who complete the induction regimen or those who complete at least 2 cycles of the
      induction regimen and not showing evidence of progressive disease but cannot tolerate any
      further chemotherapy could be started on maintenance therapy as follows:

        -  Revlimid® 15 mg or 25 mg* PO daily on days 1-21, followed by 7 days of no therapy,
           repeated every 28 days

      Patients will start maintenance therapy at the dexamethasone dose that was tolerated at the
      completion of the induction phase. *The starting Revlimid® dose for maintenance will be
      either 15 mg or 25 mg, which will be determined based on whether specific criteria are met on
      scheduled Day 1.

        -  Dexamethasone 40 mg per day for 4 days (days 1-4) every 28 days

      All participants will also receive aspirin 81 mg PO QD daily while receiving maintenance. For
      patients who cannot tolerate aspirin, low molecular weight heparin or therapeutic doses of
      coumadin may be used in place of aspirin.

Partial Remission (PR): A greater than 50% reduction in the serum paraprotein, and if present, a greater than 90% reduction in the urine M protein excretion. Patients must also have a decrease by 50% in the size of soft tissue plasmacytoma. If serum and urine M protein are not measurable, a 50% or greater decreased in the difference of the involved and uninvolved free light chain. Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR): Detectable serum and urine M component on immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M protein with less than 100 mg/24 h of urinary M protein. Complete Remission (CR): The presence of less than 5% bone marrow plasmacytosis and the disappearance of all evidence of serum and urine M-components on electrophoresis as well as by immunofixation.

Patients received lenalidomide 25 mg orally on days 1-21, dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days on 1-4, and PLD 40 mg/m^2 intravenously on day 1 (reduced to 30 mg/m^2 after the initial 29 patients were treated). Cycles were repeated every 28 days.
At the best response (4-8 cycles of induction), patients could proceed with either high-dose therapy or maintenance with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at the tolerated doses on the same schedule until disease progression.

Partial Remission (PR): A greater than 50% reduction in the serum paraprotein, and if present, a greater than 90% reduction in the urine M protein excretion. Patients must also have a decrease by 50% in the size of soft tissue plasmacytoma. If serum and urine M protein are not measurable, a 50% or greater decreased in the difference of the involved and uninvolved free light chain. Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR): Detectable serum and urine M component on immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M protein with less than 100 mg/24 h of urinary M protein. Complete Remission (CR): The presence of less than 5% bone marrow plasmacytosis and the disappearance of all evidence of serum and urine M-components on electrophoresis as well as by immunofixation.

Due to increased neutropenia and fatigue, toxicities were reviewed after the first 29 participants were enrolled.</description>

          <description>Induction Phase Followed by Maintenance Therapy.
Patients received lenalidomide 25 mg orally on days 1-21, dexamethasone 40 mg orally on days on 1-4, and PLD 40 mg/m^2 intravenously on day 1 (reduced to 30 mg/m^2 after the initial 29 patients were treated). Cycles were repeated every 28 days.
At the best response (4-8 cycles of induction), patients could proceed with either high-dose therapy or maintenance with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at the tolerated doses on the same schedule until disease progression.
Dd-R: Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) combined with Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (Doxil®) and Dexamethasone (Decadron®) as outlined in the Detailed Description.</description>
