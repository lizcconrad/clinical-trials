      This a Phase 2, multicenter open label, uncontrolled 2-step design. Patients will be arranged
      in two groups based upon the response to their last platinum containing therapy. The two
      groups are, 1) Platinum Resistant Patients: patients with progressive disease while on
      platinum containing therapy or stable disease after at least 4 cycles; patients relapsing
      following an objective response while still receiving treatment; patients relapsing after an
      objective response within 6 months from the discontinuation of the last chemotherapy and 2)
      Platinum-Sensitive Patients: patients who relapsed following an objective response after 6
      months from the discontinuation of platinum containing chemotherapy. All patients will
      receive pyridoxine at least 200mg by mouth daily beginning approximately one week prior to
      the initiation of the combination chemotherapy and it will continue up to the end of the last
      treatment cycle.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma of epithelial
             origin, primary tubal or peritoneal carcinoma;

          -  Progressive or recurrent disease

          -  The following patient types based upon the disease measurability may enroll in this
             study and will be considered for efficacy evaluation.

        Patients may have measurable disease strictly following the RECIST guidelines. CA125 levels
        must be obtained according to the Rustin guidelines to enable a complete evaluation of
        response/progressive disease according to the GCIG guidelines. Patients may enter with a
        solitary measurable lesion which has not been confirmed by histology/cytology. These
        patients will be considered evaluable for response according to a modified RECIST which
        will not require the histological/cytological confirmation of the lesion. CA125 levels must
        be obtained according to the Rustin guidelines to enable a complete evaluation of
        progressive disease according to the GCIG guidelines. Patients with non-measurable disease
        will be considered evaluable for response provided CA125 data has been collected according
        to the Rustin guidelines and a complete evaluation of response/progressive disease
        according to the GCIG guidelines maybe conducted.

          -  Numbers of prior chemotherapy(s): maximum 2 prior chemotherapies. Reintroduction of a
             platinum at relapse, after an initial response lasting &gt; 6 months is considered 1
             chemotherapy regimen only.

          -  ECOG performance status grade 0 or 1

          -  Age ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 yrs

          -  Adequate hematological, liver and renal function (hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.50 x 109/L; platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L, bilirubin within UNL;
             alkaline phosphatase ≤ 1.5 x UNL; ALT, AST ≤ UNL or ≤ 2.5 x UNL in case of liver
             metastases; albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL; creatinine ≤ UNL

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Prior anthracycline limited to doxorubicin equivalent of 280mg/m2 with progression
             free interval of at least 12 months for patients who have been pre-treated with CAELYX

          -  LVEF must be within normal limits

          -  Signed and dated informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy, hormonal, radiation or immunotherapy or participation in any
             investigational drug study within 4 weeks of study entry

          -  Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy &gt; Grade 1

          -  Presence of cirrhosis or active or chronic hepatitis

          -  Presence of serious cardiac (congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial
             infarction within one year prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or
             arrhythmia), neurological or psychiatric disorder

          -  Presence of uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any condition which in the judgment
             of the Investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the
             results of the study

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease

          -  Pregnancy or lactation or unwillingness to use adequate method of birth control

          -  Active infection

          -  Known history of allergy to mannitol, boron or liposomally formulated drugs.
