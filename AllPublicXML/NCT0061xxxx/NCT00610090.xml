    <textblock>
      The primary study objective, at this time, is to follow out to 5 years post implant the
      safety of already enrolled subjects who were treated with the UniFit Aorto-uni-iliac (AUI)
      Endoluminal Stent Graft (the &quot;study device&quot;) for the repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms
      (AAAs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm, prospective study of the safety of the study device for the
      repair of AAAs.

      The investigator will identify eligible patients and explain the study and study device
      placement procedure to each patient and/or any available family members. Patients who provide
      written informed consent will be evaluated for study eligibility within the time period
      identified under Duration of Treatment. Patients who are confirmed to be eligible, based on
      screening assessment findings, will be enrolled in the study.

      After hospital discharge, patients will attend study center visits at 30 days, 6 months, and
      1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post-procedure for follow-up evaluations.
