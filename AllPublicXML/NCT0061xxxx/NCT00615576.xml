        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male smokers who are between 18-65 years of age with normal
             genitourinary anatomy based on physical examination.

          -  The subjects should have a normal colour Doppler epididymal ultrasound (normal blood
             flow and epididymal morphology) at screening.

          -  The first 10 mL of urine voided (VB1) should be normal at screening and pre-dose.

          -  Male subjects must agree to abstain from or use a condom during sexual intercourse
             with pregnant females; or use a condom/spermicide, in addition to having their female
             partner use another form of contraception, such as an IUD, diaphragm with spermicide,
             oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone, subdermal implants or a tubal ligation,
             if engaging in sexual intercourse with a female partner who could become pregnant.
             This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication
             until 84 days after the last dose of study medication.

             OATP1B1 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index , and including vitamins and herbal
             remedies such as St John's Wort prior to dose of study medication.

          -  Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice within seven days prior to the first
             dose of study medication.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period prior to dosing.

          -  Exposure to more than 3 new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Participation in a trial with any drug within 3 months before the start of the study
             or participation in a trial with a new chemical entity within 4 months before the
