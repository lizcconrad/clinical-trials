    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia and North America. The aim of this trial is to
      compare two insulin degludec (NN1250, SIBA) formulations with each other and with insulin
      glargine, all in combination with metformin in insulin naive subjects with type 2 diabetes.

    <description>Physical examination was performed at screening (Week -4), randomisation (Week 0) and after 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. If any new findings or deterioration in previous findings were observed during the trial, these were recorded as AEs and are therefore not presented separately as no analysis was performed.</description>

             days within the last 3 months)

          -  Treatment with one or two oral anti-diabetic drug (OADs): metformin, sulphonylurea
             (SU) (or other insulin secretagogue e.g. repaglinide, nateglinide), alpha-glucosidase
             inhibitors for at least 2 months at a stable maximally tolerated dose or at least half
             maximally allowed dose according to the summary of product characteristics (SPC) or
             locally approved PI

          -  HbA1c 7.0-11.0 % (both inclusive)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) 23-42 kg/m^2 [lb/in^2 x 703] (both inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metformin contraindication according to local practice

          -  Thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment within previous three months prior to visit 1

          -  Any systemic treatment with products which in the Investigator's opinion could
             interfere with glucose or lipid metabolism (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) three
             months prior to randomisation

          -  Subject has a clinically significant, active (during the past 12 months) disease of
             the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurological, genitourinary, or haematological system
             (except for conditions associated with type 2 diabetes) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may confound the results of the trial or pose additional risk in
             administering trial drug
