      The purpose of this study is to attempt to eliminate the necessity of immunosuppressive
      therapy for HLA-identical sibling Kidney Transplants, examine cellular chimerism of donor
      hematopoietic stem cell (DHSC) lineages for pairs to demonstrate immunologic
      unresponsiveness, and to investigate the safety and efficacy of the treatment regimen
      including withdrawal of immunosuppression after one year post-transplant for those recipients
      having received DHSC infusions.

      Primary Study Objectives:

        1. To remove all immunosuppressive therapy from recipients of HLA-identical sibling renal
           transplants within 24 months of transplantation.

        2. To detect and follow cellular (macro) chimerism of donor hematopoietic stem cell (DHSC)
           lineages and the generation of T-regulatory cells using specialized immunomonitoring
           assays for these donor/recipient pairs to demonstrate specific immunologic
           unresponsiveness.

        3. To investigate the safety and efficacy of a treatment regimen consisting of induction
           therapy with Campath-1H and steroid-free low dose maintenance immunosuppression,
           consisting of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus converted to sirolimus. This is
           to be followed by complete withdrawal of immunosuppression beginning at one year, at a
           minimum, post transplant, in recipients who have also been given four infusions of
           purified donor hematopoietic Cluster of Differentiation (CD)34+ stem cells (DHSC).
