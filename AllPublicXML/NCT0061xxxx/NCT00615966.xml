      Ischemia-reperfusion injury, which occurs when the blood supply to an organ, or part of an
      organ, is cut off and subsequently restored, is an important clinical problem in the organ
      transplant setting. Diannexin, a recombinant form of the endogenous human Annexin V protein,
      is in development as a therapeutic agent designed to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury
      following organ transplantation. Pharmacology studies indicate that Diannexin has protective
      effect in various ischemia-reperfusion injury and organ transplantation models. Diannexin
      binds to phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces, which is believed to underlie its ability to
      attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury. In a completed Phase 1 trial, Diannexin was judged
      safe and well tolerated in healthy adult subjects. The present study is designed to determine
      the safety and tolerability of single escalating doses of Diannexin in kidney transplant
      recipients.
