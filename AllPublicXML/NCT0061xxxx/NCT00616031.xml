      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Nitroglycerin may help carboplatin and paclitaxel work better by making tumor cells
      more sensitive to the drugs.

      PURPOSE: This phase II randomized trial is studying how well giving nitroglycerin together
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin works and compares it to giving paclitaxel and carboplatin
      alone in treating patients with previously untreated stage III or stage IV non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate tumor response rate and safety of nitroglycerin as a potentiator of
           anticancer combination therapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with
           previously untreated stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive nitroglycerin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin. In both arms, treatment continues
           for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
