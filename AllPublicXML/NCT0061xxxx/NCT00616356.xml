    <textblock>
      The investigators at Rockefeller University are doing this research to study how the immune
      system responds to viruses and other infectious agents by using the yellow fever 17D vaccine
      as a model. The YFV-17D vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines known and
      has been used to vaccinate humans against yellow fever virus (YFV) infection since the 1930s.
      By studying how the human immune system responds to the YFV vaccine we hope to learn more
      about the normal functioning of the immune system so that it might be possible to design new,
      more effective types of vaccines to prevent important infectious diseases.

      The reason for doing this research is:

      Currently there is very little information about which factors determine the effectiveness of
      the initial (primary) immune response to a foreign substance (antigen), such as a virus, that
      person may be exposed to. There is also very little known about what determines how
      effectively and for how long a person's immune system can react to the same antigen to
      prevent another infection. Studies in animals have given us important information about how
      the immune systems of other animals behave upon initial or repeated exposure to antigens,but
      these topics have not been studied in detail in humans.

      The following hypotheses will be tested:

        -  The magnitude of the initial expansion of T lymphocytes (the &quot;clonal burst&quot;) specific
           for the infecting virus determines the level at which memory T cell responses are
           generated against the specific viral antigen and the duration of the memory T cell
           response generated in the body.

        -  The majority of CD8 T cells generated after immunization are yellow fever specific and
           not &quot;bystander activation&quot; of non-specific cells.
