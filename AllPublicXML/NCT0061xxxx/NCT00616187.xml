    <textblock>
      A phase II open-label baseline-to-treatment trial was designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of orally administered atorvastatin in patients with
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Patients with at least one
      gadolinium-enhancing lesion (CEL) at screening by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were
      eligible for the study. Patients are screened and enrolled in the outpatient clinic of the
      Cecilie Vogt Clinic at the Charité - University Medicine Berlin. After a baseline period of 3
      monthly MRI scans (months -2 to 0), patients followed a 9-month treatment period on 80 mg
      atorvastatin daily. The primary endpoint is the number of CEL in treatment months 6 to 9
      compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints include other MRI-based parameters and changes in
      clinical scores and immune responses.
