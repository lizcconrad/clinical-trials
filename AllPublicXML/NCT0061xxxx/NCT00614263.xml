      Examine levels of sedation required for patients to comfortably undergo colonoscopy using
      propofol and if adjunct monitoring equipment promotes patient safety.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propofol for sedation during outpatient endoscopy has become a popular technique in place of
      midazolam and opioid sedation. It has been associated with improved patient satisfaction and
      a faster recovery with less nausea and vomiting. However, there are a number of potential
      adverse effects associated with propofol. It has no analgesic effects; therefore, when used
      for moderate sedation procedures it frequently has to provide deeper levels of sedation to
      allow a painful procedure to be performed.

      Some patients are sedated to the level of general anesthesia and may develop respiratory
      depression or airway obstruction requiring immediate airway support.

      We examined the level of sedation required for patients to comfortably undergo routine
      colonoscopy using propofol and what monitoring system would best predict the patients who
      might need an airway intervention.
