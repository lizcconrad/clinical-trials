  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease is a disease that contributes to significant morbidity and
      mortality of millions of Americans yearly. Very little is known about the pathophysiology of
      atherosclerosis in peripheral artery disease. We plan to collect peripheral arteries and
      muscle tissue from patients undergoing amputation for end stage peripheral arterial occlusive
      disease. By extracting the RNA from these arteries and tissues and comparing them with RNA
      expression from normal arteries, we hope to have a better understanding of the
      pathophysiology of atherosclerosis in this setting. We aim to prove the hypothesis that a
      novel gene expression pattern can be discovered by the successful extraction of RNA from
      plaques from human peripheral arteries.

      Patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity amputation will be consented for extraction of
      plaque from the carotid artery or arterial tissue from the amputated limbs. The surgeon will
      perform the amputation, then the harvest team will collect arterial tissue from amputated
      limbs. These samples will be immersed in RNALater solution to preserve the integrity of the
      RNA. Tissues will stored at -80oC in the RNALater until the RNA is later extracted using a
      standardized protocol. The RNA will be examined for quality using an Agilent bioanalyzer, and
      will then be processed on Affymetrix U133A chips for gene expression data. The data will be
      analyzed with the MATLAB software package.
