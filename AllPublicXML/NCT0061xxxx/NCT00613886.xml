  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project is designed to determine which combination of tests will enable
      physicians to predict whether a patient with symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
      will improve with a shunt.

    <intervention_name>Programmable Shunt Insertion (Codman, Medtronic)</intervention_name>
    <description>Medical Device - Shunt insertion surgery of adjustable valve and laparoscopic assistance for placement of peritoneal catheter. Patient will be brought to operating room suite where general anesthesia is induced. Patient will be placed with a small roll on shoulder, supine, on the operating room table. Patient's head will be turned with the parietal area uppermost in the field. Patient will be prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Site prep includes parietooccipital area, side of neck, chest, and entire abdomen. Ventricular catheter placed and then attached to shunt valve. Catheter is then fitted over grooved blue burr hole guide. Excess catheter pulled down to pull valve into pocket on the skull. Sterile dressings applied.</description>
