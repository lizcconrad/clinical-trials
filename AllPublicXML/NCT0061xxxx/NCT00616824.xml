  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to compare postoperative outcomes of a tissue expander placement following
      a mastectomy with two different operative techniques. This study will be randomized and
      double blinded comparing the traditional placement of the tissue expander under an
      inferolateral serratus muscle flap to a new technique which uses an acellular dermal matrix
      as an inferolateral sling, instead of the muscle flap.

      The study we are proposing will evaluate the question of whether there is a difference
      between the traditional method of serratus flap and the new technique of using an acellular
      matrix with tissue expander placement. This will be a double blinded randomized study of
      thirty women in each group comparing outcomes which will include postoperative pain,
      complications (wound infection, hematoma, capsular contracture, etc), and patient
      satisfaction with the procedure.
