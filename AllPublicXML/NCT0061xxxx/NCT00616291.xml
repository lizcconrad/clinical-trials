      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response
      to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of a peptide vaccine in treating
      patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerance of NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 class-I and class-II vaccine
           administered subcutaneously in patients with androgen-independent metastatic prostate
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the response induced by immunotherapy with a combined class-I and class-II
           NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 vaccine to responses obtained to either class I or class II peptides
           alone.

        -  Evaluate whether the inclusion of class-II epitopes in a peptide vaccine will result in
           a better antitumor immune response than class-I epitopes alone.

        -  Determine antitumor activity by antigen response assays including cytokine elaboration,
           changes in frequency of peripheral T cells that recognize tumor, and intra/peritumoral
           cellular infiltrates and cytokine expression in responding and nonresponding metastasis.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1 peptide vaccine subcutaneously every other week for
      12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The initial cohorts
      of patients are treated with one course of either MHC Class I-binding or MHC Class II-binding
      peptides. If these Class I or Class II binding peptides are safe individually, subsequent
      cohorts of patients with appropriate HLA type receive both types of peptides in combination.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate cancer with evidence of progressive disease despite
             hormonal therapy (i.e., hormone-refractory prostate cancer)

               -  Metastatic disease

               -  Progressive disease defined by any of the following:

                    -  New bone lesion on bone scan

                    -  Progression of nodal or soft tissue as evidenced by standard radiographic
                       methods, i.e., CT scan or MRI

                    -  A 50% increase in PSA level from the nadir PSA level confirmed twice and
                       measured at least 2 weeks apart, with stable and measurable disease

          -  Castrate serum levels of testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL

          -  If patient was receiving anti-androgen therapy, in addition to luteinizing
             hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy, the evidence of progressive disease
             should persist after a trial of anti-androgen withdrawal
