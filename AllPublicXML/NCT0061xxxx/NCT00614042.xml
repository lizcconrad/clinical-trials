  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TRU-016 in patients
      with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and to obtain an estimate of clinical
      activity in patients with CLL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      This Phase 1/1b open-label study consists of two parts. The initial portion is a Phase 1
      dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of TRU-016 administered over a
      4-week period to patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It will identify
      the MTD and evaluate the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of TRU-016. Upon demonstrating
      satisfactory safety and tolerability in the Phase 1 portion, a Phase 1b expansion cohort will
      be enrolled to further characterize the safety of the selected dose from the first stage of
      the study and safety and to estimate the clinical activity of TRU-016 in patients with
      treatment-naive CLL, relapsed CLL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
