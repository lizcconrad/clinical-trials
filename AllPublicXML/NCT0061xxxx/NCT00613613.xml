  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn whether genetics plays a role in predicting response to
      a commonly used and FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved medication for lowering
      triglycerides and cholesterol. Our hypothesis: The pharmacogenetics of genes which affect
      drug metabolism (how the body handles the drug) and drug targets (how the drug acts on the
      body) influences how a person responds to the lipid lowering medication- fenofibrate.

      We seek to screen over 200 subjects for select candidate genes to serve as a source of
      subjects which may participate in a genotype guided investigation as to the predictability of
      response based on genotype. Response endpoints relate to lipid parameters and other variables
      of interest to cardiovascular endpoints. Subjects with genotypes of interest would then be
      enrolled into a short term clinical trial evaluating their response to fenofibrate based on
      their genetic profile ascertained from the screening phase. We hope to evaluate ~50 subjects
      in the second phase.
