  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the antitumor effects and safety of bendamustine
      hydrochloride (SyB L-0501) in patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or mantle
      cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma is treated mainly with radiation and chemotherapy
      using a combination of chemotherapies, such as purine-analogues and CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). After the approval of an antibody therapy agent
      RituximabÂ®, it alone or combination with CHOP has been introduced. Bendamustine hydrochloride
      has a unique structure compared with the marketed agents, and has an innovative mechanism of
      action. Thus, it is expected that Bendamustine hydrochloride will provide new alternatives
      for patients with refractory/recurrent indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma.

    <description>bendamustine hydrochloride is administered by 60-min drip infusion at 120 mg/m2/day for 2 consecutive days, and the course is then observed for 19 days. This is one cycle and administration is repeated for 3 - 6 cycles. From the second cycle, the dose is reduced or administration is discontinued as required based on adverse events observed in the previous cycle or observation of the course.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with prior therapy who satisfy the conditions listed below.
        No restrictions regarding gender.

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed indolent B cell Non-Hodgkin's
             lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma.

          -  Patients who had not received treatment for at least 4 weeks (for at least 12 weeks in
             the case of antibody therapy) after completion of prior therapy and who are judged to
             carry no effect from the prior therapy.

          -  Patients aged from 20 to less than 75 years.

          -  Performance Status (P.S.): 0 or 1.

             liver, and kidney functions).

          -  Patients from whom written consent to participate in this study has been obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded.

             infarction, ischemic heart disease).

          -  Patients with serious digestive symptoms (nausea/ vomiting/ diarrhea).

          -  Patients who are known to be positive for HBV, HCV or HIC.

          -  Patients receiving other investigational drugs within 3 months before registration in

          -  Patients with allogenic bone-marrow transplant.

          -  Women who are pregnant, of childbearing potential, or lactating.

          -  Patients who do not agree to contraception.
