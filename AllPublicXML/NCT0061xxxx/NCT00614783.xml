  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal study to determine the accuracy of a new device (SCOUT) in screening
      persons for pre-diabetes or diabetes. SCOUT will be compared to the standard screening test
      (Fasting Plasma Glucose), using the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test as the reference standard.

      SCOUT uses a rapid, noninvasive, light-based technology to measure the concentration of
      chemicals in the skin called advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Several studies have
      demonstrated that AGEs accumulate in skin faster in individuals with poor control of blood
      sugar.

      Persons will be eligible for the study if they are 'at risk' for diabetes based on their age
      and other risk factors as defined by the American Diabetes Association.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current methods for detecting pre-diabetes and diabetes are inconvenient and inaccurate. The
      most widely used screening test, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), requires an overnight fast and
      a blood draw. FPG also has poor sensitivity contributing to late diagnoses. A more accurate
      and convenient screening method, like SCOUT, will improve early detection and allow the
      physician to begin a treatment regimen to prevent or delay the development of the disease and
      its serious complications.
