    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 Weeks, and 48 Weeks/Early Termination</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) over 48 weeks measured by cardiac MRI. The effects of paricalcitol injection on progression or regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in participants with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) compared to placebo. Left Ventricular Mass is normalized to the participant's height by the following equation to obtain LVMI: LVM (g) divided by height (m)2.7.
The primary comparison was between the 4 mcg paricalcitol injection and the placebo treatment groups in the change from baseline to Week 48.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 220 participants were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to each treatment group to receive paricalcitol injection or placebo at 75 US and ex-US sites. A stratified randomization scheme was used to ensure balance among treatment groups with respect to country, sex, and baseline Renin Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitor use.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Screening Period consisted of 3 visits and occurred within 6 weeks prior to participant randomization and enrollment into the Treatment Period of the study. For enrollment, all screening labs and echocardiogram requirements had to be met. Also, a technically adequate cardiac MRI had to be obtained for participant to be randomized into study.</pre_assignment_details>

The effects of paricalcitol injection on progression or regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in participants with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) compared to placebo. Left Ventricular Mass is normalized to the participant's height by the following equation to obtain LVMI: LVM (g) divided by height (m)2.7.
The primary comparison was between the 4 mcg paricalcitol injection and the placebo treatment groups in the change from baseline to Week 48.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Biological Marker Plasma B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)</title>
          <description>Plasma BNP is a product from the heart that becomes elevated with an enlarged heart and its level may be affected by treatment with paricalcitol. The study was terminated early (prior to any subject reaching Week 24). The values are for Baseline and Early Termination only. Each of the 12 randomized subjects terminated at different study weeks; therefore Early Termination cannot be defined as a specific week and varies for different subjects. Of the 12 subjects, 11 had early termination visits and 1 didn't. The final visit week range is 4-16.</description>
          <population>The Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population - all randomized participants administered at least one dose of study drug. Results reported are from the early termination visit analysis for the subjects who terminated prematurely. None of the participants completed 24 or 48 weeks.</population>
