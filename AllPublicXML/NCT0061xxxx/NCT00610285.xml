  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a way to accurately treat brain tumors. SRS involves the
      use of a special head frame to keep the head from moving during treatment. The head frame
      makes very accurate treatment possible. The frame must be attached to the skull with special
      pins. It feels very tight and can hurt. A special immobilization device can be used to keep
      the head from moving.

      This device does not need any pins and does not hurt. We would like to see if the new way of
      holding the head still can be used for SRS. This is the purpose of the study. New X-Ray
      machines can be used to find if the head has moved in the mask. We hope that we can use these
      new tools to treat brain tumors just as accurately without using a head frame. It will make
      treatment more comfortable for the patient. This is why we are asking patients to join the
      study.

    <description>This is a feasibility study to evaluate the accuracy of an alternative, non-invasive immobilization system in combination with image guided patient setup for SRS treatments. The aim is to determine whether or not the non-invasive system can provide comparable accuracy as the conventional invasive head ring system. If successful, patient discomfort can be significantly reduced for such treatments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed malignancy with the presence of intraparenchymal brain
             metastases.

          -  A diagnostic contrast enhanced MRI demonstrating the presence of brain metastases
             performed within two weeks prior to registration.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Must be scheduled or planning to be scheduled for SRS treatment.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥60.

          -  Patient must sign a study-specific informed consent form. If the patient's mental
             status precludes his/her giving informed consent, written informed consent may be
             given by the patient's legal representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide informed consent

          -  Major medical illness including poor cardiac or pulmonary status which would result in
             inability of the patient to lie down for the procedure.

          -  Inability to obtain histologic proof of malignancy.

          -  Younger than 18 years of age.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.3 mg/dl.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≤50.

          -  Allergy to either CT or MR contrast dyes.
