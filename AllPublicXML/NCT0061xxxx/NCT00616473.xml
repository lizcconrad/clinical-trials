      The purpose of this study is to examine key organizational structures and processes
      (leadership, teamwork, communication, palliative care) and their impact on the quality of
      end-of-life care for dying residents and their family members.

    <textblock>
      As the American population ages, nursing homes are rapidly becoming a dominant site for
      death. Currently, 25% of all deaths occur in nursing homes and 35% of all elders over the age
      of 85 die in nursing homes. By 2020, 40% of those over 65 will die in nursing homes. Nursing
      home residents die in pain with undue psychosocial suffering. For all permanently placed
      residents, death is inevitable. Nonetheless, how residents die, is not.

      There have been long standing concerns about the quality of care and quality of life in
      nursing homes. Although there is some evidence that the quality of care for nursing home
      residents has improved, serious problems continue in areas that potentially affect
      end-of-life such as dehydration, pressure ulcers, and pain. Efforts to improve care have
      rarely considered the dynamic nature of nursing home structure and process factors, such as
      staffing levels, leadership of the director of nursing, or communication and teamwork among
      staff that facilitate or impede the organization's ability to improve care processes.
      Findings from our preliminary studies in nursing homes indicate that organizational structure
      and process factors make a difference in end-of-life care for residents and their family
      members. More specifically, staff education, staffing levels, leadership of the DON and
      administrator, teamwork and communication among direct care staff, and incorporating
      palliative care clinical practices into day-to-day care had a profound impact on outcomes
      such as the honoring of end-of-life preferences, symptom management, and satisfaction with
      care. A more generalizable understanding of key structure and process factors and their
      relationship to resident care and outcomes at the end-of-life will provide a foundation for
      future intervention studies aimed at improving care.
