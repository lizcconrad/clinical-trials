      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides and a person's dendritic cells may help the body build
      an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients with malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of autologous dendritic
           cells pulsed with synthetic glioma-associated antigen (GAA) peptides in patients with
           malignant gliomas.

        -  Determine survival, tumor progression, and cellular immune response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo leukapheresis for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC). Autologous dendritic cells (DC) are prepared from autologous PBMC exposed to
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), matured with a cytokine cocktail, and pulsed
      with synthetic glioma-associated antigen (GAA) peptides. Cohorts of patients receive
      escalating doses of GAA peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine until the maximum
      tolerated dose is determined.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year.
