      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as Hu3S193, can block tumor growth in different ways.
      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well Hu3S193 works in treating patients with
      ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cavity cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 in women with
           platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer,
           based on RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety of the study drug.

        -  To determine the drug pharmacokinetics when administered in multiple weekly injections.

      Exploratory analysis

        -  Clinical Benefit (objective response rate + tumor stabilization).

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS).

        -  Duration of Response.

        -  Overall Survival.

        -  12-month survival rate.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 1-8.
      Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly.

    <description>Best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Includes all patients evaluable for efficacy, regardless of used criteria: RECIST or CA-125 (Cancer Antigen 125).
Evaluation of target lesions: Complete Response (CR), resolution of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD sum) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline LD sum; Progressive Disease (PD), a 20% increase in LD sum of target lesions or the appearance of new lesion(s); Stable Disease (SD), no sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD. Evaluation of non-target lesions: CR, resolution of all non-target lesions and normalization of CA-125 level; SD, persistence of one or more non-target lesions and/or maintenance of CA-125 level above the normal limits; PD, appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

          <title>Expression of the Lewis Y antigen in tumor tissue</title>
          <description>Expression of Lewis Y was investigated by immunohistochemistry on primary or metastatic tumor biopsies. To determine Lewis Y expression levels, a semi-quantitative approach was used, which considered cytoplasm and membrane compartments independently. The score taken into account was from the higher expression observed, either cytoplasm or membrane.
Participants with positive expression of Lewis Y in tumor were scored, according to the percentage of positively stained cells, into the following categories: +4 (&gt;75% positive cells); +3 (51 to 75%); +2 (26 to 50%); and +1 (1 to 25%).</description>
