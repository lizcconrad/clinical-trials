  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are serious and growing problems within the United States. The usual
      approaches to weight loss-dieting, exercise, and behavioral interventions-rarely result in
      long-term weight loss. Therefore, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of glucomannan, a
      fiber supplement that has promising weight loss effects.

      The primary objective of this exploratory project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a
      highly viscous, water-soluble fiber supplement, glucomannan, for achieving weight loss in
      overweight and moderately obese individuals. Overweight and obesity are major public health
      problems in the U.S. that account for substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.
      Conventional approaches to weight loss are largely ineffective, particularly for long-term
      weight loss and maintenance. Thus, there is a critical need for safe and effective adjunctive
      treatments. A few, limited studies suggest that glucomannan supplementation is associated
      with weight loss, is well-tolerated, and has a favorable safety profile.

      In this preliminary study, the target population will be overweight and moderately obese
      individuals, a population that accounts for nearly 50% of all U.S. adults. The specific aims
      of the project are to: 1) describe the safety of glucomannan for achieving weight loss in
      overweight and moderately obese individuals, and 2) describe the efficacy of glucomannan for
      achieving weight loss in overweight and moderately obese individuals. Participants will take
      glucomannan supplements daily for eight weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomized clinical trial. Safety and efficacy outcome measures include: gastrointestinal
      symptoms/tolerance, hepatic panel, serum creatinine, weight, body composition, diet intake,
      hunger/fullness, lipid profile, blood glucose, and C-reactive protein. Examination of the
      safety and efficacy of glucomannan for achieving weight loss will extend our understanding of
      additional treatments that may be effective in combating a significant public health problem.
