    <textblock>
      Background: Routine oral examination (ROE) refers to periodic monitoring of the general and
      oral health status of patients. In most developed Western countries a decreasing prevalence
      of oral diseases underpins the need for a more individualised approach in assigning recall
      intervals for regular attendees instead of systematic decision making of fixed intervals.
      From a quality of care perspective as well, one can also question the effectiveness of the
      widespread prophylactic removal of mandibular impacted asymptomatic third molars (MIM) in
      adolescents and adults. It is as yet unclear how quality of oral care can be improved.
      Research data on effectiveness of interventions to promote continuing professional
      development for dentists are rare.

      Methods/Design: This implementation study is a cluster randomised controlled trial with
      groups of GDPs as the unit of randomisation. The aim of the study is to determine the
      effectiveness and efficiency of small group quality improvement on professional decision
      making of general dental practitioners (GDPs) in daily practice. Six peer groups
      ('IQual-groups') shall be randomised either to the intervention group I or group II. Groups
      of GDPs allocated to either of these arms act as each other's control group. An IQual peer
      group consists of 8-10 GDPs who attend in monthly structured sessions scheduled for
      discussion on practice related topics.

      GDPs in both trail arms receive recent developed evidence-based CPG on ROE or MIM
      respectively. The implementation strategy consists of 1 interactive IQual circle meeting of
      mostly 2-3 hours. In addition, both groups of GDPs receive feedback on personal and group
      characteristics and are invited to make use of web-based patient vignettes for further
      individual training on risk assessment policy. A few weeks after the interactive meeting
      reminders (flow charts) will be send by mail.

      The main outcome measure for the ROE-study and control group is the use and appropriateness
      of individualised risk assessment in assigning recall intervals and for the MIM-study the use
      and appropriateness of individualised mandibular impacted third molar risk management.

      Measurements (pre-intervention data collection) will take place in months 1-3, starting in
      September 2006. Post-intervention data collection will be performed after 9 months.

      Discussion: In most developed Western countries a decreasing prevalence of oral diseases
      underpins the need for a more individualised approach in assigning recall intervals for
      regular attendees. If the evaluation of this multifaceted implementation study reveals a
      shift in individual performance of GDPs in assessing risks for oral disease, further research
      questions and efforts to a risk-based professional education could be promoted.

      Scientific hypothesis Multifaceted implementation of consensus based clinical practice
      guidelines (CPGs) for GDPs on ROEs and the management of asymptomatic impacted third molars
      (MIM) in daily dental practice is more effective and efficient compared to only dissemination
      of CPGs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        GDPs inclusion criteria

          -  GDPs have to work in general dental practice for at least three days/week and should
             have practice experience for at least three years. They were eligible if their
             practice population was characterised by primary oral care patients, consisting of
             regular attendees, and patient recordkeeping was conducted electronically. GDPs had to
             give their informed consent to assess and evaluate electronically patient records.
             Patient data were collected anonymously.

        Patient's inclusion criteria

        To be eligible for inclusion, patients should meet (fulfil) several criteria, depending on
        the IQual's CPG to be used (ROE or MIM):

        ROE:

          -  All patients regularly visiting their dentist (at least once a year) over the past
             three years for ROEs will be included in the study.

        MIM:

          -  All patients regularly visiting their dentist (at least once a year) over the past
             three years for ROEs are included for the study and, in addition, have to be aged
             between 17 and 35 years, with disease-free impacted mandibular third molars in
             retention.

        For both group of patients, it is important that they can be linked particular to the
        participating GDP, especially in practices with more than one GDP occupied

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient's exclusion criteria

        ROE:

          -  Patients with symptomatic driven (emergency) attendance in dental practice, or
             recently started regular attendance in the participating dental practice (within past
             three years).

        MIM:

          -  Patients with symptomatic third molars in dental practice, or recently started regular
             attendance (past three years) or who already had their third molars removed.
