      Purpose/objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the CAM biofield
      therapy of Healing Touch to improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in women with
      breast cancer receiving radiation therapy. The proposed study will build on existing research
      by Cook, Guerrio and Slater (2004) who studied Healing Touch and HRQOL in women receiving
      radiation therapy for breast and gynecologic cancers. Outcome measures of HRQOL as measured
      by Short Form-36 (SF-36) tool were used (Norris et al. 2004). The SF-36 is a tool to measure
      HRQOL, a 36 item tool that measures nine domains of health: a) functional limitations in
      physical activity secondary to health problems, b) limitations in social activity secondary
      to physical or mental health issues, c) limitation in role activities secondary to physical
      health problems, d) limitation in role activities secondary emotional health problems, e) to
      pain, f) overall mental health, g) vitality, h) perceptions of health and i) health
      transitions (Norris et. al., 2004). Measurements were taken at baseline and end of study.

      Cook et al (2004) found that all women in the study had improved scores on the HRQOL Short
      Form-36 (SF-36) tool used (Norris et al. 2004). Equally important, the women who received
      Healing Touch had greater improvement in all subscale scores in comparison to placebo
      treatment. The overall score on the SF-36 (p value .00) and areas of emotional role
      functioning (p value .00), mental health (p value .03) and health transitions (p value .00)
      had statistical significance in the Healing Touch treatment group. The placebo treatment
      group had statistical significance in the areas of physical role functioning (p value .00)
      and health transition (p value .01).In group comparisons of mean SF-36 scores, the Healing
      Touch group had statistically greater improvement, than the placebo group, with a p value of
      &lt; .05, in the areas of physical functioning, pain and vitality.

      The total number of participants in the study was 62 women, with 38 who had gynecologic
      cancers and 24 participants with breast cancer. The number of breast cancer patients was
      inadequate to perform a separate statistical analysis of this sub-group (Cook et al., 2004).
      Therefore, this study will specifically focus on women with breast cancer to investigate the
      efficacy of using Healing Touch to improve HRQOL improvement in women with breast cancer
      receiving radiation therapy.

      Research Aims The research aim of the proposed study is to determine the efficacy of Healing
      Touch in significantly improving HRQOL, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Breast (FACT-B)(Brady et al., 1997; Cella et al., 1993) scale among women receiving
      radiation therapy for breast cancer treatment (see Appendix A for FACT-B; see Appendix B for
      FACT-B scoring).

      Research Hypothesis Healing Touch significantly improves HRQOL, as measured by the FACT-B,
      when compared to a placebo treatment, among women receiving radiation therapy for treatment
      of breast cancer.

    <description>The sham/placebo treatment will consist of the RN graduate assistant standing near the table, slowly walking around from each side and to the foot of the table stopping periodically. The RN graduate assistant will be instructed to not focus on the patient in thought. While providing the placebo treatment the RN graduate assistant will mentally do multiplication equations. This serves as a distracter to keep the RN graduate assistant from setting intention or thoughts on the participant. At no time will the RN performing the placebo treatment move hands or arms over or around the participant or come in physical contact with the participant. The placebo treatment will be a minimum of 20 minutes but no greater than 30 minutes in length. A timer will be set in the treatment room to notify the practitioner of the time limit.</description>

    <description>Behavioral: Healing Touch The Healing Touch intervention will consist of a brief meditative state in which the practitioners sets the intention of healing for the session. A hand scan to assess the biofield; consists of a technique of where the practitioner slowly moves her hands three to six inches above the body going from head to toe, to assess for any disturbances in the biofield; a non-contact Healing Touch treatment which will follow, to include a connection of the chakras. The chakras are connected by placing the hands above the body over each chakra, starting at the feet and progressing to the head. This will be followed by smoothing the biofield, achieved by the Practitioner slowly moving her hands above the body from the head and moving towards the feet (Hover-Kramer et al., 1996). At no time will the Practitioner make physical contact with the participant during the treatment. The treatment will be 20 minutes to 30 minutes in length.</description>
