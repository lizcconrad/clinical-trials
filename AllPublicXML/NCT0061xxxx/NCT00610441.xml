  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial of MK-8777 (Org 26576, SCH
      900777) in adult subjects with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). MK-8777 or
      placebo will be administered in a crossover fashion for two 3-week treatment periods. The two
      3-week treatment periods will be separated by a 2-week placebo washout period.

      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of various doses of MK-8777 to that of
      placebo in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in adults.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL) and Day 7, Day 14, Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The AISRS is an 18-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the 18 core symptoms of ADHD corresponding to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic symptoms for adults. Based on the clinician's rating for each of the symptoms using a 4-point scale (0=None to 3=Severe), the AISRS total score is derived by summing the score assigned to each of the 18 symptoms. Scores can range from 0 to 54, with a higher score indicating a more severe ADHD symptoms. Baseline was defined as the score at the baseline visit prior to starting dosing for Period 1 and as the last score in the 2-week placebo wash-out period for Period 2. For the statistical analyses, the average score from Day 14 and Day 21 was used.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 7, Day 14, Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a participant-rated scale to assess the quality of sleep. The PSQI consists of 7 component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each component score can range from 0=better (i.e., 0 times per month) to 3=worse (i.e., 3 or more times per week). The sum of these 7 component scores yields one total score with a range of 0 (better) to 21 (worse). A total PSQI score &lt;=5 is associated with good sleep quality; a total score &gt;5 is associated with poor sleep quality. Baseline was defined as the score at the baseline visit prior to starting dosing for Period 1 and as the last score in the 2-week placebo wash-out period for Period 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) Score</title>
        <description>The AISRS is an 18-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the 18 core symptoms of ADHD corresponding to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic symptoms for adults. Based on the clinician’s rating for each of the symptoms using a 4-point scale (0=None to 3=Severe), the AISRS total score is derived by summing the score assigned to each of the 18 symptoms. Scores can range from 0 to 54, with a higher score indicating a more severe ADHD symptoms. Baseline was defined as the score at the baseline visit prior to starting dosing for Period 1 and as the last score in the 2-week placebo wash-out period for Period 2. For the statistical analyses, the average score from Day 14 and Day 21 was used.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (BL) and Day 7, Day 14, Day 21</time_frame>
        <population>The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population consisted of all participants who were randomized, who received at least one dose of study drug in at least one period, and who had at least one postbaseline AISRS efficacy assessment. Results are reported by the study drug being administered at time of assessment and not by randomly assigned sequence.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) Score</title>
          <description>The AISRS is an 18-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the 18 core symptoms of ADHD corresponding to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic symptoms for adults. Based on the clinician’s rating for each of the symptoms using a 4-point scale (0=None to 3=Severe), the AISRS total score is derived by summing the score assigned to each of the 18 symptoms. Scores can range from 0 to 54, with a higher score indicating a more severe ADHD symptoms. Baseline was defined as the score at the baseline visit prior to starting dosing for Period 1 and as the last score in the 2-week placebo wash-out period for Period 2. For the statistical analyses, the average score from Day 14 and Day 21 was used.</description>
          <population>The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population consisted of all participants who were randomized, who received at least one dose of study drug in at least one period, and who had at least one postbaseline AISRS efficacy assessment. Results are reported by the study drug being administered at time of assessment and not by randomly assigned sequence.</population>

        <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point clinician-rated scale for assessing the global severity of ADHD. Scores could range from 1=Normal, not at all ill to 7=Among the most extremely ill, with a higher score indicating more severe illness. Categorization was as follows: 1=Normal, not at all ill and Borderline mentally ill; 2=Mildly ill; 3=Moderately ill and 4=Markedly ill, Severely ill and Among the most extremely ill patients, with a higher category indicating more severe illness. Analysis of CGI-S was performed using a proportional odds model. For statistical analyses, CGI-S assessments were condensed to one assessment of severity per treatment period by taking the most severe score at the second and third visits within a treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score</title>
        <description>The ESS is an 8-item scale used to assess sleepiness. The test consists of a list of 8 situations in which participants rate their tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0=Would never doze to 3=High chance of dozing. The scores for each of the 8 situations are added to create a total score on a scale with a range from of 0 to 24. A higher score indicates a greater degree of sleepiness. Baseline was defined as the score at the baseline visit prior to starting dosing for Period 1 and as the last score in the 2-week placebo wash-out period for Period 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Score</title>
        <description>The PSQI is a participant-rated scale to assess the quality of sleep. The PSQI consists of 7 component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each component score can range from 0=better (i.e., 0 times per month) to 3=worse (i.e., 3 or more times per week). The sum of these 7 component scores yields one total score with a range of 0 (better) to 21 (worse). A total PSQI score &lt;=5 is associated with good sleep quality; a total score &gt;5 is associated with poor sleep quality. Baseline was defined as the score at the baseline visit prior to starting dosing for Period 1 and as the last score in the 2-week placebo wash-out period for Period 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomology - Clinician Rating (QIDS-C) Score</title>
        <description>The QIDS-C is a clinician-administered rating scale to measure the severity of depressive symptoms within the 9 DSM-IV major depression disorder symptom (MDD) domains: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, concentration/decision making, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, energy/fatigability, sleep, weight/appetite change, and psychomotor changes. There is one score (0=none to 3=severe) for each of the of the 9 domains. The total score is obtained by adding the scores for each of the 9 symptom domains. QIDS-C total scores can range from 0 to 27, with a higher score indicating more severe depression. Baseline was defined as the score at the baseline visit prior to starting dosing for Period 1 and as the last score in the 2-week placebo wash-out period for Period 2.</description>
