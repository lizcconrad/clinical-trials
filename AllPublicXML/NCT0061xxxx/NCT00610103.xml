      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of KW-6500 versus placebo when
      administered as a subcutaneous injection at the individualized maintenance dose level in an
      OFF state in Parkinson's disease patients with motor response complications on levodopa
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of KW-6500 as a subcutaneous injection at the individualized maintenance dose
      level (1 mg to 6 mg per dose) when used in combination with domperidone (30 mg/day) will be
      evaluated in comparison with that of placebo in Parkinson's disease patients with motor
      response complications on levodopa therapy. The maintenance dose level for each subject will
      be determined using a titration scheme in 1 mg increments.

          -  Patients who have been on a stable regimen of levodopa (at least three times daily)
             plus at least one other antiparkinsonian agent being administered or more frequently
             for at least 30 days before the preliminary evaluation and who have predictable
             end-of-dose wearing-off.

          -  Patients who meet both of the following criteria on the Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale
             during the preliminary evaluation and on the day before starting study drug (Day -1).

               -  Stage IV or V while in the OFF state

               -  Stage II to III while in the ON state

          -  Patients who have experienced a 30% or more improvement in UPDRS Part 3 score when
