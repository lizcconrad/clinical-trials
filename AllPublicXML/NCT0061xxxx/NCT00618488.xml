  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if probiotics bacteria, specifically
      bifidobacterium lactis (BB12) improve gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects with functional
      gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., non-patients IBS/functional bowel disorders).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The apparent success of the use of probiotics in several gut disorders (e.g., IBD and
      rotavirus diarrhea) together with the greater understanding of the role of inflammation and
      intestinal microflora in the pathophysiology of functional bowel disorders has led to
      increased interest in use of probiotics in patients with these symptoms. The data on the use
      of probiotic in certain functional GI disorders (e.g., IBS, bloating, diarrhea) is limited
      but several reported studies show encouraging results and suggest some symptomatic response
      and parallel improvement in quality of life. Functional Bowel Disorders (FBD) - According to
      the Rome II criteria FBD refer to symptoms attributed to the mid or lower GI tract. FBD
      include several clinical subgroups including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional
      diarrhea, functional constipation, functional abdominal bloating, and an unspecified group.
      This study will examine 'Non-Patients IBS,' these are people who have functional
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms but do not sought out medical care for their GI symptoms and
      therefore they are referred to as 'Non-patients'. This study will investigate the overall
      effect of probiotic bacteria (BB12) on GI symptoms in non-patients subjects with functional
      bowel symptoms (FBS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is 18 - 70 y/o.

          -  The subject has any functional GI symptoms that are related to IBS, functional
             diarrhea, functional constipation, or functional bloating according to the Rome II
             criteria for functional GI disorders. The subject has the above symptoms for at least
             two weeks (i.e., active symptoms on enrollment). The subject has not been seen by a
             medical care provider for these symptoms in the 10 months and is not taking prescribed
             medications for these symptoms. Over the counter (OTC) medications are allowed as long
             as the subject is still symptomatic despite current OTC therapy.

          -  For diarrhea we will use the definition of a mean of &gt;2 bowel movements per day, or a
             mean score of &gt; 4 on the Bristol Stool Form Scale per week.

          -  For constipation we will use the definition of a mean of &lt;3 bowel movements per week
             or a need for significant straining for a bowel movement.

          -  The subject's symptoms are mild to moderate in severity. Symptoms severity will be
             assessed at baseline and at the end of the 2-weeks screening period to determine
             eligibility prior randomization. Severity of bowel symptoms will be determined using
             the Francis Whorwell IBS severity scale: Mild &lt;175, Moderate 175-300, Severe &gt;300

          -  Subject must have had a normal colonoscopy within the last 3 years if age &gt;50y/o.

          -  Subjects' initial evaluation at screening visit including medical history, physical
             examination, and laboratory tests are unrevealing i.e., do not show abnormalities that
             require further investigation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject saw a physician for your functional bowel symptoms in the last 10 months

          -  The subject has taken prescribed medications for your functional bowel symptoms

             medical care provider for these symptoms for more than 10 months and are not taking
             prescribed medications for their GI symptoms are eligible.

          -  The subject has a serious, unstable medical condition.

          -  The subject has insulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus.

          -  The subject had a major psychiatric diagnosis or a suicide attempt within the last two

          -  The subject received antibiotic treatment or intentionally consumes probiotic products
             during the last 6 weeks. (If the subject was on antibiotic or probiotics treatment, a
             washout period of 6 weeks is required).

          -  The subject had previous significant gastric or intestinal surgery.

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating due to possible effects of hormonal changes during
             pregnancy on GI functions and/or functional GI symptoms.

          -  The subject is predisposed to infection (i.e. their immune system is compromised, they
             have rheumatic heart disease, an artificial valve, history of bacterial endocarditis,
