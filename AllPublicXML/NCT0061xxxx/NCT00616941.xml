      This is an open label, Phase I study of vaccination with NY-ESO-1 OLP4 with or without
      immunoadjuvant Montanide and Poly-ICLC in patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube,
      or primary peritoneal cancer in second or third clinical remission.

      The primary and secondary endpoints of the study are to determine the safety and
      immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 OLP4 vaccination with or without immunoadjuvants Montanide and
      Poly-ICLC.

      Cohort I (n=3) will receive NY-ESO-1 OLP4 by subcutaneous injection once every 3 weeks (weeks
      1, 4, 7, 10, and 13) for a total of 5 vaccinations. At week 16 patients will return for final
      toxicity and immunologic assessments. If 0/3 DLT's are seen in Cohort I, this arm will be
      considered safe and accrual for this arm will stop. If 1/3 patients experience a DLT (as
      defined in section 11), then 3 further patients will be accrued. If 1/6 experience a DLT this
      arm will be considered safe. If &gt;1/6 patients in this arm experience a DLT then this arm will
      not be considered safe, and accrual for the study will stop. If this arm is considered safe
      we will proceed to Cohort II. Cohort II (n=3 + 6) will receive NY-ESO-1 OLP in combination
      with Montanide immune adjuvant by subcutaneous injections, once every 3 weeks (weeks 1, 4, 7,
      10, and 13) for a total of 5 vaccinations. At week 16 patients will return for final toxicity
      and immunologic assessments. If 0/3 initial patients experience a DLT we will add 6 further
      patients to this arm at the same dose and schedule described above, for a total of 9
      patients. If 1/3 patients have a DLT, we will accrue 3 further patients at this dose and
      schedule. If 1/6 have a DLT this arm will be considered safe, and 3 further patients will be
      tested. Cohort III will begin accrual after 6 patients in cohort II have received all 5
      vaccinations with no more than one DLT observed (this criterion has already been met in the
      study). Cohort III (n=3 + 6) will receive NY-ESO-1 OLP mixed with Poly-ICLC immunoadjuvant
      emulsified in Montanide by subcutaneous injections, once every 3 weeks (weeks 1, 4, 7, 10,
      and 13) for a total of 5 vaccinations. At week 16, patients will return for final toxicity
      and immunologic assessments. If 0/3 initial patients in Cohort III experience a DLT, 6 more
      patients will added to this for a total of 9 evaluable patients. If 1/3 initial patients have
      a DLT, then 3 more patients will be accrued in cohort III. If 1/6 patients have a DLT, then
      this arm will be considered safe, and 3 further patients will be accrued. Patient's vital
      signs will be monitored for one hour following each vaccination, The three cohorts will be
      accrued sequentially. Cohort I will be accrued directly. Cohort II will begin accrual when at
      least one patient in cohort I has received all 5 vaccinations. Cohort III will begin accrual
      after 6 patients in cohort II have received all 5 vaccinations with no more than one DLT
      observed (this criterion has already been met in the study).
