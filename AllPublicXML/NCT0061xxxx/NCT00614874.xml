    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common chronic disease characterized by airway inflammation and
      bronchoconstriction. This study utilizes the drug rosiglitazone (Avandia)to treat the effects
      of airway inflammation in patients with asthma.

      The study will be conducted on 14 adult steroid naive patients with asthma. Patients with
      qualifying pulmonary function testing values will be eligible for enrollment. Enrolled
      subjects will be treated with rosiglitazone orally at 2mg dose for 4 weeks. Patients will be
      reassessed and dosing will increase in 4 week increments up to 8mg.

    <textblock>
      The current standard-of-care utilizes corticosteroids to down-regulate the inflammatory state
      in patients with asthma. However, corticosteroids have many side effects and are not
      universally effective. New safe anti-inflammatory agents are needed to help modulate the
      disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists are widely used to manage
      diabetes mellitus, another common chronic disease. These agents have been study models and
      have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in lung tissue. Case reports have noted
      improvement in asthma symptoms in patients being treated with these agents. These agents are
      ideally placed for human research given their long record of safe use in the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes.
