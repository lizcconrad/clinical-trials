    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  gp100 is a protein that is often found in melanoma tumors.

        -  An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with melanoma uses anti-gp100
           cells designed to destroy their tumors. The anti-gp100 cells are created in the
           laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.

        -  The treatment procedure also uses a vaccine called plaque purified canarypox vector
           (ALVAC) gp100, made from a virus that ordinarily infects canaries and is modified to
           carry a copy of the gp100 gene. The virus cannot reproduce in mammals, so it cannot
           cause disease in humans. When the vaccine is injected into a patient, it stimulates
           cells in the immune system that may increase the efficiency of the anti gp 100 cells.

      Objectives:

      -To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-gp100 cells and the ALVAC gp100 vaccine in
      treating patients with advanced melanoma.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients with metastatic melanoma for whom standard treatments have not been effective.

      Design:

        -  Patients undergo scans, x-rays and other tests and leukapheresis to obtain white cells
           for laboratory treatment.

        -  Patients have 7 days of chemotherapy to prepare the immune system for receiving the
           gp100 cells.

        -  Patients receive the ALVAC vaccine, anti-gp100 cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (an
           approved treatment for advanced melanoma). The anti gp100 cells are given as an infusion
           through a vein. The vaccine is given as injections just before the infusion of gp100
           cells and again 2 weeks later. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion every 8 hours for
           up to 5 days after the cell infusion for a maximum of 15 doses.

        -  After hospital discharge, patients return to the clinic for periodic follow-up with a
           physical examination, review of treatment side effects, laboratory tests and scans every
           1 to 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  We have engineered human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to express a T-cell
           receptor that recognizes an human leukocyte antigens (HLAA) 0201 restricted epitope
           derived from the gp100 protein.

        -  We constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both alpha and infinity chains
           and can mediate genetic transfer of this T cell receptor (TCR) with high efficiency
           (greater than 30 percent) without the need to perform any selection.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A 0201 positive melanoma gp100:154-162 TCR transduced T cells
           secreted significant amount of interferon (IFN)-(but no significant secretion was
           observed in control co-cultures with cell lines.

      gp100:154-162 TCR transduced PBL could efficiently kill -HLA-A 0201 positive tumors. There
      was little or no recognition of normal fibroblasts cells.

        -  This TCR is over 10 times more reactive with melanoma cells than the melanoma antigen
           recognized by T-cells (MART)-1 TCR that mediated tumor regression in two patients with
           metastatic melanoma.

        -  In this trial we would like to test our hypothesis that the addition of an anti-tumor
           ALVAC vaccine will result in clinical tumor regression, and persistence of the
           transferred cells (as is the case in murine models).

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

      -Determine if the administration of anti-gp100:154-162 TCR-engineered peripheral blood
      lymphocytes, ALVAC anti-tumor immunization, and aldesleukin to patients following a
      nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical tumor
      regression in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

        -  Determine whether treated patients develop anti-mouse TCR antibody.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-A 0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have:

        -  metastatic melanoma;

        -  previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred after aldesleukin;

        -  normal values for basic laboratory values.

      Patients may not have:

        -  concurrent major medical illnesses;

        -  any form of primary or secondary immunodeficiency;

        -  severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study;

        -  contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained by leukapheresis (approximately 5
           times 10^9 cells) will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin in
           order to stimulate T-cell growth.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 10^8 to 5 times 10^8 cells to
           supernatant containing the anti-gp100:154-162 TCR retroviral vector. These transduced
           cells will be expanded and tested for their anti-tumor activity.

        -  Once engineered PBMC are demonstrated to be biologically active according to the strict
           criteria outlined in the Certificate of Analysis, patients will receive a
           nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of
           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor
           reactive, TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus intravenous (IV) aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg q8h
           for a maximum of 15 doses). Approximately 2 hours prior to cell infusion, patients will
           be immunized with ALVAC virus expressing the tumor antigen. ALVAC immunization will be
           repeated at 2 weeks.

        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, computed
           tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four
           to six weeks after treatment and then monthly for approximately 3 to 4 months or until
           off study criteria are met.

        -  The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable
           patients will be enrolled. If 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response,
           then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable
           patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of
           41 evaluable patients have been enrolled.

        -  The objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin,
           lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, ALVAC immunization and anti-gp100:154-162 TCR-gene
           engineered lymphocytes is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can
           rule out 5 percent (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20 percent partial response (PR) plus
           complete response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).
