  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disorder in which people often have swelling and skin
      infections. People with this disease cannot receive the smallpox vaccine because it could
      cause them to have a fatal reaction known as eczema vaccinatum (EV). Keyhole limpet
      hemocyanin (KLH) is a protein that can be used to deliver vaccines to the body. The purpose
      of this study is to determine a baseline immune reaction to KLH in people without AD. Once
      this has been established, other studies can be designed to determine whether KLH can be used
      to give vaccines to people with AD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AD is characterized by skin inflammation and recurrent skin infections. In addition, people
      with AD may have a severe and sometimes fatal reaction to the smallpox vaccine called EV. KLH
      is a carrier protein that can be used to deliver antibodies to the body. However KLH itself,
      may cause an immune response. The purpose of this study is to determine the body's reaction
      to pure KLH in people without AD. This will be used to establish a baseline immune response
      and may be compared to the immune response in people with AD during future studies.

      This study will last 8 weeks and will have 11 study visits. Participants in this study will
      be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups. All participants will receive their immunizations at
      Visits 5 and 6. Participants in Group 1A will receive 2 immunizations each with 100 mcg of
      KLH each. Participants in Group 2A will receive 2 immunizations through scarification (a
      shallow cut in the skin) with jabs, each containing 20 mg/mL of KLH. Adverse reactions will
      be monitored after each immunization. Once safety data from these 2 groups have been
      reviewed, the next 2 groups will be enrolled. Participants in Group 1B will receive 2
      immunizations each with 250 mcg of KLH each. Participants in Group 2B will receive 2
      immunizations through scarification with 15 jabs, each containing 20mg/mL of KLH. Other study
      visits will include allergy testing and blood and urine collection.
