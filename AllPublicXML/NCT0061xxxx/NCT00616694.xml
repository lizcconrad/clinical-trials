        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a variety of rheumatologic, pulmonary, and skin conditions.

          -  Subjects were to be on oral glucocorticoids with a mean daily dose of greater than or
             equal to 5.0 mg prednisone (or its equivalent) and were expected (although not
             required) to remain on a daily dose of greater than or equal to 5.0 mg prednisone (or
             its equivalent) for 12 months after the study started.

          -  Women must have been at least one year post-menopausal or surgically sterile.

          -  Subjects must have had evaluable BMD site at the lumbar spine (LS) and proximal femur.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject's unwillingness to take Vitamin D, calcium supplements or study medication

          -  A history of cancer: any history of cancer within the past 5 years. Relatively benign
             skin malignancies, such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, are not an
             exclusion if the subject has been in remission for at least 6 months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  A history of hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism or osteomalacia or other metabolic
             bone disease within one year prior to enrollment

          -  History of alcohol or drug dependence within one year of enrollment

          -  A history of using any of the following medications within 6 months of starting study
             drug: Estrogen or estrogen-related drugs (tamoxifen, raloxifene, tibolone); low dose
             vaginal estrogen (estradiol &lt; 0.2 mg/day, estropipate &lt; 1.5 mg/day) will be
             allowed,Anabolic steroids,Parathyroid hormone

          -  A history of using any of the following medications within 1 month of starting study
             drugor for more than 1 month within 6 months prior to study entry: Calcitonin,Vitamin
             D supplements (&gt;1000 IU per day),Calcitriol (&gt;1.5mcg/week)

          -  A history of using any of the following medications within 6 months of starting study
             drug or for more than 14 days within 1 year prior to study entry: Any
             bisphosphonate,Fluoride (&gt; 10 mg per day),Estrogen implant,Deflazacort

          -  Have received a depot injection of &gt; 10,000 IU Vitamin D in the past 12 months

          -  Have a documented history of an abnormal or allergic reaction to bisphosphonates

          -  History of recurrent nephrolithiasis or a history of one episode of nephrolithiasis
             within 5years of study entry

          -  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of &lt;30 mL/min)

          -  Subjects on steroid therapy for transplantation

          -  Subjects on oral glucocorticoids for &gt;8 weeks but &lt;6 months at screening

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the investigational product or to drugs with similar
             chemical structures

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, or other major
             systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study
             results difficult

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of the study

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
