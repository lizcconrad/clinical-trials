  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to compare salivary MS levels in four different groups of
      children with caries, that have been submitted to intraoral topical treatment with either
      1,23% sodium fluoride, 1% chlorhexidine, 3% or 10% vancomycin, during 6 consecutive days.
      This clinical trial was designed to test two different hypotheses. First, that topical
      vancomycin would be more effective than chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride in salivary MS
      reduction. Secondly, a 6-day antimicrobial treatment with either one of these agents would
      produce a long lasting MS suppression, dispensing repeated antibacterial treatments.

      The present study aimed to compare the effect of sodium fluoride, chlorhexidine and
      vancomycin on salivary mutans streptococci (MS) levels, on a double-blind, randomized
      clinical trial. Sixty-nine healthy volunteers, aged 4-8 years, with at least one active
      carious lesion and no previous history of allergies were selected to participate in the
      study. A gel formulation containing 1.23% sodium fluoride, 1% chlorhexidine, 3% or 10%
      vancomycin was topically administered to the dentition every 24 hours, during 6 consecutive
      days. Salivary MS levels were measured at baseline (D1), on the 6th (D6), 15th (D15) and 30th
      day (D30). For microbiological analysis, MSB agar medium was used.
