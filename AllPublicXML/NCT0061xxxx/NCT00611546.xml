  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an effort to decrease the load of peroxides in TPN solutions, multiple studies examined
      different strategies such as photo-protection, adding multivitamins to the lipid emulsion
      rather than to the dextrose-amino acid admixture, and adding antioxidants such as glutathione
      to the TPN solution. However, the role of trace elements as antioxidants, and their
      interaction with light have not been studied. Also, the impact of TPN-related oxidants on
      clinical morbidities has not been addressed. Therefore, we aimed in this study of preterm
      infants to evaluate the role of different components of TPN on urinary peroxides and to
      examine the biochemical and clinical effects of light protection.
