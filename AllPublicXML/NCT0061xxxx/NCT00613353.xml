    <textblock>
      Objective activity data will be collected using accelerometry for a minimum of seven days on
      38 adult, female, women recruited from the metabolic Clinic at the University of Mississippi
      Medical Center. Following objective measurement of activity, participants will complete
      self-report and objective activity data, as well as the relationship between sedentary
      activities and food cravings will be examined. It is hypothesized that minutes of sedentary
      behavior, especially time spent in television viewing, will be significantly correlated with
      total and specific food cravings.
