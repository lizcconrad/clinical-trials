      The purpose of this observational study is to examine RSI (Reflux Symptom Index) and RFS
      (Reflux Finding Score) by treatment period before and after rabeprazole treatment in
      LaryngoPharyngeal Reflux Disease(LPRD) patients.

      This clinical study is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, observational study of
      outpatients who visit the department of otolaryngology (branch of medicine that deals with
      diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ear, nose, and throat) under routine practice.
      This study will examine RSI (Reflux Symptom Index) and RFS (Reflux Finding Score) by
      treatment period (before and after rabeprazole treatment) in patients with LaryngoPharyngeal
      Reflux Disease(LPRD). Among the patients who visit the department of otolaryngology with
      suspicious laryngopharyngeal reflux, those needing rabeprazole sodium treatment according to
      the doctor's discretion are eligible for enrollment. This study will explore the correlation
      between RSI and RFS and will examine major reflux symptoms and types of lesions, to find the
      most reliable factors in diagnosing LPRD and judging therapeutic effectiveness of treatments.
      LPRD is a disease with various symptoms and causes lesions by exposing the upper respiratory
      system to gastric acid and stomach contents. RSI and RFS can be used to diagnose LPRD in a
      relatively objective manner by scoring items of symptoms and lesions particular to LPRD.
      Evaluations will be performed four times from baseline to week 12. Observational Study - one
      tablet of rabeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg once daily for 12 weeks
