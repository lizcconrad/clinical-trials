  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the change detected by a standardized rating scale (Hamilton Anxiety
      Rating Scale) scores in the active treatment group as compared to sham (placebo) group after
      6 weeks of rTMS treatments. It is hoped that 6 weeks of rTMS treatment will lead to
      improvement of core symptoms in patients with GAD.

    <description>6 weeks of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation . Treatment comprises of stimulation with rTMS frequency 20Hz, intensity 110% of MT, 20 trains, 9 sec/train, 51 sec ITI applied over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by a figure eight shaped coil. Treatment will be given 5 times a week for 4 weeks, 3 times a week during Week 5 and 2 times a week during Week 6.</description>
