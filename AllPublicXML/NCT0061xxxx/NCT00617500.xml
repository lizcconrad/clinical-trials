  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The alternative and complementary therapies are being gradually included in the Brazilian
      Health Unique System (SUS), as it is foreseen in the National Politics of Integrative and
      Complementary Practices in Brazil . However, though this thematic is also included in the
      National Agenda of Research Priorities concerning Health, published studies concerning this
      matter are quite scarce. The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that it is a big
      challenge to effect the following studies: cost-effectiveness, as well as safety, efficiency
      and the quality of such practices. WHO also pointed out the clinical situations where they
      could be applied and that is why this investigation we are undertaken is fully justified.

      Annoying signs and symptoms which come along with the climacteric period, especially anxiety,
      insomnia and hot flushes, change women´s life quality and their affective, social and
      business relationships as well. Consequently, this can generate sadness, depression and
      isolation.

      Many women cannot undergo hormonal replacement, for several reasons: or they have some
      illnesses which reject hormones, or due to hypersensitiveness reactions or even economical
      difficulties. Also, the cost-effectiveness ratio between conventional therapy of hormonal
      replacement and complementary therapies which compose this study are not known yet .

      The complementary therapies proposed in this study concern non-invasive methods, of low cost,
      which justify being researched in order to verify the potential of those annoying signs
      alleviation.
