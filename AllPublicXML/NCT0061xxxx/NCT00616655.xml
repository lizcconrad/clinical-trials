        <description>THe HAM-M was administered by a site-trained rater and measured the severity of the subjects' anxiety symptoms using 14 items of the HAM-M rating scale. These items included: anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, intellectual, depressed mood, somatic complaints-muscular, somatic complaints-sensory, cardiovascular symptoms, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, genitourinary symptoms, autonomic symptoms, and behavior at interview. All items are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). The Ham-A total score can range from 0 to 56 with higher scores indicating higher severity of anxiety symptoms.</description>

        <description>The CGI-Swas completed by a board certified psychiatrist and represents the clinician's subjective assessment of severity of the subject's anxiety symptoms as assessed by a 7-scale score for a single question, &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how anxious is the subject at this time?&quot; The score was based on the following scale: 1=normal, not at all anxious; 2=borderline anxious; 3=mildly anxious; 4=moderately anxious; 5=markedly anxious; 6=severly anxious; 7=among the most extremely anxious subjects. CGI-S score can range from 0 to 7, with higher values indicating higher severity.</description>

        <title>Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) 50% Anxiolytic Response</title>
        <description>The HAM-A was administered by a site-trained rater and measured the severity of the subjects' anxiety symptoms using 14 items of the HAM-A rating scale. These items include: anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, intellectual, depressed mood, somatic complaints-muscular, somatic complaints-sensory, cardiovascular symptoms, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, genitourinary symptoms, autonomic symptoms, and behavior at interview. All items are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). A 50% anxiolytic response was defined as a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the HAM-A total score.
The Ham-A total score can range from 0 to 56 with higher scores indicating higher severity of anxiety symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Q-LES-Q was completed by the subject and assessed quaility of life based on 16 items, each evaluated on a 5-point scale of overall level of enjoyment/satisfaction: 1=very poor; 2=poor; 3=fair; 4=good; 5=very good. The overall percentage score was computed as a sum of items 1 to 14 as expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score: Overall Percentage Score = Sum [item 1... item 14]-14)/(70-14 ) *100%. Q-LES-Q overall percentage score can range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating higher quality of life.</description>

          <description>The Q-LES-Q was completed by the subject and assessed quaility of life based on 16 items, each evaluated on a 5-point scale of overall level of enjoyment/satisfaction: 1=very poor; 2=poor; 3=fair; 4=good; 5=very good. The overall percentage score was computed as a sum of items 1 to 14 as expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score: Overall Percentage Score = Sum [item 1... item 14]-14)/(70-14 ) *100%. Q-LES-Q overall percentage score can range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating higher quality of life.</description>

        <description>The ISI was completed by the subject and is an assessment of the severity of insomnia. The administered extended ISI questionnaire consists of 5 items (containing 7 questions, as item 1 contains 3 questions) comprising the original ISI questionnaire, plus 6 quality of life related items (sleep quality, restedness/refreshness upon arising, daytime fatigue, attention/concentration, relationships and mood disturbances), and 2 items assessing duration and frequency of sleep problems. All items, except for the insomnia duration and frequency questions, are measured on a Likert-type 5-point scale (0-4). ISI total score can range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia.</description>

        <description>ESS was completed by the subject and assessed daytime sedation based on 8 items, each presenting a situation for which the subject needed to evaluate how likely he/she is to doze off or fall asleep in contrast to feeling just tired. Each item was evaluated on the following scale: 0 = would never doze; 1 = slight chance of dozing; 2 = moderate chance of dozing; 3 = high chance of dozing. ESS total score can range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating higher levels of daytime sleepiness.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</title>
          <description>ESS was completed by the subject and assessed daytime sedation based on 8 items, each presenting a situation for which the subject needed to evaluate how likely he/she is to doze off or fall asleep in contrast to feeling just tired. Each item was evaluated on the following scale: 0 = would never doze; 1 = slight chance of dozing; 2 = moderate chance of dozing; 3 = high chance of dozing. ESS total score can range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating higher levels of daytime sleepiness.</description>
