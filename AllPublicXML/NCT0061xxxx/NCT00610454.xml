      Subjects receiving LEV as adjunctive therapy to 1 or 2 other AEDs for partial onset seizures
      and subjects who are temporarily unable to take oral LEV, may require alternative routes of
      administration. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 1000
      to 3000 mg/day LEV administered as a 15-min IV infusion b.i.d. after switching from the same
      oral dose.
