      Primary objective To determine maximum tolerated dose &amp; dose limiting toxicity of imatinib
      mesylate &amp; RAD001 when combined w fixed doses of hydroxyurea among pts w recurrent GBM who
      are on &amp; not on enzyme-inducing anti-convulsants including pts not on anti-epileptic drugs
      Secondary objective To assess safety &amp; tolerability of imatinib mesylate in combo w RAD001 &amp;
      hydroxyurea in this population To characterize single-dose &amp; repeated-dose pharmacokinetic
      profiles of imatinib mesylate &amp; RAD001 combo therapy in this pt population.

      To assess antiangiogenic effects, pre- and post-treatment, of imatinib mesylate, RAD001 &amp;
      hydroxyurea combo therapy, using DCE-MRI to evaluate changes in extent of vascular
      permeability, perfusion &amp; relative tumor blood volume; to explore assessment of tumor
      cellularity &amp; tumor cell death by changes in DWI-MRI as quantitated by apparent diffusion
      coefficient maps.

      This is open-label, single center, 1-arm ph I dose-escalation study of continuous, daily
      doses of imatinib mesylate &amp; RAD001 administered orally in combination w fixed doses of
      hydroxyurea in adult pts w recurrent or relapsing glioblastoma multiforme. Study format
      includes classical &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design to determine MTD &amp; DLT of imatinib mesylate +
      RAD001 when combined w hydroxyurea among GBM pts. Pts will be stratified based on whether
      they who are receiving EIACD &amp; each stratum will independently dose escalate. Additionally,
      study will characterize safety, tolerability, biologic activity, &amp; pharmacokinetic profile of
      this combo therapy.

    <description>Dose of Gleevec will be 400 mg in 1st cohort &amp; will be increased to 600 mg po/day &amp; then to 400 mg bid in successive cohorts. Prescribed dose should be administered orally, w large glass of water. Pts should not eat large or high fat meal within 1 hour before or after gleevec dosing. Doses of 600 mg or less should be administered once daily, whereas doses greater than 600 mg should be administered as equal doses twice day. It is recommended that pts take their prescribed Gleevec at same time that they take their prescribed RAD001 &amp; hydroxyurea, however, 30-60 minute interval between agents is acceptable if required for practical or other compliance issues.</description>
