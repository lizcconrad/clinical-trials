    <textblock>
      Myocardial damage occurs in up to 40% of cases when sensitive biomarkers are measured after
      coronary artery stenting. Such events have been associated with poor outcomes both at 30 days
      and long term. The cause of such damage is multi-factorial and includes distal propagation of
      atheromatous and thrombotic debris and the subsequent infiltration of the microcirculation
      with inflammatory cells. Individually or together these events can occlude the
      micro-circulation and lead impaired blood flow to heart muscle.

      The vasodilator adenosine is commonly used in cases of impaired flow in an endeavor to
      improve flow rate and limit myocardial damage. Unfortunately the efficacy of this therapy is
      limited. More recently, there have been clinical studies looking at the administration of
      adenosine before any potential damage by ballooning or stenting, in an effort to avoid poor
      distal flow post procedure and thus limit any myocardial damage. Although small numbers of
      subjects have been included in these trials, there have been encouraging preliminary data.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether the use of intra-coronary adenosine given directly
      into the target coronary artery prior to stenting can reduce the incidence of myonecrosis
      (heart muscle damage)over placebo. We also aim to assess whether this translates to better
      outcomes at 30 day follow up.

      Prior clinical studies looking at the administration of adenosine before coronary artery
      stenting have looked at small numbers of subjects and did not mandate previous statin therapy
      or high dose loading of clopidogrel before stenting, both of which can also help lower the
      rate of peri-procedural myonecrosis.

      Our aim is to assess the above mentioned therapy in patients on optimal treatment with
      statins, dual antiplatelet agents and standard of care anti-coagulants.
