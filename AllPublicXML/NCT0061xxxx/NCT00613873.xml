  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a cancer in the colon or rectum. Routine screening can find it at an
      early stage, when it has a much higher chance of cure. Screening can also help to find
      polyps. These are mushroom shaped growths that could turn into cancer. A polyp can be removed
      before it turns into cancer. Even though screening can save lives, not enough people in the
      country are having it. This is especially true in Harlem. Harlem has a higher rate of deaths
      from this cancer than other places in the U.S. because too many people do not get screened.
      By the time a person has symptoms, the cancer may be at a late stage, when it is much harder
      to cure.

      We are doing this study to see if we can increase the number of people in Harlem who get
      screened. We plan to tell women about the screening when they have a mammogram or pap test.
      We will also ask them what they know and think about colorectal cancer. And, we will see if
      they get other members of their household to be screened.

    <description>Women participating in a community based mammography or cervical screening program will also participate in colonoscopy screening. Participation will be measured by stating an interest in colorectal cancer screening and then following through with colonoscopy screening. Furthermore we will assess whether those complying with colonoscopy will also recommend colonoscopy screening for their spouses or household members.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,
        the protocol investigators or research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
        Center(MSKCC). The study will be offered to all eligible women who come for breast or
        cervical cancer screening at The Breast Examination Center of Harlem during the study
        period
