      The purpose of the study was to investigate the dose-response effect of increasing doses of
      Bifidobacterium animalis ssp lactis (BB-12) and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei
      (CRL-431) on the immune response, blood lipids, gut microflora, recovery from feces and
      overall tolerance in healthy young adults.

      The study included seventy-one healthy young vounteers, and was designed as a double-blind
      placebo controlled dose-response trial based on a 2 wk run-in period, a 3 wk intervention and
      2 wk wash-out period. The subjects were randomly assigned into 5 groups of 15 subjects each,
      who were supplemented with 0, 10E8, 10E9, 10E10 or 10E10 CFU/d, respectively, og a mixture of
      BB-12 and CRL-431. Blood samples were collected 4 times and fecal samples 3 times. Diary
      reporting bowel habits and weel being was kept for all 7 weeks.

      There are very few articles concerning the issue dose-response effect of probiotics.The aim
      of the study was to investigate the dose-response effect of increasing concentrations of
      probiotics on the immune response, blood lipids, composition of the gut microflora, recovery
      from feces and the overall tolerance.

      The hypothesis was that the increasing dose would influence the immunresponse (eg incresae
      phagocytosis), improve blood lipid profile (eg.lower HDL-cholesterol), would be recovered in
      increasing concentrations in feces, would change the intestinal microfloraprofile and would
      be well tolerated even in high doses.
