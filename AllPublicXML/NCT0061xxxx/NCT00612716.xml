    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and busulfan, and total-body
      irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It
      also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated
      stem cells from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood may replace the patient's immune cells
      and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal
      cells. Giving methotrexate and cyclosporine after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well a donor stem cell transplant works in
      treating patients with previously treated lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine if allogeneic stem cell transplantation using unrelated matched or related
           haploidentical donor bone marrow or unrelated matched cord blood results in timely,
           complete, and durable engraftment in patients with previously treated lymphoma, multiple
           myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the incidence and grade of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine if the augmented graft-versus-tumor effect accompanying unrelated or partially
           matched donor allogeneic transplant reduces the incidence of relapse in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -7 and -6
           and undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) twice daily on days -4 to -1. Patients who are
           unable to undergo TBI receive busulfan IV or orally 4 times daily on days -9 to -6 and
           cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -5 to -2.

        -  Stem cell transplantation: All patients undergo unrelated matched bone marrow or
           umbilical cord blood transplantation or partially matched related allogeneic bone marrow
           transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis
           comprising methotrexate and cyclosporine. Patients may be enrolled in other protocols
           directed towards GVHD prophylaxis.
