  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease induced by wheat gluten. Destruction of epithelial
      cells and microvilli on gut mucosa is causing a &quot;flat mucosa&quot; and an absorption defect. The
      diagnosis is based on typical microscopical finding in biopsy specimens but serum antibodies
      to tissue transglutaminase and certain gliadin peptides are strongly associated with the
      pathology. Severe diarrhoea associated with growth disturbance in infancy was historically
      characterising the disease but is nowadays rare. Clinically more mild forms including silent
      disease are very common. Studies based on antibody screening and biopsies done in
      autoantibody positive subjects have confirmed a frequency of about 1-2% in adult population.
      Undiagnosed disease is associated with deficiencies of nutrients and vitamins leading to
      various chronic symptoms like anaemia, osteoporosis and general fatigue. It has also been
      recently found that undiagnosed celiac disease may be associated with general
      underachievement in society probably associated with common psychological symptoms like
      fatigue and depression during the adolescence. The disease is treated by complete elimination
      of wheat, rye and barley in the diet, which is laborious and causing considerable extra costs
      in nutrition.

      Much progress has been recently made in understanding of the genetic background and immune
      markers associated with the disease as well as in understanding those patterns of gluten
      introduction in infancy, which might be connected to a high disease risk. Our aim in this
      study is in the first phase to identify children at high genetic risk (around 10%) and in a
      follow-up study to define:

        1. Are the age, dose of gluten and presence of simultaneous breast feeding at the
           introduction of gluten associated with the risk of celiac disease?

        2. Is it possible to decrease the frequency of celiac disease by nutritional counselling?

        3. Is it possible to predict development of celiac disease by immunological tests before
           the development of mucosal lesion

      If we can confirm, that optimising the conditions at the introduction of wheat gluten in
      infancy diet significantly reduces the disease incidence, will this have an important effect
      on the nutritional recommendations concerning the diet in infancy. Combining genetic
      screening and immunological tests might also offer a way to reduce the frequency of celiac
      disease and help in early diagnosis and organisation of an adequate treatment
