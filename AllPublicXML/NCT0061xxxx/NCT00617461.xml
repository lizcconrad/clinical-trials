    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the difference between two doses of gabapentin
      enacarbil (XP13512/GSK1838262), hereafter referred to as GEn, on pain associated with
      post-herpetic neuralgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of study PXN110527 was to investigate the efficacy of a high (3600mg/day)
      dose versus a low (1200mg/day) dose of GEn in subjects with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) who
      have a history of an inadequate response to gabapentin treatment. The study is a cross-over
      design. Prior to screening subjects are required to have a demonstrated history of an
      inadequate response (as determined by the investigator) to at least 1800 mg/day of
      gabapentin. Prior history of treatment with gabapentin includes current treatment at
      1800mg/day (2 weeks) or prior treatment with ≥1800mg/day (4 weeks). Subjects could also have
      been treated with pregabalin monotherapy (150-300mg/day, ≥4 weeks) and had an inadequate
      response.

      Subjects are treated with gabapentin 1800mg/day during the Baseline Period and are randomized
      if during the Basleline Period they are compliant with gabapentin treatment and have a
      24-hour average pain intensity score ≥4.0 based on an 11-point pain intensity numerical
      rating scale (PI-NRS). Subjects are then randomized to receive gabapentin enacarbil (either
      1200mg/day or 3600mg/day in a 1:1 ratio) for Treatment Period 1 (28 days). Followed by a dose
      of 2400mg/day for 4 days and the alternate fixed dose (either 3600 mg/day or 1200 mg/day) for
      Treatment Period 2 (28 days).

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Treatment (Weeks 4 and 9, representing the last week of each treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and end of treatment values are the calculated means of the daily 24-hour API scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization (baseline) and the last 7 days on treatment within each period (end of treatment). Participants rated their API over the preceding 24 hours, using an 11-point PI-Numerical Rating Scale (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). LOCF was used if less than 4 days of diary data were provided. Change from baseline was calculated as end of treatment minus baseline. Data are summarized by dose, independent of treatment period.</description>

    <description>Baseline and end of treatment values are the calculated means of the daily 24-hour API scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization (baseline) and the last 7 days on treatment within each period (end of treatment).

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean 24-hour Average Pain Intensity (API) Score at the Last Week of Each Treatment Period Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) Data</title>
        <description>Baseline and end of treatment values are the calculated means of the daily 24-hour API scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization (baseline) and the last 7 days on treatment within each period (end of treatment). Participants rated their API over the preceding 24 hours, using an 11-point PI-Numerical Rating Scale (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). LOCF was used if less than 4 days of diary data were provided. Change from baseline was calculated as end of treatment minus baseline. Data are summarized by dose, independent of treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean 24-hour Average Pain Intensity (API) Score at the Last Week of Each Treatment Period Using LOCF Data for Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Baseline and end of treatment values are the calculated means of the daily 24-hour API scores for each participant during the last 7 days prior to randomization (baseline) and the last 7 days on treatment within each period (end of treatment). Participants used a hand-held diary to rate their average pain intensity over the preceding 24 hours, using an 11-point PI-NRS (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). LOCF was used if less than 4 days of diary data were provided. The by period summary is provided as a sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Night-time Worst Pain Intensity Score at the Last Week of Each Treatment Period Using LOCF</title>
        <description>Night-time worst pain is defined as the participant's assessment of their worst pain intensity between going to bed and rising in the morning. Participants recorded night-time worst pain in the morning upon wakening using an 11-point PI-NRS (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Baseline and end of treatment scores are as defined for primary endpoint. Change from baseline = the end of treatment score minus the baseline score. An ANCOVA with baseline value, BMI, grouped center as covariates was used. Data are summarized by dose, independent of treatment period.</description>

Percent reduction from baseline was calculated as the [(end of treatment score minus the baseline score) divided by the baseline score], multiplied by 100. The PI-NRS is an 11-point scale (0=no pain, 10=pain as bad as you can imagine) by which a participant assesses their 24-hour average pain intensity. Data are summarized by period.</description>
          <population>Of the 93 participants in the ITT Population, there were 3 and 8 participants who did not take GEn 1200 and 3600 mg, respectively, in the second period. In addition, there was one participant who did not provide post-baseline data for 24-hour API while taking GEn 3600 mg in the first period, and was therefore not included in this analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Dose in Milligrams of Rescue Medication at the Last Week of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Mean daily use of rescue medication (milligrams of acetaminophen) was calculated by determining the average number of tablets taken per day of rescue medication (Commercial Tylenol) during treatment and multiplying that by 500 mg. Baseline and end of treatment scores are as defined for the primary endpoint. Change from baseline is calculated as the end of treatment score minus the baseline score. An ANCOVA with baseline value, BMI, grouped center as covariates was used. Data are summarized by dose, independent of treatment period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Are Responders on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) Questionnaire at the Last Week of Each Treatment Period Using LOCF Data</title>
        <description>The CGIC is a single-item questionnaire designed to provide an overall assessment of treatment from the clinician's perspective since the start of the study. It is measured on a 7-point scale, where 1=very much improved and 7=very much worse. A participant is considered a responder if they have a response of &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved.&quot; Data are summarized by dose, independent of treatment period.</description>

Analysis of this endpoint is based on the change from baseline (BL) (EOMT score minus the BL score) using an ANCOVA model with BL value, BMI, grouped center as covariates.
