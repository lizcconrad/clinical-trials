  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial to examine the effects of meditation on the incidence of ventricular
      arrhythmias and the psychological profiles in patients with implanted cardiac defibrillators.

      We wish to test the following hypotheses:

        1. Vipassana meditation reduces the incidence of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in
           patients with congestive heart failure.

        2. Vipassana meditation improves the psychological profile in patients with CHF. In this
           study, subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited into the
           study after obtaining informed consent. The subjects will then be randomized into either
           an experimental group ( Meditation) or into a control group (usual care).

      This is a single center, investigator-initiated, randomized, controlled trial to examine the
      effects of meditation on the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and the psychological
      profiles in patients with implanted cardiac defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization
      devices. The former are used to protect patients against cardiac fibrillation and the latter
      for synchronizing the contractions of the two ventricles.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged 18 to 85

          -  All patients with NYHA class II to III congestive heart failure symptoms from ischemic
             and non-ischemic etiology who received a defibrillator at least 3 months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  All patients with NYHA class III and IV symptoms, QRS complex of the ECG more than 120
             ms, who received device for cardiac resynchronization at least 3 months prior to
             enrollment. These devices are placed when the two ventricles beat at slightly
             different times. These devices also have the capacity to record arrhythmias as the
             defibrillators.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with life expectancy less than 6 months from non-cardiac causes

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Smokers

          -  History of major psychosis.

          -  Significant chronic liver, renal and pulmonary disease

          -  Active alcohol and drug abuse
