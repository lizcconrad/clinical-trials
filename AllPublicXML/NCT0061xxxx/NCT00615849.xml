  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the definite treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax(PSP), thoracoscopic bleb
      obliteration with pleural adhesive procedure is generally accepted as a standard. But
      additional pleurodesis is potentially useless procedure on the parietal pleura for treating
      visceral pleural disese. Furthermore, pleural symphysis could deteriorates normal pleural
      physiology and cause chronic pain. According to our previous study, stapling resection of the
      bulla without pleurodesis gave comparable result in recurrence comparing with articles with
      additional pleurodesis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate surgical outcome of
      thoracoscopic surgery with or without pleural abrasion and to know whether adhesive procedure
      is essential in the management of PSP.
