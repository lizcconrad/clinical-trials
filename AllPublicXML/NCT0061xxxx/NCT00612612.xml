  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obatoclax may stop the growth of chronic lymphocytic leukemia by blocking blood flow to the
      cancer and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells
      to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing
      substances to them. Giving obatoclax together with fludarabine and rituximab may kill more
      cancer cells. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of obatoclax when
      given together with fludarabine and rituximab in treating patients with B-cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of obatoclax mesylate in combination with
      fludarabine phosphate-rituximab (FR) in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity of obatoclax mesylate in combination with FR in this patient
      population.

      II. To determine objective response rate and progression-free survival of obatoclax mesylate
      in combination with FR.

      III. To correlate levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members with drug response.

      IV. To determine whether apoptosis is induced via the mitochondrial pathway in response to
      obatoclax mesylate and further enhanced by FR.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of obatoclax mesylate.

      Patients receive obatoclax mesylate IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 3, fludarabine IV over
      20-30 minutes on days 1-5, and rituximab IV over 4 hours on day 1 (days 1 and 3 of course 1
      only). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood collection for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed
      for expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members by western blot; apoptosis
      induction by measurement of lymphocyte count, Annexin V staining, and Caspase and PARP
      cleavage; activated Bax by immunoprecipitation; and Bax promoter polymorphism by PCR
      amplification and direct sequencing.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months.

    <description>DLT will be defined as any non-hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or greater severity (excluding asymptomatic grade 3 laboratory abnormalities that are not life-threatening and respond to treatment; grade 3 fatigue; grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea occurring without optimal prophylaxis; or expected grade 3 rituximab infusion reactions). Any grade 4 non-hematological toxicity, as well as any irreversible grade 2 cardiac, renal or neurologic toxicities, will be considered dose-limiting. Grading of non-hematologic toxicities will be according to NCI CTC version 3.0.</description>
