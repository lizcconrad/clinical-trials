    <description>Fistula closure is defined as absence of drainage at the external fistula opening.
An anorectal fistula is an inflammatory tract or connection between the epithelialized surface of the anal canal and most frequently, the perianal skin or perineum. It is possible to have multiple fistula tracts present on a patient.</description>
