  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In major orthopaedic surgery of the lower extremities both continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA)
      and combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSE) are safe and reliable anaesthesia methods. Our
      results suggest that both continuous spinal anesthesia and combined spinal epidural
      anesthesia provide good surgical conditions with a low incidence of complications. The
      sensory block level and hemodynamic changes were lesser with CSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      240 patients scheduled for hip, knee arthroplasty or fracture of the femur were randomly
      assigned to receive either CSA or CSE. Blocks were performed in the lateral position at L3-L4
      interspace. Puncture success, technical difficulties, paresthesia, highest level of sensory
      and motor block, need for complementary doses of local anesthetic, degree of technical
      difficulties, cardiocirculatory changes and post dural puncture headache were registered. At
      the end of the surgery, the catheter was removed and CSF leak was evaluated.

    <description>For CSA, an 22-G catheter (Spinocath, B.Braun Melsungen, Germany) over a 27-G Quincke needle was used. After identification of the epidural space with a Crawford needle, the catheter with the spinal needle inside was advanced through the epidural space until the dural puncture was felt and CSF was seen in the catheter. The catheter was then fed over the needle into the intrathecal space. The spinal needle and the modified Tuohy needle were removed and a luer connector and a filter previously filled with the anesthetic solution were attached to the catheter.</description>

    <description>CSE was performed with the &quot;needle-through-needle&quot; technique using a single interspace (Espocan, B.Braun Melsungen, Germany). The block consists of performing a spinal block via a 27-G spinal needle (Spinocan 125mm) introduced through an 18-G Tuohy needle (Perican 88mm) which was placed cranially directed in the epidural space. We did rotate the Tuohy needle between the spinal block and the insertion of the epidural catheter.</description>
