      The primary objective of this trial is to study the safety and efficacy of a novel regimen of
      sirolimus, tacrolimus and methotrexate as prophylaxis against acute graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) in recipients of mismatched unrelated donor stem cell grafts. Methotrexate is
      administered in a low dose format of 5mg/m2 on days +1,3 and 6 only.

    <description>Tacrolimus will be administered at a dose of .02mg/kg/d IVCI beginning day -3 until able to take oral medicines reliably. Blood levels will be maintained at 5-10 ng/ml. The oral dose will be 4 times the IV dose. Tacrolimus will be converted to oral dosing prior to hospital discharge. Tacrolimus will be continued until 4 months post transplant (day +120) unless toxicity, refractory GVHD or the development of disease recurrence mandate discontinuation of the drug.</description>

    <description>Sirolimus will be administered as a 12 mg oral loading dose on day -3 followed by 4mg daily. Sirolimus levels will be obtained on day +0 and then at least twice weekly to maintain a trough serum level of 3-12 ng/ml. Sirolimus will be continued until 5 months post transplant (day +150) unless toxicity, refractory GVHD or the development of disease recurrence mandate discontinuation of the drug.</description>

    <description>Methotrexate, dose #1 will be administered on day +1 post transplantation, as an IV bolus, provided at least 24 hours have elapsed following infusion of donor stem cells at a dose of 10mg/m2. Dose #2 of Methotrexate will be administered 48 hours later, as IV bolus on day +3 at a dose of 5mg/m2.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have an identified 8/10 or 9/10 matched unrelated donor identified
             following a formal search with confirmatory typing through the national marrow donor
             program as the best available donor. No matched sibling or fully matched unrelated
             donor has been identified. HLA typing of donor and recipient will be performed by high
             resolution molecular typing at HLA A, B, C and DRB1/DQ loci. Patients whose best
             available donor is matched at 8/10 loci must have at least one of the mismatches at
             the DQ locus. (no more than one mismatch at HLA A,B,C,DR allowed).

          -  Candidates for this trial will meet the following criteria:

               1. Adequate organ function for conditioning type:

                  For patients receiving ablative conditioning

                    -  Left Ventricular ejection fraction &gt;45%

                       abnormalities9, persistent elevated blast count on day +15 or recovery
                       marrow after induction therapy).

                    -  AML beyond first remission

                    -  High risk Myelodysplasia (RAEB-II, RAEB-I with poor-risk cytogenetics)

                    -  Recurrent Aggressive Non-Hodgkins or Hodgkins lymphoma (indolent histologies
                       excluded) who have failed autologous transplant or have had inadequate
                       response to salvage therapy.

                    -  CML with transformation

                    -  CLL with transformation or Fludarabine failure.

                    -  Severe aplastic anemia with recurrence or failure after immunosuppressive
                       therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior allogeneic transplantation

          -  Active CNS leukemia.
