  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The medicines used to treat HIV can suppress but cannot kill all the virus in the body. A
      small amount of virus remains at low levels in the part of the blood called the plasma. It is
      of crucial importance to identify the source of the residual virus in patients receiving
      antiretroviral therapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the source of low
      level plasma virus is from latent (old) infection or ongoing (new) infection. MK-0518 is a
      investigational drug, which means that is not yet FDA approved, that works in a different way
      to other anti-HIV medicines to help kill the virus. We hypothesize that addition of MK-0518
      to a stable anti-HIV regimen will reduce the viral load further in patients with undetectable
      plasma virus.

      This is a non-randomized, non-comparative, single center trial of antiretroviral therapy
      intensification using the investigational integrase inhibitor MK-0518 and an investigational
      viral load assay to measure response to additional antiviral therapy. Eighteen patients will
      receive open-label MK-0518 400 mg P.O. every 12 hours for 28 days in addition to their
      prescribed antiretroviral therapy. Patients will take their doses of MK-0518 without regard
      to food. The study will enroll patients on antiretroviral therapy regimens with Cluster of
      Differentiation 4 (CD4) counts greater than 200 cells/ul, HIV-1 RNA levels &lt;50 copies RNA/ml
      plasma using a commercial assay(conventional Amplicor) and with detectable plasma virus
      (viral loads ≥ 1 copies RNA/ml plasma, Single copy assay, &quot;SCA&quot;). Acceptable antiretroviral
      regimens will include those on Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (&quot;NRTIs&quot;) +
      protease inhibitor (PI)I, NRTIs + non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), +
      PI, or NRTIs + NNRTI-containing regimens. Patients cannot have prior evidence of resistance
      to antiretroviral drugs. Patients will be screened for intensification by history, physical
      exam, and laboratory evaluations (see below). Patients who are eligible and who agree to
      participate will intensify their antiretroviral therapy for 28 days with MK-0518 400 mg by
      mouth twice a day. During the 28- day drug addition, patients will have samples drawn for SCA
      assay at entry and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 (+/- 1 d), with the last day of intensification
      as day 28. Patients will have additional phlebotomy after intensification on days 29, 30, 35,
      42, 49 and 58 (+/- 1 day). The intensification period is followed by a post- intensification
      period to determine whether removal of the drug resulted in viral RNA changes.

        <title>Proviral DNA Response, HIV-1 Sequence Variation Levels of Cell Associated HIV DNA and Genetic Variation in HIV During Raltegravir Addition in Individuals Who Have Declines in HIV</title>
        <description>We planned to compare HIV DNA levels and HIV genetic variation in individuals with and without ≥10 fold decreases in HIV RNA. As none of the patients had a decline in viral RNA, this analysis could not be readily analyzed</description>
        <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>0 participants were analyzed because no patients had ≥10 fold decrease in viral RNA. As described in patient outcome description, we would sequence patients only if a ≥10- fold decrease in viremia occurred, Since no one experienced ≥10 fold decrease in viremia, no sequencing could be performed.</population>
