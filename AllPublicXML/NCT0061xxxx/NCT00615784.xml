    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of bexarotene, a retinoic acid class
      drug, in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that has returned after or is resistant
      to standard chemotherapy or are otherwise not eligible for conventional chemotherapy.
      Retinoic acids are a class of drugs related to Vitamin A, and have a wide range of effects
      within normal and malignant cells that affect cell growth and cell death.
