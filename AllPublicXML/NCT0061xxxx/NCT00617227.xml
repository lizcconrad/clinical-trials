  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is based on the hypothesis that decreased creatinine clearance may be associated
      with detectable vancomycin levels in patients on enteral (oral / vancomycin enemas)
      vancomyicn for CDAD.

      The objective of the study is to see whether enteral vancomycin is absorbed through the
      inflamed GI mucosa in CDAD, and if it is absorbed, does it achieve measurable serum
      concentration.

      Vancomycin is a large glycopeptide compound with a molecular weight of about 1450 Da. It is
      not appreciably absorbed orally and is eliminated primarily via the renal route. Enteral
      vancomycin therapy (oral/intracolonic ) is used inpatients with severe Clostridium difficile
      associated colitis who are unable to take oral metronidazole or have failed treatment with
      metronidazole. Oral vancomycin is not detectable in serum of normal persons, but
      concentrations below therapeutic range may be found in patients with colitis. There are a few
      case reports of serum concentrations within the therapeutic range after oral/intracolonic
      administration of vancomycin, in association with renal failure. The use of enteral
      vancomycin in our geriatric population with variable creatinine clearance prompted us to
      measure the serum vancomycin levels in these patients.
