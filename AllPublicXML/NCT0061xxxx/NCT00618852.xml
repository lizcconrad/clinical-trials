  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of intravenous furosemide on
      cardio-respiratory performance in neonates receiving a packed red blood cell (PRBC)
      transfusion who are considered at high risk of volume overload.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Red cell transfusion is a very common practice in neonates, particularly in preterm infants.
      It has been estimated that approximately 300,000 neonates undergo transfusions annually. The
      decision to administer a blood transfusion to a sick anemic neonate is made after
      consideration of multiple clinical factors, including: poor weight gain, oxygenation failure,
      and recurrent apnea and bradycardia. These decisions are also influenced by physician
      preferences. For many years, furosemide has been used routinely by physicians during and
      after blood transfusions in neonates and other age groups. The rationale behind this common
      practice is to reduce the vascular overload that may be imposed by the additional blood
      volume delivered during transfusion. This belief, however, lacks the support of scientific
      clinical evaluation.
