  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of an increased pulmonary blood pressure amongst patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)is unclear. So is the impact of abnormal pulmonary blood
      pressure on symptoms. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of an increased
      pulmonary blood pressure in 200 patients with COPD. Furthermore we will investigate if lung
      function test results and blood tests can predict an increased pulmonary blood pressure, and
      explore whether COPD patients with a high pulmonary blood pressure have more symptoms that
      their co-patients.

      The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) is unclear. The presence of an abnormally increased pulmonary blood pressure
      worsens the prognosis of COPD, but the patients are not currently diagnosed or treated for
      pulmonary hypertension. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of pulmonary
      hypertension in 200 patients with COPD and explore whether it worsens functional capacity and
      symptoms. Furthermore we will look into whether blood gas values, NT-proBNP, CRP and lung
      function test result can predict which patients are at risk of having pulmonary hypertension.

      Methods: All patients will be screened by echocardiography. Those with signs of pulmonary
      hypertension will be admitted to right heart catheterization for direct measurements of
      pulmonary haemodynamics.

      All patients will perform a 6 minutes walk test and spirometry. Blood levels of NT-proBNP and
      CRP will be measured. Life quality by the St. George Questionnaire and contacts to the health
      care system is also assessed. Differences in these parameters are analyzed among patients
      with no, moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension.
