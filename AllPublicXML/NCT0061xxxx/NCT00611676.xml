  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-blind, placebo-run-in trial. Subjects will be informed that they may
      receive Venlafaxine or placebo during the course of the trial. All subjects will, in fact,
      receive placebo for the first two weeks. All subjects will then be placed on 150-225 mg per
      day of venlafaxine. Primary outcome assessment will compare pain intensity at 2 weeks (after
      placebo) to that at 12 weeks (after 10 weeks of Venlafaxine treatment).

      Study Hypothesis:

      In subjects who continue to have activity-limiting osteoarthritis pain after treatment with
      acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, 150-225 mg Venlafaxine per day over
      10 weeks will provide significant additional pain relief over that achieved with placebo
      (more than 30% reduction after Venlafaxine treatment).

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 50 - 80 years

          -  Physician diagnosis of OA in hip, knee or spine

          -  Significant activity limitation due to pain for at least one month on the Western
             Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and average pain more
             than 5/10 on Brief Pain Inventory despite adequate treatment with acetaminophen or
             NSAIDs (This will identify an OA group with significant psychological distress and a
             desire for treatment).

          -  Depression status is not restricted, but will be monitored with PRIME-MD interview and
             the SCL-20. We anticipate depressive symptoms will be common in this population due to
             the above requirement for activity limitation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cannot read and write English

          -  Significant cognitive impairment

          -  History of psychosis or mania

          -  Current suicidal ideation

          -  Current substance abuse or dependence

          -  Current use of opioids or any antidepressant medication

          -  Use of investigational drug within the past month
