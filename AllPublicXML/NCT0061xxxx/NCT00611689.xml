  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I study, the investigators will determine the maximum tolerated doses of
      imatinib and PTK/ZK administered in two different dose schedules. Due to the different
      mechanisms of action and the minimally-overlapping toxicity profiles of these two novel oral
      agents, it is hoped that a combination regimen incorporating both compounds will produce
      increased activity without enhanced toxicity. After completion of this phase I study, the
      investigators propose a follow-up phase II study in patients with previously treated
      metastatic renal cell cancer - where VEGF and PDGF appear to play important roles in the
      malignant phenotype - to determine the antitumor efficacy of the recommended dose of this
      combination regimen.

    <description>Imatinib and PTK/ZK will each be administered orally daily. Two dose levels of imatinib (400 mg and 600 mg) will be tested with 4 dose levels of PTK/ZK (250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg, and 1000 mg). 3 patients will be accrued at each individual dose level. If dose-limiting toxicities are reported in ≤ 1/3 patients, the dose level will be expanded to 6 patients. If dose-limiting toxicities are reported in &lt; 2/6 patients, then dose escalation will continue. If ≥ 2/6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity, the next lower dose will be considered the maximum tolerated dose and will be expanded to a total of 12 patients. There will be no intrapatient dose escalations. Patients may continue to receive treatment until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression is encountered.</description>

             normal (within 7 days prior to initial treatment).

          8. Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 gm/dL (may be transfused or receive erythropoietin to maintain or
             exceed this level).

          9. Patients with a history of brain metastases are eligible, but only if they have had
             previous treatment for the metastases and these are inactive and asymptomatic at the
             time of enrollment in this study.

         10. Patients must be able to understand the nature of this study and give written informed
             consent.

         11. Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before initiation of study drug dosing. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Male and female
             patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of
             birth control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of
             study drug. Oral, injectable, and injection contraceptives should not be considered
             effective as they may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions.

         12. Must have evaluable-disease

         13. Must be &gt; 18 years of age.

         14. Patients may have received prior systemic chemotherapy, i.e. there is no limit on the
             number of prior regimens the patient may have received.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients who are pregnant or are lactating.

          2. History of acute myocardial infarction within 6 months. In addition, patients are
             ineligible if they have clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g.
             uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina), New York Heart Association grade II or
             greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, or
             &gt; grade II peripheral vascular disease.

          3. Patients with a prior malignancy (except for adequately treated basal-cell or
             squamous-cell skin cancers, in situ carcinomas, or low grade [Gleason score 3+3 or
             less] localized prostate cancer) in the past 5 years will be excluded.

          4. Patients with active concurrent infections or patients with serious underlying medical
             conditions will be excluded from the study.

          5. Women who are pregnant or lactating are ineligible. All men and women of reproductive
             potential must agree to use effective contraception while receiving treatment in this
             study. (See 3.1.11)

          6. Patients who are concurrently using phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates,
             rifampicin, phenobarbital, systemic retinoids, or St. John's Wort are ineligible.

          7. Patients who have had a prior grade 4 thromboembolic event are ineligible. Patients
             who have had a grade 3 thromboembolic event are ineligible unless they have an
             in-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of low molecular weight
             heparin or unfractionated heparin. In addition, patients who have clinical or
             radiologic evidence of clots in the renal veins, inferior vena cava, hepatic veins, or
             portal vein are ineligible. Since warfarin is metabolized through the CYP450 system,
             no therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin (e.g. Coumadin or Coumadine) will be
             permitted in patients participating in this study. As an alternative, therapeutic
             anticoagulation may be accomplished using low-molecular weight heparin (e.g. Lovenox)
             or heparin. Mini-Dose Coumadin (e.g. 1 mg qd) is permitted for prophylaxis of central
             venous catheter thrombosis, at the discretion of the treating physician. In general,
             the use of Coumadin is discouraged on this protocol.

          8. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy; or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study.

          9. Patients with PEG or G-tubes are ineligible.

         10. Proteinuria; if &gt; 1+ on dipstick at baseline patients must have 24-hour urine
             collection. Patients with &gt; 500mg protein/24 hrs are ineligible. (See Appendix A -
             Evaluation and Management of Proteinuria).

         11. Any nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

         12. Any clinical evidence or history of a bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

         13. Participation in another experimental drug study within 28 days of starting treatment.

         14. History of any other disease, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory
             finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use
             of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the
             study or render the subject at high risk from treatment complications.

         15. Presence of poorly controlled hypertension (as defined by the treating clinician) If a
             patient's condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated &lt; 48
             hours prior to initiation of therapy.

         16. Prior VEGF therapy.

         17. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of PTK787/ZK 222584 (i.e. ulcerative disease, uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, bowel obstruction, or inability to
             swallow the tablets).
