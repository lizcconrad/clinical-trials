  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The abbreviated diagnostic sleep studies (RP), made at home and transferred telematically to
      the sleep laboratory, are useful for the diagnosis of sleep apnea and due to a lower cost, it
      could be an alternative to conventional polysomnography. Objectives: 1) Usefulness of
      domiciliary study evaluated by percentage of patients diagnosed of SAHS compared with PSG and
      agreement in the therapeutic decision. 2) Direct costs of patients included in the study.
      Design: controlled, randomized, crossed and blind (320 patients) comparing PR made at home
      with PSG, in patients suspicious of SAHS. The equipment transfer will be made by a transport
      agency from home to home in order to be universal the access to this diagnostic model. The
      file transmission with the raw data of the study will be made telematically by GPRS. If the
      aims of the study reach an end there will be a considerable change in the clinical practice
      making possible the international acceptation of domiciliary PR as diagnosis of SAHS and
      adapting the diagnosis of this syndrome to the new technologies of communication. The
      universalization of domiciliary PR would make possible that the diagnosis of SAHS could be
      done in any patient and in any country with GPRS technology and a transport agency, that is
      to say in all developed countries. As sleep apneas affect 5-7 million persons in Spain and
      there is association between sleep apneas and cardiovascular risk, in the immediate future we
      must evaluate this disease as we do today with the cholesterol determination. If our results
      are as predicted, the primary care physician could start and in a lot of cases finish the
      SAHS diagnostic process. This would simplify remarkably the diagnosis of SAHS and would
      alleviate a lot the process cost all over the world.
