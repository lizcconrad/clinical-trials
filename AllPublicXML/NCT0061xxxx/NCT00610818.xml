      We are approaching you to participate in this study because you are taking Palifermin and the
      purpose of this study is to describe the effect of Palifermin on skin growth found on the
      body. Palifermin is a new synthetic growth factor (encourages skin cells to grow)
      specifically designed to protect the areas of the body (mouth and upper digestive tract) that
      are damaged by chemotherapy. The cells in these areas are rapidly dividing cells and so are
      killed by chemotherapeutic drugs. Palifermin is a drug that stimulates new cells in these
      areas to grow and therefore protects patients from some serious side effects of chemotherapy.
      These include mucositis or inflammation of the lining of the mouth and other organs resulting
      in difficulty swallowing, speaking and extreme pain in the mouth and upper digestive tract.

      Skin cells are also known to respond to these types of growth factors like Palifermin, but
      unfortunately no studies have been done that look specifically at the effect of this drug on
      pre-existing skin lesions or the development of new skin lesions. We will be asking you if
      you have noticed any change in moles or other skin lesions that you have, and if you have
      noticed any new lesions. We will also be doing a full physical examination of the skin at
      regular intervals during the study to document the appearance of any new lesions or change in
      pre-existing ones.
