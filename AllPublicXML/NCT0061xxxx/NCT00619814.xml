  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research protocol aim is to compare diagnostic tools for the proper evaluation of patient
      with fecal occult blood test positive (FOBT +), a routine screening test for colorecatl
      carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to determine if Double Contrast Barium Enema (DCBE),
      a specialized radiographic exam of the colon, is a reasonable alternative for the evaluation
      of patients with positive fecal occult blood as compared to colonoscopy, which is considered
      the best evaluation method. Colonoscopy involves the direct visualization of the colon using
      a flexible instrument. This permits the removal of polyps and to obtain biopsies. It involves
      additional risks, discomfort and costs. In fact the DCBE is the experimental procedure in
      this protocol.

      Additional aims of this study are: to determine the localization, number, size and pathologic
      characteristics, if applicable, of findings in colonoscopy and/or DCBE and to determine the
      patient preference between both studies.

      This study is limited to those patients 50 years or older who are at average risk for colon
      cancer and who had a positive fecal occult blood screening test.

    <description>This is a blinded cohort study comparing double contrast barium enema (DCBE) and colonoscopy in detecting polyps and/or cancer in patients with positive FOBT. Initial evaluation consisted of complete clinical history and physical examination. A DCBE and a colonoscopy were performed in all patients. All polyps identified during colonoscopy were removed and classified by histology. Sensitivity and specificity of DCBE for polyp and/or cancer detection was determined. Tolerability and grade of satisfaction with study procedures was assessed.</description>
