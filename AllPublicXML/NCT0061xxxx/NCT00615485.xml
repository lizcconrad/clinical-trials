  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific subgroups of children who survive treatment for childhood malignancies have been
      shown to develop relative osteopenia following chemotherapy and are felt to be at risk for
      developing osteoporosis later in life due to their inability to reach peak bone mass during
      childhood. Based upon an earlier study in our department, the investigators reported
      conclusive evidence that approximately half of survivors of pediatric solid malignancies are
      at risk for these problems. However, the proportion of patients in our population that showed
      osteopenia/osteoporosis was lower than that in other similar cross-sectional studies in solid
      tumors such as osteosarcoma. The main difference between our report and the osteosarcoma
      study was duration of follow-up, with ours being shorter. Longer follow-up may prove that a
      larger proportion of our patients are affected. The purpose is to perform a longitudinal
      follow-up study of bone mineral density using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in adult
      survivors of solid pediatric tumors that were previously studied as subjects in our original
      cross-sectional study. The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of pediatric solid
      cancer survivors with significantly lower bone mineral density (BMD) compared to established
      age group controls will be increased with the additional time that has elapsed since the
      original study despite the fact that the patients are young and would not normally be
      expected to have osteopenia/osteoporosis at this age.

        The 38 patients from the SUNY Upstate Medical Center (Syracuse, NY) Pediatric Oncology
        Long-term Survivor Clinic who were subjects in the original Georg Fund supported study will
        comprise the patient population if they are locatable and willing to participate. Patients
        must be less than 40 years of age to participate.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  The 38 patients from the SUNY Upstate Medical Center Pediatric Oncology Long-term
             Survivor Clinic who were subjects in the original Georg Fund supported study will
             comprise the patient population if they are locatable and willing to participate.

          -  Patients must be less than 40 years of age to participate.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients who have received interval treatment for Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) and
             those who have received subsequent cranial irradiation or total body irradiation
             (groups already known to be at high risk for osteoporosis) will be excluded. These
             would have had to have occurred in the interval since the original study, as these
             were also exclusion criteria for that study. In addition, any patient who received
             interval non-autologous bone marrow transplant will be excluded, as these patients may
             have graft versus host disease (also known to be associated with osteopenia).
