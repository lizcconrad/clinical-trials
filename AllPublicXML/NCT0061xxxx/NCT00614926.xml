  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether modafinil is helpful in alleviating
      fatigue, low energy, drowsiness and difficulty concentrating among patients with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS), and to evaluate incidence and frequency of adverse events, if any.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALS is an untreatable, progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease whose etiology is unknown
      and whose course is relatively rapid (median survival 3 years after diagnosis). Palliative
      care, including symptom management, can contribute greatly to improved quality of life. In
      this context, alleviation of fatigue can help maintain function, extend the duration of time
      when employment is feasible for those still working, and can enable patients to more fully
      participate in and enjoy social and recreational activities. Given the prevalence of fatigue
      in this population, identification of effective treatment is a meaningful goal.

    <description>The CGI is a standardized assessment tool widely used in clinical psychopharmacology trials as an outcome measure. Scores range from 1= very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5-7 = worse. We use it as a dichotomous measure with scores of 1 or 2 signifying &quot;responder&quot; and all the rest as &quot;non-responder&quot; using all available data including clinician judgement, and ratings scales.</description>

    <measure>Number of &quot;Impaired&quot; Scores on Neuropsychological (Brief) Test Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This was an initial plan but the large majority of patients were too impaired (either anarthric or unable to use hands) to complete the tests we had selected so this outcome measure turned out to be unfeasible. Therefore, 0 participants were analyzed.</description>

        <description>The CGI is a standardized assessment tool widely used in clinical psychopharmacology trials as an outcome measure. Scores range from 1= very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5-7 = worse. We use it as a dichotomous measure with scores of 1 or 2 signifying &quot;responder&quot; and all the rest as &quot;non-responder&quot; using all available data including clinician judgement, and ratings scales.</description>
