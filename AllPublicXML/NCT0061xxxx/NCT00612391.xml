  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized clinical trial is proposed to compare the plate fixation of proximal
      humerus fractures using a minimally invasive lateral approach and the traditional anterior
      approach.Forty five patients will be assigned to each approach (total of 90 patients) and
      will be assessed 7 times over a two-year period. The trial's primary objectives will be to
      demonstrate the efficacy of the plating technique in terms of speed of recuperation of
      function. The Quick DASH will be used for evaluation of function.The study will also examine
      secondary end-points of pain, range of motion, esthetic satisfaction and radiographic
      outcome, as assessed by the components of the Constant Score3,4, SF-12V2 Questionnaire, and
      Patient Scare Assessment Scale Questionnaire. Furthermore, the assessment of safety will be
      based on the rates of all reported complications and adverse events at 2 years

    <description>A longitudinally oriented, 4-cm incision will be made laterally starting at the acromion. The deltoid will be split proximally at the most strategic location (vis-à-vis the fracture), and after the deltoid is bluntly elevated from the humerus more distally the axillary nerve will be identified by digital palpation. The nerve is easily identified posteriorly as it emerges from the quadrilateral space. With a finger maintained on the nerve for protection, the plate will be inserted onto the lateral side of the proximal humerus and fixed according to the described technique. A second, 2-cm longitudinal incision will then be made further distally for diaphyseal screw placement. This incision is well distal to the course of the axillary nerve.</description>

    <description>Anterior, Delto-Pectoral Approach - A 10-cm incision will be made over the deltopectoral groove, starting at the coracoid process proximally. As the clavipectoral fascia is incised, the cephalic vein will be identified and retracted laterally with the deltoid muscle. The pectoralis major as well as the conjoint tendon will be retracted medially, and the long head of the biceps tendon will be identified and used as a guide for achieving an anatomic reduction of the different fracture parts. Next, internally rotating the humerus will allow access to the lateral side of the proximal humerus, on which the plate will then be fixed according to the described technique.</description>
