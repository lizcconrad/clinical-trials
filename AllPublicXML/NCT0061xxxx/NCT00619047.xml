  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis has been established as a major public health problem, primarily effecting
      women. The attainment of maximal peak bone mass is crucial in the prevention of osteoporosis,
      yet little is known about the specifics of bone accrual. Physical activity has been
      identified as an important modifiable factor controlling bone accrual. It is has been shown
      that increased activity during peri-pubertal years increase bone mineral content during
      adulthood. Thus, strategies designed to increase peak bone mass should target the
      peri-pubertal years of critical bone acquisition.

      Hypothesis 1a: The amount of bone mineral accrued during the peri-pubertal years is greater
      in girls who engage in impact activity than in those who do not.

      Hypothesis 1b: The positive effects of impact activity on bone accrual are maintained after
      cessation of the activity, resulting in greater bone mineral density in girls who participate
      in impact activity during a portion of the peri-pubertal years than in those who never
      participated in impact activity.

        Subjects were recruited into the following three groups based on their exposure to
        gymnastic activity. A) control, no gymnastic activity. B)retired gymnasts, who participated
        at study onset, but stopped gymnastics activity during the course of the study. C) active
        gymnast, who continues participation in gymnastics throughout the duration of the study.
