  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of adjuvant therapy for patients with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus that
      has been completely removed by surgery. &quot;Adjuvant&quot; therapy means that the tumor (the
      leiomyosarcoma) has been completely removed by surgery; thus, giving further treatment now is
      done in hopes of decreasing the chance that the tumor will come back (relapse or recur). The
      main goal of this study is to show that this series of treatments is safe for patients with
      your type of tumor.

      In this trial you will be getting drugs that have been approved for use in some types of
      cancer. In this study we wish to see whether the combination of two chemotherapy drugs,
      docetaxel and gemcitabine can decrease the chance of your tumor, leiomyosarcoma of the
      uterus, from coming back (relapsing). We will also be looking at the short-term side effects
      and risks of the drugs given in this combination to patients with leiomyosarcoma that has
      been completely resected (removed by surgery).

      The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel has been shown to be safe, and it has been shown
      to decrease the size of leiomyosarcoma tumors in patients with leiomyosarcoma of the uterus
      that has relapsed, or has continued to grow despite treatment with other chemotherapy drugs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed leiomyosarcoma of the uterus, completely resected, stage I,
             II, III or IV within 8 weeks of surgery to remove the tumor(s). Patients with stage I
             tumors should have LMS that is considered high-grade by histology.

          -  No prior chemotherapy for LMS

          -  No prior treatment with gemcitabine or docetaxel Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt; or equal to 80%

          -  Pre-treatment absolute neutrophil count &gt; or equal to 1500/ul, hemoglobin greater than
             or equal to 8.0 gm/dl, and platelets &gt; than or equal to 100,000/ul.

          -  Adequate renal documented by serum creatinine &lt; than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Adequate hepatic function: Total serum bilirubin must be within institutional normal
             limits; transaminases (ALT and AST) may be up to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of
             normal (ULN) if alkaline phosphatase is &lt; than or equal to ULN, or alkaline
             phosphatase may be up to 4 x ULN if transaminases are &lt; than or equal to ULN.

        If peripheral neuropathy is present, it must be less than or equal to grade 1

          -  Capable of providing written, informed consent

          -  Women with child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must

             noted above, patients with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) any evidence

             contraindicates this protocol therapy are excluded.

          -  Known history of hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other drugs formulated with
