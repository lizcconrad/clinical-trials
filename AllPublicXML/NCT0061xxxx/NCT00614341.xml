  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if pulsed electric field therapy reduces lower leg and foot pain associated with
      diabetic neuropathy and lessens the need for medication.

      The MedRelief device sends a sub-threshold electric signal through the skin using electrodes
      as means of signal delivery. The signal or waveform, frequency and strength were created to
      match the characteristics of signals the body generates to help natural healing.

      A multi-center, randomized, open-label study involving 23 patients with chronic diabetic
      peripheral neuropathy meeting study entry criteria. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive one of two treatments using an FDA cleared MedRelief device: (1) a MedRelief SE 55
      device set on &quot;pulsed&quot; mode at 10 microsecond burst intervals 4150 Ha, or (2) a MedRelief SE
      55 device set on &quot;continuous&quot; mode at 4150 Hz. Subjects will wear the device on target foot
      each night for a minimum of 6 hours over a two week (15 day treatment)period.

      Subjects will complete a daily pain diary, medication form, and device use form. Subject
      global assessments and physician global assessments will occur at baseline, study visits Day
      7, Day 15 and Day 21 (end of study).

      Response to therapy will include pain reduction, improvement in sensation, improved response
      to vibratory stimulation and reduction of edema in study subjects.
