      Clinical effect and tolerability of atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with Pulmonary
      Hypertension: double-blinded, randomised, prospective phase II study for 6 months with
      adjusted doses of Atorvastatin

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAH is characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and lower extremity edema as a result of heart
      failure. Several research have proved that inflammation may participate in the pathogenesis
      of PAH. As atorvastatin inhibits inflammation and has beneficial effects on blood vessels in
      other types of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, atorvastatin may similarly benefit patients
      with PAH. Experimental data suggest that statins attenuates pulmonary hypertension in animal
      experiments. In addition, non-controlled clinical studies suggest that atorvastatin is
      effective and safe in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive 6 months of daily placebo
      tablets or daily atorvastatin in a double-blind fashion. The study will compare the safety
      and efficacy of placebo and atorvastatin.

    <description>Patients were assigned to receive 10 mg of atorvastatin for 6 months (supplied by JiaLin Pharmaceutical Co., Beijing, China). The dose was adjusted to 5mg daily if serum transaminase levels increased by less than three times the upper limit of normal or creatine kinase levels increased to less than five times the upper limit of normal. If serum transaminase and creatine kinase levels remained normal and low-density lipoprotein level greater than 3.4mmol/L after 4 weeks of therapy, the dose of drug was increased to 20mg once daily.</description>
