  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of drug-induced injury is high in the ambulatory geriatric population and is
      increased for elders upon transition from the hospital to the ambulatory setting. In this
      application, we describe an effort to build on our extensive experience in medication safety
      and HIT-based medication management to respond to the AHRQ RFA entitled Ambulatory Safety and
      Quality Program: Improving Quality through Clinician Use of Health IT (RFA-HS-07-006). In
      this study, we propose to develop and evaluate the value of an enhanced, HIT-based
      transitional care intervention superimposed on the ambulatory electronic medical record (EMR)
      to improve the quality and safety of medication management, focusing particularly on the
      transition from the inpatient to the ambulatory setting for older adults with multiple
      comorbid conditions who are prescribed high risk medications. We propose a randomized
      controlled trial of a HIT-based transitional care intervention with enhanced medication and
      therapeutic monitoring alerts to improve the quality and safety of patient monitoring and
      medication management. We postulate that the efficient and coordinated delivery of actionable
      health information to the clinician via use of HIT in the ambulatory setting can improve
      medication safety for the growing geriatric population. The specific aims for this study are
      to evaluate, among a population of older adults discharged from the hospital, the impact of
      an enhanced discharge information system initiated upon transition to the ambulatory setting:
      (1) on the rate of follow-up by an outpatient provider within 14 days of hospital discharge;
      (2) on the prevalence of appropriate monitoring for selected high risk medications at 30 days
      from the time of hospital discharge; (3) on the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs) 30
      days after discharge; and (4) on the rate of emergency department visits and hospital
      readmission within 30 days of discharge. A secondary aim for this study is to determine costs
      directly related to the development and installation of the HIT-based transitional care
      intervention. This research allows for the examination of an integrated HIT intervention on
      the quality of follow-up, outpatient clinician workflow, occurrence of ADEs, and health care
      utilization to gain insights into the effective use of clinical alerts and coordinated
      delivery of actionable information to outpatient clinicians in the management of ambulatory
      elderly patients subsequent to hospital discharge.
