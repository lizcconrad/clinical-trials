      This is an open label, single arm, dose escalation study of ARQ 197 in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will take ARQ 197 orally twice daily continuously at dose levels specified for their
      respective dose cohorts. The ARQ 197 starting dose will be a total daily dose of 200 mg (100
      mg bid). ARQ 197 treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable
      toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose
      adjustment is permitted. A treatment cycle is designed as four weeks (28 days) and will be
      repeated without therapy interruption.
