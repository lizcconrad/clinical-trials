  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose of the GF Strong water protocol is to allow clients who have thin liquid
      dysphagia to drink water under certain specified conditions according to the rules of the
      water protocol. Water Protocols have been shown to improve client satisfaction, and
      hydration. We wish to assess this in a randomized, controlled fashion, and this is a pilot
      project to determine feasibility.

      GF Strong water protocol will be used with the study subjects. Control subjects will not
      receive water protocol. Pre and post measures will include SWAL-QOL, client satisfaction,
      water and thickened fluid intake, and monitoring for adverse events.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Potential participants in this study will include all clients aged 19 years and older who
        are admitted to GF Strong Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and Neruomusculoskeletal (NMS) and
        Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) programs and who have thin liquid dysphagia resulting from
        a neurological diagnosis. The thin liquid dysphagia will be confirmed by a Modified Barium
        Swallow conducted by a certified speech-language pathologist. Potential participants must
        be proficient in English in order to complete the questionnaires and capable of
        understanding the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Clients who present with the following will be excluded: active pneumonia, acute or
        unstable medical condition, surgery where coughing might rip stitches or cause pain or
        discomfort, oral dental bacteria or infection that cannot be controlled, poor oral hygiene
        that cannot be improved with routine care, excessive or uncomfortable coughing during or
        after intake, severe or uncontrolled GERD, immunosuppressed, or decline participation.
