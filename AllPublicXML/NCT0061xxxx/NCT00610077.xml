      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) in patients
      with anovulatory infertility. DESIGN: Open, prospective, randomized, parallel group,
      multicentric, comparative trial. SETTING: Out patient clinics of infertility centers in
      India. PATIENT(S): Fifty-five patients with anovulatory infertility were recruited.
      Twenty-seven patients (59 cycles) were given letrozole and twenty-eight patients (68 cycles)
      were given CC. Both drugs were given orally on days 3-7 of menstrual cycle. INTERVENTION(S):
      Letrozole, CC, ovulation induction, vaginal micronized progesterone, IUI.
