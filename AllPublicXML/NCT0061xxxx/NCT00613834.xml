      The purpose of this study is to assess the level of pain women experience with an Essure
      procedure and the effect that lidocaine might have on that pain. We will also assess the
      absorption of lidocaine in the uterus by measuring lidocaine levels in the blood.

      We intend to conduct a randomized, blinded, and placebo- controlled clinical trial at Oregon
      Health and Science University and Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette to determine
      if intrauterine lidocaine infusion will decrease the amount of pain subjects experience
      during and after Essure transcervical tubal sterilization.

      We plan to enroll women who have selected Essure as their method of tubal sterilization who
      will be randomized to one of two groups on the days of their procedures. Subjects in Group 1,
      the treatment group, will receive a standard paracervical block with lidocaine intrauterine
      infusion and subjects in Group 2, the control group, will receive a standard paracervical
      block with saline intrauterine infusion. The subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a
      100 mm VAS at five points during the procedure and once thirty minutes following the
      procedure. Subjects will also be asked to rate their overall satisfaction with their care
      prior to leaving the recovery room.
