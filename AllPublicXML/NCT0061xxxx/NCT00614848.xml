          -  Subject must have clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease or a positive functional
             study.

          -  Subject has single vessel disease or has multivessel disease with only moderate

             at the time of study inclusion).

          -  Target lesion / vessel must meet the following criteria:

               1. Target lesion is a single de novo lesion that has not been previously treated
                  with any interventional procedure. Only one lesion may be treated per subject

               2. Target vessel must be a native coronary artery with a stenosis of &gt;=50% and &lt;100%

               3. Target lesion must be &gt;= 14 mm and ≤ 27 mm in length

               4. Target vessel reference diameter must be &gt;= 2.25 mm and ≤3.5 mm

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before the procedure.

          -  Subject or subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the study
             and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by
             the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site

          -  Subject and treating physician agree that subject will comply with all required
             post-procedure follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%

          -  A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, cobalt,
             nickel, chromium, or a sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated

          -  History of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity or receiving drugs similar
             to/or synergistic to ABT-578 (rapamycin, tacrolimus, sirolimus, CCI-779 or other
             analogues).

          -  A platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt;700,000 cells/mm³, or a WBC &lt;3,000 cells/mm³

             placement

          -  Previous stenting anywhere in the target vessel

          -  Target vessel has evidence of thrombus or is excessively tortuous (2 bends &gt;90 degrees
             to reach the target lesion)

          -  Significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require
             revascularization or impede run off

          -  Target lesion located in native vessel distally to anastomosis with vein graft or LIMA

          -  Target lesion has any of the following characteristics:

               1. Lesion location is aorto-ostial, an unprotected left main lesion, or within 5mm
                  of the origin of the LAD, LCX, or RCA

               2. Involves a side branch &gt;2.0 mm in diameter

               3. Is at or distal to a 45º bend in the vessel

               4. Is severely calcified

          -  Unprotected left main coronary artery disease (an obstruction greater than 50% in the
             left main coronary artery)

          -  History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 6 months

          -  Active peptic ulcer or upper GI bleeding within the prior 6 months

          -  The subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions

          -  Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months

          -  Any previous or planned treatment with anti-restenotic therapies including, but not
             limited to, drug-eluting stents and brachytherapy

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
