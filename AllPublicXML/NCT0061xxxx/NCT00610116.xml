      Evaluate appropriate performance of Electronic Repositioning™ (ER) in the clinical routine,
      cumulative incidence of phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) &amp; success rates of ER to remove it,
      various incl. left ventricular pacing (LVP) thresholds and PNS

      &quot;Bipolar leads for left ventricular pacing (LVP) such as the newly available ACUITY TM or the
      standard EASYTRAK TM II and EASYTRAK TM III leads from GUIDANT in combination with suitable
      devices for cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) allow for the non-invasive programming of
      different LVP configurations. Hence, this Electronic RepositioningTM (ER) may help physicians
      to overcome problems in CRT such as ineffective biventricular pacing, high LVP thresholds and
      phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) without the need for an additional patient's operation to
      reposition LV leads.The ERACE study it a multi-centre, prospective, non-randomized clinical
      study to document and evaluate appropriate performance of GUIDANT's Electronic Repositioning™
      in the clinical routine with respect to the following major aspects: avoidance of PNS and low
      LVP thresholds (for low battery consumption and extended device longevity) in standard
      cardiale resynchronisations therapy (CRT). &quot;
