      This study aims to evaluate and to compare the efficacy and safety of FK506MR with Prograf®
      in stable liver transplantation patients. It shall be demonstrated that FK506MR is
      non-inferior to Prograf® with regards to the efficacy and safety.

      A multicentre, randomized, open label, two parallel group study The patients will be
      randomized to MR4 group or Prograf® group. The treatment period is 3 months( 12
      weeks).Patients randomized to MR4 group who complete 3 months treatment period will continue
      to use MR4 until MR4 commercial available or authority notification.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent with the date of the patient must be obtained

          2. Patient is the recipient of a liver transplant from 6 to 24 months prior to enrollment

          3. Patient is currently receiving Prograf or Prograf + MMF based immunosuppressive
             therapy

          4. At screening the liver and kidney function of patient is stable (defined as Serum
             creatinine is normal and ALT or AST is &lt;= 2 times the upper value of normal range)

          5. Patient has the stable whole blood trough level concentration of Prograf (defined as
             tacrolimus trough concentrations of 2-10ng/ml measured 14 days prior to enrollment),
             and is clinically stable in the opinion of the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has received an organ transplant other than a kidney

          2. Patient has experienced any rejection episode within 90 days prior to enrollment in
             the study, any rejection episode within the last 6 months that required
             anti-lymphocyte antibody therapy

          3. Patient is currently receiving other immunosuppressant therapy, eg. sirolimus

          4. Patient with liver recurrent cancer, or metastasis, or other cancer

          5. Patient has any unstable medical condition that could interfere with the study
             objectives

          6. Patient is currently participating in another clinical trial and/or is taking or has
             been taking an investigational drug in the 30 days prior to enrollment

          7. Patient is allergic macrolide antibiotics or tacrolimus

          8. Patient has psychiatric disorder, in the opinion of the investigator, may invalidate
