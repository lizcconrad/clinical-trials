      Primary Objectives To determine maxi tolerated dose &amp; dose limiting toxicity of SU011248 +
      Irinotecan in recurrent MG pts not on EIAEDs To characterize safety &amp; tolerability of
      SU011248 + Irinotecan among pts w recurrent MG Secondary Objectives To evaluate
      pharmacokinetic profile of SU011248 &amp; Irinotecan when co-administered in pts w MG To evaluate
      anti-tumor activity of SU011248 + Irinotecan

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary interest for combining SU011248 w irinotecan in malignant glioma pts derives from
      dramatic anti-tumor activity recently demonstrated among RMG pts treated w humanized
      anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, when combined w irinotecan. 63 percent
      radiographic response rate was observed following treatment w regimen every other wk, &amp;
      median progression-free survival was 23wks. Similar enhancement of chemo activity by
      VEGF-directed therapy w bev has been previously demonstrated for colorectal &amp; lung cancer
      pts. SU011248 is being evaluated in current regimen because it may exert more potent
      anti-angiogenic effect than bev among MG pts due to its ability to inhibit PDGFR-mediated
      pericyte stabilization in tumor neovasculature.

      Current proposed ph I study is designed to determine MTD &amp; DLT of SU011248 when combo w
      irinotecan for pts w RMG. Both SU01148 &amp; irinotecan are known to be metabolized by CYP3A4
      cytochrome system. Current study will limit enrollment to pts who are not on CYP3A4-enzyme
      inducing anti-epileptic drugs.

    <description>Sutent given in daily oral manner for 1st 4 wks of each 6wk cycle. You will not take any Sutent during last 14 days of each 6 wk cycle. CPT-11 will be given intravenously over 1 &amp; 1/2 hrs on 1st day of each cycle &amp; then again on days 14 &amp; 28.
Sutent is approved for adult subjects w some forms of kidney cancer. It is considered &quot;investigational&quot; for brain tumors. Dosing will begin on day 1 of cycle 1 &amp; continue daily for 4 wks by mouth.
Irinotecan is approved for adult subjects with some forms of colorectal cancer. It is also considered &quot;investigational&quot; for brain tumors. Irinotecan dose will depend on your height &amp; weight. Irinotecan will be given intravenously over 90 min on days 1, 14 &amp; 28 of 6wk cycle.
You will be seen in clinic approximately every 42 days for 1st 3 cycles of study drug, &amp; then every other cycle thereafter. Your brain MRI examination will be done within 1 wk prior to completion of cycles 1-3, &amp; then within 1 week prior to completion of every other cycle.</description>
