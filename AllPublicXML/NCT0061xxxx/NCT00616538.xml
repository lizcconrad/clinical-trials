  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Novel therapies for AD that avoid immunosuppression and potential carcinogensis are needed.
      EpiCeram™ , a topical cream, represents a novel class of therapy for skin disorders that does
      not contain corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory drugs. The objective of the present
      study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of EpiCeram ™ in the treatment of moderate to
      severe atopic dermatitis as compared to mid-strength topical steroid cream following twice
      daily dosing for four weeks in pediatric patients with AD. The potential benefit to patients
      lies in the potential for EpiCeram ™ to provide restoration of the normal skin barrier as
      shown in previous studies and eliminate or reduce the requirement for supplemental topical
      steroid administration.
