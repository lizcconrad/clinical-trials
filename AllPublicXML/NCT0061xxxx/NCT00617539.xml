      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and temozolomide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving irinotecan together with
      temozolomide and to see how well it works in treating patients with breast cancer who have
      received previous treatment for brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the objective response rate systemically and in the CNS to the combination
           of irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide among patients with breast cancer and
           progressive brain metastases that have progressed after previous treatment for brain
           metastases.

        -  To determine the toxicities associated with the combination of irinotecan hydrochloride
           and temozolomide in breast cancer patients with progressive brain metastases.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the time to first progression at any site (CNS or extra-CNS) in patients
           treated with the combination of irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with the combination of irinotecan
           hydrochloride and temozolomide for brain metastases.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 15 and oral temozolomide on days 1-7
      and 15-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 4 weeks.

    <description>Imaging was performed at 8-week intervals to assess response to treatment. Patients with known or suspected leptomeningeal disease were deemed to have a complete response if CSF cytology converted to negative (if positive at baseline) and all meningeal enhancement or nodularity of brain and/or spine MRI resolved. A modified RECIST 1.0 criteria was used to assess CNS response for patients with new or progressing brain metastases. In this modified RECIST criteria, CNS lesions &lt;1cm were not considered measurable, but were considered evaluable for response and progression. Progressive disease for patients with lesions &lt;1 cm was defined as follows: growth of a lesion from less than or equal to 5 mm to greater than or equal to 10mm; or, growth of a 6-9 mm lesion by at least 5 mm in the case of non-target parenchymal brain metastases.</description>

    <description>The number of patients experiencing a clinical benefit is the sum of patients with an objective response plus patients with stable disease at ≥ 16 weeks from cycle 1 day 1 (first day of treatment).

          <title>Number of Patients With Objective Treatment Response (Complete or Partial) in the CNS</title>
          <description>Imaging was performed at 8-week intervals to assess response to treatment. Patients with known or suspected leptomeningeal disease were deemed to have a complete response if CSF cytology converted to negative (if positive at baseline) and all meningeal enhancement or nodularity of brain and/or spine MRI resolved. A modified RECIST 1.0 criteria was used to assess CNS response for patients with new or progressing brain metastases. In this modified RECIST criteria, CNS lesions &lt;1cm were not considered measurable, but were considered evaluable for response and progression. Progressive disease for patients with lesions &lt;1 cm was defined as follows: growth of a lesion from less than or equal to 5 mm to greater than or equal to 10mm; or, growth of a 6-9 mm lesion by at least 5 mm in the case of non-target parenchymal brain metastases.</description>

        <description>Imaging at 8-week intervals to assess response to treatment. A modified RECIST 1.0 criteria was used to assess response and time to progression in the CNS for patients with progressing brain metastases. In this modified RECIST criteria, CNS lesions &lt;1cm were not considered measurable, but were considered evaluable for response and progression. Progressive disease for patients with lesions &lt;1 cm was defined as follows: growth of a lesion from less than or equal to 5 mm to greater than or equal to 10mm; or, growth of a 6-9 mm lesion by at least 5 mm in the case of non-target parenchymal brain metastases.
If patient did not come back for a follow up scan after clinical deterioration, patient was only considered stable up to the time of the last scan per protocol and time to progression would be from cycle 1 day 1 to the last scan they completed that was stable.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline scan prior to study entry was performed within 14 days of cycle 1 day 1, then every 8 weeks from then until disease progression or up to 2 years</time_frame>
