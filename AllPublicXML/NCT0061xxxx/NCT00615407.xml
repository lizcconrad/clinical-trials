  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1980, the number of people in the United States diagnosed with asthma has increased
      dramatically. Studying what causes and triggers asthma is an important part of understanding
      and subsequently managing this disease. Although some have suggested that alcohol consumption
      may affect asthma, little is known about how consistent alcohol use affects the amount of
      inflammation present in the lungs and whether consistent alcohol use makes the airways more
      narrow and stiff.

      Participation in this study involves 2 visits in order to complete questionnaires, various
      pulmonary function tests, as well as the collection of blood, urine, and exhaled breath
      condensate specimens.

      This study includes optional genetic and bronchoscopy substudies.
