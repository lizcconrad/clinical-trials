      Physical therapy for hipertensive elderly: effects in the physical activity and exercise
      adherence.

      Introduction: The arterial hypertension (AH) is a clinical syndrome characterized by blood
      pressure ≥ 140/90mmHg. Practical of physical activity (PA) and/or physical exercise (PE) is
      one of the modalities of not farmacological treatment. Hypertensive aged not adhere to this
      recommendation for presenting factors that make it difficult this practical. Objective: to
      verify if physical therapy (PT) treatment can improve the AF and EF adhesion of hypertensive
      aged. Methods: The sample was composed by 43 hypertensive aged of Arterial Hypertensive
      League of the Federal University of Goiás. Of these, 30 had remained in the study and had
      been randomized in study group (SG) (16 patients) and control group (CG) (14 patients). SG
      was submitted of the PT treatment and participated of educative meetings, the CG only
      participated of the meetings. To evaluate adhesion to the AF was used the pedometer and EF
      was used a questionnaire of open and closed questions, six minute walk test (6`WT) and
      ergometric test (ET).
