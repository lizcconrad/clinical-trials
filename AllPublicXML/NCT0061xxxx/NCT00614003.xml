    <textblock>
      Most dying cancer patients would prefer a home death yet die in an institution. Patients can
      experience uncertainty when weighing practical considerations, concern for others, and their
      personal ratings about the desirability and undesirability of various outcomes related to
      different locations of care. Health professionals, trained in decision support, can help
      patients to make decisions that are informed by both relevant information and what outcomes
      are most valued by patients. Therefore, I will study if an educational intervention can help
      nurses and case managers to strengthen their skills and confidence in providing patient
      decision support around place of end of life care.

      Project Description:

      Using a two step approach I will study if the quality of providers decision support can be
      improved with an education. In step one nurses and care coordinators will be interviewed to
      identify factors that make it easier or more difficult to provide patient decision support.
      This information will be used to develop an education program. In step two, nurses and care
      coordinator volunteers will be assigned by a flip of a coin to either receive the decision
      support education or not. Before and after the education program the quality of the decision
      support participants provide will be measured and compared. As well, participants receiving
      the education program will be asked about their satisfaction with the education program.

      Most terminal cancer patients prefer home palliation yet die in an institution. Some
      experience decisional conflict when weighing options regarding place of care. Community Case
      Managers and Nurses are well positioned to identify decisional needs and provide decision
      support; however, they generally lack skills and confidence in doing so. This study aims to
      determine whether the quality of case managers' and nurses' decision support can be improved
      with a theory-based skills-building intervention.

      In phase one a needs assessment will be conducted with about 20 key informants. In phase two,
      nurses will be randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. The intervention,
      informed by the needs assessment, is comprised of: an auto-tutorial; an interactive skills
      building workshop; a decision support protocol; performance feedback, and educational
      outreach.

      Participants will be assessed: a) at baseline (quality of decision support); b) after the
      auto-tutorial (knowledge); and six to eight weeks after the other interventions (quality of
      decision support; confidence and intention to integrate decision support into practice).
      Between group differences in the primary outcome (quality of decision support scores) will be
      analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA.
