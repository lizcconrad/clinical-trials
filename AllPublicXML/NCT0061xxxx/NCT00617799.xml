      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers that predict response to high-dose
      aldesleukin in patients with metastatic kidney cancer or metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the relationship of peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotype pattern in patients
           with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma to response to high-dose
           aldesleukin (IL-2).

        -  Determine the relationship of peripheral blood mononuclear cells gene microarray
           patterns in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma to
           response to high-dose IL-2.

        -  Determine the frequency of mutations on genes encoding for IL-2 receptor A and B.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) as part of standard treatment on days
      1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline, prior to beginning course 2, and 4 weeks after
      the completion of course 2. Samples are analyzed using peripheral blood cytometry, gene
      microarray analysis, and IL-2 receptor single-nucleotide polymorphism techniques.
