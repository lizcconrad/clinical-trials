  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group study
      that compares Alprostadil given in a low, fixed-dose continuous infusion and placebo. The
      difference between the two groups for the primary endpoints will be compared after 24 weeks
      (Outpatient Double-Blind Treatment Phase). Thereafter, patients will continue on blinded
      treatment and observation to all continued assessment of survival and cardiac-specific
      mortality (Follow-Up Phase). It is planned that approximately 550 patients with advanced
      heart failure be randomized (see Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the Screening Phase, informed consent will be obtained and information to establish
      eligibility for transplant and all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed.
      The screening activities may be performed on an outpatient basis in stable patients or as an
      inpatient in unstable patients who are already hospitalized.

      Throughout the study, patients will be maintained medically in accordance with the national
      Guidelines for heart failure, which are mostly based on the European Guidelines for Heart
      Failure (2005) and the American Guidelines for Heart Failure, The primary assessment of
      efficacy is based on the number of days that the patient is hospitalized or is deceased
      during the 24 weeks following the day of randomization, As elective transplantation is biased
      by donor availability, observation period in those cases will be counted until ELECTIVE heart
      transplantation. Additional surrogate measures of efficacy will include monthly assessments
      of Nt-proBNP, patient assessment of dyspnoea, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
      Questionnaire, NYHA classification, and use of beta1-blocker therapy.

      Study Population It is planned that a sufficient number of patients will be screened to
      enroll 500 patients (250 patients per treatment group). Compliance with the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria outlined below must be established prior to randomization to double-blind
      therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of either gender and of any race/ethnicity who are between 18 and 70 years of
             age inclusive

          2. Patients in advanced cardiac heart failure in New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             functional class IIIb or IV

          3. Eligible for heart transplant according to the ISHLT guidelines ; it is not necessary
             that the patient already be listed at time of screening

          4. Patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] &gt; 50
             mmHg on echocardiography or pulmonary resistance on right heart catheterization), who
             are usually excluded from transplantation under conventional conditions, are eligible
