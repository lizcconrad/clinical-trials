      This study is double blind (neither you nor the physician will know if you are receiving
      active study drug or placebo, an inactive compound such as a sugar pill) and it is being
      conducted at various research centers in the United States.

      If the study staff determines that you are eligible and you decide to participate, there will
      be approximately 11 study visits in about 3 months. During these visits, you will undergo
      routine health exams and complete different kinds of questionnaires.

      This study requires that you wear a blood pressure cuff continuously for 24 hours on three
      separate occasions. You will also be required to make multiple same-day visits to the study
      site on three separate occasions for blood draws.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible to participate in the study, patients must meet the following criteria:

               1. Patients may be male or female between the ages of 18 and 70 years, inclusive

               2. Patients must have been diagnosed of primary fibromyalgia, as defined by the 1990
                  ACR Criteria for the Classification of Fibromyalgia

               3. Females must be either postmenopausal (no menses for at least 1 year),
                  posthysterectomy, postoophorectomy (bilateral), or, if of childbearing potential,
                  must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to randomization and be using a
                  medically acceptable form of contraception (eg, hormonal birth control, IUD,
                  double-barrier method [eg, simultaneous use of two of the following: male condom,
                  female condom, diaphragm], or a barrier method plus a spermicidal agent
                  [contraceptive foam, jelly, or cream])

               4. Patients must have the ability to give written informed consent

               5. Patients may have hypertension untreated or treated with a maximum of two
                  antihypertensive medications. (Note: medications contributing to a combination
                  product(s) will each be considered as a separate medication.) If untreated, the
                  patient should be stable, with no expectation of initiating treatment during the
                  study. If treated, the patient must have been on stable doses of antihypertensive
                  medications for at least 2 months, with the expectation that dose adjustments
                  will not be necessary for the duration of the study. A patient will be classified
                  as hypertensive if the patient is taking antihypertensive medication, has a SBP
                  equal to or greater than 130 mm Hg, or has a DBP equal to or greater than 85 mm
                  Hg. A patient will be classified as normotensive if he/she is not on
                  antihypertensive medication and has a SBP less than 130 mm Hg and DBP less than
                  85 mm Hg

               6. Patients must have a mean of two sitting SBP measurements of less than 160 mm Hg
                  and sitting DBP less than 100 mm Hg at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2
                  (Baseline/Randomization) using an automatic office blood pressure monitor

               7. Patients must have normal physical examination findings, clinical laboratory
                  results, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results from Visit 1 (Screening) or abnormal
                  findings judged not clinically significant by the Investigator and documented as
                  such in the eCRF

               8. Patients must be willing to withdraw from CNS-active therapies marketed as
                  antidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics,
                  tetracyclics, selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), noradrenaline
                  reuptake inhibitors (NARIs), noradrenaline-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (NSRI),
                  serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and St. John's Wort

               9. Patients must be willing to withdraw from pregabalin (Lyrica) or gabapentin
                  (Neurontin).

              10. Patients must be willing to withdraw from stimulant medications such as those
                  used to treat attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
                  (eg, amphetamine/dextroamphetamine [Adderall], methylphenidate,
                  dextroamphetamine) or the fatigue associated with sleep apnea or shift work (eg,
                  modafinil)

              11. Patients must be willing to withdraw from anorectic agents such as diethylpropion
                  , sibutramine (Meridia), and phentermine (Adipex)

              12. Patients must be willing to withhold certain medications for the 24 hours before,
                  as well as during, any ABPM assessment. These medications include
                  phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, Viagra, Levitra, Cialis, Edex, Muse),
                  decongestants (eg, pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine), and antimigraine therapies
                  (eg, triptans such as Imitrex and Maxalt, ergotamines such as Cafergot and
                  Midrin). If, for any reason, the patient takes any of these medications, the ABPM
                  visit should be rescheduled so that at least 24 hours have transpired since the
                  patient's last use

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in

                  judgment or based on an answer of 2 or 3 for question 9 of the Beck Depression
                  Inventory (BDI) (regarding suicidal ideation) performed at Visit 1 (Screening) or
                  Visit 2 (Baseline/Randomization)

                  (including patients with a prosthetic heart valve); hypertensive cardiovascular
                  disease changes (heart, eyes or kidneys) that in the Investigator's judgment,
                  would preclude patient participation; ischemic changes; and/or clinically

              12. Patients with pulmonary dysfunction or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
                  disease that, in the Investigator's judgment, could interfere with study
                  participation and completion

              13. Patients with unstable endocrine disease, including unstable diabetes or thyroid
                  disease. Disorders that have been stable for the preceding 3 months will be

              16. Any other conditions (such as epilepsy) that, in the Investigator's judgment,
                  would indicate that the patient is unsuitable for the study (eg, might interfere
                  with study conduct, confound the interpretation of study results, endanger the
                  patient)

          -  Treatment-Related Criteria

                  milnacipran studies (ie, all respective protocol-related study procedures have
                  been completed by the patient) are eligible to participate. Any patients who
                  failed screening in previous milnacipran studies may be re-evaluated, and

                  not eligible to participate

               2. Patients who are receiving concomitant therapy with digitalis (digoxin)
                  preparations. (Note: Patients should not undergo washout of digoxin; therefore,
