  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a home-based exercise rehabilitation
      program compared to a supervised exercise program on intermittent claudication (leg pain or
      discomfort) and ambulatory function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to 1) compare the changes in ambulatory function, vascular function, and
      health-related quality of life in patients limited by intermittent claudication following a
      home-based exercise rehabilitation program, a supervised exercise program, and a light
      resistance training exercise program; and 2) determine whether changes in walking efficiency,
      calf muscle circulation, and calf muscle oxygen are the reasons by which both home-based and
      supervised exercise rehabilitation improve ambulatory function.

      We hypothesize that a home-based exercise program utilizing new physical activity monitoring
      technology that can accurately quantify exercise adherence as well as the intensity,
      duration, and volume of exercise sessions will result in similar changes in ambulatory
      function, vascular function, and health-related quality of life compared to a standard,
      supervised exercise program. Further, both the home-based and supervised exercise
      rehabilitation programs will result in greater changes in ambulatory function, vascular
      function, and health-related quality of life than a light resistance training exercise
      program. Finally, we hypothesize that the changes in walking efficiency, calf muscle
      circulation, and calf muscle oxygen will each be predictive of improved ambulation following
      the home-based exercise program as well as the supervised exercise program.

      The 3-month program will consist of walking 3 times per week, with progressive increases in
      duration and intensity. The two walking exercise programs will be matched on the estimated
      caloric expenditure during the training sessions. Patients in the control group will perform
      light resistance training without any walking exercise.
