      The RITMO (Registro Italiano sul trattamento del Tronco coMune non protettO) observational
      study will be a prospective, multicenter, observational study aiming to appraise the
      prevalence, management strategy, and prognosis (up to 5 years) of unprotected left main
      coronary artery disease in Italy. A total of 45 Italian secondary and tertiary care centers
      will participate, and enroll patients during a period of 12 to 18 months. Patients will be
      included provided that they complete a written informed consent form and significant
      unprotected left main coronary artery disease is established at diagnostic coronary
      angiography. The primary end-point will be the 12-month rate of major adverse
      cerebro-cardiovascular events (ie death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary
      revascularization).
