      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well everolimus works in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
           treated with everolimus.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of everolimus in patients with multiple myeloma.

        -  To study the tumor cells and blood from patients entering this trial for laboratory
           correlates.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate, biopsy, and blood sample collections periodically.
      Samples are assessed for the following: cyclin D1, phospho-AKT, phospho-p70 S6 kinase, and
      phospho-S6 by western blot; checkpoint regulators PTEN, p53, pRB, and p27 by immunoblotting;
      p53, Rb, p16, PTEN, p27, and cyclin D1 by DNA analysis; caspases 3 and 9 by immunoblotting
      and Annexin/PI by flow cytometry; unknown molecular markers by protein profiling; and
      microvessel density.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2
      years.
