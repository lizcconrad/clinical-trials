      Evaluation of efficacy of alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) for treatment of patients suffering

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results of the planned interim analysis indicated that the number of originally planned
      patients were not sufficient to reach statistical significance in the primary end point.
      Instead of increasing the sample size accordingly, it was decided to terminate the study and
      plan future proceedings based on a careful analysis of the unblinded results.

    <measure>Difference in Visual Acuity Between Measurements at 3 Months After Drug Intervention and Measurements at Baseline (Assessed Within Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Chart)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in visual acuity was measured with the standard ETDRS chart with letters arranged in lines of five. The first line is assumed to have letters of a specific size and each subsequent line to consist of letters of a smaller size. The subject starts reading the first line and continues reading the following lines until failing a line. Passing a line means to name at least three of the five letters correctly.</description>

Progression

    <measure>Development of a Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is defined as the development of choroidal neovascularization of the &quot;study-eye&quot; (worse eye).
Development is categorized in Yes and No, where Yes means that a subject who had no wet AMD at Screening has developed a wet AMD at Week 29.</description>

    <measure>The Difference in Contrast Sensitivity Between Measurements Immediately After Intervention and Measurements at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to time immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in contrast sensitivity was measured with the Pelli-Robson test, using a chart with letters arranged in groups of three. The first group has unit contrast and each subsequent group has a lower contrast. Passing a group means to read correctly at least two of the three letters. A Pelli-Robson score of 2.0 indicates normal contrast sensitivity of 100 percent. Scores less than 2.0 signify poorer contrast sensitivity. Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity score of less than 1.5 is consistent with visual impairment and a score of less than 1.0 represents visual disability.</description>

        <title>Difference in Visual Acuity Between Measurements at 3 Months After Drug Intervention and Measurements at Baseline (Assessed Within Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Chart)</title>
        <description>Difference in visual acuity was measured with the standard ETDRS chart with letters arranged in lines of five. The first line is assumed to have letters of a specific size and each subsequent line to consist of letters of a smaller size. The subject starts reading the first line and continues reading the following lines until failing a line. Passing a line means to name at least three of the five letters correctly.</description>

        <title>The Difference in Contrast Sensitivity Between Measurements Immediately After Intervention and Measurements at Baseline</title>
        <description>Difference in contrast sensitivity was measured with the Pelli-Robson test, using a chart with letters arranged in groups of three. The first group has unit contrast and each subsequent group has a lower contrast. Passing a group means to read correctly at least two of the three letters. A Pelli-Robson score of 2.0 indicates normal contrast sensitivity of 100 percent. Scores less than 2.0 signify poorer contrast sensitivity. Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity score of less than 1.5 is consistent with visual impairment and a score of less than 1.0 represents visual disability.</description>
