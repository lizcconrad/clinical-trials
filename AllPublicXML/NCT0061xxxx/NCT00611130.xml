      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that a larger proportion of vigabatrin-treated
      subjects than placebo-treated subjects will be cocaine-free in the last 2 weeks of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine addiction, a serious public health concern associated with significant medical,
      social, and economic consequences, is difficult to treat using traditional psychosocial and
      behavioral therapies. Despite testing of a number of different agents for cocaine dependency,
      there remains no proven pharmacologic treatment for cocaine addiction.

      The addictive properties of cocaine have been associated with its actions on
      mesotelencephalic dopamine reward pathways in the central nervous system (CNS). Cocaine
      administration increases the levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with
      sensations of pleasure and reward. Therefore, blocking cocaine-induced increases in dopamine
      levels represents a valid pharmaceutical approach to the treatment of cocaine addiction.

      Another neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), suppresses striatal dopamine
      release, and attenuates cocaine-induced increases in extracellular and synaptic dopamine
      levels in the striatum and nucleus accumbens in animal models of drug dependence. Significant
      elevation of brain GABA levels may reduce cocaine-stimulated dopamine release and dampen the
      sensations of pleasure and reward. Thus, drugs that potentiate or enhance GABA-ergic
      transmission are candidates for the treatment of cocaine addiction.

          -  Male or female at least 18 years of age.

          -  Meets DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition)
             criteria for cocaine dependence as primary diagnosis, as determined by the Substance
             Abuse module of SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV).

          -  Provide at least one urine sample that is positive for cocaine according to a rapid
             screening test.

          -  Seeking treatment for cocaine dependence.

          -  Have normal visual fields.

          -  Be in generally good health based on history, physical examination, electrocardiogram
             and laboratory findings.

          -  If female of childbearing potential, use acceptable contraceptive methods. (oral
             contraceptives (the pill), IUDs, contraceptive implants under the skin, contraceptive
             rings or patches or injections, diaphragms with spermicide, and condoms with
             spermicide). Surgical sterilization by tubal ligation or hysterectomy is acceptable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has current dependence, as determined by the SCID, on any psychoactive substance other
             than cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, or marijuana or physiologic dependence on alcohol
             requiring medical detoxification.

          -  Has any serious medical or psychiatric illness and/or clinically significant abnormal
             laboratory value, which in the judgment of the Principal Investigator or his/her
             designee would make study participation unsafe, or would make treatment compliance
             difficult or put the study staff at undue risk.

          -  Be under court mandate to obtain treatment.

          -  Be enrolled in an opiate substitution treatment program within 2 months of
             randomization.

          -  Has ever taken vigabatrin in the past.

          -  Is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Has clinically significant ophthalmologic disease, which would preclude safety
             monitoring or is undergoing treatment for ocular disease.

          -  Has received a drug with known major organ toxicity, including retinotoxicity within
             30 days of randomization.

          -  Is currently participating in, or has been enrolled in another clinical trial within
             the last 30 days.

          -  Be anyone who, in the judgment of the investigator, would not be expected to attend
             regular study visits or to complete the study protocol, due to imminent relocation
             from the clinic area, legal difficulties, work-related problems, transportation, etc.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Lack of subject medication compliance, site-to-site variability in medication compliance possibly indicative of differing site capabilities to attract subjects sufficiently motivated to stop using cocaine.</limitations_and_caveats>
