  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who are obese
      and in the number of people who have asthma. Both are considered serious public health
      concerns. Several studies have shown that becoming obese or overweight can increase the risk
      of developing asthma or can make asthma symptoms more severe and difficult to control. How
      obesity affects asthma is not fully understood. This research study will examine whether
      obesity affects the amount of inflammation that is present in the lungs of people with
      asthma, and will also examine whether obesity leads to narrow and stiff airways.

      Participation in this study involves 2 visits in order to complete questionnaires, various
      pulmonary function tests, as well as the collection of blood, urine, and exhaled breath
      condensate specimens.

      This research study includes optional genetic and bronchoscopy substudies.
