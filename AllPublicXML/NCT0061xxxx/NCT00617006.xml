  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that by improving hand hygiene compliance in the operative environment, we
      would reduce horizontal transmission of pathogenic bacteria to surgical patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed an observational study evaluating provider adherence to these techniques. We
      then sought to increase hand hygiene compliance through the use of a point of care alcohol
      based hand hygiene device. We hypothesized that increased hand hygiene compliance would
      reduce bacterial contamination of the anesthesia workspace and peripheral intravenous tubing,
      and ultimately reducing overall morbidity and mortality secondary to a reduction in
      nosocomial infection rates.
