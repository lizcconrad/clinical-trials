      The purpose of this study is to use Sorafenib + 5-FU to evaluate activity, efficacy, safety,
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous chemotherapeutic regimens have been tested for use against hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). HCC is, however, highly resistant to chemotherapy; doxorubicin and 5- fluorouracil
      containing regimens, alone or in combinations, results in less than a 20% response, with a
      median survival of less than 4 months. Furthermore even the objective responses are
      short-lasting. In a metaanalysis of the published randomized studies on HCC, neither
      doxorubicin nor any chemotherapeutic agent has been shown to have any survival benefit for
      HCC patients.

      Sorafenib (Bay 43-9006) is a novel signal transduction inhibitor that prevent tumor cell
      proliferation and angiogenesis through blockade of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway at the level of
      Raf Kinase and the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-beta.

      Recent preclinical studies have shown the activation of Mek-1/2 and its downstream target
      MAPK in HCC tumors. In a phase II study 137 patients advanced primary liver cancer with have
      been treated with Sorafenib administered as a single agent. Investigators reported seven
      patients with partial responses, five minor responses and 59 with stable disease for at least
      4 months. Median overall survival was 9.2 months and median time to progression 4.2 months.
      This study showed that Sorafenib was well tolerated and side-effects were manageable and
      reversible.

      Rationale

      5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a widely used agent for patients with unresectable advanced HCC,
      with objective responses rates around 10%. Compared to bolus administration, infusional 5-FU
      in metastatic colorectal cancers has demonstrated increased activity with less toxicity.

      Sorafenib as single agent in HCC has demonstrated activity in terms of objective responses
      and promising duration of stable disease.

      The combination of Sorafenib and 5-FU was evaluated in a phase I study where the drug is
      associated with different 5FU based schedules with good toxicity profile and objectives
      responses in particular in colorectal carcinoma.

      Based on these data our purpose is to study infusional 5-FU with Sorafenib to evaluate the
      activity, efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this combination.

      Study design and duration of treatment

      5-FU 3000 mg/sqm 48 hours continuous infusion every 14 days Sorafenib 400 mg bid orally
      continuously 5-FU will be administered for a maximum of 12 cycles. Sorafenib will be
      administered from the start of treatment in combination with 5-FU until progression of
      disease.

             intent, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy , vaccines or hormonal therapy given
             before study entry or during study treatment. Anticancer therapy is defined as any
             agent or combination of agents with clinically proven anticancer activity administered
             systemically, with the purpose of affecting the cancer, either directly or indirectly,
             including palliative and therapeutic endpoints. In certain cases, local anticancer
             therapy is allowed. See Inclusion Criteria for details.

          -  Any surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to start of study drug.

          -  Autologous bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue within 4 months of study entry.

          -  Use of biologic response modifiers, such as G-CSF, within 3 weeks of study entry.
             G-CSF and other hematopoietic growth factors may be used in the management of acute
             toxicity, such as febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated, or at the discretion
             of the investigator; however, they may not be substituted for a required dose
             reduction. Chronic Erythropoietin treatment prior to the study entry or during the
             study is permitted.

          -  Use of ritonavir and grapefruit juice.

          -  Prior use of Raf-Kinase inhibitors, MEK or Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitors. Any
             investigational drug therapy outside of this trial during or within 4 weeks of study
             entry.

        Other Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test performed within 7 days of the start of treatment. Both men
             and women enrolled in this trial must use adequate barrier birth control measures
             (e.g. cervical cap, condom, diaphragm) during the course of the trial. Oral birth
             control methods alone will not be considered adequate on this study, because of the
             potential pharmacokinetic interaction between SORAFENIB and oral contraceptives.

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, is likely to interfere with the patient's participation in the study
             or evaluation of the study results.

          -  Known allergy to the investigational agent or any agent given in association with this
             trial.

          -  Any condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the patient and its
             compliance in the study, in the investigator's judgment.
