  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to compare two NN5401 (Soluble
      Insulin Analogue Combination [SIAC], insulin degludec/insulin aspart) formulations with each
      other and with biphasic insulin aspart 30, all in combination with metformin in insulin naive
      subjects with type 2 diabetes.

    <description>Physical examination was performed at screening (week -4), and after 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. If any new findings or deterioration in previous findings were observed during the trial, these were recorded as AEs and are therefore not presented separately as no analysis was performed.</description>

             (no previous insulin treatment or previous short term insulin treatment maximum 14
             days within the last 3 months)

          -  Treatment with one or two oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs): metformin, sulfonylurea,
             other insulin secretagogue (e.g. repaglinide, nateglinide), alpha-glucosidase
             inhibitors for at least 2 months at a stable maximally tolerated dose or at least half
             maximally allowed dose according to locally approved summary of product
             characteristics (SPC)

          -  HbA1c, 7.0-11.0 % (both inclusive)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI), 25.0-37.0 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metformin contraindication according to local practice

          -  Thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment within previous 3 months prior to Visit 1

          -  Any systemic treatment with products, which in the investigator's opinion could
             interfere with glucose or lipid metabolism (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) within 3
             months prior to randomisation

          -  Subject has a clinically significant, active (during the past 12 months) disease of
             the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, neurological, genitourinary, or haematological system
             (except for conditions associated with type 2 diabetes) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may confound the results of the trial or pose additional risk in
             administering trial product

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects underwent a run-in period of up to 3 weeks (including 1-week maintenance period) where metformin was up-titrated to 1500 or 2000 mg/day.
