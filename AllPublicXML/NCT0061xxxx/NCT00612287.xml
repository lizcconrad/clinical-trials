      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test clinical guidelines for the use of
      buprenorphine for the treatment chronic pain among patients with substance abuse histories.
      Buprenorphine, an opioid medication, holds promise as a treatment of chronic pain because,
      compared to most other opioid analgesics, it has a high safety profile, a low level of
      physical dependence, and mild withdrawal symptoms on cessation. Moreover there are promising
      reports from Europe of its use as a skin patch to treat chronic pain as well as clinical
      reports in the U.S. that it may be effective when used sublingually (placed under the
      tongue). This study will test the sublingual formulation.

    <description>Sublingual buprenorphine; product name Suboxone® (buprenorphine/naloxone). Dosing is informed by a clinical guideline which permits flexibility dependent up physician's clinical judgment. During the induction period (Day 1, at the physician's office) the first dose is 2 mg and can be brought up to 20 mg depending on patient's response. On Day 2 going forward dose can range from 2 mg q8h to 12 mg q8h. Rescue doses with buprenorphine are also permitted.</description>
