    <textblock>
      The investigators' project has as for principal objective to understand the impact of trans
      fatty acids from dairy products and industrial origin on the development of insulin
      resistance in obese woman. Because of the different isomeric position of the double bound
      those trans fatty acids may have different metabolic effects.

      Women will be included in the study according to their susceptibility to develop a insulin
      resistance (evaluated starting from the body index of mass IMC superior to 28 kg.m-², of the
      waist measurement 88 cm). Once included in the study, the volunteers will receive for 4 weeks
      butter, dairy products and biscuits enriched in stearic, elaidic or vaccenic acid. The
      volunteers will undergo a measurement of the body composition by biphotonic absorptiometry as
      well as a complete metabolic assessment (blood and urinary samples, clamp to insulin and
      biopsies).
