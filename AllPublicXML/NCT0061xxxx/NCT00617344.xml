  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow up study using three different formulations for each serotype with the aim
      of testing immunogenicity and reactogenicity

      Primary Objective:

      Immunogenicity: To evaluate immunogenicity by neutralizing antibody response post dose 2.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Safety: To evaluate safety following three formulations of ChimeriVax™ Tetravalent Dengue
      Vaccine.

      Immunogenicity: To describe the neutralizing antibody responses after each dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, double-blind, randomized, descriptive, multicenter study in US adult
      subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive a total of three doses of ChimeriVax™
      Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine from one particular formulation.

          -  Previous residence in, travel or planned travel of more than 2 weeks during the study
             period to areas with high dengue infection endemicity. (Please refer to Appendix 5 of
             the protocol.)

          -  Reported history of flavivirus infection as reported by the subject.
