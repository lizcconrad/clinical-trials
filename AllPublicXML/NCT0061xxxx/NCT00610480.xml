  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of Systane® versus
      Optive™ and Soothe™ on aqueous tear film stability in patients with a diagnosis of Dry Eye
      Syndrome and to determine the possible application for this product in the future. Systane®
      is marketed as over-the-counter tear lubricating therapy in the United States under the FDA
      monograph.

      Twenty (20) patients will be enrolled in this three -period crossover, randomized study
      design. During the course of the study, each patient will be treated with each test articles
      in the clinic at separate visits. Following the informed consent procedure, a general ocular
      evaluation, including corneal and conjunctival staining, Schirmer testing, and evaporometry
      assessments will be completed to determine baseline tear evaporation rate. This will occur
      before any test article is administered to the patient.

      Qualified patients will be randomized into three treatment groups. After 1 hour, in order to
      eliminate any residual sodium fluorescein, patients will be administered one drop of Systane®
      (40 µl), Optive™ (40 µl), or and Soothe™ (40 µl) in each eye per randomization assignment. At
      30 and 60 minutes following instillation of drop, evaporometry measurement will be repeated
      again. These tests (pre and post instillation of drops) will be performed in order to
      establish a comparison for later analysis. The estimated time in completing these visits will
      be 180 minutes per visit. Patients will be asked to return to the clinic after 2 - 14 days
      for evaluation of the 2nd and 3rd assigned treatment.

      During the interim study periods, patients will be asked to continue their pre-study routine;
      using their pre-study ocular lubricant or other tear products at the same frequency. Any
      changes in the frequency of product use during the interim period or any changes in other
      concomitant medications will be carefully recorded. This is especially important since many
      prescription products (e.g., Claritan) have significant effects on lacrimal gland physiology.

      An effort will be made to schedule all study visits at approximately the same time of day in
      order to reduce diurnal variability. For the similar reasons, all patients will be asked not
      to use any lubricants or ocular medications prior to one hour of their office visits.
