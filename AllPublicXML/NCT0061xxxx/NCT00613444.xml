      The purpose of this research project is to study the effect of non-ablative (non-cutting)
      laser therapy, a technique that uses laser energy to try to improve the appearance of the
      skin. This type of laser treatment creates changes in a layer of the skin called the dermis
      without causing an open wound in the skin. The use of non-ablative laser therapy, together
      with application of a photo-sensitizer (substance that makes the skin more sensitive to
      light), may improve the appearance of acne. The idea behind the photo-sensitizer is that it
      is supposed to make the laser more effective than using just the laser alone. It is not yet
      clear how much improvement can be seen with these treatments or exactly how the skin's
      response causes these improvements. In this study, we are interested in learning how well
      such a laser works to improve the symptoms of acne, as well as how much the photo-sensitizer
      actually enhances the efficacy of the laser.

      The photo-sensitizing agent (Levulan Kerastick) and the non-ablative laser (LumaCare LC-122M
      non-coherent (multiple wavelengths) light source from LumaCareÂ® Medical Products) are both
      FDA-approved. The Levulan Kerastick is approved for the treatment of another skin disease,
      not acne.

      Background

      Acne vulgaris remains among the most common cutaneous disorders, impacting the vast majority
      of people at some point during their lives. It is associated with significant psychosocial
      morbidity, and there remains the need for efficacious and low risk therapeutic options.

      The FDA has approved various lasers and light sources for the treatment of acne. However, few
      randomized, controlled clinical trials have been performed of these devices. In addition, the
      use of topical photosensitizers preceding laser or light-therapy for acne has also been
      examined in a preliminary way with some initial evidence of efficacy. However, these trials
      have been small with modest numbers of subjects, many focus on back acne, and treatment
      protocols vary widely and are often poorly controlled. Photodynamic therapy for facial acne
      is being performed by physicians across the country but little objective data regarding this
      practice is available.

      We have recently conducted a trial of a 1 hour application of a common photosensitizer
      approved by the FDA for acne phototherapy (Levulan, DUSA pharmaceutical) using a pulsed dye
      laser therapy (V-Beam laser, Candela Corp., Wayland, MA, 595 nm wavelength) as the activating
      light source (IRB protocol 2005-0117). Interim results from our study indicate this therapy
      is effective in a minority of patients. Accumulating published reports data suggests the
      limited effectiveness of this protocol may be due to inadequate skin penetration of the
      photosensitizing agent and due to the need for an activating light source with a longer
      wavelength of light to allow deeper penetration into the skin. We wish to incorporate these
      findings to design a protocol that should be more effective for treatment of facial acne.

      Objectives

      We propose to evaluate the efficacy and confirm the safety of an FDA-approved non-coherent
      light source (LumaCare LC-122M non-coherent light source with LUM-I, fiber optic probe, 610
      nm-660 nm output range, LumaCare Medical Products, Newport Beach, Ca) used in conjunction
      with a topical photosensitizer (Levulan, DUSA pharmaceutical) in the treatment of acne
      vulgaris. Because one proposed mechanism of action for such treatments includes altered
      sebaceous gland activity, we also seek to examine the effects of this treatment on cutaneous
      sebum production.

    <description>Split Face Comparison. One half of subject's face will receive topical photosensitizer applications followed by LumaCare LC-122M non-coherent light source illumination. Subjects will receive a series of up to 6 treatment sessions with a treatment interval of from approximately 1 to 4 weeks. In all cases, light treatment parameters will be within the guidelines normally used clinically for red-light non-coherrent light sources, and thus fluences used will not exceed 75 J/cm2.
The other half of the face will not receive any treatment and will serve as internal control.</description>
