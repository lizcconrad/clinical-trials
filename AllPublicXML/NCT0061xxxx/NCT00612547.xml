      Primary objective

      To assess the feasibility, the acceptability and the effectiveness of the use of the
      Artesunate + Amodiaquine Fixed Dose Combination for the home management of presumed malaria
      in Malagasy children by the community-based service providers

      Secondary objectives

      To assess the reliability of the use of the malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) by the
      community-based service providers in the Malagasy home management strategy

      To assess the frequency of short-term and long-term side effects of the Artesunate +
      Amodiaquine Fixed Dose Combination used for the home management of presumed malaria in
      Malagasy children by the community-based service providers

      To assess the real burden of the malaria in children under the age of five years in 2
      different epidemiological strata of Madagascar (central highlands and equatorial strata)

      Type of study

      Follow-up of a cohort of 1200 children under the age of five years during 1 year

      Studied population

      All children under the age of five years (2 months to 5 years) having fever and consulting
      the community-based service provider, residing in the zone covered by the community-based
      service provider throughout the entire follow-up period Investigators Four community-based
      service providers, four field physicians and two supervisors number of district: 2 (Moramanga
      and Manakara)
