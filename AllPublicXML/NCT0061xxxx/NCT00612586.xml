      This study will evaluate the addition of enzastaurin to 5-FU(5-fluorouracil)/LV (leucovorin)
      plus bevacizumab in the maintenance of best response obtained with 6 cycles of first-line
      therapy consisting of FOLFOX (5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin) or FOLFIRI(5-FU/LV + irinotecan), plus
      bevacizumab in patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
