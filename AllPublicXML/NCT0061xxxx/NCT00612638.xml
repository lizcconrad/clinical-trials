      O6-benzylguanine To characterize any toxicity associated w combo of CPT-11 + Temodar plus
      O6-BG To observe pts for clinical antitumor response when treated w combo of CPT-11 + Temodar

      Objectives of study: to determine maximum tolerated dose of CPT-11 when administered
      following Temodar + O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG); to characterize any toxicity associated w combo
      of CPT-11 + Temodar + O6-BG; to observe pts for clinical antitumor response when treated w
      combo of CPT-11 + Temodar plus O6-BG. Pts have histologically confirmed diagnosis of
      recurrent primary malignant glioma. 2 separate strata accrued independently of each other:
      Stratum 1-pts receiving Dilantin, Tegretol/phenobarbital. Stratum 2-pts on anti-convulsants
      other than Dilantin, Tegretol/phenobarbital/pts not on any anti-convulsants. Each strata will
      be treated &amp; escalated independent of each other.

      Pre-chemo, O6-BG administered intravenously at 120 mg/m2, over 1hr, prior to administration
      of Temodar on day 1 of 21-day cycle. Post-chemo, O6-BG administered intravenously at 30
      mg/m2/day, over 48hrs, immediately after completion of the CPT-11 infusion on day 1 of 21-day
      cycle. Temodar administered orally at 355 mg/m2, in fasting state, within 60 minutes of the
      end of 1hr O6-BG infusion. Treatment cycles may be repeated every 3 weeks following dose of
      Temozolomide from previous cycle. CPT-11 will be administered intravenously in fasting state
      over 90min. CPT-11 infusion will begin 1hr after Temozolomide administration. Initial doses
      60 mg/m2 for stratum 1 &amp; 40 mg/m2 for stratum 2. Treatment cycles may be repeated every 3 wks
      following dose of CPT-11 from previous cycle.

      Major toxicities associated w CPT- 11 are myelosuppression &amp; diarrhea. Temozolomide has been
      well tolerated by both adults &amp; children w most common toxicity being mild myelosuppression.
      Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea &amp; vomiting, constipation, headache,
      alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain, diarrhea, lethargy, &amp;
      hepatotoxicity. Hypersensitivity reactions have not yet been noted w Temozolomide. As is case
      w many anti-cancer drugs, Temozolomide may be carcinogenic. O6-BG toxicities include
      transient lymphopenia has been seen w O6-BG as single agent. O6-BG in combo w other agents
      could cause exacerbation of any adverse event currently known to be caused by other agent,/
      combo may result in events never previously associated w either agent. Animal studies
      indicated that agitation, lethargy, convulsions, nausea, vomiting, rapid heart rate, elevated
      liver functions, leukopenia, lymphopenia could be seen.
