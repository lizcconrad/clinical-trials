  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single tablet regimen (STR) of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (tenofovir DF) is the first complete HAART that is offered as one tablet once a day. The
      individual components of this HAART regimen have demonstrated efficacy and safety in HIV
      treatment-naive patients and offer simplification that in turn may increase adherence and
      improve clinical outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness (efficacy, safety
      and tolerability) of a STR simplification strategy in patients on HAART who have achieved
      viral suppression in a real world clinical setting.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to evaluate pure virological response rates in
      antiretroviral-experienced HIV infected subjects initiating therapy with Atripla. Subjects
      will be switching to Atripla having already been established on the individual components of
      efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF.

      Within the Chelsea and Westminster hospital approximately 540 subjects have been identified
      who are currently receiving the individual components of Atripla and who would eventually
      switch to Atripla. The Royal Sussex County Hospital will be included to ensure that
      recruitment timelines are met.

      A minimum of 150 subjects will be switched within the first 6 months allowing initial 24 week
      data for these subjects to be available approximately 12 months post launch.

          -  Have a history of resistance to any of the study agents at the time of screening
             (documented presence of resistance mutation(s) as defined by the IAS-USA 2007

             asymptomatic grade 4 abnormalities will be permitted at the discretion of the
             investigator if deemed clinically appropriate (excluding AEs and laboratory parameters
             mentioned elsewhere in the inclusion/exclusion criteria). Abnormalities deemed

             product, with the exception of studies where the treatment studied has been stopped
             for more than 1 month.

          -  Evidence of alcohol and/or drug or substance abuse that in the judgment of the
             investigator would likely result in the patient being unreliable in fulfilling the
             conditions of the protocol.

          -  History of psychological illness or conditions that in the judgment of the
             investigator might interfere with the patient's ability to understand the requirements
             of the study.

          -  Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with
             the dosing requirements and cause the patient to be unable to complete the study
             protocol.
