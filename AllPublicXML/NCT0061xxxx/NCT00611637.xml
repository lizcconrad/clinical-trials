        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stratum 1: Subjects must be undergoing a non-myeloablative stem cell transplant from a
             6/6 matched, sibling donor for the treatment of a malignancy

          -  Stratum 2: Subjects must be undergoing a non-myeloablative stem cell transplant from a
             3/6, 4/6, or 5/6 matched, sibling donor for the treatment of a malignancy.

          -  Stratum 3: Subjects must be undergoing a myeloablative stem cell transplant from a
             3/6, 4/6, or 5/6 matched, sibling donor for the treatment of a malignancy.

          -  Donor must be CMV sero-positive.

          -  Karnofsky performance status â‰¥ 70%.

          -  Subject and donor must be one of the following HLA types: HLA A*0201, HLA-A*0101,
             HLA-A*2402, HLA-B*0702, HLA-B*0801, HLA-B*35, HLA-DR*1, or HLA-DR*4.

          -  Availability of the stem cell donor to provide multiple PBMC samples for T-cell
             culture if needed. These samples could be obtained via a 90cc peripheral blood draw or
             through leukapheresis. Stem cell donor must satisfy BMT Program criteria for
             undergoing leukapheresis to provide DLI and consent to provide repeat leukapheresis if
             this is necessary.

          -  Ability to understand and provide signed informed consent that fulfills Institutional
             Review Board guidelines.

          -  Ability to return to Duke University Medical Center for adequate follow-up as required
             by this protocol.

          -  In order to receive their T cell infusions, subjects should be:

          -  At least 2 weeks from the time of their allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          -  Without Grade 3 or 4, non-hematologic, major organ toxicity within the preceding 1
             week; all non major organ toxicities must have resolved to grade-2 or less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women and nursing mothers.

          -  Current or prior history of brain metastases.

          -  More than 12 months since their allogeneic stem cell re-infusion.

          -  HIV+, Hepatitis BsAg+, Hepatitis C Ab+
