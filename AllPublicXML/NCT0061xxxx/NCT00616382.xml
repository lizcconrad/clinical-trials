  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent postnatal ductal patency may have significant adverse hemodynamic effects,
      frequently necessitating therapeutic intervention in order to facilitate ductal closure.
      Medical therapy for patency of the ductus arteriosus is successful mediating ductal closure
      in approximately 70% of treated infants. In a recent study in our population, 17% of the
      babies showed no ductal response to the first course of treatment and 9.4% of our study
      infants eventually underwent surgical ligation of the ductus after failure of medical
      therapeutic closure.We propose to evaluate and compare two alternate therapeutic approaches
      to ductal closure in babies who do not respond to initial therapy.
