  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to demonstrate immunologic equivalence of three consecutive
      production lots of the subunit influenza vaccine compared to egg-derived inactivated
      influenza vaccine in healthy subjects 18 to 49 years of ages. In addition, this study is to
      show how safe and well tolerated a conventional inactivated subunit influenza vaccine,
      licensed in many countries outside the United States, is compared to an inactivated influenza
      vaccine, licensed in the United States.

    <time_frame>21 days after vaccination</time_frame>

the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion rate (prevaccination HI&lt;10/ postvaccination HI ≥40 or at least a fourfold increase in titer from non-negative prevaccination serum [HI≥10]), for HI antibody met or exceeded 40%.</description>
