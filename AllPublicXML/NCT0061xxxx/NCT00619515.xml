      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor
      and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This trial is studying the side effects of stereotactic radiation therapy and to see
      how well it works in treating patients with prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate in both low- and low-to-intermediate-risk groups of patients with prostate
           cancer, the rate of acute toxicities observed during the 5 years following CyberKnife®
           stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the rate of late grade 3-5 toxicities after SRS in these patients.

        -  To measure biochemical disease-free survival of patients treated with this therapy.

        -  To measure rates of local failure, distant failure, disease-free survival,
           disease-specific survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this therapy.

        -  To measure quality of life in generic and organ-specific domains in patients treated
           with this therapy.

        -  To evaluate imaging modalities and their potential role in the detection of prostate
           cancer persistence, recurrence, and/or progression in patients treated with this
           therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to risk group (low risk vs low/intermediate risk).

      Patients undergo fiducial placement using ultrasound. At least 5-10 days later, patients
      undergo CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery once daily for 5 days.

      Patients complete 4 questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study to assess acute
      and late toxicities and quality of life (e.g., overall health status, patient function,
      sexual function, and urinary symptoms).

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 5 years.

    <description>This study's primary goal is to determine the rate of acute grade 3-5 toxicities following CyberKnife treatment. Per RTOG/ECOG, acute toxicity will be defined as occurring within 90 days of completing treatment.</description>
