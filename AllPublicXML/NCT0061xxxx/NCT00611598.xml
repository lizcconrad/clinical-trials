  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us better understand the cellular changes that may lead
      to the development of lung cancer. We want to compare people with a second primary lung
      cancer with those who have only a first primary lung cancer. We hope to use the information
      obtained in this study as the basis for future studies and will not regard the results from
      this study as final.

      We will analyze your blood cells and DNA to measure the changes in several genes that we
      believe may be involved in lung cancer. We also want to evaluate the capacity for your DNA to
      repair itself.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases will be eligible for inclusion if:

          -  They have been diagnosed with a second primary lung cancer, and

          -  They speak English or a language for which we have a translated consent form, and

          -  They understand and agree to sign informed consent, and

          -  They agree to give us a blood sample, and

          -  They agree to give us a tissue sample when part of normal clinical procedures, and

          -  They agree to complete the study questionnaires, and

          -  They agree to have their pathology information reviewed. This could include biopsy
             specimens.

        Controls will be eligible for inclusion if

          -  They have been diagnosed with a first primary lung cancer, and

          -  They speak English or a language for which we have a translated consent form, and

          -  They understand and agree to sign informed consent, and

          -  They agree to give us a blood sample, and

          -  They agree to give us a tissue sample when part of normal clinical procedures, and

          -  They agree to complete the study questionnaires,

          -  They agree to have their pathology information reviewed. This will could include
             biopsy specimens.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who do not meet the inclusion criteria as either cases or controls will not
             be eligible for this study.

          -  Control subjects who have a history of another cancer, other than nonmelanoma skin
             cancer or a first primary lung cancer, will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Control subjects who otherwise meet the eligibility requirements above but who have
             had chemotherapy and/or are currently being treated with chemotherapy will be excluded
             from the functional assay, but not from the genotyping.
