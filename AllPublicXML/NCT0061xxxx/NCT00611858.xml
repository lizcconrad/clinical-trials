  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for rectal cancer is to receive the chemotherapeutic drug
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with radiation therapy before having surgery to remove the rectal
      cancer. This is known as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The purpose of this research study is
      to determine if Cetuximab improves the benefits of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy when given
      with 5-FU and radiation therapy. The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, which is found
      in rectal cancer, is a specific part of the cancer that is felt to encourage tumor growth.
      Cetuximab targets and blocks the EGF receptor and has been shown to be safe and effective in
      treating colorectal cancer and head and neck cancers.

      -  Prior to the first dose of cetuximab, participants will undergo a sigmoidoscopy with
           biopsy for research purposes as well collection of blood samples. These tests will be
           repeated between days 16 and 21.

        -  After treatment begins, participants will undergo the following every week; history and
           physical exam; vital signs; blood tests.

        -  On treatment weeks 1, 2 and 3: cetuximab is given once a week. On weeks 4 through 9:
           cetuximab is given weekly; continuous infusion of 5-FU will begin on day 22; treatment
           with radiation therapy Monday through Friday.

        -  It is recommended that the participant undergo surgery 4 to 8 weeks after completion of
           therapy to attempt to remove the tumor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum that begins within 15cm of the
             anal verge as determined by sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy, with no evidence of
             distant metastatic disease. A complete colonoscopy to the cecum is recommended prior
             to initiating protocol therapy.

          -  Staging with transrectal ultrasound or endorectal coil MRI to confirm clinical stage
             of T3 or T4 or lymph node positive rectal adenocarcinoma

          -  Tumor is K-ras wildtype by method of choice at respective institution (testing codons
             12 and 13)

          -  Performance status: ECOG less than or equal to 2
