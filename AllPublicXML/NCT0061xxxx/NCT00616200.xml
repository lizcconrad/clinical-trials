  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to prospectively determine the effect of a very low
      carbohydrate diet on quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D); and to determine possible
      physiological correlates of symptom improvement, as related to post-prandial
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release, weight loss and fiber content.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10-15% of individuals in the United States have symptoms consistent with
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) which is a costly disorder and negatively impacts patient
      quality of life. The pathogenesis of this heterogeneous disorder is still not well
      understood. Patients frequently identify worsening of symptoms after meals and often cite
      particular foods as triggers of their IBS symptoms. Unfortunately, there is insufficient
      randomized clinical trial data to allow for specific dietary recommendations. Previous
      research has suggested a role for carbohydrate ingestion in IBS. There is also evidence for
      the role of the post-prandial release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and its turnover (as
      represented by the ratio of its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), to 5-HT in
      response to a carbohydrate-rich meal, especially in those with IBS-D. As the prevalence of
      overweight (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 25 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) has risen in
      recent years, very low carbohydrate diets have become popular for those attempting to lose
      weight. Patients with IBS, especially IBS-D, anecdotally report improvement in their
      gastrointestinal symptoms after initiating a very low carbohydrate diet. However, no study
      has investigated the effect of a very low carbohydrate diet on symptoms and quality of life
      in patients with IBS-D.

    <time_frame>At the end of each of 6 study weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adequate relief was measured as the primary endpoint via a single item Adequate Relief Question asking &quot;Over the past week have you had adequate relief of your symptom experience&quot;. Higher scores represent greater levels of adequate relief over the week prior to the assessment. Participants completed this 1-item questionnaire at the end of each of weeks of the study, assessing whether they had adequate relief of their IBS symptoms for the week.
A responder was defined as reporting adequate relief in at least 2 of the 4 weeks on the VLCD.</description>
