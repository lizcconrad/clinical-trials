  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment single
      center safety and tolerability study. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of
      the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 4:1 fashion to receive either pafuramidine
      maleate 100 mg tablets or matching placebo tablets administered twice daily for 14 days.
