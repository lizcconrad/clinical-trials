  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an intense two-week long cognitive training program
      helps the thinking ability of adults with very mild Alzheimer Disease. We anticipate that
      scores on clinical cognitive tests will be better after the training.

      Twenty of the 30 subjects will be recruited to participate in functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI). Scanning will be done while subjects perform a verbal learning task. Ten
      subjects will be scanned before and after the two week training. Another ten will be scanned
      twice at a two week interval before beginning the cognitive training.
