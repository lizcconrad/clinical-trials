      Objectives:

      Primary - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the dose limiting
      toxicities (DLT) of combining lapatinib and temozolomideSecondary - Obtain preliminary
      information on the clinical anti-tumor activity of lapatinib plus temozolomide on brain
      metastases secondary to HER-2 positive breast cancer including Objective Response Rate (ORR),
      Clinical Benefit (CB) and Duration of Response (DR)

      Methodology:

      Phase I, single-centre, open-label, dose-escalation study of combining lapatinib and
      temozolomide in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with progressive brain metastases after
      surgery or radiotherapy or radiosurgery

      Treatment:

      Temozolomide will be given orally for 5 days of every 28 days, at doses of either
      100mg/m2/day or 150mg/m2/day or 200mg/m2/day AND Lapatinib will be given orally every day at
      either 1000mg/day or 1250mg/day or 1500mg/day.Sequential cohorts will be escalated in
      increments according to the dose escalation scheme, and determined by dose limiting
      toxicities.

           surgery (at least 3 weeks prior) or WBRT (at least 3 weeks prior) or stereotactic RT (at
           least 1 week prior); or otherwise deemed as unsuitable for standard treatment in the
           first instance

           study entry)

        -  At least one measurable lesion in the brain, defined as any lesion &gt;5mm in longest
           dimension on T1-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced MRI

        -  Expected life-expectancy of more than 3 months

        -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

        -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic functionsLVEF

        -  LVEF 50% measured by echocardiography or MUGA scan
