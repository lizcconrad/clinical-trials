  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, more and more people are having lung CT scans performed to screen for
      various cancers. Many of them have small abnormalities detected, called &quot;nodules&quot;, which -
      for a variety of reasons - doctors are unable to biopsy. As a result, many patients have
      their CT scans repeated on a regular basis to see if their nodules grow. This process can
      last several years.

      Many patients experience significant anxiety during this process, when they are aware of a
      spot in the lung, but are not told any specific cause.

      Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering have developed a new way to look at lung nodules in
      three dimensions. The purpose of this project is to see if any change in the nodules can be
      detected sooner by this method than by traditional CT scans.

Nodules are to be scanned at 2.5mm collimation / 1.25 mm reconstruction. This resolution is necessary for volume measurements of nodules less than 1cm in diameter.</description>
