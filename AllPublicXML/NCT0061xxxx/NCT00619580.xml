  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The information collected will optimize the management of patients with gram negative
      bacteremia. Approximately 300 patients with Gram negative bacteremia are cared for each year
      at UPMC-P. Published medical literature suggests that mortality from this infection exceeds
      20%. The aim of this research is to determine the risk factors for bacteriologic failure of
      antibiotic therapy, risk factors for antibiotic resistance in bloodstream isolates and risk
      factors for mortality from Gram negative bacteremia. Modifiable risk factors can then be
      tackled by a future interventional study.

      The information collected will optimize the management of patients with gram negative
      bacteremia. Approximately 300 patients with Gram negative bacteremia are cared for each year
      at UPMC-P. All sites are collecting the following information that was collected as part of
      the patient's clinical treatment. The following variables will be collected at all sites:
      time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases and severity of illness, recent
      immunomodulative therapies, physical exam findings, laboratory and radiographical data,
      antimicrobial usage within 14 days of onset of bacteremia, microbiological data and
      resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once organism identified, suspected source of
      bacteremia, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information,
      medications, clinical outcome,gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and past medical history
      (please see attached clinical data collection worksheet dated 4/2005). We will also collect
      information retrospectively for one year and prospectively for one year. The bacteria in the
      patient's blood cultures will be subcultured (after the diagnosis has been obtained since the
      microbiology lab would otherwise destroy the culture) and provided to the honest broker who
      will deidentify the specimen and link it to the medical information collected (which will
      also be deidentified by the honest broker). The following evaluation will be performed on
      these samples. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic used in treatment will
      be performed by the E-Test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). Specific mechanisms of
      antimicrobial resistance will be studied with emphasis on the presence of beta-lactamases
      produced by the bacteria. This evaluation will be performed by analytical isoelectric
      focusing techniques as well as PCR and gene sequencing analysis to determine genes encoding
      beta-lactamases. Biologic samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of
      this research project. All samples provided to the investigators are deidentified by the
      honest broker and will be coded with numbers. The information linking these code numbers to
      the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept in a separate, secure location that only
      the honest broker has access to. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. Samples will be kept in the investigator's laboratory located in Scaife Hall,
      room 812, 3500 Terrace Street. At no time with the research investigators have access to any
      patient identifers. Medical record information and bacteria samples from facilities outside
      of UPMC will be provided to the PI de-identified. At not time will the anyone on the research
      team have access to patient identifiers. All information and bacteria are collected as part
      of the patient's clinical treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients at the aforementioned institutions that have Gram negative bacteremia
             will be included in the study.

          -  Women with childbearing potential will also be included in this study. Since this is
             an observational study, no added risk is conferred to the woman or potential progeny.
             HIV serostatus will not be specifically investigated for participation in this study.
