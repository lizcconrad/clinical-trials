      The primary hypothesis of this study is that regular topical oral application of Manuka Honey
      will reduce the severity and duration of oral mucositis in patients who are undergoing
      mucotoxic radiation therapy for cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis is a common side-effect of radiation therapy for many head and neck cancers,
      and can have a very severe impact on quality of life and nutritional status. At least42% of
      patients treated for head and neck cancers will develop grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis. Although
      there have been positive trials, no study has had overwhelming data to strongly support any
      one agent in the prevention or treatment of oral mucositis. A comprehensive review of the
      literature done in 2004 found only benzydamine (a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      agent) to be beneficial as a palliative treatment for established mucositis. Management
      essentially consists of pain management, with topical and oral analgesics/anaesthetics and
      anti-inflammatory agents, and nutritional support, once mucositis is established. Despite the
      use of these agents, many patients still have severe mucositis, and there is great need for
      new treatments to reduce this distressing complication of cancer therapy.

      Currently, the only standard &quot;treatment&quot; consists of an oral rinse of warm water, salt, and
      baking soda 4 times a day. This is only to maintain oral hygiene and does not have any impact
      on the severity or duration of the mucositis itself. Topical fluoride is applied at bedtime
      to reduce the caries risk. Basic oral care (brushing and flossing as tolerated) is
      recommended to maintain general mucosal health and to reduce the impact of oral microbial
      flora.

      Study Objectives The primary objective of this study is to see if topical oral Manuka honey
      reduces the severity of mucositis in patients receiving radiation treatment for head and neck
      cancer. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of any demonstrated improvement in
      mucositis on nutrition, symptom burden, quality of life, and radiotherapy treatment
      interruptions.
