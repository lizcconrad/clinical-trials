    <textblock>
      Patients with alcohol use disorders are often cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU). We
      estimate that close to half of the patients we care for in our ICU have alcohol use
      disorders. One of the reasons that patients with alcohol use disorders are frequently cared
      for in our ICU is because patients with alcohol use disorders are at higher risk of
      developing infections. The medical term for infections is sepsis. When an infection develops,
      patients with alcohol use disorders tend to get more severely ill compared to patients who do
      not have alcohol use disorders. Patients with alcohol use disorders are also at higher risk
      of dying when they develop severe infections.

      The purpose of this study is to determine why patients with alcohol use disorders become more
      severely ill when they develop infections. There are a number of reasons why this is
      possible. One reason is that a hormone called cortisol is higher in individuals with alcohol
      use disorders (who do not have infections). This hormone is also higher in patients who are
      at increased risk of dying from severe infections. One of the aims of this study is to see if
      cortisol levels are higher in patients with alcohol use disorders compared to those who do
      not have alcohol use disorders.

      Another reason why patients with alcohol use disorders are at increased risk of developing
      infections is because their immune system is not functioning properly. A second aim of this
      study is to see if certain markers of immune function are different in patients with alcohol
      use disorders compared to patients without alcohol use disorders.

      Patients with alcohol use disorders are also more likely to become confused when they are in
      the ICU. This condition is called delirium. Delirium is marked by abrupt onset of altered
      level of consciousness, disorganized thinking, and inattention that changes over time.
      Delirium tremens is one form of delirium. About 80% of our ICU patients develop delirium, and
      many patients who do not have alcohol use disorders develop the disorder as well. Patients
      with alcohol use disorders who have high cortisol levels have a higher chance of developing
      delirium compared to patients with normal cortisol levels. A third aim of this study is to
      examine the relationship between delirium and cortisol in both patients with and without
      alcohol use disorders.

    <description>Validated questionnaires will be administered. Blood samples will be analyzed for levels of immune markers as well as cortisol. This is an observational study and patients will not undergo any treatment as part of study participation. Patients will not receive medications or other interventions if they participate in the study. Blood samples analyzed are from samples remaining in the hospital laboratory that were collected as part of routine patient care and destined to be discarded.</description>

      1. Diagnosis of alcohol use disorders will be made through the use of a validated
           questionnaire.

        2. Blood collected as part of routine patient care (and that is destined to be discarded)
           will be evaluated for a number of immune markers. Cortisol levels measured as part of
           routine care will be recorded.

        3. Delirium will be assessed through the use of a validated instrument.
