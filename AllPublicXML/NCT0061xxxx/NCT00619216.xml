  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplant patients often require multimodal immunosuppressive therapy to minimize
      their risk for rejection. In our regimen, MMF (mycophenolate mofetil) is often added to lower
      the side effects of the calcineurin inhibitors. Unfortunately the literature reports 20% up
      to as many as 40% of patients have GI intolerance to MMF. At our Center, approximately 30% of
      patients have intolerance to MMF, thereby mitigating our ability to use this agent. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess the tolerability of myfortic in combination with
      Neoral or Tacrolimus as determined by the GSRS (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) after
      conversion from MMF in maintenance liver transplant patients with GI intolerance within 3
      months.
