      Purpose: To study the effects of two different rehabilitation programs for people with
      osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.

      Hypothesis 1: Participants who received Activity Stratgey Training will report less pain and
      physical disability at 8-weeks and 6-months follow-up.

      Hypothesis 2: Participants who receive Activity Strategy Training will have a greater
      increase in physical activity as measured by a wrist-worn accelerometer.

      Hypothesis 3: Participants who receive Activity Stratgey Training will report greater
      improvements in health-related quality of life.

      We are testing the effectiveness of a targeted intervention for older adults with hip and/or
      knee osteoarthritis (LE-OA) using an occupational therapy treatment approach to promote
      activity engagement. We believe that it is necessary to tailor this intervention to the
      specific needs of older adults with LE-OA. Based on the literature, exercise is a necessary
      component of an intervention for older adults with LE-OA. However, this should also be
      coupled with an Activity Strategy Training (AST) component designed to promote lifestyle
      changes and thus more lasting effects. The AST component is based on occupational therapy
      principles and will include behavioral and environmental strategies to increase activity
      engagement.

    <description>Exercise + Activity Strategy Training: 7/8 sessions will be in a group format in which participants engage in muscular strength &amp; flexibility exercises and listen to education lessons on management strategies for osteoarthritis. The remaining session includes a home assessment by an occupational therapist to facilitate adequate participation in daily living and leisure activities.</description>

    <description>The AST component will involve training in specific behavioral and environmental strategies to facilitate performance in daily activities and routines. The activity strategy training group sessions will use education, group discussion, and demonstration and practice of techniques to facilitate activity performance. Homework assignments will be given after many of the sessions to practice and reinforce concepts learned.</description>
