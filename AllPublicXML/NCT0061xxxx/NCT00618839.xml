  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot Phase I/II clinical study will be conducted at up to three clinical sites.

      This is an open-label, randomized, comparative study with a maximum of fifteen (15) patients,
      each with skin defects. The patients are intended to undergo sequential surgical procedures
      involving surgical skin debridement and temporary allogeneic (cadaver skin) grafting at
      various separate or contiguous wound sites. Patients will be randomized within each wound
      site to one of two test products: cadaver skin or StrataGraft™ skin tissue.

      Stratatech has completed a phase I/IIa clinical study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      escalating amounts of StrataGraft skin tissue in patients with complex skin defects requiring
      sequential debridement and temporary wound coverage with biological dressing prior to
      autografting. The specific objectives of this phase I/IIa clinical trial were to assess the
      safety of StrataGraft skin tissue using a predetermined panel of clinical and laboratory
      endpoints and assess the efficacy of StrataGraft skin tissue by comparing the ability of
      StrataGraft skin tissue to the standard of care, human cadaver skin, to condition complex
      skin defects for subsequent autografting. In three cohorts of five patients each, the maximum
      amount of StrataGraft skin tissue applied to excised full-thickness skin wounds was increased
      sequentially from 0.5% to 1.0%, and then to 1.5% TBSA. Equivalent study wound areas on each
      subject were treated with StrataGraft or cadaver allograft for one week, at which time the
      allograft tissues were removed and the wound bed was evaluated. Infection and appearance of
      the temporary allogeneic skin tissue were evaluated at every study session until autograft
      placement. The wound was covered with split-thickness skin autografts when the wound was
      judged ready to accept an autograft. Autograft take was assessed two weeks after autograft
      placement.

            <title>StrataGraft Skin Tissue</title>
            <description>StrataGraft skin tissue is a fully-differentiated tissue which exhibits barrier function comparable to that of intact human skin. StrataGraft consists of an epidermal layer of fully-stratified human keratinocytes growing on a dermal layer which is comprised of human fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix. StrataGraft skin tissue is a tough, suturable, meshable tissue product that is manufactured with a surface area of 44 cm2. StrataGraft tissue is not intended to be a patient-specific product but rather to provide an allogeneic skin substitute which reproduces many of the structural and biological properties of normal human skin and is anticipated to serve as a biological wound dressing.</description>

            <title>Cadaver Skin</title>
            <description>The current standard of care for the management of severe burns or other major skin trauma is temporary coverage of the wound with cadaver skin followed by autografting once once sufficient donor skin is available for autografting. Excised wounds are covered temporarily with cadaver skin to reduce fluid loss and infection. In addition to preventing excessive dehydration, restoration of a permeability barrier maintains a moist wound environment which promotes wound healing. However, there is inconsistent availability of freshly-harvested cadaver grafts. In addition, the quality of cadaver skin is variable- cadaver skin is often contaminated and if cadaver skin had undergone prolonged storage or freezing this reduces the viability of cadaver skin.</description>
