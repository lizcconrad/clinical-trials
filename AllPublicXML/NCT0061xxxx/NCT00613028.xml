      Primary objective To estimate 6-month progression free survival probability of pts w
      recurrent GBM treated w bev + either daily temozolomide/etoposide following progression on
      bev + irinotecan Secondary Objectives To evaluate safety &amp; tolerability of bev + either daily
      temozolomide/etoposide among pts w recurrent GBM who have progressed on bev + irinotecan To
      evaluate radiographic response, progression free survival &amp; overall survival of pts w
      recurrent GBM treated w bev + either daily temozolomide/etoposide following progression on
      bev + irinotecan

      This is exploratory, two-arm, phase II study designed to assess anti-tumor activity of bev +
      either daily temozolomide/etoposide among GBM pts w progressive disease following bev +
      irinotecan. About 48 participants w recurrent GBM will take part in this study. Approximately
      24 participants will receive bev plus temozolomide &amp; approximately 24 will receive bev +
      etoposide. Pts must have confirmed diagnosis of GBM &amp; radiographic evidence of recurrence
      following prior therapy bev + irinotecan. 24 pts will be enrolled onto each arm of this
      single-stage study. If 4 or more of these 24 pts live 6/more months without disease
      progression, treatment regimen will be considered worthy of further investigation. Otherwise,
      treatment regimen will be determined not worthy of further investigation within pt
      population. Type I &amp; II error rates associated w testing are 0.030 &amp; 0.115 respectively.
      Management guidelines dose reduction/interruption for temo, etoposide, &amp; bev.
