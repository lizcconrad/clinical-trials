      This study will compare the effectiveness of two different family treatments for the
      treatment of adolescent anorexia nervosa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this study is to enhance the treatment and outcome of anorexia
      nervosa (AN). Research on the treatment of AN has lagged that of other conditions, even other
      eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa. The focus of this study is on adolescent AN.
      Successful early treatment is likely to reduce the prevalence of chronic AN with its high
      rates of morbidity and mortality and high health care costs. The most promising treatment for
      adolescent AN is a specific form of family therapy called behavioral family therapy (BFT).
      This treatment is focused on the disordered eating behavior that characterizes AN and enables
      parents to refeed their child. Although there have been several small scale studies of BFT
      there has been no controlled comparison with another form of family therapy. Therefore we
      propose to use systems family therapy (SFT) which has been developed to represent the type of
      family therapy practiced in the community.

      One hundred and sixty adolescents of both genders aged 12-18 years meeting DSM-IV criteria
      for anorexia nervosa will be entered to the study. Recruitment is projected to extend for 2
      years. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two types of family therapy.
      Family therapy will be given for 36-weeks. For the purpose of the present study, patients
      will be followed for 12-months after the end of family treatment. Hence, each family will
      participate for approximately 2-years, with a total participation time of some 40-hours. In a
      sub-study blood will be drawn from those volunteering for genetic analysis focusing on the
      subset of non-responders to treatments.

    <intervention_name>Family Behavior Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>This treatment is usually delivered in two phases: In the first phase there is an initial investigation of family behavior around feeding using a family meal followed by family therapy focused on enhancing feeding of the anorexic child in order to promote weight gain. In the second phase, once weight gain is well established the adolescent is given greater autonomy over feeding and in later sessions over other issues.</description>

    <description>This therapy is applied in three phases. 1. In the first 2 or 3-sessions the treatment is explained to the family and an initial examination of family issues begins. 2. In the second phase family interactions and psychological processes are explored with clarification for family members. 3. In the third phase knowledge of family patterns is refined aiming for behavior change.</description>
