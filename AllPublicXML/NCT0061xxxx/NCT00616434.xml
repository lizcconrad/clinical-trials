  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical activity of interferon beta-1a
      in participants with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Secondary objectives of this
      study are to determine (i) the safety and tolerability of interferon beta-1a in participants
      with moderate to severe UC, and (ii) the percentage of participants, with a decrease in the
      Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) score of ≥3 points at Week 8.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, accompanied by a decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or an absolute subscore of 1 or less. Baseline was defined as the score collected during the screening period. The Mayo Score/Disease Activity Index (DAI) measures disease activity through assessment of 4 items: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and Physician Global Assessment (PGA). Each item of the score is assessed on a 4-point scale, 0, 1, 2, or 3, with a higher score representing greater severity. In this study, the endoscopy subscore was expanded to a 5-point scale to increase sensitivity in this important dimension of the disease (0=normal/inactive disease, 4=deep ulceration). The Total Mayo Score can therefore range from 0 to13 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE, can therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. All AE's were analyzed based on the principle of treatment emergence. An AE was regarded as treatment-emergent if it was not present prior to receiving the first injection but subsequently appeared, or if it was present prior to receiving the first injection and subsequently worsened in severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Decrease on Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) of ≥3 Points at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SCCAI measures disease activity as defined by both participants and examiners and includes the following 13 items: general well-being, abdominal pain, bowel frequency, stool consistency, bleeding, anorexia, nausea or vomiting, abdominal tenderness, extra-intestinal complications (eye, mouth, joint, skin), temperature, sigmoidoscopic assessment, nocturnal bowel movements, and urgency of defecation. Scores range from 0 to 19 points, and scores &lt;2.5 have been shown to correlate with Patient-Defined Remission, and a decrease of &gt;1.5 points from Baseline correlates with Patient-Defined Significant Improvement. Baseline is defined as the mean of the screening and visit 1 scores.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response</title>
        <description>Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, accompanied by a decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or an absolute subscore of 1 or less. Baseline was defined as the score collected during the screening period. The Mayo Score/Disease Activity Index (DAI) measures disease activity through assessment of 4 items: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings, and Physician Global Assessment (PGA). Each item of the score is assessed on a 4-point scale, 0, 1, 2, or 3, with a higher score representing greater severity. In this study, the endoscopy subscore was expanded to a 5-point scale to increase sensitivity in this important dimension of the disease (0=normal/inactive disease, 4=deep ulceration). The Total Mayo Score can therefore range from 0 to13 points.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE, can therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. All AE’s were analyzed based on the principle of treatment emergence. An AE was regarded as treatment-emergent if it was not present prior to receiving the first injection but subsequently appeared, or if it was present prior to receiving the first injection and subsequently worsened in severity.</description>

Scores range from 0 to 19 points, and scores &lt;2.5 have been shown to correlate with Patient-Defined Remission, and a decrease of &gt;1.5 points from Baseline correlates with Patient-Defined Significant Improvement.
