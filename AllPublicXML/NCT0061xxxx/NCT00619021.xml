      RATIONALE: Bronchial artery infusion uses a catheter to deliver antitumor substances directly
      to the lungs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving gemcitabine in different ways
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine given
      by bronchial artery infusion and to see how well it works in treating patients with recurrent
      or progressive non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride delivered via
           bronchial artery infusion in patients with recurrent or progressive non-small cell lung
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate local response in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients treated
           with this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride delivered via bronchial
      artery infusion.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride via bronchial artery infusion over 30-60 minutes
      on day 1 and via IV infusion over 30 minutes on day 8 of course 1. Patients then receive
      gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of all subsequent courses.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 8 weeks to 3 months for up to
      2 years.
