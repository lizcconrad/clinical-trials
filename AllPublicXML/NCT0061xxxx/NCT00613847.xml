  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how a new study agent works inside the body.
      This study agent is a protein called 68Ga-F(ab')2-trastuzumab fragments (HERScan). This is a
      radioactive tracer that was developed at MSKCC to target the HER2 protein on cancer cells. By
      giving this tracer to patients whose cancers have the HER2 protein, we hope to be able to see
      the level of HER2 on the cancer cells using PET scanning.

    <description>Pt will undergo one PET study following the i.v. administration of 10mCi of 68Ga-F(ab')2-trastuzumab fragments (HERScan). The PET study will be performed within 4 weeks of the patient's most recent imaging studies. A subset of 10 patients who have evidence of tumor uptake and localization with the 68Ga-F(ab')2-trastuzumab fragments will be asked to undergo follow-up PET scans (up to a maximum of 3) to examine the time course of HER-2 expression. These follow-up PET scans will be performed concurrently with the patient's standard imaging studies to evaluate response to their current therapy as per their treating physicians.</description>

    <description>Once safety and feasibility has been established in this group, then enrollment to the HER2 1+ cohort will commence.
