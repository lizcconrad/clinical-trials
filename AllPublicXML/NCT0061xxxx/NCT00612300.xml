      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of an automatic gait trainer
      (Lokomat) handled by physical therapists compared with categorized gait training by physical
      therapists in ambulatory stroke patients. Gait speed, gait distance and gait symmetry are
      used to evaluate study effects.

      Hypotheses: 1) The Lokomat improves stroke patients gait speed, distance and symmetry more
      than categorized gait training.
