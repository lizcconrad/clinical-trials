      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the antidepressant, duloxetine, is equally
      effective as a treatment for subjects who have a Postpartum Onset Depression compared to
      subjects who have an onset of Major Depressive Disorder prior to delivery. The hypothesis is
      that duloxetine will be as effective in subjects with Postpartum Major Depressive Disorder as
      in subjects with a Major Depressive Disorder.
