  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the 4.0-5.0mm
      AngioSculpt Scoring Balloon Catheter (AngioScore, Inc.) for femoropopliteal use in a
      controlled clinical investigation.

      The scoring balloon is a semi-compliant balloon encircled by 3 spiral struts with a nitinol
      scoring element, which theoretically provides targeted scoring of lesions, by concentrating
      the dilation force thus minimizing barotrauma, elastic recoil and uncontrolled dissection.
      This may improve the outcome of the intervention and reduce the number of stents required.

    <description>The AngioSculpt Scoring Balloon Catheter is a line of innovative angioplasty catheters comprising an angioplasty balloon surrounded by a unique system of nitinol scoring elements. Creating focal concentrations of dilating force, the scoring elements score arterial lesions as the balloon expands.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stenotic (&gt;50%) or occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the femoropopliteal arteries
             (primarily superficial femoral arteries - SFA)

          -  Length of lesion &gt;5 cm or 2 times the AngioSculpt balloon length (whichever is longer)

          -  Reference vessel diameter should be 4.0-6.0 mm

          -  Life altering claudication or critical limb ischemia (Rutherford 3-5)

          -  No untreated inflow-limiting arterial lesions

          -  At least single vessel run-off until the ankle

          -  The patient must be &gt; 18 years.

          -  Life-expectancy of more than 12 months

          -  The subject or legal guardian has been informed of the nature of the evaluation;
             agrees to its provisions and has signed informed consent

          -  The patient is capable to follow all evaluation requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient refusing treatment

          -  The reference segment diameter is not suitable for available catheter design

          -  Length of lesion is ≥5 cm or requires more than two overlapping AngioSculpt balloon
             inflations (whichever is longer) to cover the entire lesion (however, more than two
             inflations are permitted within an acceptable lesion length)

          -  The patient has a known allergy to heparin, aspirin or other
             anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies or a bleeding diatheses or is unable, or
             unwilling, to tolerate such therapies

          -  The patient has a history of prior life-threatening contrast media reaction

          -  The patient is currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug trial

          -  The patient is currently breast-feeding, pregnant or intends to become pregnant
