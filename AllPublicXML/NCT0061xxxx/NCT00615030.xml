  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to provide detailed information on the efficacy of indacaterol (in
      terms of the spirometry assessment forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) over the full
      24-h time period

    <measure>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Following 14 Days of Evening Dosing of Indacaterol Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>After 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Trough FEV1 was assessed by performing spirometry measurements in the clinic for each treatment period. For the primary efficacy variable, trough FEV1 is the mean of two measurements taken at 23h 10 min and 23h 45 min post dose. The primary variable was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate.
The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</description>

    <measure>Trough FEV1 Assessed After 14 Days of Dosing for All Other Treatment Comparisons</measure>
    <time_frame>After 14 days of dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Trough FEV1 was assessed by performing spirometry measurements in the clinic for each treatment period. On the morning and evening of Day 15 trough FEV1 (i.e. mean of measurements performed 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose) were assessed. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used with the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate. The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</description>

    <description>In period I, indacaterol 300 μg once a day in the morning delivered via single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI) with a placebo to salmeterol delivered via dry powder inhaler (DPI). Patients were also instructed to take evening doses of a placebo to indacaterol via SDDPI and placebo to salmeterol via DPI. In period II, patients were instructed to take morning doses of a placebo to indacaterol delivered via SDDPI and placebo to salmeterol delivered via DPI. Indacaterol 300 μg once a day in the evening delivered via SDDPI with placebo to salmeterol delivered via DPI. In period III, Salmeterol 50 μg twice daily delivered via DPI. One of the two daily doses of salmeterol was administered in the morning and second dose in the evening along with placebo matching indacaterol delivered by SDDPI. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was allowed to remain stable throughout the study. The short acting (beta) β2-agonist (SABA) was available for rescue use throughout the study.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were randomized to one of the 12 possible treatment sequences of the double-blind 10-week treatment phase (Week 1 – 10). Each treatment sequence was divided into three treatment periods (I/II/III) of 15-day duration each. The first and second treatment period of each sequence was followed by a 2-week washout period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total 96 patients were randomized; one randomized patient discontinued from the study prior to exposure to study drug because of abnormal test procedure(s) result.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Following 14 Days of Evening Dosing of Indacaterol Versus Placebo</title>
        <description>Trough FEV1 was assessed by performing spirometry measurements in the clinic for each treatment period. For the primary efficacy variable, trough FEV1 is the mean of two measurements taken at 23h 10 min and 23h 45 min post dose. The primary variable was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate.
The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</description>
        <time_frame>After 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
        <population>The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Patients who received only one treatment were also included for calculation of treatment means. This analysis included all patients who received indacaterol in the evening or placebo in their assigned treatment sequence.</population>

          <title>Trough FEV1 Assessed After 14 Days of Dosing for All Other Treatment Comparisons</title>
          <description>Trough FEV1 was assessed by performing spirometry measurements in the clinic for each treatment period. On the morning and evening of Day 15 trough FEV1 (i.e. mean of measurements performed 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose) were assessed. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used with the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate. The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</description>
          <population>The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Patients who received only one treatment were also included for calculation of treatment means.</population>
