  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a common retinal vascular disease occurring in a
      significant number of individuals older than 50 years.The most common cause of visual
      disturbance in BRVO patients is macular edema, which has been reported in 60% of patients.
      Macular grid laser photocoagulation has been shown to be effective in the treatment of
      macular edema arising from BRVO. Some eyes are resistant to conventional grid laser
      treatment, and the conventional treatment is not useful in patients with intraretinal
      hemorrhages that may interfere with laser photocoagulation. Moreover, several studies have
      shown that conventional grid laser treatment for macular edema may be associated with
      complications.

      Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) injection has recently been reported to be
      effective in the treatment of macular edema of various etiologies.On the other hand,
      arteriovenous sheathotomy is a surgical method suggested for treatment of macular edema in
      BRVO patients, and has been reported to be efficacious in patients refractory to conventional
      focal or grid laser macular photocoagulation.Both treatment modalities have been reported to
      be associated with reductions in central macular thicknesses and improved visual acuities.

      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacies of arteriovenous (AV) sheathotomy and
      intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA) injection in the treatment of macular edema associated with
      branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).

    <intervention_name>Arteriovenous Crossing Sheathotomy</intervention_name>
    <description>In each sheathotomy patient, a standard pars plana vitrectomy is performed, followed by surgical separation of the posterior cortical vitreous from the optic nerve and posterior retina. After the relevant arteriovenous crossing site is identified based on preoperative FA, a bent microvitreoretinal blade is used to open the internal limiting membrane and the nerve fiber layer over the artery, with the incision commencing 100-200 micrometer proximal to the AV crossing. The incision is continued parallel to and under the retinal arteriole, with a gentle lifting motion, until the common AV crossing sheath is encountered and incised in a side-to-side manner. The completion of AV dissection is confirmed by an elevation of the overlying artery.</description>

    <intervention_name>Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide Injection</intervention_name>
    <description>The IVTA group receive intravitreal injection of 4 mg/0.1 mL triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg/mL; Tamceton®; Hanall Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea). The injections are performed using 0.5% proparacaine drops (Alcaine®; Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) for topical anesthesia under sterile conditions. The drug is injected through the inferotemporal pars plana using a 30-gauge needle. The correct intravitreal localization of the suspension, and perfusion of the optic nerve head, are then confirmed by indirect ophthalmoscopy.</description>
