      Basing in studies which have related the darunavir (DRV) virtual inhibitory quotient (vIQ)
      with the virological response, it is possible to think in the possibility of simplifying the
      rescue treatment with DRV/ritonavir to 900/100 mg once a day in those patients who are being
      treated with DRV/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice a day and who, besides having undetectable viral
      load, have a vIQ over 2. This strategy would not jeopardize the efficacy of the
      antiretroviral treatment and would have less impact in the lipid profile of the patients as
      well as less pharmaceutical expenditure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The probability of achieving viral replication suppression during the treatment with DRV has
      been related to both the extent of viral resistance to DRV (inhibitory concentration 50%,
      IC50) and the drug concentration. Moreover, the DRV virtual inhibitory quotient (vIQ) has
      been related significantly with the virological response to DRV treatment. So patients with a
      DRV vIQ &gt;= 1,5 had a 8-times higher probability of having viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL after 24
      weeks of treatment than those having a vIQ &lt; 1,5.

      Considering the previous arguments, it is possible to think in the possibility of simplifying
      the rescue treatment with DRV/ritonavir to 900/100 mg once a day in those patients who are
      being treated with DRV/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice a day and who, besides having undetectable
      viral load, have a DRV vIQ over 2. This strategy would not jeopardize the efficacy of the
      antiretroviral treatment and would have less impact in the lipid profile of the patients as
      well as less pharmaceutical expenditure.
