      Purpose: The associations between pain, stress, bloating, and their short interval temporal
      relationships to defecation in IBS D, C &amp; M are of great interest to the field of functional
      GI disorders, but have not been adequately studied. Broad recall based assessments (i.e.,over
      past week or month) of pain and bloating have been key features of the diagnosis of IBS,
      however such long term retrospective recall of symptom experience has been shown to be
      unreliable and influenced by outside factors (heuristics, recall bias, etc.). Short interval
      assessment may provide a more accurate picture of patient symptom experience Participants:
      Patients with IBS in general and IBS subtypes (IBS-C, D, M) Procedures (methods): Study
      participants could be asked to record data at randomly assigned points throughout the day, as
      well as during the course of a diarrheal or constipated stool (i.e., prior to and right after
      a bowel movement).

        80 male and female subjects will be recruited: 20 with IBS D; 20 with IBS C; 20 with IBS M;
        20 control (no bowel symptoms).

        We will target patients who have maintained a diagnosis of IBS with Diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS
        with Constipation (IBS-C, IBS with Mixed Stool pattern (IBS-M), using Rome III Criteria as
        well as control subjects without bowel symptoms. Subject participation will be limited to
        patients who maintain mild or moderate symptom severity score on the functional bowel
        disorders severity index (FBDSI.) providing they have at least 3 symptom episodes of pain
        or discomfort in a given week, to assure adequate data collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject signs and dates a written informed consent form (ICF) prior to any
             study-related activities, including discontinuation of any prohibited medications.

          2. The subject has been diagnosed with either IBS-C, IBS-D, IBS-M, or has no history of
             gastrointestinal symptoms (control group).

          3. The subject has at least 3 pain episodes a week and does not have constant,
             unremitting abdominal pain.

          4. The subject is at least 18 years of age and less than 75 years of age at the time of
             the screening visit.

          5. The subject is fluent in English.

          6. The subject is an ambulatory outpatient. Ambulatory is defined as not depending
             exclusively on a wheelchair for mobility. Nursing home subjects may be enrolled
             provided they are ambulatory. Subjects with spinal cord injuries resulting in
             paraplegia may not be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject exhibits evidence of a biochemical or structural abnormality of the
             digestive tract. These conditions include (but are not limited to) the following:

               -  Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis),

               -  GI surgery (with the exceptions of appendectomy; cholecystectomy; benign
                  polypectomy; fundoplication without gas bloat syndrome, 6 months post-surgery;
                  herniorrhaphy without bowel resection, 1 month post-surgery; hemorrhoidectomy, at
                  least 2 months post-surgery; and hiatal hernia repair),

               -  GI malignancy, GI obstruction

          2. In the opinion of the investigator the subject has a concurrent illness or disability
             (excluding IBS) that may affect the interpretation of clinical efficacy and/or safety
             data or otherwise contraindicates participation in this clinical study (e.g., an
             unstable cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, endocrine, metabolic, GI,
             hematological, or neurological condition).

          3. The subject has been diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder within the past 2
             years that required hospitalization and/or involved an attempted suicide (e.g., major
             depression or psychoses). Subjects diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder that
             did not require hospitalization or involve an attempted suicide must have remained on
             a stable dose of medication for at least 6 months prior to the screening visit.

          4. The subject has a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the past 2 years.

          5. The subject has any evidence or treatment of malignancy (other than localized basal
             cell, squamous cell skin cancer or cancer in situ that has been resected) within the
             previous 5 years.
