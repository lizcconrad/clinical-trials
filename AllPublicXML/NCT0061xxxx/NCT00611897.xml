      This study tests the hypothesis that extrasynaptic mechanisms are critically linked with
      cognitive effects of NMDA antagonism as evidenced by event-related potentials (ERPs) in
      healthy humans.

    <measure>Target P300</measure>
    <time_frame>daily</time_frame>
    <description>The Target P300 measures were obtained from the Fz, Cz and Pz electrodes.
Target stimuli were 1000 Hz tones (500 ms) and novel stimuli (~250 ms) were unique environmental sounds (e.g., dog bark) used in prior studies of the novelty P300. Subjects were instructed to respond to the target sounds by pressing a button using their dominant hand index finger. The standard stimuli were 20, 30 or 40 Hz click trains (500 ms) in the first, second, and third runs, respectively. The auditory steady state EEG driving data obtained from these standard stimuli will be presented in a separate report. All stimuli were presented at 80 dB SPL.</description>

    <measure>Mismatch Negativity (MMN) Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>daily</time_frame>
    <description>Mismatch Negativity (MMN) Intensity difference waves at midline electrodes (Fz, Cz and Pz).
The frequent standard tones were of 75 ms duration with 5 ms rise and fall time, and were composed of 500, 1000, and 1500 Hz sinusoidal partials (harmonics) that resulted in a single high pitched beep sound.
All tones were presented at 76 dB sound pressure level (SPL) with the exception of intensity deviants. The three deviants were distinguishable from standard tones in either intensity, frequency, or duration.
Subjects performed a visual discrimination distractor task during the MMN runs and were instructed to ignore the tones.
The mismatch negativity (MMN) measure included 3 types of deviant tones (stimuli) that the subjects heard: 1. Frequency deviant, 2. Intensity deviant, 3. Duration deviant. The response to these 3 types of deviants were recorded in the EEG. Therefore each deviant was associated with different waves which we measured in amplitude (microvolts)</description>

        <description>The Target P300 measures were obtained from the Fz, Cz and Pz electrodes.
Target stimuli were 1000 Hz tones (500 ms) and novel stimuli (~250 ms) were unique environmental sounds (e.g., dog bark) used in prior studies of the novelty P300. Subjects were instructed to respond to the target sounds by pressing a button using their dominant hand index finger. The standard stimuli were 20, 30 or 40 Hz click trains (500 ms) in the first, second, and third runs, respectively. The auditory steady state EEG driving data obtained from these standard stimuli will be presented in a separate report. All stimuli were presented at 80 dB SPL.</description>

          <title>Target P300</title>
          <description>The Target P300 measures were obtained from the Fz, Cz and Pz electrodes.
Target stimuli were 1000 Hz tones (500 ms) and novel stimuli (~250 ms) were unique environmental sounds (e.g., dog bark) used in prior studies of the novelty P300. Subjects were instructed to respond to the target sounds by pressing a button using their dominant hand index finger. The standard stimuli were 20, 30 or 40 Hz click trains (500 ms) in the first, second, and third runs, respectively. The auditory steady state EEG driving data obtained from these standard stimuli will be presented in a separate report. All stimuli were presented at 80 dB SPL.</description>

        <description>Mismatch Negativity (MMN) Intensity difference waves at midline electrodes (Fz, Cz and Pz).
The frequent standard tones were of 75 ms duration with 5 ms rise and fall time, and were composed of 500, 1000, and 1500 Hz sinusoidal partials (harmonics) that resulted in a single high pitched beep sound.
All tones were presented at 76 dB sound pressure level (SPL) with the exception of intensity deviants. The three deviants were distinguishable from standard tones in either intensity, frequency, or duration.
Subjects performed a visual discrimination distractor task during the MMN runs and were instructed to ignore the tones.
The mismatch negativity (MMN) measure included 3 types of deviant tones (stimuli) that the subjects heard: 1. Frequency deviant, 2. Intensity deviant, 3. Duration deviant. The response to these 3 types of deviants were recorded in the EEG. Therefore each deviant was associated with different waves which we measured in amplitude (microvolts)</description>

        <title>Mismatch Negativity (MMN) Duration</title>
        <description>Mismatch Negativity (MMN) Duration difference waves at midline electrodes (Fz, Cz and Pz).
The frequent standard tones were of 75 ms duration with 5 ms rise and fall time, and were composed of 500, 1000, and 1500 Hz sinusoidal partials (harmonics) that resulted in a single high pitched beep sound.
All tones were presented at 76 dB sound pressure level (SPL) with the exception of intensity deviants. The three deviants were distinguishable from standard tones in either intensity, frequency, or duration.
Subjects performed a visual discrimination distractor task during the MMN runs and were instructed to ignore the tones.
The mismatch negativity (MMN) measure included 3 types of deviant tones (stimuli) that the subjects heard: 1. Frequency deviant, 2. Intensity deviant, 3. Duration deviant. The response to these 3 types of deviants were recorded in the EEG. Therefore each deviant was associated with different waves which we measured in amplitude (microvolts)</description>
