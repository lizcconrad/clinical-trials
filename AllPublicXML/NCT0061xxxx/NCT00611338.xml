    <textblock>
      This research study will examine the usefulness of groups in reducing stress and helping
      individuals with HIV to stay healthy and avoid problems associated with sexually transmitted
      diseases. We hope to discover whether being in a group is effective in reducing
      stress-related symptoms and promoting healthy behaviors.
