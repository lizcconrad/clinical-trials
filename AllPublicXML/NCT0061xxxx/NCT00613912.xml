    <textblock>
      Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder.

        -  3-5% of a given population has major depression.

        -  Less than 50% of the depressed in Denmark are diagnosed with major depression.

        -  25-50% of the depressed have a relative with major depression-underlying brain
           pathology?

      The purpose of this study is to use MRI to evaluate cerebral morphology and function in
      ambulant patients with major depression

      Previous studies within major depression, have often included hospitalized patients with
      severe symptoms and imaging have been performed with PET and SPECT, which uses ionizing
      radiation. This study focus on ambulant patients(with or without medication/ECT treatment),
      to find patients in an earlier stage. Cerebral perfusion with the MR sequence Arterial Spin
      Labelling, concentrations of different metabolites with MR spectroscopy and brain volumetry
      with BRAVO 3D T1 ax will be performed.

      MR protocol: T2 sag, T2 FLAIR ax, ASL ax, MRS and 3D T1 ax. Scan time 45 min.
