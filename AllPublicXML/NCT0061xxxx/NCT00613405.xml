      The purpose of this study is to explore the interaction between stress and marijuana cues, in
      hopes that it may lead to the development of new treatments for marijuana dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although use of marijuana is widespread, little research has focused on the treatment of
      marijuana use disorders or on predictors of relapse. Although several factors contributing to
      relapse have been explored in other dependencies (i.e., alcohol, cocaine), little research
      has focused on drug cue-related or stress-induced relapse in marijuana-dependent individuals.
      Cue reactivity is a construct measured in a laboratory procedure where an individual's
      subjective, behavioral, and physiological responses are assessed following exposure to
      drug-related environmental cues or stressors. Investigating the effects of drug-related
      environmental cues and stress in marijuana-dependent individuals will be useful in guiding
      treatment development.
