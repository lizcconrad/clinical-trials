  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and efficacy of dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in combination with
      cetuximab and irinotecan in treating participants with wild type KRAS (wtKRAS) metastatic
      colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to cetuximab and irinotecan alone.

      The primary study hypothesis is that administration of dalotuzumab in combination with
      cetuximab and irinotecan to participants with metastatic CRC expressing the wtKRAS genotype
      improves Overall Survival OR Progression-free Survival compared to participants treated with
      cetuximab and irinotecan alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dalotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the insulin-like growth
      factor type 1 receptor-1 (IGF-1R). Dalotuzumab may act through inhibition of insulin-like
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-mediated cell signaling to cause reductions in tumor growth and
      spread antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

      In preclinical studies, dalotuzumab improved the activity of an anti-epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) mAb and the activity of erlotinib, a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR.

      All eligible participants will receive cetuximab 400 mg/m^2 infusion over 120 minutes
      followed by weekly infusions of cetuximab 250 mg/m^2 over 60-120 minutes along with
      irinotecan infusion over 30-90 minutes. Dosage of irinotecan will be the same as most recent
      pre-study therapy. Participants will then be assigned to one of three treatment double-blind
      arms.

    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks after last dose of study drug (Up to 35 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The OS of participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) expressing the KRAS wild-type (wtKRAS) tumor genotype (indicating no detection of KRAS mutation) was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to last dose of study drug (Up to 32 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS of participants with metastatic CRC expressing the wtKRAS genotype was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to the first documented disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 (RECIST 1.0) as documented by an independent core laboratory, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Disease progression was defined as either a 20% or greater relative increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions OR an absolute increase of at least 5mm in the sum of lesions or the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to 33 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. (Grade 3=Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living. Grade 4=Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5=Death related to AE.) Participants were monitored for AEs until the earlier of study discontinuation or 30 days after dalotuzumab/placebo discontinuation. AE grades were assessed using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE, version 3.0.</description>

Disease progression was defined as either a 20% or greater relative increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions OR an absolute increase of at least 5mm in the sum of lesions or the appearance of new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and is reported in months.</description>

          <description>An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. (Grade 3=Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living. Grade 4=Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5=Death related to AE.) Drug-related AEs were those AEs that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug or protocol-specified procedures. Participants were monitored for AEs related to dalotuzumab or placebo until the earlier of study discontinuation or 30 days after dalotuzumab/placebo discontinuation. AE grades were assessed using the NCI CTCAE, version 3.0.</description>

          <description>ORR, using RECIST 1.0, was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) at any time during the study, based on central radiology review.</description>
          <population>The ITT population consisted of all participants who had a wtKRAS tumor genotype. The efficacy analyses were planned for and only included participants from the DB portion of the study. Participants from the OL portion were excluded from the analyses. Participants were counted in the group to which they were randomized.</population>
