      Study Objective:To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Vascular Sealant compared
      with Gelfoam/Thrombin when used to seal bleeding anastomotic suture lines in patients
      undergoing vascular reconstructive surgery requiring placement of a PTFE graft (including
      extra-anatomic, infrainguinal bypass and arteriovenous (AV) access procedures).

      Study Design: The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial
      that will compare two methods for treating anastomotic leakage (bleeding). All subjects (n
      =151) will be randomized at a 3:1 ratio to receive either the investigational treatment
      (Vascular Sealant) or the control treatment (Gelfoam/Thrombin). Up to two (2) treatment sites
      may be evaluated for each subject. Subjects will be stratified by type of graft procedure: AV
      access graft or extra-anatomic and infra-inguinal graft. A minimum of 60 patients, and a
      maximum of 91 patients, will be enrolled in each stratum. Treatment randomization will be
      blocked by center and type of graft procedure (e.g., bypass or AV grafts). All subjects will
      undergo preoperative screening to determine eligibility and will be evaluated
      intraoperatively, at discharge or within 7 days of surgery, and 30 days post-procedure to
      monitor for hematologic disturbances, hemorrhagic events, wound complications and other
      potential acute post-operative adverse events.

      Up to ten (10) investigational sites will participate in the study. Enrollment is expected to
      take approximately 8 months for an anticipated duration of the clinical investigation of
      approximately 9 to 10 months.

      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Vascular Sealant
      to Gelfoam/Thrombin when used to seal anastomotic suture lines in patients undergoing
      placement of PTFE vascular grafts (including extra-anatomic, infrainguinal bypass and
      arteriovenous access procedures).

        Preoperative Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for participation in the
        study:

          -  &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Scheduled for elective vascular surgery that entails placement of a PTFE vascular
             graft including extra-anatomic, infrainguinal bypass and primary and secondary
             arteriovenous access procedures

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment and evaluation
             schedule

          -  Informed of the nature of the study, and has provided written informed consent,
             approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the respective
             clinical site

        Preoperative Exclusion Criteria: Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not
        eligible for participation in the study:
