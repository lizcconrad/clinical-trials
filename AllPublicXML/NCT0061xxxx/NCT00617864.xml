  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study was designed to look at the effect of human albumin transfusion on
      circulating levels of Vascular Endothelial Derived Growth Factor (VEGF), a protein that is
      believed to be responsible for the syndrome of ovarian hyperstimulation. Patients have been
      asked to participate because they are identified as at risk for the Ovarian Hyperstimulation
      Syndrome (OHSS), a potentially serious complication of in vitro fertilization. It has been
      established that the onset of OHSS may be preventable by the infusion of albumin at the time
      of egg retrieval; however, we do not know by what mechanism albumin works. As we know the
      pathogenesis of OHSS is related to VEGF released from the ovaries, we believe human albumin
      may serve to &quot;bind up&quot; this VEGF and prevent it from causing its harmful effects. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the effect of albumin infusion on blood and urine VEGF levels in
      these patients.

  <why_stopped>
    The syndrome of hyperstimulation is so rare that after one year no patients were eligible.The
    study was withdrawn and never started.
