  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is crucial to rapidly identify cardiac ischemia in the care of patients with suspected
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Cardiac troponins are a major factor in the diagnostic of
      myocardial infarction. New methods have been developed to improve the accuracy of the assay
      and determine low troponin concentrations. Elecsys® (highly sensible T troponin) TnT-HS assay
      is supposed to help early detection of myocardial infarction after onset of symptoms. It
      should therefore shorten the transit time to emergencies by a more rapid intervention or a
      faster return home. The aim of the study is to compare TnT-HS assay to the standard troponin
      assay in the detection of early cardiac ischemia in patients with ACS.

      Patients with suspected ACS with 2/2 negative results of conventional troponin I assay and
      1/3 positive result of highly sensitive troponin assay will have a non invasive cardiac Rb82
      PET/CT performed within 24 hours of admission. This exam is recognized by Associations of
      cardiology for its high sensibility and specificity in coronary disease detection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chest pain of ≥ 5 minutes during the last 24 hours, or other symptoms suggestive of
             ACS (unstable angina or NSTEMI) with 2 negative standard troponin values(&lt;0.09 µg/L)

          -  age ≥ 18

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with ST- segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

          -  detection of TnI standard values &gt; 0.09 (limit of positivity) in one of two blood
             samples (T0 and T6)

          -  detection of heart disease or extra-cardiac disease that could explain the elevated
             conventional troponin values

          -  presence of major organ dysfunction, infection or major underlying medical condition
             that could compromise the patient's ability to perform a stress test for myocardial
             ischemia

          -  cancer with prognosis &lt; 6 months
