  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2- component, single center study, witch aims to evaluate the efficacy of multisite
      intracardiac echocardiography (mICE) imaging of left atrial appendage (LAA) and in detecting
      thrombus located in LAA as compared to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The study
      group will consist of patients eligible for atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedure
      (Component I) or cardioversion (Component II).

      First component will enroll 100 patients; these patients will undergo clinically indicated
      TEE &amp; cardiac catheterization procedures with ICE(AF ablation). Second component will enroll
      15-20 patients with AF or atrial flutter in whom a thrombus in LAA was detected by TEE prior
      to electrical cardioversion. The ICE probe will be located in multiple positions in the right
      atrium (RA), coronary sinus (CS), pulmonary artery (PA), right ventricular outflow tract
      (RVOT) and esophagus. This will enable the investigators to compare sensitivity and
      specificity of mICE and TEE.

      This study will examine two hypotheses in AF patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures:

      Hypothesis 1: That ICE has comparable efficacy to TEE in visualization of LAA from multiple
      positions (RA,CS,PA,RVOT and esophagus ). This will be evaluated during the component I of
      the study.

      Hypothesis 2: That ICE can identify low risk patients, CHADS Score &lt; 2,0 in whom immediate
      cardioversion during the procedure is as safe as based on conventional strategy.

    <description>Predictive value of ICE compared to TEE in visualization of morphology (area and volume of LAA) and function of LAA (emptying velocity and ejection fraction of LAA) - offline analyses will be conducted. Quality of LAA imaging will be assessed using 5-grade scale, and compared to that obtained by TEE. Grade 0 means unacceptable quality wheras grade 5 means exellent view of LAA. Exclusion of existence of thrombus in LAA by mICE will enable electrical cardioversion of AF during AF ablation procedure. That will by assessed using binary scale - YES or NO.</description>

          2. Patients with or without structural Heart Disease.

          3. Men or Women aged 18 years or older.

          4. Patients undergoing an invasive catheterization procedure including right heart
             catheterization.

          5. Patients who give an informed consent for participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in whom placement of an ICE catheter for adequate atrial visualization is
             technically not feasible (Right atrium or Esophagus).

          2. Women of child bearing potential, in whom pregnancy cannot be excluded.

          3. Patients with any medical condition or social circumstance, which in the opinion of
             the investigator, would make the patient's successful completion of the study doubtful
