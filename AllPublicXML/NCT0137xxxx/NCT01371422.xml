  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial (meaning the selection is random as when flipping a coin)
      to assess the benefit of paravertebral blockade (PVB) in Percutaneous
      nephrolithotomy/nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy/nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) is an effective treatment that offers
      maximal physical removal of large kidney stones. However, despite the minimally invasive
      nature of the procedure, postoperative pain still remains a significant concern. General
      anaesthetic (solution given to put the patient to sleep) for the procedure is routinely
      given, along with a local anaesthetic injection at the operative site (injection of
      anaesthetic solution to the incision area to reduce the pain after the procedure) and pain
      pills to reduce the pain even further after surgery. Paravertebral nerve blockade (PVB) is a
      technique for inserting anesthetic solution into an area near the vertebrae (bony segments
      that form the spinal column of humans or backbone), and is an effective method for reducing
      pain in the post operative period from a variety of surgeries.

      The investigators expect that the PVB can decrease side effects from opioids (pain
      medication) and other analgesics used post-operatively. Opioid side effects include nausea,
      vomiting, urinary retention, constipation, and drowsiness. Other side effects associated with
      anaesthetic use include peptic ulcer disease and acute renal failure. The investigators also
      expect that PVB will result in decreased post-operative pain.

    <description>The pain scores at each of the specific time will be compared between the PVB and no PVB arms. So we will look for differences in pain between the PVB and no-PVB group at one hour, than separately at 6 hours and than at 24 hours. Differences for each time will be looked at different time (at 1 hr than at 6 hrs than at 24 hours post-op).</description>

    <description>The T10, T11 and T12 paravertebral spaces on the operative side will be identified with ultrasound in all patients (Sonosite MicroMax, 2-5 MHz curvilinear probe).
In the PVB group, a 90mm 22g Tuohy needle will be inserted in-plane with the live ultrasound image over the transverse process at each of these levels and 5 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine will be injected at each level.</description>
