  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of
      MK-7145 in participants with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

      The primary hypotheses for the study were as follows:

        1. Multiple dose administration of 6-mg MK-7145 results in a reduction in systolic blood
           pressure (SBP) in male participants with mild to moderate hypertension that is superior
           to placebo, as measured by time weighted average change from baseline over 24 hours
           postdose (TWA0-24hrs) on dosing Day 28

        2. Multiple dose administration of 6-mg MK-7145 results in a reduction in SBP in male
           participants with mild to moderate hypertension that is similar to hydrochlorothiazide
           (HCTZ), as measured by TWA0-24hrs on dosing Day 28

        3. The effect of MK-7145 and HCTZ on natriuresis (UNaV) as well as SBP and diastolic blood
           pressure (DBP), both as measured by TWA0-24hrs, will be estimated

        4. Multiple dose administration of MK-7145 for 4 weeks will be generally safe and
           well-tolerated.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time-weighted Average Over 24 Hours Post Dose (TWA [0-24]) in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant had their blood pressure monitored by continuous 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on Days -1 and 28 of each treatment period. The average systolic blood pressure over the 24-hour monitoring period was calculated for baseline (Day -1) and Day 28. The difference between baseline and Day 28 was calculated and recorded.</description>

    <description>Each participant had their blood pressure monitored by continuous 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on Days -1 and 28 of each treatment period. The average diastolic blood pressure over the 24-hour monitoring period was calculated for baseline (Day -1) and Day 28.

    <description>Urine sodium (Na) levels were measured over 24-hours on Day -1 (baseline) and on Day 1. The total amount of Na excreted in the urine for Day-1 (baseline) and Day1 were calculated and the difference between the 2 values was recorded.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. The percentage of participants who experienced an AE during the study was summarized by study drug taken at the time of the AE.</description>
