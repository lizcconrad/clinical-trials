  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of hydroxyzine in the treatment
      of meal-related anxiety in adolescents and young adults 8 to 25 years of age diagnosed with
      an eating disorder who are underweight. The investigators want to find out if hydroxyzine
      given before meals will improve meal-related anxiety compared to no hydroxyzine.

      This study is a practiced-based pilot study in follow-up to clinical observations made by our
      treatment team that hydroxyzine attenuates meal-related anxiety and improves treatment
      adherence in patients with a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa (AN) (excluding the amenorrhea
      criterion) or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) specifically with low BMI (≤
      18). To our knowledge, hydroxyzine has never been formally investigated in treating
      meal-related anxiety and improving outcomes in patients with AN or EDNOS specifically with
      low BMI (≤ 18).
