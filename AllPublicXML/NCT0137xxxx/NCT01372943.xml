  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CDI (Clostridium difficile infection) causes diarrheal illness and can cause colitis which
      may be fatal. A patient being treated for CDI has a 10-25% chance of developing relapse.
      Recurrent CDI is on the rise. There are few options available to treat recurrent CDI. &quot;Stool
      transplant&quot; (infusing donor stool into the intestine of the recipient), is not very palatable
      to either patient or medical personnel. The investigators will isolate intestinal bacteria
      from donor stool and use this purified mixture of donor bacteria instead of stool transplant.
      The investigators hypothesize that this cleaner mixture of purely isolated intestinal
      bacteria from a healthy donor would be equally effective as conventional fecal
      bacteriotherapy, which uses donor stool. The use of this prepared mixture of aerobic and
      anaerobic organisms, or probiotic approach, is based on the same principle of fecal flora
      reconstitution. However our approach would provide a more controlled, reproducible, cleaner
      and more aesthetically acceptable method of administration, and from a patient safety
      perspective, would also be a safer strategy than using freshly defecated donor fecal matter.
