      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GSK573719/GW642444
      Inhalation Powder 125/25 mcg once-daily. The product will be delivered via the Novel Dry
      Powder Inhaler (nDPI) over 52 weeks to Japanese subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD). This is a multi-centre, open-label study evaluating the safety of
      GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder 125/25 mcg. Treatment will be given once-daily in the
      morning. The target enrolment is approximately 120 subjects at approximately 20 study centres
      in Japan. The total duration of subject participation will be 54-55 weeks, consisting of a
      7-14 day run-in period, 52-week treatment period and 1-week follow-up period. Subjects
      meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at screening visit
      (Visit 1) will enter 7-14 day run-in period. The run-in period is provided for completion of
      baseline safety evaluations and to obtain baseline measures of COPD status. At Visit 2,
      eligible subjects will start to take GSK573719/GW642444 125/25 mcg, and enter the treatment
      period. This treatment will be delivered via the Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (nDPI) once daily
      in the morning for 52 weeks. One nDPI will contain 30 doses of study medication. Subjects
      will be instructed to administer medication once daily in the morning for the duration of the
      52-week treatment period. Each subject should be advised to adhere to this dosing regimen
      throughout the study. There will be a total of 8 study visits including at screening (Visit
      1), initiation of treatment (Visit 2), and at 4weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks,
      52 weeks (Visit 3 through Visit 8, respectively). Follow-up (Visit 9) will be conducted by
      the phone contact approximately 1 week following the completion/withdrawal of treatment
      period. A subject will be considered to have completed the study upon completion of the last
      on-treatment visit (Visit 8). At the end of the treatment period, subjects will be prescribed
      appropriate COPD medication at the investigator's discretion.

      (Visit 1) will enter 7-14 day run-in period. The run-in period is provided for completion of
      baseline safety evaluations and to obtain baseline measures of COPD status. Cardiovascular
      medical history/risk factors will be assessed at baseline. The following information will be
      collected from subjects receiving study medication and recorded in the eCRF: demography
      (including gender, ethnic origin and date of birth, height, weight), medical history
      (including duration of COPD and smoking history), COPD exacerbation assessment (documented
      history of ≥1 COPD exacerbation that required antibiotics/systemic corticosteroids or
      hospitalization in the past 12 months), concurrent medical conditions, and concomitant
      medication. At Visit 2, eligible subjects will start to take GSK573719/GW642444 125/25 mcg,
      and enter the treatment period. This treatment will be delivered via the Novel Dry Powder
      Inhaler (nDPI) once daily in the morning for 52 weeks. One nDPI will contain 30 doses of
      study medication. Subjects will be instructed to administer medication once daily in the

      including at screening (Visit 1), initiation of treatment (Visit 2), and at 4weeks, 8 weeks,
      12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, 52 weeks (Visit 3 through Visit 8, respectively). Follow-up
      (Visit 9) will be conducted by the phone contact approximately 1 week following the
      completion/withdrawal of treatment period. A subject will be considered to have completed the
      study upon completion of the last on-treatment visit (Visit 8). At the end of the treatment
      period, subjects will be prescribed appropriate COPD medication at the investigator's
      discretion. Primary endpoint is incidence and severity of adverse events. Secondary endpoints
      are clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry), change from baseline in vital
      signs (pulse rate and systolic and diastolic pressure), and 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
      assessments. And other endpoints are change from baseline in trough Forced Expiratory Volume
      in One Second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), number of puffs of supplemental use of
      salbutamol, percentage of rescue-free days, percentage of symptom-free days, mean symptom
      scores, incidence of COPD exacerbations, and COPD device preference questionnaire.

    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs (occuring at a frequency threshold of &gt;=5%) and SAEs.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. AEs were classified according to intensity based upon the investigators' clinical judgment. The intensity was categorized as: mild (an event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities); moderate (an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities); or severe (an event that prevents normal everyday activities).</description>

      <recruitment_details>131 participants (par.) comprised the All Subjects Enrolled Population (ASEP; all par. with records in the study database). One par. in the ASEP was withdrawn due to a Good Clinical Practice violation and was thus withdrawn from the Intent-to-Treat Population (comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of study drug; n=130).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following screening and a 2-week Run-in Period, during which participants were evaluated for Baseline safety and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status, eligible participants entered a 52-week Treatment Period, followed by a Follow-up Period.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. AEs were classified according to intensity based upon the investigators' clinical judgment. The intensity was categorized as: mild (an event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities); moderate (an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities); or severe (an event that prevents normal everyday activities).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With AEs Classified by the Indicated Maximum Grade Throughout the Treatment Period</title>
          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. AEs were classified according to intensity based upon the investigators' clinical judgment. The intensity was categorized as: mild (an event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities); moderate (an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities); or severe (an event that prevents normal everyday activities).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Blood Pressure</title>
        <description>Blood pressure measurements included systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Blood pressure was measured in a sitting position after the participant was kept at rest for at least 5 minutes. Change from Baseline was calculated as the assessment value at the time of interest minus the Baseline value. The WD visit was conducted for participants who withdrew at any point during the study. The Week 24/WD visit was conducted for participants who completed the Week 24 visit or withdrew before Week 24. The Week 52/WD visit was conducted for participants who completed the Week 52 visit or withdrew before Week 52.</description>

        <description>A 12-lead ECG was recorded in a supine position after the participant was kept at rest in this position for at least 5 minutes. Data are presented as clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS) abnormal findings. An abnormal and significant ECG finding includes the presence of a QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc interval) &gt;500 milliseconds (msec) or an uncorrected QT interval &gt;600 msec, for participants with Bundle Branch Block QTc &gt;530 msec based on an average QTc value of triplicate ECGs. The study investigator determined if the abnormal ECG finding was CS or NCS. The WD visit was conducted for participants who withdrew at any point during the study. The Week 24/WD and Week 52/WD visits were conducted for participants who completed the Week 24 visit or withdrew before Week 24 and completed the Week 52 visit or withdrew before Week 52, respectively. The Baseline value for clinical laboratory tests was the value recorded on Week -2 (Screening visit).</description>
