        Patients who are obese with heart failure and will undergo gastric bypass surgery or who
        have already had gastric bypass surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects will have obesity and have a BMI &gt; 35kg/m2.

          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 35 and 65 years, in order to limit the
             confounding affect of age on our endpoints.

        To determine if potential subjects meet these criteria, they will:

          1. be interviewed,

          2. their clinical charts reviewed, by the research study coordinator and/or the PI, and

          3. undergo a history and physical by a physician (Study Day 2). Subjects who are to
             undergo gastric bypass surgery will be in the intervention arm. They will be matched
             with control subjects. We will attempt to have no more than one control subject for
             each gastric surgery subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a condition that may masquerade as diastolic heart failure will be
             excluded (see Research and Design).

          -  Subjects who are &lt; 35 or &gt; 65 years, &gt; 400lbs (the weight limit of the MRI table) not
             obese, unstable, not able to lie flat for the imaging studies, not ambulatory, unable
             to give informed consent, pregnant, lactating, with atrial flutter or fibrillation,
             current smokers, or who will undergo a different type of bariatric surgery (not
             Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) will be excluded from participation.

          -  Those who have evidence of other major systemic diseases (e.g., cancer, significant
             lung disease, creatinine &gt; 2.0mg/dL, hemoglobin &lt; 10g/dL, and liver function tests
             twice the normal range) will be excluded.

          -  Subjects who have &gt; class I hypertension will be excluded. The investigators will
             exclude patients with an LV ejection fraction &lt; 45% and those with significant
             pulmonary hypertension (peak artery pressure &gt; 55mmHg).
