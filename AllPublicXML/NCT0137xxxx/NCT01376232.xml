      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical drug-drug interaction potential of
      GSK1278863A with medications that are inhibitors of CYP2C8 enzyme in order to support
      co-administration of similar agents in later phase development. Specifically. this study will
      assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of GSK1278863A administered alone or
      co-administered with gemfibrozil, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8, following steady-state oral
      administration of gemfibrozil. Finally, to support the co-administration of GSK1278863A with
      food, this study will assess the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of GSK1278863A under
      fasting conditions and following a standard high-calorie, high fat meal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and
             estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 5 terminal half-lives post-last dose

          -  Body weight &lt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 - 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

             reference range

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be
             screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and
             benzodiazepines

          -  The values of the following tests at screening are: Serum ferritin: outside the

             anatomy or motility, and/or hepatic function-that could interfere with the absorption,
             metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Examples of conditions that could
             interfere with normal gastriointestinal anatomy or motility include cholecystectomy,
             vagotomy, malabsorption, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac sprue

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an
             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit is

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period

             Medical Monitor this will not interfere with the study procedures and compromise
             subject safety
