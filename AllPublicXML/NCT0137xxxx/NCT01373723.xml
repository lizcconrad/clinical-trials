      The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness and the costs of three types of
      population interventions to increase the number of female participants in the screening
      programmes for cancer of the cervix carried out by Primary Care in four Basic Health Care
      Areas.

      Background A high percentage of cervical cancer cases have not undergone cytological tests
      within 10 years prior to diagnosis. Different population interventions could improve coverage
      in the public system, although costs will also increase. The aim of this study was to compare
      the effectiveness and the costs of three types of population interventions to increase the
      number of female participants in the screening programmes for cancer of the cervix carried
      out by Primary Care in four basic health care areas.

      Methods A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the perspective of public health
      system including women from 30 to 70 years of age (n=20,994) with incorrect screening
      criteria from four basic health care areas in the Valles Occidental, Barcelona, Spain. The
      patients will be randomly distributed into the control group and the three Intervention
      Groups (IG1: invitation letter to participate in the screening; IG2: invitation letter and
      informative leaflet; IG3: invitation letter, informative leaflet and a phone call reminder)
      and followed for three years. Clinical effectiveness will be measured by the number of Human
      Papillomavirus (HPV), epithelial lesions and cancer of cervix cases detected. The number of
      deaths avoided will be secondary measures of effectiveness. The temporal horizon of the
      analysis will be the life expectancy of the female population in the study. Costs and
      effectiveness will be discounted at 3 %. In addition, univariate and multivariate sensitivity
      analysis will be carried out.

      Expected results IG3 is expected to be more cost-effective intervention than IG1 and IG2,
      with greater detection of HPV infections, epithelial lesions and cancer than other
      strategies, albeit at a greater cost.

      METHODS

      An economic evaluation of three populational screening strategies for cervical cancer will be
      performed. Particularly, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. These interventions
      will be compared to the current opportunistic screening strategy using data of the
      multicentre randomised trial (CRICERVA). The analysis will be conducted from the National
      Health Care System perspective.

      Design: Pragmatic, blinded, multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial with four
      branches, and a three years follow-up. The randomisation unit was Basic Health Care Area
      (BHCA).

      Setting: Primary Health Care Services (PCS) of Cerdanyola-Ripollet, province of Barcelona,
      comprising 4 municipalities and 5 BHCA. The population covered by this Primary Care Service
      (PCS) is 120,293 inhabitants over 14 years. As there are four study groups and 5 BHCAs, only
      4 BHCAs with most homogeneous socioeconomic criteria will be considered.

      Population: 20,994 women from 30 to 70 years of age with incorrect screening criteria (data
      obtained from Data Base of Primary Health Care Services) ascribed to the BHCA will be
      included in the study. Incorrect screening will be defined as [9]: 1.- No cytology in the
      last 3 years from women between 30 to 40 years, 2.- No cytology in the previous 5 years from
      women between 40 to 65 years, 3.- No previous cytology history for females older than 65
      years or women who have not had their last cytology before the age of 60. The exclusion
      criteria will be: (a) hysterectomised women, with a current history of pre-malignant lesions
      [Atypical Glandular Cells of Undetermined Significance (AGUS), Atypical Squamous Cells of
      Undetermined Significance (ASCUS), Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LSIL),
      High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (HSIL)], carcinoma in situ and cervical-uterine
      cancer, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive or other causes of immunosuppression
      (since these women follow a specific protocol); (b) those residing outside the study setting
      for more than 6 months; and (c) those ascribed to the study BHCA but with a physician
      assigned in an UBA of another zone different from the one considered in the study.

      Sample size: The sample size has been calculated based on the detection of a difference in
      effectiveness compared with the Non Intervention Group (NIG). It has been calculated by
      multiplying the size of a simple randomised design by the design effect or factor of
      inflation. For the simple randomised design, on accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta
      risk of 0.20 in a bilateral contrast, 59 subjects will be required in the first group and 59
      in the second group to detect a difference greater than or equal to 28.4 % in the screening
      coverage of the 41.6 % in the Non Intervention Group (NIG). The lost to follow up rate has
      been estimated at 20 %. The calculation of the sample has been performed with the Granmo 5.2
      computer programme for Windows. According to a review of the literature [23-25], considering
      an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05 and a mean number of 3,500 women from 30 to 70
      years of age with incorrect screening by BHCA, the design effect will be 176 and thus, 20,768
      women with incorrect screening will be required.

      ETHICAL ASPECTS The investigators are committed to respect the prevailing norms of Good
      Clinical Practice as well as the requisites of the Declaration of Helsinki and the clauses of
      general and particular ethical conditions related to the right to privacy, anonymity and
      confidentiality. Neither the first name nor surname or any other type of data indicating the
      identification of the women will be registered. Therefore, identification will be made by
      numeric codes. Since this type of study is developed in the usual clinical setting,
      authorisation and support must be and has already been granted by the representatives and
      authorities of the collectives involved and thus, individualised informed consent is not
      necessary. Nonetheless, the research team decided that women attending the consultation for
      the cytology should sign the consent form. The protocol has been evaluated by the Clinical
      Investigation Ethics Committee of the IDIAP Jordi Gol.

      LIMITATIONS Randomisation by groups will avoid the potential introduction of selection bias
      which may be produced among the interventions performed at the same site. Since the
      characteristics of the study do not allow the application of the double-blind masking
      technique, the masked response evaluation will be used to ensure that the measurement and
      interpretation of the dependent variables is carried out the same way in all groups. The
      possible loss of information, which may be produced in women doing screening outside public
      health care if they are not contacted by the research team, will be minimised with a phone
      call reminder. This will be made when the women do not attend the appointment. The language
      difficulties in women from other countries will be solved with cultural mediators at each
      site. Within the setting of the study, the administrative personnel have been updating the
      postal addresses of the users attending the BHCA since 2007 and, therefore the postal
      registry is quite precise, thereby reducing the potential loss of letters.
