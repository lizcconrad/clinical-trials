  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to perform a 36-week pilot study with a cross-over design
      to study the safety and efficacy of a novel integrative exercise program called PLIÉ
      (Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise). PLIÉ integrates elements of Eastern and
      Western exercise traditions and is specifically designed to target the muscles and movements
      needed to help individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia maintain physical function and
      independence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical function (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's physical function will be assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale (Galasko 1997). The ADCS-ADL is a 78-point scale that assesses functional ability in 23 daily activities based on informant report. It is the standard measure for assessment of functional status in AD treatment trials.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed with the Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD), which is a brief, 13-item measure that obtains input from both the individual and the caregiver (Logsdon 1999). Scores may range from 13-52 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional health and well-being (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional health and well-being will be assessed with the SF-36v2, which assesses function in eight domains and provides physical and mental component summary scores that may range from 0 to 70 (Stewart 1989). The SF-36v2 is typically administered directly to participants. However, we also will ask caregivers to answer questions on behalf of participants and will compare their answers to assess congruence. Data collected will help to determine if this measure is suitable for a larger trial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of falls (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's falls will be assessed based on caregiver report.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fall-related self-efficacy (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fall-related self-efficacy will be assessed with the Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), which is a 10-item scale that has been validated in individuals with cognitive impairment (Hauer 2010).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical performance (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical performance will be assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which was developed by the National Institute on Aging to provide an objective tool for evaluating lower extremity functioning in older adults. The test includes repeated chair stands, tandem balance testing and 8' walking speed (Guralnik 1994).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive function (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) (Rosen 1984), which is the most commonly used primary outcome measure in AD treatment trials. It is an 80-point scale that includes direct assessment of learning (word list), naming (objects), following commands, constructional Praxis (figure copying), ideational Praxis (mailing a letter), orientation (person, time, place), recognition memory and remembering test instructions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant compliance will be determined based on % of exercise classes attended from baseline to 18 weeks and from 18-36 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of adverse events from baseline to 18 weeks and from 18 weeks to 36 weeks will be monitored through biweekly telephone calls with caregivers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dementia-related behaviors (participant)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's dementia-related behaviors will be assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), which is a 144-point informant-based questionnaire that assesses 12 behavioral domains common in dementia including frequency, severity and impact on caregiver distress (Cummings 1997).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional health and well-being (caregiver)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will be asked about the functional health and well-being of themselves as well as participants using the SF-36v2, which assesses function in eight domains and provides physical and mental component summary scores that may range from 0 to 70 (Stewart 1989).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in burden (caregiver)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 weeks, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver burden will be assessed with the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), which is a 96-point scale that includes 24 items and 5 domains (Novak 1989).</description>
