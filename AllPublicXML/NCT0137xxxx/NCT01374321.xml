    <textblock>
      Objectives of the phase 2 prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is to assess safety and efficacy of TRO40303 administered just
      before balloon inflation during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for limitation of
      infarct size in patients treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

      The study is being conducted in 9 centres in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and France. One hundred
      eighty patients will be included. It will last one month per patient and its overall duration
      will be 11 months.

      The efficacy will be assessed by infarct size expressed as area under the curve for creatine
      kinase and troponin I (blood sampling at D1, D2 and D3), and also evaluated by Cardiac
      Magnetic Resonance.

      Safety will be assessed by

        -  clinic evaluation,

        -  blood samples (hematology, biochemistry, renal and hepatic function),

        -  Recording and follow-up of major adverse events occurring during the first 48h after
           reperfusion (death, heart failure, AMI, stroke, recurrent ischemia, the need for repeat
           revascularization, renal or hepatic, vascular complication and bleeding).

        -  ECG

        -  Recording cardiac events during one month after AMI

        -  Follow-up of global left ventricular function by Echocardiography at D3 and D30.

      Demographic and medical history at inclusion and non-cardiac events occurring during the
      first 30 days will be recorded. TRO40303 plasma concentration will be assessed at 15 min, 6h,
      and 12h post the end of administration.

      Sample size calculation assuming a reduction of 35% of the AUC for Troponin I release, for a
      statistical power of 85% and a probability of type I error of 0.05.

      Main analysis: between-group comparisons of AUCs for serum troponin I and CK release will be
      performed using O'Brien's method for multiple endpoints testing.

      Secondary analysis: comparisons of the CMR criteria described above will be performed using
      mixed model of ANCOVA.

      All analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set and Per protocol populations.

      Safety analysis: A comparison of the incidence of cumulative adverse clinical events between
      the groups will be performed by Fisher's exact tests.

      Subjects will undergo primary PCI and receive concomitant medications according to current
      standard of care.

      After coronary angiography is performed but just before balloon inflation is performed,
      patients who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned to either the control
      group or the TRO40303 group. Randomization is ensured by taking the treatment units in
      ascending and consecutive order in each strata (anterior/posterior as determined on ECG).
      Just before balloon inflation, ideally less than 5 minutes, and with a maximum of 15 minutes
      before balloon inflation and stenting, the patients in the TRO40303 group will receive an
      intravenous slow-bolus (35 mL/min) injection of 6 mg/kg of TRO40303 injected in peripheral
      IV. The patients in the control group will receive an equivalent volume of the placebo.
      Patients will be hospitalized for as long as there is a medical indication. CMR and
      echocardiography will accordingly be conducted as in/out patient between day 3 (ideally) and
      5. A follow-up visit will be conducted one month after PCI.
