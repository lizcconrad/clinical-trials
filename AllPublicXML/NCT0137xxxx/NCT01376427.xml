      This study proposes to provide adequate treatment and is based on current scientific evidence
      for elderly patients with ALL Bcr / Abl positive.

      To determine whether low-dose chemotherapy associated with imatinib or dasatinib has
      acceptable tolerability in elderly patients.

      To determine whether this association can increase the rate and quality of referrals to the
      results of the literature of imatinib as monotherapy for elderly patients

      Prephase (days -5 to -1) Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 bolus day EV for 5 days (-5 to -1).

      Intrathecal treatment (diagnosis and prophylactic / therapeutic) -5 days:

      Methotrexate 12 mg

      Systemic treatment:

        -  Imatinib 400 mg daily and continuous VO.

        -  Vincristine (VCR) 1 mg (absolute dose) EV 1, 8, 15 and 22.

        -  Dexamethasone (DEX): 10 mg/m2 EV, IM or PO days 1-2, 8-9 days 15-16, 22-23. .

      Intrathecal chemotherapy:

      Triple therapy was administered with methotrexate (MTX), cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) and
      hydrocortisone, days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (five doses total prophylactic between prophase and
      induction):

      MTX 12 mg ARA-C 40 mg Dexamethasone 4 mg

      Maintenance during the first year will start after full recovery after induction and after
      complete reassessment of the disease (including mielograma and Bcr-Abl/Abl or Bcr-Abl/Gus
      ratio in peripheral blood) and will last until one year from the time of complete remission.

      The basic treatment included imatinib 400 mg / day (or dasatinib), mercaptopurine at doses of
      50 mg/m2 PO day and methotrexate 20 mg/m2 IM weekly.

      One week every 3 months maintenance treatment added a &quot;mini-reinduction&quot; consisting

        -  VCR: 1 mg (absolute dose), i.v., day 1.

        -  Dexamethasone 40 mg / day, i.v. or p.o., days 1-2.

        -  not considered more doses of triple intrathecal therapy. Reinduction only be practiced
           during the first year after remission, so a total of 4 quarterly.

      Maintenance treatment of second year

      After the first year of maintenance will perform a complete reassessment of the disease
      (including myelogram) and if the patient remains in complete remission maintenance will
      continue (without reinduction) until two years from the time of diagnosis.

      Maintenance treatment of third year During the third year after complete remission imatinib
      administered alone (or dasatinib
