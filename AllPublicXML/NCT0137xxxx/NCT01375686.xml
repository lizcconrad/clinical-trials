  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will complete up to 500 subjects across 9 clinical sites to evaluate the precision
      and accuracy of SCOUT DS (Diabetes Screening) subjects at risk for type 2 diabetes. The study
      will involve up to two unique Scout devices at each clinical site. Each site will initially
      contain only a CS-1 (Commercial SCOUT 1) &quot;A&quot; for collection of data. As they become
      available, CS-1 &quot;B&quot;s operating with latest version of SCOUT software will be shipped to each
      site.

      The NSEEDS study will enroll patients at-risk for type 2 diabetes who meet the study
      inclusion criteria (and do not meet one or more of the exclusion criteria) at approximately 9
      clinical sites distributed across the United States. Eligible subjects must be at least 18
      years old, not have an existing diagnosis of diabetes and, if less than 45 years old, must
      have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 and at least one other risk factor for type 2 diabetes.

      The data will be collected and a partial area under the receiver operator curve (pAUC) will
      be computed via the method of moments between the 20% and 50% false positive rates based on
      the first valid Scout &quot;A&quot; measurement for each patient. The impaired glucose tolerance status
      will be determined by the average of the two hour, post challenge plasma glucose samples
      measured at the central laboratory. This will be compared to 1000 bootstrap re-samplings of
      the calibration data pulling a cohort that matches that collected during this study. A test
      will be conducted to assure that the SCOUT performance lies within a 95% empirical confidence
      interval based on the bootstrap re-sampling.

      Serum will be stored to later analyze lipids and insulin. This will be useful in
      understanding metabolic disorders experienced by the patients measured. These measurements
      can be used directly, or combined in a manner similar to the McAuley index to understand the
      risk of insulin insensitivity.

        In the study, volunteers age 18 and above, of either sex and of any ethnic background, will
        be recruited at up to 9 clinical sites. The number of sites may be decreased as the sponsor
        has the right to close a site due to protocol compliance or enrollment issues during the
        course of the study. All subjects will be at risk for diabetes based on the American
        Diabetes Association Standard of Care Guidelines. Subjects in the 18-44 age range must have
        a BMI &gt; 25 plus an additional risk factor for type 2 diabetes.
