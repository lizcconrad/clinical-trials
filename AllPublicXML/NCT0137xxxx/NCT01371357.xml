  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A methyl-group acceptor such as guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) could induce hyperhomocysteinemia
      with the effects of GAA expected to be dose-dependent. Due to the fact that
      hyperhomocysteinemia is thought to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and
      neurodegenerative diseases, different dietary agents were used in the past for the treatment
      of elevated total plasma homocysteine (T-HCy), e. g. betaine, choline (betaine precursor) or
      folic acid. In the context of GAA loading the question arises whether intake of betaine,
      choline (betaine precursor) or folic acid during GAA loading could affect plasma T-HCy in
      healthy humans. Forty healthy physically active men and women aged 20 to 30 years will take
      part in this GAA-controlled, double-blind and parallel-group intervention study. Subjects
      will be allocated to four randomly assigned trials, with treatment lasting for 8 weeks and
      washout period of 28 days. The 4 test treatment-groups will include TEST1 (GAA only), TEST2
      (GAA, choline, B6, B12 and folic acid), TEST3 (GAA, betaine, B6, B12 and folic acid) and
      TEST4 (GAA, B6, B12 and folic acid). Plasma T-HCy will be the primary outcome measure
      assessed every second week throughout the study. Plasma B-vitamins and blood and urine
      metabolites (GAA, creatine, methionine, arginine) will be secondary outcome measures along
      with adverse-effects indicators assessed every second week throughout the study. Selected
      body composition indicators will be obtained at 0, 2, 8 and 12 weeks throughout the study to
      monitor the effects of experimental treatments on body hydration and protein synthesis. This
      research will test the hypothesis that a combination of GAA with homocysteine lowering
      nutrients attenuates the elevation of T-hcy, and will further display the size-effect of each
      additive used.
