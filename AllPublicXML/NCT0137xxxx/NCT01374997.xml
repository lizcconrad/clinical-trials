  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a rare genetic disease characterized by an enzyme deficiency, called
      alpha-galactosidase A, which normally breaks down a lipid, is missing or does not function
      properly. As a result, the lipid accumulates in the body, this leads to multisystem
      impairment, including progressive renal failure.

      Several studies have focused on the detection of this disease in end-stage renal failure
      patients, transplant or hemodialysis.

      This study aims to diagnose the Fabry patients earlier, among men aged 18-60 years with a
      glomerular filtration rate estimated by MDRD between 60 and 15 ml/min/1, 73m2, or between 90
      and 60 ml/min/1, 73m2 in association with proteinuria greater than 0.3 g / g or creatinine
      level greater than 0,5 g/l.

      This screening will be conducted by a blood test to measure the level of alpha-galactosidase
      A activity by micromethod from samples taken from blood spots on filter paper. If this assay
      was positive, confirmation of diagnosis of Fabry disease will done the standard method:
      macrodosage of leukocytic alpha-galactosidase A activity.

      This multicenter prospective study, openly contacted in medical practice, with patient
      follow-up corresponding to the management of renal insufficiency, will be offered to all
      departments of nephrology and dialysis for adults in the Provence - Alpes - Côte d'Azur.

      The objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of Fabry disease in the target
      population and to identify previously undiagnosed patients, enabling them to benefit from
      appropriate management of their disease, including whether need enzyme replacement therapy.
