      This study is being performed to reduce unwanted abdominal fat using two different
      applicators for the Zeltiq System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the CoolFlex applicator
      compared to the performance of the eZ App 6.3 applicator in the treatment of abdominal fat in
      terms of its ability to achieve a discernable change to the contour of the treated area.

    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is the percent of reviews by the reviewers which either identify no clinically significant difference in fat reduction between the two sides of the abdomen, or identify greater fat reduction on the side of the abdomen treated with the CoolFlex applicator at 8 weeks post-treatment. It is expected that the percentage of reviews identifying no clinically significant difference between the two sides of the abdomen or identifying greater fat reduction on the side of the abdomen treated with the CoolFlex applicator at 8 weeks post-treatment will be at least 75%.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects &gt; 18 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age.

          2. Subject has clearly visible fat on the abdomen. (Figure 1)

          3. Subject has not had weight change exceeding 10 pounds in the preceding month.

          4. Subject agrees to maintain their weight (i.e., within 5 pounds) by not making any
             major changes in their diet or lifestyle during the course of the study.

          5. Subject has read and signed a written informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has had a surgical procedure(s) in the area of intended treatment.

          2. Subject has had an invasive fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction,
             abdominoplasty, mesotherapy) in the area of intended treatment.

          3. Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in the
             area of intended treatment within the past 6 months.

          4. Subject has discernable asymmetry or contour irregularity in the intended treatment
             area.

          5. Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of subcutaneous injections into
             the area of intended treatment (e.g., heparin, insulin) within the past month.

          6. Subject has a known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, or paroxysmal cold
             hemoglobinuria.

          7. Subject has a known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a
             response to cold exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.

          8. Subject has a history of bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the
             investigator's opinion may increase the subject's risk of bruising.

          9. Subject body mass index (BMI) exceeds 40. BMI is defined as weight in pounds
             multiplied by 703 divided by the square of the height in inches.

         10. Subject is taking or has taken diet pills or supplements within the past month.

         11. Subject has any dermatological conditions, such as moderate to excessive skin laxity,
             or scars in the location of the treatment sites that may interfere with the treatment
             or evaluation.

         12. Subject is pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 6 months.

         13. Subject is lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.

         14. Subject is unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements.

         15. Subject is currently enrolled in a clinical study of any other unapproved
             investigational drug or device.

         16. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the
             investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the data
             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.
