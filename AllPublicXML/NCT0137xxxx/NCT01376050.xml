      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low level laser light therapy is effective
      as an adjunctive therapy to the healing of venous stasis leg ulcers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A chronic venous stasis leg ulcer is a wound below the knee that fails to heal within 6
      weeks. Venous stasis ulcers account for 80% to 90% of all leg and foot ulcers, affecting an
      estimated 500,000-600,000 people in the United States every year. Venous stasis ulcers
      account for the loss of 2 million working days and incur treatment costs around $3 billion
      dollars annually in the United States. Standard of care for venous stasis ulcers includes
      compression of the affected leg together with daily dressing changes to minimize swelling;
      debridement of the ulcer to remove dead tissue and bacteria; and daily wound Care dressing to
      keep the wound clean. Venous stasis ulcers typically have very lengthy and poor healing
      rates, with up to 50% remaining open and unhealed for 9 months or longer. Many patients
      suffer pain and sleep and mobility problems, impairing quality of life. Recurrence rates for
      venous stasis ulcers is very high, with about one third of treated individuals experiencing 4
      or more episodes of ulceration.

      Low level laser light therapy (LLLT), with its proven tissue healing acceleration properties
      has recently gained attention as a simple, non-invasive alternative adjunctive therapy to
      assist in both wound closure and accelerated time to wound closure. Numerous histological
      trials have exhibited laser therapy's capacity to upregulate essential wound-healing factors
      such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),
      oxygen concentration, fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, re-epithelialization, and
      tissue granulation. Clinically, the application of laser therapy has demonstrated promise,
      accelerating the rate of wound healing and tissue contracture.

    <measure>Difference in the Proportion of Venous Stasis Ulcers Attaining Complete Wound Closure Between Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>'Complete wound closure' is defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements confirmed across a consecutive two-week evaluation period. Efficacy success was defined as a statistically significant greater proportion of venous stasis ulcers in the test procedure group achieving complete wound closure compared with the proportion of venous stasis ulcers in the placebo procedure group achieving complete wound closure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ulcer Size</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The study ulcer was digitally photographed, and the ulcer size/area calculated in centimeters squared (cm²) using the Aranz Medical SilhouetteMobile™ System, a portable handheld computer device with custom camera and software that enables capturing of a wound image at the point of care. The change in ulcer size from baseline to study endpoint (12 weeks) was calculated. A decrease in ulcer size indicates an improvement in the ulcer status and is positive for study success. An increase in ulcer size indicates a worsening of the ulcer status and is negative for study success.</description>

          <title>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Degree of Ulcer Pain Rating</title>
          <description>The Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) is one of the three most commonly used scales for assessing pain. The VAS scale ranges from 0 to 100 mm, with 0 indicating no pain and 100 indicating worst pain imaginable. The subject marks on the line the spot for the pain intensity, which is then measured. Subjects in this study were asked to mark the spot on the line that best represented the degree of pain they felt at the study ulcer site at that time.</description>
