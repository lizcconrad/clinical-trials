    <textblock>
      In order to compare two different forms of patient education; patients who receive Lortab
      medication or prescription during their ED visit are randomized to receive either standard
      patient education (from healthcare provider) or video assisted education. After education,
      patient completes a survey, estimated to take 5 minutes to complete.

      The purpose of this study is to compare different methods of teaching patients about their
      prescription medicines. It is possible that certain teaching methods are better than others
      at educating patients.

      Patients who receive Lortab medication or prescription during their ED visit and agree to the
      study are randomized to receive either standard patient education (from healthcare provider)
      or watch a 3 minute video. After the medication teaching has been provided the patient is
      given the medicine and a asked to complete a ten-question survey. This takes approximately
      five minutes and asks the patient to rate the quality of the information received.
