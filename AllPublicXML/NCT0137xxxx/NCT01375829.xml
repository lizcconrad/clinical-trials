    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ixabepilone and temsirolimus in
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread from the primary site to other places in
      the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Temsirolimus may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      ixabepilone together with temsirolimus may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of ixabepilone and
      temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. To describe toxicity profiles associated with the combination of ixabepilone and
      temsirolimus.

      III. To assess preliminary efficacy of the combination of ixabepilone and temsirolimus.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1 and temsirolimus IV
      over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
