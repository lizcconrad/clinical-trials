    <measure>Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of first phase 1b dose until time of last phase 1b dose (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>The recommended Phase 2 dose was the highest dose where less than 1/3 of participants experienced dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The recommended dose was determined based on a review of overall toxicity, dose reductions, omissions, and pharmacokinetic information from Phase 1b.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to date of death from any cause (up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For each participant who is not known to have died as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, overall survival duration was censored for that analysis at the date of last prior contact.</description>

    <measure>Phase 1b: Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve at Steady State From Time Zero to 24 Hours (AUC[0-24], ss) and Time Zero to Infinity (AUC[0-∞], ss)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Days 14 (predose; 0.5, 2, 3, and 6 hours post dose), 24h (Days 15) and 48h (Days 16)</time_frame>
    <description>AUC[0-24h] is a combined measure obtained from Day 14 at 0 hour (pre-dose), 0.5, 2,3, 6 hours post dose and morning doses from 24h and 48h to compute. AUC0-infinity will take 48h and extrapolation beyond this in addition to earlier time points to be calculated. All mentioned time points are used to calculate the two AUCs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of Phase 1b (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) version 1.1. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR) was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as having at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and minimum 5 mm increase above nadir; Stable Disease (SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to first date of progressive disease or death due to any cause (up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the date of randomization to the first date of progression of disease or of death from any cause. For each participant who is not known to have died or to have had a progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, PFS will be censored at the date of last prior contact. PFS will be calculated and analyzed twice: (1) including clinical progressions of disease not based on lesion measurements, and (2) excluding clinical progressions. Progression Disease (PD) was defined as having at least a 25% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Percentage Change From Baseline in Tumor Size (CTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of Cycle 2 (up to 56 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in tumor size is defined as the maximum percent change from baseline in the sum of target lesions. Change was assessed in each participant using radiographic imaging.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Overall Response Rate[ORR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate is the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.</description>

        criteria:

        For Phase 1b:

          -  Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer that is advanced
             and/or metastatic disease; that is refractory to standard therapy and/or therapies
             known to provide clinical benefit or for which no standard therapy exists; and/or in
             which gemcitabine therapy at the proposed doses and schedule would be considered
             appropriate treatment for the metastatic disease (eg, pancreatic cancer)

          -  Patients may have received prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancer-related hormone
             therapy, or other investigational therapy as treatment. There is no limit in the
             number of previous lines of therapy.

        For Phase 1b and Phase 2:

          -  Have measurable disease or non-measurable disease, defined according to Response
             Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures

          -  Have adequate organ function including: Hematologic: absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
             greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L, platelets greater than or equal to 100 x
             10^9/L, and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL. Hepatic: bilirubin less than

             Women of childbearing potential must have a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin
             (B-HCG) pregnancy test documented within 14 days prior to treatment. If condoms are
             used as a barrier contraceptive, a spermicidal agent should be added to ensure that
             pregnancy does not occur. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician

        <title>Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the date of randomization to the first date of progression of disease or of death from any cause. For each participant who is not known to have died or to have had a progression of disease as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, PFS will be censored at the date of last prior contact. PFS will be calculated and analyzed twice: (1) including clinical progressions of disease not based on lesion measurements, and (2) excluding clinical progressions. Progression Disease (PD) was defined as having at least a 25% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>

        <title>Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Overall Response Rate[ORR])</title>
        <description>Overall response rate is the best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions. Overall response rate is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR divided by the total number of participants with at least 1 measurable lesion, multiplied by 100.</description>
