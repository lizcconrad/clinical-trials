  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine what effect Cetaphil® Restoraderm® system has on
      babies' skin versus Johnson &amp; Johnson baby lotion and skin cleanser.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will randomly be divided into a group using Cetaphil® Restoraderm® system or a group
      using Johnson &amp; Johnson baby lotion and skin cleanser . At 3, 6, and 12 months non-invasive
      measurements of barrier function will be used to test the babies' skin. The procedures are as
      follows:

        -  Transepidermal loss (TEWL - measures the water loss from the skin)

        -  Skin electrical capacitance (measures how much water stays in the top layer of skin)

        -  Skin pH (measures level of pH)

        -  Skin microbiome analysis (skin swabs to check genetic code of skin bacteria)

        -  Lipidomic and natural moisturizing factor analysis (measures lipids (oils) in the top
           layer of skin)

      Both groups will be reminded to follow the instructions about general good skin care of
      infants. Subjects will be asked if they agree to provide a saliva sample. If yes, a saliva
      sample will be collected from the inside of the infant's cheek at the 6 month visit and will
      be shipped to the laboratory of Dr. Irwin McLean at the University of Dundee, where it will
      be tested for gene defects in the skin barrier that might trigger the development of eczema.
      Defects in the gene called filaggrin have been shown to increase the risk of developing
      eczema. The samples will be identified by a code to protect your infant's identity. The
      saliva samples will be stored only for this study, and then the sample will be destroyed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants up to three weeks of age born to mothers aged 18-45 years will be recruited
             for this study.

          -  Infants must have a family history of asthma, eczema, or hayfever in at least one
             first-degree relative and be in otherwise good overall health.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Preterm birth defined as birth prior to 37 weeks gestation

          -  Major congenital anomaly

          -  Hydrops fetalis

          -  Significant dermatitis at birth not including seborrheic dermatitis on the scalp
             (&quot;cradle cap&quot;)

          -  Any immunodeficiency disorder

          -  Any severe genetic skin disorder

          -  Any other serious condition that would make the use of emollients inadvisable

          -  Any other major medical problems that the investigator deems may increase the risk of
             adverse events with the intervention or in whom assessing the outcomes may be masked
             by the underlying problem or practically very difficult to assess
