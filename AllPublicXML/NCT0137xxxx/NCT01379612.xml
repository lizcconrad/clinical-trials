    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to recruit 50 rectal cancer patients planned to receive standard
      radiochemotherapy. A baseline ultrasonic elastography is performed prior to radiochemotherapy
      and followed by re-scans two and six weeks after initiation of treatment. The objective
      quantitative elastography findings are compared with the TRG score.

      The purpose is to elucidate ultrasonic elastography's ability to predict treatment response
      at an early stage by comparing quantitative ultrasound parameters before, during and after
      treatment with MR scan results and histopathological Tumor Regression Grade (TRG score) after
      operation.
