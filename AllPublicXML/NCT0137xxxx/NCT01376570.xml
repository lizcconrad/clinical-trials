  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether contingency management (monetary vouchers contingent on
      abstinence from drugs) that reinforces one behavior (achieving abstinence from drugs) leads
      to improved outcomes in other related behaviors (achieving HIV viral load suppression). In a
      randomized controlled trial, the investigators propose to test whether an
      abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention improves viral load suppression in
      HIV-infected drug users.

    <textblock>
      Using a randomized controlled study design, the investigators will test the efficacy of an
      abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention compared with a control condition
      (Performance Feedback) on HIV viral load suppression. The investigators will enroll 202
      opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals who are receiving opioid agonist treatment with
      buprenorphine or methadone, who continue to use opiates, oxycodone or cocaine (drugs that are
      consistently associated with poor HIV treatment outcomes), and who are prescribed
      antiretroviral medication, but with suboptimal viral load suppression. The contingency
      management group will have the potential to receive compensation in vouchers over the 16-week
      intervention based on drug-free urine. Participants will be followed for 28 weeks, with
      research visits occurring twice weekly during the Baseline Period (weeks 1-4) and
      Intervention Period (weeks 5-20), then every two weeks during the Post-Intervention Period
      (weeks 21-28). Data sources will include blood tests (viral load and CD4 count), urine
      toxicology tests, questionnaires, pill counts, and medical records. The primary outcome will
      be change in HIV viral load, and secondary outcomes will include CD4 count, antiretroviral
      adherence, and abstinence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV viral load</measure>
    <time_frame>Viral load will be measured every 4 weeks over the 28-week follow-up period.</time_frame>
    <description>Every 4 weeks participants will undergo phlebotomy to measure HIV viral load. Viral load will be analyzed as a continuous measure (log10 copies/ml). In secondary analyses, viral load will be analyzed dichotomously, as undetectable (&lt;45 copies/ml) or not.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CD4 count</measure>
    <time_frame>CD4 count will be measured at weeks 0, 4, 20, and 28.</time_frame>
    <description>At weeks 0, 4, 20, and 28, participants will undergo phlebotomy and CD4 count will be measured. CD4 count will be analyzed as a continuous measure and an increase of 50 cells/mm3 will be considered a clinically significant improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abstinence from opiates, oxycodone, and cocaine</measure>
    <time_frame>Abstinence will be measured twice weekly during weeks 0-20, then every two weeks during weeks 21-28.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide urine samples twice weekly during weeks 0-20, and every two weeks during weeks 21-28. Abstinence will be defined as having drug-free urine (no cocaine, oxycodone and opiates). Abstinence will be examined two different waysâ€”as the proportion of drug-free urines and the number of consecutive drug-free urines. Although urine toxicology tests will be our primary data source for measuring abstinence, we will also measure addiction severity using the Addiction Severity Index.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Antiretroviral adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Antiretroviral adherence will be measured every 4 weeks during the 28-week follow-up period</time_frame>
    <description>Antiretroviral adherence will be measured using pill counts. Adherence will be analyzed as a continuous measure, defined as the proportion of pills taken (# pills taken / # pills prescribed). Mean adherence over each 4-week period will be examined. In addition, we will also analyze adherence as a dichotomous measure (e.g., perfect [100%] adherence or not during each 4-week period).</description>

    <description>The contingency management intervention consists of participants receiving vouchers exchangeable for goods and services contingent on achieving abstinence. When participants are abstinent (urine is free of cocaine, oxycodone and opiates), they will receive a voucher. If participants are not abstinent (cocaine or oxycodone or opiates are in the urine), they will not receive a voucher. The value of vouchers increases with continued evidence of abstinence. When participants have urines with opiates or cocaine, the value of the voucher is reset. The vouchers are part of the intervention, they are not participant compensation.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive performance feedback about their drug use.
