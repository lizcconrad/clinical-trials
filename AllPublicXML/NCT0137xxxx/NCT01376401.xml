    <textblock>
      This protocol corresponds to an open-label national phase II, multicenter, to assess efficacy
      (in terms of response rate and CR) and toxicity of bendamustine, bortezomib and prednisone
      (BVP) in 60 patients newly diagnosed MM. Patients in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity receive up to 9 cycles of BVP. The patients eligible for autologous
      transplant receive four cycles of BVP, hematopoietic stem cell collection and administration
      of two cycles BVP over followed by autologous transplant.

      In addition to the overall response rates, will also be analyzed time to progression (TTP),
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.

      Finally, the results will be compared with BVP with those obtained in 120 patients included
      in our protocol VMP GEM10MAS65.

      Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits up to 3 periods of study:

      pretreatment, treatment and monitoring.

      Patients included in the study will receive a 6 week cycle consisting of Bendamustine
      administered IV at doses of 90 mg/m2 on days 1 and 4 of the first cycle and days 1 and 8 in
      subsequent cycles in combination with Bortezomib as a bolus dose of 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4,
      8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32, and oral prednisone at doses of 60 mg/m2, during the first four
      days of each cycle.

      Then, patients will receive eight additional cycles of 5-week . The same pattern consisting
      of bendamustine and prednisone but bortezomib is administered as an intravenous bolus dose of
      1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 and 22.
