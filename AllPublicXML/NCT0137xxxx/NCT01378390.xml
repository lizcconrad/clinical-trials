  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and efficacy of eASCs (expanded adult stem
      cells) for treatment of complex perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complex perianal fistulas are a source of great distress for suffers. In Crohn's disease,
      options are limited, and surgery is often associated with incontinence and recurrence.

      The biological properties of stem cells derived from adult tissues make them candidates for
      the treatment of pathologies requiring tissue regeneration or in diseases where the healing
      process is altered.

      A proof-of-concept study, a phase 1 study and a phase 2 study [Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
      NCT00115466] have all suggested that this approach is promising, even in patients whose
      fistula is associated with Crohn's disease.

      The present multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study aims to confirm the efficacy and
      safety shown in the previous phase 1 and phase 2 studies in the treatment of complex perianal
      fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease after 24 weeks from initial administration. Fistula
      closure is defined as absence of suppuration through the external orifice with complete
      re-epithelization of the external orifice and absence of collections &gt;2cm directly related to
      the fistula tract treated, as measured by MRI.

    After the investigators and experts in the field imput it became apparent that the protocol was
    not reflective of clinical reality. No safety issues reported.

    <description>Administration will be preceded by localization and closure of the internal opening. Cell treatment injection will be performed following Major Ambulatory Surgey standards. Patients will receive an intralesional dose of 20 million cells at baseline. 50% of the cell susupension will be placed into the fistula walls of the internal opening, with the remaining 50% being injected across the wall tracts of the target fistula. Patients without healing (complete fistula closure) at week 12 will receive a second dose of 40 million cells, using the same treatment approach.</description>

    <description>Administration will be preceded by localization and closure of the internal opening following Major Ambulatory Surgey standards. Subjects will be receiving one treatment cycle with placebo consisting of intralesional instillation of 5 ml saline solution. Patients without healing (complete fistula closure) following week 12 assessment will continue to receive standard of care until the primary assessment of fistula closure at week 24. Patients with incomplete fistula closure at week 24 will be offered the possibility of participating in a separate open-label, single arm study using the ASCs derived from the liposuction procedure.</description>
