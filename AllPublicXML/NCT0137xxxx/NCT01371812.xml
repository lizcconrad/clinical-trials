  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first time into human study is to investigate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GSK2239633 in healthy male subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK2239633 is a human chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) antagonist with a novel anti-inflammatory
      profile acting mainly on a subset of Th2 cells, with potential for the oral treatment of all
      severities of asthma. Inhibition of the CCR4 receptor represents a target for asthma because
      of the potential to inhibit Th2 cell chemotaxis and the subsequent effects of limiting Th2
      cell involvement in both the acute and chronic inflammatory response. Recent data in man
      suggests that the CCR4 receptor ligands (thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and
      macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)) may be important in asthma and in the development of
      Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA). This will provide a unique opportunity to
      differentiate GSK2239633 significantly from other oral non-steroidal asthma treatments. This
      study is the first administration of oral GSK2239633 in humans. Two alternating cohorts of 12
      subjects will receive 3 single, ascending doses of oral GSK2239633 or placebo. In addition,
      one cohort will receive a single dose of GSK2239633 or placebo following the standard FDA
      high fat/high calorie meal. Safety will be monitored (ECGs, telemetry, vital signs, clinical
      laboratory assessments, adverse events), and blood samples will be taken for pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic analysis.

        An average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males. One unit is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol:
        a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (125 ml) of wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
