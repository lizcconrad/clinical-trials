    <textblock>
      Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein in human body, and reports have shown that it act as
      a novel risk factor for brain and heart ischemia injury. This 5 years follow-up study will
      focus on serum adiponectin concentration, activity and isoforms in Chinese population and its
      correlation to these diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic processes,
      anti-inflammatory, vascular protective, and anti-ischemic properties. Since its 1995
      discovery, Ad has garnered considerable attention for its role in diabetic and cardiovascular
      pathology. Clinical observations have demonstrated the association of hypoadiponectinemia in
      patients with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance. There is growing
      evidence supporting Ad can act as a novel risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      injury. This 5 years follow-up study will focus on serum adiponectin concentration, activity
      and isoforms in Chinese population and its correlation to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      diseases.
