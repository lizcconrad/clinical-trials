  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of brachytherapy versus
      brachytherapy + triptorelin 22.5 mg (single injection) in subjects with recurrence of
      prostate cancer previously treated with radiotherapy. Efficacy was to be assessed by
      biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) curves from treatment initiation up to 5 years.

      Secondary objectives included comparing the following: the differences in time to progression
      of subjects receiving brachytherapy + triptorelin 22.5 mg versus subjects receiving
      brachytherapy only, the BFFS percentages between both treatment groups at 5 years from
      treatment initiation, overall survival between both treatment groups, total testosterone
      changes (from baseline visit up to 12 months) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels
      (from baseline visit up to 60 months of treatment) between both treatment groups, quality of
      life (QoL) modifications (Spanish version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite
      (EPIC) questionnaire) between the baseline score and the rest of measurements, and to compare
      safety between both treatment groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a proof-of-concept, prospective, parallel, multicentre, randomised and open-label
      trial, including a follow-up of all subjects conducted at 11 centres in Spain. Study visits
      included an inclusion visit (Visit 1), a treatment administration visit (Visit 2), and 9
      follow-up visits (Visit 3 to Visit 11) from 3 to 60 months after study treatment
      administration. All of the procedures performed at these visits were in accordance with
      routine clinical practice. Subjects were randomised to any one of the two treatment arms
      (Group 1: brachytherapy only, or Group 2: brachytherapy + triptorelin 22.5 mg). Randomisation
      was stratified according to the brachytherapy dose rate (low or high dose rate).

      Visit 1 included the collection of demographic data, a review of clinical details of prostate
      cancer and its treatment, blood sampling (for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), testosterone,
      and haematology and biochemistry parameters, as appropriate), administration of the QoL
      questionnaire and International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), and treatment group
      allocation. Visit 2 included a review of the eligibility criteria, recording of concomitant
      medications and adverse events (AEs) and study drug administration. Visits 3 to 11 included
      recording of AEs and concomitant medications, blood sampling and administration of the QoL
      questionnaire and IPSS.

      Following the selection visit (Visit 1), all subjects were scheduled to brachytherapy. Those
      subjects who were randomised to the concomitant hormone therapy group received a single dose
      of triptorelin 22.5 mg by intramuscular injection at Visit 2, 2 weeks following the selection
      visit (Visit 1), and preferably 2 months before receiving brachytherapy. One week before and
      two weeks after triptorelin administration, subjects were permitted to receive an
      anti-androgen to counteract a transient increase in testosterone levels.

      The study was prematurely stopped due to the slow enrolment of subjects. Of the planned 86
      evaluable subjects, 35 were screened, and 32 were randomised between 3 November 2011 and 26
      May 2014. The slow inclusion of subjects was due to several factors, among which there were
      changes in clinical practice which caused such subjects to be offered alternative treatments
      to brachytherapy. Due to the small number of subjects, none of the planned efficacy analyses
      were performed. Instead, the data were analysed as follows:

        -  Efficacy data and quality of life (QoL) outcomes were displayed only in listings.

        -  Safety information was displayed using listings and summary tables.

    <measure>Biochemical Failure-free Survival (BFFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>BFFS was determined by a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) increase of 2 ng/mL or more in comparison with the pre-study nadir PSA (as per the Phoenix criteria) confirmed in the course of follow-up by a second value 3 weeks later or longer over the 5-year follow-up. Time to BFFS was defined from the &quot;start date&quot; to the first time when PSA increase of 2 mL was observed.
As the study was prematurely terminated, no analyses were conducted. Data for BFFS are listed by subject for those individuals who reported biochemical failure. Time (months) to biochemical failure is relative to the date of brachytherapy.</description>

    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression (in months) was measured from the informed consent date to the date of first event occurrence. Progression was defined as either: death from all causes or disease progression (defined as PSA increased by 2 ng/mL as compared to the pre-trial nadir PSA, confirmed during follow-up by a second value after 3 or more weeks, or the diagnosis of a new clinical recurrence of their prostate cancer (metastasis, new injury, etc.)).
As the study was prematurely terminated, no analyses were conducted. Data for time to progression are listed by subject for those individuals who reported progression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time in months from diagnosis (biopsy date for local recurrence) to death due to any cause, the last visit or the loss to follow-up.
No deaths were reported during the study. As the study was prematurely terminated, no data analyses were conducted. The study was terminated prior to completion of the 5-year follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) Modifications (Spanish Version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>At every visit (except for Visit 2 (treatment administration visit))</time_frame>
    <description>EPIC assessed the disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies and comprised four summary domains (Urinary, Bowel, Sexual and Hormonal). Factor analysis supported dividing the Urinary Domain Summary Score into two different Incontinence and Irritative/Obstructive subscales. In addition, each Domain Summary Score had measurable Function Subscale and Bother Subscale components. Response options for each EPIC item formed a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores were transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better Health-Related QoL.
As the study was prematurely terminated, no data analyses were conducted. The study was terminated prior to completion of the 5-year follow-up.</description>

        <title>Biochemical Failure-free Survival (BFFS)</title>
        <description>BFFS was determined by a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) increase of 2 ng/mL or more in comparison with the pre-study nadir PSA (as per the Phoenix criteria) confirmed in the course of follow-up by a second value 3 weeks later or longer over the 5-year follow-up. Time to BFFS was defined from the “start date” to the first time when PSA increase of 2 mL was observed.
As the study was prematurely terminated, no analyses were conducted. Data for BFFS are listed by subject for those individuals who reported biochemical failure. Time (months) to biochemical failure is relative to the date of brachytherapy.</description>

        <title>BFFS Percentage 5 Years From Treatment Initiation</title>
        <description>A subject had a biochemical failure if there was an increase of PSA of 2 ng/mL or more in comparison with the pre-study nadir PSA confirmed in the course of follow-up by a second value after 3 or more weeks or with diagnosis of a new clinical recurrence of their prostate cancer over the 5-year follow-up.
As the study was prematurely terminated, no data analyses were conducted. The study was terminated prior to completion of the 5-year follow-up.</description>

        <description>Overall survival was defined as the time in months from diagnosis (biopsy date for local recurrence) to death due to any cause, the last visit or the loss to follow-up.
No deaths were reported during the study. As the study was prematurely terminated, no data analyses were conducted. The study was terminated prior to completion of the 5-year follow-up.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life (QoL) Modifications (Spanish Version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Questionnaire)</title>
        <description>EPIC assessed the disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies and comprised four summary domains (Urinary, Bowel, Sexual and Hormonal). Factor analysis supported dividing the Urinary Domain Summary Score into two different Incontinence and Irritative/Obstructive subscales. In addition, each Domain Summary Score had measurable Function Subscale and Bother Subscale components. Response options for each EPIC item formed a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores were transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better Health-Related QoL.
As the study was prematurely terminated, no data analyses were conducted. The study was terminated prior to completion of the 5-year follow-up.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were monitored from the moment the subject gave informed consent up to study completion.</time_frame>
      <desc>AEs were elicited by means of direct, non-leading questioning or by spontaneous reporting. Due to the planned study duration (5 years) and that only half of the subjects were to be treated with the study drug, if an AE was attributable to the subject's disease (prostate cancer) and was not study drug-related, or was not unusual in severity or presentation, it was not necessary to report it as an event beyond the study treatment phase (7 months after informed consent).</desc>
