  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-endorphins, which are naturally occurring narcotic substances, have been shown to alter
      the perception of breathlessness. Oral ketoconazole, an antifungal antibiotic, increases
      blood levels of beta-endorphins. The study hypothesis is that oral ketoconazole will reduce
      ratings of breathlessness induced by resistive breathing loads.

    <textblock>
      Beta-endorphins are naturally occurring narcotic substances (like morphine) that are released
      by the brain under stressful conditions, such as exercise and when breathing through a
      resistive load (a tube containing fine wire mesh). In one study of 8 patients with coronary
      artery disease, ketoconazole, an oral medication used to treat fungal infections, was
      administered (1,200 mg at 12 midnight and 600 mg at 6 am) and increased blood levels of
      beta-endorphins five fold. In a recent study performed at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center,
      we found that ketoconazole increased blood levels of beta-endorphins in all eight patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mean values increased by 2.5 times at four
      hours compared with baseline values (p = 0.0078). Based on this significant response, we
      propose to study the effect of ketoconazole on patients' perception of breathlessness induced
      by resistive breathing loads in a randomized clinical trial. The hypothesis of the study is
      that ketoconazole will reduce ratings of breathlessness as mediated by the increased levels
      of beta-endorphins.

    <description>The average of all ratings for the unpleasantness of breathlessness at equivalent times for each subject during Resistive Load Breathing (RLB). For example, if 1 subject provided 6 ratings during 6 minutes of RLB with Ketoconazole and 10 ratings during 10 minutes of RLB with inert powder, then ratings for unpleasantness through 6 minutes were used for analysis for that patient. This approach was used for all subjects to yield a total of 252 ratings for Ketoconazole and for inert powder.
Subject rating of intensity of unpleasantness was obtained during RLB on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale anchored at the bottom by &quot;No Unpleasantness&quot; and at the top by &quot;Greatest Unpleasantness&quot;.</description>

        <title>Intensity of Breathlessness</title>
        <description>The average of all ratings for the intensity of breathlessness at equivalent times for each subject during Resistive Load Breathing (RLB). For example, if 1 subject provided 6 ratings during 6 minutes of RLB with Ketoconazole and 10 ratings during 10 minutes of RLB with inert powder, then ratings for intensity through 6 minutes were used for analysis for that patient. This approach was used for all subjects to yield a total of 252 ratings for Ketoconazole and for inert powder.
Subject rating of intensity of breathlessness was obtained at 1 minute intervals during RLB on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale anchored at the bottom by &quot;No Intensity&quot; and at the top by &quot;Greatest Intensity&quot;.</description>
