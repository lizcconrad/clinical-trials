    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate, faith-placed
      lay health advisor intervention aimed at increasing fruit and vegetable intake and physical
      activity among intergenerational Appalachian individuals and families.

      The developmental phase of this project incorporated community based participatory research
      (CBPR) principles to identify the needs and preferences of community members with regard to
      energy balance. In the intervention phase, this group-randomized trial administers and
      evaluates an intergenerational, culturally appropriate energy balance intervention aimed at
      increasing fruit and vegetable intake and increasing physical activity among participants in
      6 distressed Appalachian counties. Faith institutions are recruited and randomized to
      treatment or wait-list control conditions, and participants are recruited and enrolled within
      those institutions. Focusing on Appalachian children, parents, and grandparents, local lay
      health advisors deliver a series of group presentations, adapted from We Can! and Media Smart
      Youth. In addition, the project provides culturally consonant leave-behind &quot;booster&quot;
      activities, including square dances, cooking classes, and community gardens.

    <measure>Change in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed approximately 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of fruit and vegetable intake is measured using an FFQ, pretested in focus groups comprised of members of the target population. Positive change (i.e., increasing fruit and vegetable intake) from baseline to post-test will be coded as &quot;1,&quot; while negative or no change will be coded &quot;0.&quot; This assessment occurs after the Early Treatment group has completed the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-reported physical activity from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at approximately 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of physical activity is measured using instruments with demonstrated reliability and validity, pretested in focus groups comprised of members of the target population. Positive change (i.e., increasing physical activity) from baseline to post-test will be coded as &quot;1,&quot; while negative or no change will be coded &quot;0.&quot; This assessment occurs after the Early Treatment group has completed the intervention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body mass index (BMI) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at approximately 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Positive change (i.e., decreasing BMI when indicated, or maintaining BMI when not indicated) from baseline to post-test will be coded as &quot;1,&quot; while negative or no change will be coded &quot;0.&quot; This assessment occurs after the Early Treatment group has completed the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stage of readiness to change each health behavior (i.e., fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed approximately 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Stage of readiness to change is measured using instruments with demonstrated reliability and validity, pretested in focus groups comprised of members of the target population. Positive change in stage of readiness from baseline to post-test will be coded as &quot;1,&quot; while negative or no change will be coded &quot;0.&quot; This assessment occurs after the Early Treatment group has completed the intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of visits completed</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This process measure will reflect the number of visits/classes attended by participants, as a means of assessing participation rate and feasibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention (i.e., number of participants who complete all planned assessment timepoints)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately one year after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Retention numbers will be assessed as a process measure outcome. Participants who complete all study assessment timepoints will be coded as &quot;1,&quot; while participants who drop out will be coded &quot;0.&quot; Number/percentage of participants who remained enrolled and complete all study procedures and assessments will be used as an indicator of feasibility in the community setting.</description>
