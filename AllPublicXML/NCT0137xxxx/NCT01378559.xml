    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess patient satisfaction with the Titan one touch release
      penis prosthesis and to register complications with this prosthesis. This will regard the
      first prostheses inserted at Herlev Hospital/Frederikssund Hospital.

      Patient satisfaction will be assessed by mailing out the &quot;Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of
      Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) Questionnaire&quot; and recording the patient answers. The most
      important question will be &quot;Overall how satisfied are you with penile prosthesis?&quot;.

      Complications (including infection, bleeding, and mechanical failure) will be assessed by a
      patient chart review and confirmed by a brief phone interview.
