  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photozig and Stanford University are creating a program to help cope with caregiving,
      alleviate related stress, and enhance quality of life for caregivers, with funding from the
      National Institute on Aging. This home-based program includes a free DVD, printed materials,
      and resource website. In addition, after completing the program, participants will have free
      access to final online resources for 1 year. There are no face-to-face meetings, and
      participants can live anywhere in the United States.

      The goal of this study is to develop the iCare Program, a DVD/online video training that
      builds skills and stimulates practice. We are evaluating different materials, which may
      encourage caregiver participation, enable user interaction, and promote better assimilation
      of concepts. We are designing the program to help to enhance caregivers' skills to deal with
      demanding tasks of caregiving, alleviate related stress, and improve quality of life.

      Research Program Steps:

        1. Caregivers will be asked some simple questions about themselves and their family members
           to see if they are eligible for the project (fill out Enrollment Form and Informed
           Consent).

        2. A Program survey will be sent, which can be completed online, or returned in a
           pre-mailed envelope.

        3. A DVD, materials, link to our website, login information, and instructions will be
           mailed to participants. We ask participants to watch the DVD, read printed materials,
           use the website, and follow instructions. Materials are expected to help participants in
           their caregiver role.

        4. After completing the program, the second and final survey should be filled out online or
           returned by pre-mailed envelope.

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Perceived Stress Scale&quot; measures the overall level of stress. This instrument contains 10 items accessing overall appraisals of stress in the past month. The scale refers to the caregiver. Minimum score (best value)=0. Maximum score (worst value)=40. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the type/number of dementia patients disturbing behaviors, and how much they bother caregivers with 24 items describing possible troublesome behaviors that the patient might evidence in the past month. Caregivers are first asked whether the dementia patient had displayed any of these in the time period, and secondly to rate on a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 4= extremely) how much this &quot;bothered or upset&quot; them. A &quot;conditional bother&quot; score is calculated which is the &quot;upset&quot; or &quot;bother&quot; ratings for only the problematic behavior that occurred. The scale refers to the caregiver. Minimum score (best value)=0. Maximum score (worst value)=4. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Perceived Quality of Life&quot; (PQoL instrument) measures quality of life by the evaluation of major categories of fundamental life needs. This measure was developed using a normative sample of older individuals, and has been used in a number of studies investigating the effects of chronic disorders on the perceived quality of life. The scale contains items describing level of satisfaction with needs and resources in various categories. The scale refers to the caregiver. Minimum (worst value) = 0. Maximum score (best value=10. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>This scale measures the type/number of dementia patients disturbing behaviors, and how much they bother caregivers with 24 items describing possible troublesome behaviors that the patient might evidence in the past month. Caregivers are first asked whether the dementia patient had displayed any of these in the time period, and secondly to rate on a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 4= extremely) how much this &quot;bothered or upset&quot; them. A &quot;conditional bother&quot; score is calculated which is the &quot;upset&quot; or &quot;bother&quot; ratings for only the problematic behavior that occurred. The scale refers to the caregiver. Minimum score (best value)=0. Maximum score (worst value)=4. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The &quot;Perceived Quality of Life&quot; (PQoL instrument) measures quality of life by the evaluation of major categories of fundamental life needs. This measure was developed using a normative sample of older individuals, and has been used in a number of studies investigating the effects of chronic disorders on the perceived quality of life. The scale contains items describing level of satisfaction with needs and resources in various categories. The scale refers to the caregiver. Minimum (worst value) = 0. Maximum score (best value=10. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
