  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and pharmacology of single
      administrations of AVI-7100, a candidate treatment for influenza.

    <textblock>
      Influenza A, a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, is composed of a
      negative-sense,single-stranded and segmented ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome. An urgent need
      exists for new forms of treatment for influenza A based on (a) the known propensity of this
      virus to undergo both continuous low-level antigenic drift and less frequent but
      unpredictable major antigenic shift leading to pandemic disease, (b) the clear failure of
      vaccination, even when strains are reasonably matched, to prevent influenza-related illness
      in a significant proportion of vaccine recipients, and (c) the increased frequency of
      resistance to approved forms of therapy for influenza (eg, the adamantane derivatives and,
      more recently, the NA inhibitor, oseltamivir). AVI-7100 is an experimental phosphorodiamidate
      morpholino antisense oligomers with positive charges on selected subunits (PMOplus™).
      AVI-7100 specifically targets viral messenger RNA sequences. The present study is designed to
      characterize the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating
      single-administration doses of AVI-7100 in healthy human subjects.
