  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to prospectively compare outcomes (functional, quality of
      life, risk-adjusted clinical event) of medical management, surgical or endovascular
      (angioplasty or stent placement) interventions for the treatment of claudication caused by
      peripheral arterial disease. This study will test two major hypotheses;

      Hypothesis 1: At 12-months, surgical interventions are associated with greater improvements
      in function, claudication symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than
      endovascular procedures or medical management.

      Hypothesis 2: At 12-months, surgical and endovascular interventions are associated with
      greater improvements in function, claudication symptoms, and HRQoL than medical management.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study, and the outcome on which the study is powered, is the change in score on the WIQ from the baseline assessment to the 12-month assessment. There are three subscales within the WIQ; summary scores will be calculated separately for each - the walk distance, walk speed, stair climb.</description>

          2. Be undergoing one of three treatments for claudication:

               -  Surgical bypass (use of synthetic or endogenous (vein) or composite graft to
                  treat lesions in the superficial femoral, common femoral or popliteal artery)

               -  Endovascular therapy (angioplasty and/or stent to treat lesions in the
                  superficial femoral, common femoral or popliteal artery)

               -  Medical management (i.e. smoking cessation, walking therapy, long-term monitoring
                  by physician)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. those with documented acute ischemia, rest pain or ulceration

          2. those with claudication determined to be of aortic or iliac origin

          3. those with claudication that is not caused by atherosclerotic disease

          4. those without access to a telephone or Internet and are unwilling to participate in
             surveys by mail at home (assess in patient screen)
