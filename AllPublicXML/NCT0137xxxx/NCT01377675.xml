  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves the development and evaluation of a web-based, interactive education
      program on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for primary care clinicians.

      The research questions that this proposal addresses include:

        1. Can an interactive, web-based COPD course be developed to disseminate evidence-based,
           best practice recommendations to primary care clinicians?

        2. Can assessment tools be developed to evaluate the impact of the program on clinician
           behavior in clinical practice and on patient care?
