      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. To conduct a randomized block experiment to test the effectiveness of different models
           of the seamless supervision/treatment system and traditional criminal justice
           supervision on reducing recidivism and drug use, and improving social adjustment among
           offenders;

        2. To understand the differential impacts based on offender risk factors (e.g., propensity
           to engage in further criminal behavior) on criminal justice outcomes and to determine
           whether differences found between seamless and traditional system participants are
           moderated by offender risk level;

        3. To understand differential treatment and social adjustment outcomes (e.g., treatment
           progress, employment status) of different types of offenders participating in various
           treatment services; and

        4. To examine levels of systems and service integration between the supervision and
           treatment systems pre- and post-intervention and to measure the impact of integration on
           outcomes over time.
