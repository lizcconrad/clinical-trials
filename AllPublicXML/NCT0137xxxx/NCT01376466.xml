      The aim of this study is to

        1. evaluate CT scan validity for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

        2. compare the difference in evaluation of CT-scan result between radiologist on call and
           consultant radiologist with CT experience.

        3. illustrate difficulties associated with practical implementation of CT-scan in relation
           to other activities in radiology department and O.R. (logical &amp; organizational).

        4. illustrate patients experiences about the study (pain, discomfort &amp; other information
