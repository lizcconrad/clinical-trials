  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown there wasn't inevitable relationship between mismatch area and
      infarct growth according to Volumetric-subtraction mismatch volume.The recently published on
      Stroke paper has proposed Coregistration mismatch to calculate the mismatch to replace
      ischaemic penumbra, and it reignites hope for clinical application of the PWI/DWI mismatch.
      But the correlation between the mismatch, calculated by Coregistration mismatch method,and
      the clinical outcome of the patients with acute ischemic stroke is still unknown. so the
      investigators plan to conduct a prospective observational cohort study.

      NIHSS,mRS and MR PWI/DWI/MRA are performed within 48 hours of stroke onset and final MR
      T2/flair image at ≈1 month. And then,Volumetric-subtraction mismatch and Coregistered
      mismatch will be calculated,respectively.finally,we will assess and compare the
      Volumetric-subtraction mismatch and Coregistered mismatch, and to clarify which method match
      the clinical outcome more better.
