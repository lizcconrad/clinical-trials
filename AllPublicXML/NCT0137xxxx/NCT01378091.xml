      Primary objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of daily lenalidomide and docetaxel given
      every three weeks and prednisone, as combination therapy to subjects with androgen
      independent prostate cancer

      To evaluate the safety profile of the combination of daily lenalidomide and every three week
      docetaxel and prednisone when given to subjects with androgen independent prostate cancer

      Secondary objective:

      To explore the anti-tumor activity of the combination of daily lenalidomide and every 3 week
      docetaxel and prednisone when given to subjects with androgen independent prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. There is
      medication available to help treat this disease, which typically lengthens life by 10 to 12
      months. More recent studies have shown average survivals of 20 to 23 months.

      The investigators hope that the experimental (research) drug called lenalidomide (Revlimid®),
      which is being used in this study, will lengthen the lives of these patients by even more
      time. A different drug in the same drug family has demonstrated activity against a variety of
      solid tumors as well as hematological malignances. It works against cancer in different ways
      than chemotherapy by affecting the immune system (the body's ability to naturally fight
      disease).

      The investigators believe that the study drug helps build up patients' immune systems than
      some of the other popular drugs on the market, and may potentially increase survival rates
      for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent document.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years at the time of signing informed consent form.

          -  Histological documentation of prostate cancer.

          -  Subjects must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          -  Radiographic or clinical evidence of measurable or evaluable androgen independent
             prostate cancer stages D1 or D2.

          -  Patients must be surgically or medically castrated. If the method is medical
             castration, the patient must have a serum testosterone level of &lt;50 ng/dl/. The
             patient should maintain treatment with LH RH antagonists or agonists.

          -  Patients must have metastatic prostate cancer unresponsive or refractory to androgen
             blockade by one or more of the following criteria:

               -  Progression of unidimensionally measurable disease.

               -  Progression of non measurable disease

               -  Rising PSA (absolute value of PSA &gt; 5 mg/ml).

               -  Rising PSA is defined as at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA to be documented
                  over the reference value (measure 1). The first rising PSA (measure 2) must be
                  taken at least 7 days after the reference value. A third confirmatory PSA is
                  required, and it must be obtained at least seven days after the second measure.
                  If the third measure does not confirm the rise in PSA, a fourth PSA measure is
                  required to be taken to confirm the rise over the second measure.

          -  Patients who were treated with antiandrogens such as flutamide, or other hormonal
             agents such as estrogens, or ketoconazole must have been stopped for at least 28 days
             prior to enrollment. In the case of nilandron and bicalutamide, treatment with these
             agents must have stopped at least 42 days prior to treatment. If the patient is being
             treated with corticosteroids, the dose should be stable for 14 days prior to study
             entry

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤2 (Appendix I: ECOG Performance Status Scale).

          -  Regarding Lenalidomide: Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact
             with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All patients must be
             counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal
             exposure. See Appendix V: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and
             Acceptable Birth Control Methods, AND also Appendix VI: Education and Counseling
             Guidance Document.

          -  Laboratory values as indicated below:

               -  Serum Creatinine &lt;2.0 mg/dL

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥1,500/mm3 (or 1.5 X109/L)

               -  Platelet Count &gt;100,000/mm3 (or 100 x 109/L)

               -  Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Alkaline Phosphatase &lt; 2.5 x ULN (In the absence of liver metastasis, elevated
                  alk phos due to bone mets is permitted)

               -  Conjugated Bilirubin &lt; ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious medical condition or psychiatric illness that places the subject at an
             unacceptable risk for study participation or would prevent the subject from signing
             the informed consent.

          -  More than 2 prior regimens of chemotherapy.

          -  Use of thalidomide or biologic response modifier therapy within 28 days of initiation
             of therapy

          -  Prior desquamating rash while taking thalidomide therapy.

          -  Prior &gt; grade-2 allergic reaction to thalidomide.
