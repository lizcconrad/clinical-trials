      The primary aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of a worksite intervention for
      reducing daily sedentary time and improving risk factors for cardiometabolic disease (e.g.,
      measures of adiposity, anthropometrics, cardiorespiratory fitness) among sedentary,
      overweight, full-time working adults as compared to a waitlist control. A secondary aim will
      be to test pedal time at work as a measure of compliance with the intervention.

      Recent research indicates prolonged sedentary behaviors such as computer use and workplace
      sitting are particularly damaging resulting in increased risk for chronic diseases such as
      cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Few interventions have been tested with
      the specific purpose of reducing sedentary time to improve risk factors for cardiometabolic
      diseases. The primary aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of a worksite
      intervention for reducing daily sedentary time and improving risk factors for cardiometabolic
      disease (e.g., measures of adiposity, anthropometrics, cardiorespiratory fitness) among
      sedentary, overweight, full-time working adults as compared to a waitlist control. A
      secondary aim will be to test pedal time at work as a measure of compliance with the
      intervention. Participants will be followed for 12 weeks and randomized to either a treatment
      or wait list control group which will have the option to crossover into the intervention
      after 12 weeks.

             per week)

          -  Working full time (35+ hours/week) at a sedentary desk dependant occupation

          -  Overweight (Body Mass Index &gt; 25.0 kg/m2 but less than 40.0 kg/2)

          -  Apparently healthy as assessed by a health history screening survey

             neurological diseases

          -  Free from exercise/physical activity limitations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults with significant health problems exacerbated by exercise, such as uncontrolled
             hypertension, diabetes, orthopedic limitations, etc. will be excluded from the study.
             Note, with physician approval and adequate control of these health problems, these
             conditions will not necessarily preclude participation.
