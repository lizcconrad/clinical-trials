  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to compare the efficacy of plasma exchange treatment with using two
      different citrates ( 4% and 15% ) as anticoagulants in plasma exchange treatment.

      The efficacy of plasma exchange treatment is better with using 15% trisodium citrate as
      anticoagulant during the plasma exchange procedure.

    <textblock>
      To compare the elimination rate of immunoglobulins in plasma exchange treatment by using two
      differently concentrated citrates for anticoagulation during plasma exchange procedure. At
      the same time we want to compare acid-base , electrolyte status and anticoagulation protocol
      in two citrate groups.
