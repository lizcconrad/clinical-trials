  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of sanofi pasteur's CYD dengue vaccine in
      preventing symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue cases for dengue-endemic areas of Latin
      America.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the efficacy of CYD dengue vaccine after 3 vaccinations at 0, 6, and 12 months in
      preventing symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue cases, regardless of the severity, due
      to any of the four serotypes in children and adolescents aged 9 to 16 years at the time of
      inclusion.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To describe the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs), including SAEs of special
      interest in all subjects throughout the trial period.

      To describe the efficacy of CYD dengue vaccine after each dose in:

        -  Preventing symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue cases due to any of the four
           serotypes

        -  Preventing symptomatic dengue cases, either virologically-confirmed or probable based on
           serological criteria, due to any of the four serotypes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to either receive a total of 3 injections of CYD dengue
      vaccine or a placebo at 0, 6, and 12 months, respectively.

      A subset of participants from each country will also be evaluated for reactogenicity and
      immunogenicity to enable the generation of country-specific data on reactogenicity,
      immunogenicity, and baseline dengue and yellow fewer antibody levels.
