  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physiopathology of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is unclear. To investigate risk factor, the
      investigators choose to look about some oxidative stress genes. Today a one-gene explanation
      is not really possible. So the theory of some genetic predisposition to DN is more likely.

      The aim of the study is to look about the association of the C282T polymorphism of P22phox, a
      sub unit of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH oxidase) in the
      occurrence of DN. To follow the oxidative stress pathway of the DN, the investigators also
      investigate three other polymorphisms: -429 T/C, -374 T/A polymorphism of advanced glycation
      end-products receptor (AGER) and the p.Arg261Gln polymorphism of the 12 lipoxygenase (ALOX
      12). Discordant data suggest a link between the first 2 polymorphisms and DN. The last
      polymorphism is correlated to albuminuria in diabetic patients.

      To avoid confounding factors, we choose type 1 diabetic patients. We plan, with the data of
      literature a number need to be significative with a power of 80% and an Alpha risk at 5%, the
      inclusion of 160 patients for our primary analyze of p 22 phox. Those patients are included
      consequentially from the diabetic consultation of the university hospital of Grenoble, if
      they have a history of more than 20 years of diabetes. Those patients have been separated
      according to the existence of DN, and their polymorphism. Then we estimate with the Fisher
      test the prevalence of DN in risky patient, and the prevalence of the risky phenotype in the
      nephropathic patients. Then we investigate with the same statistical test the -429 T/C,he
      -374 T/A AGER and p.Arg261Gln 12 ALOX polymorphisms.
