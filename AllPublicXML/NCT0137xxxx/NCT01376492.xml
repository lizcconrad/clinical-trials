  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the relationship between performance of patients
      with schizophrenia and relationship with perceived quality of sleep. The secondary objectives
      are: to establish the prevalence of schizophrenic patients reporting sleep disturbances; to
      assess the potential epidemiological risk factors associated with the perceived impairment of
      quality of sleep; to establish the relationship between the clinical condition and the
      quality of sleep perceived; to assess the performance level of patients.

      This is a multicenter, cross-sectional, epidemiological study in the daily clinical practice
      on the relationship between personal and social functionality and quality of sleep perceived
      in outpatients with schizophrenia. It is proposed to perform a simple screening for detecting
      schizophrenic patients reporting sleep disturbances. These patients will be assessed in a
      single visit and will be administered a number of quality of life and functional assessment
      scales. N/A
