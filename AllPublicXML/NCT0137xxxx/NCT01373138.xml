      The objective of this study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of Dr. Reddy's
      Laboratories Ltd., India, desloratadine-pseudoephedrine and Schering Corporation,
      U.S.A.(Clarinex-D® 24-HOUR), desloratadine-pseudoephedrine, administered as a 1 x 5 mg/240 mg
      extended-release tablet under fasting conditions. The treatment phases were separated by a
      washout period of 14 days. 34 subjects(19 males and 15 females) were dosed and were enrolled
      in the study; 31 of these enrolled subjects completed the study.
