    <textblock>
      Pregabalin is used for the treatment of neuropathic pain and has shown analgesic efficacy in
      postoperative pain. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for reducing postoperative pain in
      patients after septoplasty. Persons who scheduled for elective septoplasty under general
      anesthesia were randomly assigned to groups that received either pregabalin (150 mg twice) or
      placebo, one hour before surgery and 12 hours after the initial dose. Assessments of pain
      (verbal numerical rating scale) and side effects were performed at one, six, 12, and 24 hours
      postoperatively.

      Pregabalin is used for the treatment of neuropathic pain and has shown analgesic efficacy in
      postoperative pain. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for reducing postoperative pain in
      patients after septoplasty. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to
      receive either pregabalin (Lyrica®, Pfizer, Inc.) or placebo (vitamin complex). According to
      their assigned study group, patients received either pregabalin (75 mg) or placebo twice, one
      hour before surgery and 12 hours after the initial dose. The assessment of pain and side
      effects, such as nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, sedation, and blurred vision, were
      made at one, six, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively.
