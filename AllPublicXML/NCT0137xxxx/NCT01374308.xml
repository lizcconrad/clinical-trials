    <textblock>
      The general objective of the present clinical trial is to compare the therapeutic efficacy of
      a combination therapeutic vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and
      hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) [later called NASVAC] with a commonly used antiviral drug,
      pegylated interferon in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To collect and assess data on the therapeutic potential of the NASVAC in CHB patients
      regarding:

      Reduction of the serum HBV DNA levels. Reduction in the levels of alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT) Clearance of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) Negativation or lowering of HBsAg
      Anti-HBsAg/anti-HBeAg seroconversion

      An additional objective of this study is to reconfirm the safety of NASVAC in CHB patients
      that has previously been shown by us in Phase I-II clinical trial in CHB patients.
