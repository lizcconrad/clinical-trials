  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a four-period crossover study to assess the glycemic effects of a single dose of
      oxyntomodulin (OXM) on the glucose levels in participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences consisting of 4
      treatment periods, with a 7-day wash-out between each treatment period. The primary
      hypothesis was that during graded glucose infusion (GGI) oxyntomodulin (OXM) is neutral or
      better than placebo (Pbo) at lowering ambient plasma glucose levels, and at significantly
      enhancing insulin secretion.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time-weighted Average of Glucose Measured by Area Under the Curve (AUC) After a Single Dose of Oxyntomodulin (OXM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and during GGI at time points 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 165 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants received on Day (-1) an overnight intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin titrated to achieve baseline fasting plasma glucose on Day 1 of between 90 and 130 mg/dL. Participants also received on Day (-1) a single dose of liraglutide (Lg) or placebo for Lg, after which insulin infusion was discontinued. Following overnight fast, participants received on Day 1 OXM or placebo for OXM, accompanied by up to 160 minutes of graded glucose infusion (GGI). During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting approximately 40 minutes. Glucose levels were measured from blood collected at baseline and during GGI at the following minutes: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 165 in order to calculate the time-weighted average change from baseline in glucose AUC from 0-160 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants received on Day (-1) an overnight IV infusion of insulin titrated to achieve baseline fasting plasma glucose on Day 1 of between 90 and 130 mg/dL. Participants also received on Day (-1) a single dose of Lg or placebo for Lg, after which insulin infusion was discontinued.

During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting approximately 40 minutes. Glucose levels were measured from blood collected at baseline and during GGI to determine the maximum ambient glucose concentration above baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Beta Cell Sensitivity to Glucose (Φ) After a Single Dose of OXM</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to160 minutes after start of GGI</time_frame>
    <description>Beta cell sensitivity measures the ability to mount an insulin secretory response relative to the level of ambient plasma glucose. Participants received on Day (-1) an overnight IV infusion of insulin titrated to achieve baseline fasting plasma glucose on Day 1 of between 90 and 130 mg/dL. Participants also received on Day (-1) a single dose of Lg or placebo for Lg, after which insulin infusion was discontinued. Following overnight fast, participants received on Day 1 a single dose of OXM or placebo for OXM, accompanied by up to 160 minutes of GGI. During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting 40 minutes. Glucose (G), insulin and C-peptide levels were measured from blood collected at baseline and during GGI, with the decay in C-peptide concentration used to indirectly estimate the Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR). Beta Cell Sensitivity (Φ) was determined from the regression of the ISR on ambient plasma glucose (G).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 160 minutes after start of GGI at each placebo treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The reproducibility of insulinotrophic effects was compared after two separate placebo treatment periods within the same treatment sequence. Participants received on Day (-1) an overnight IV infusion of insulin titrated to achieve baseline fasting plasma glucose on Day 1 of between 90 and 130 mg/dL. Participants also received on Day (-1) a single subcutaneous dose of placebo for Lg, after which insulin infusion was discontinued. Following overnight fast, participants received on Day 1 placebo for OXM, accompanied by up to 160 minutes of GGI. During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting approximately 40 minutes. Over these two treatment periods glucose (G), insulin and C-peptide levels were measured from blood collected at the highest glucose infusion rate; with the decay in C-peptide concentration used to indirectly estimate the Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR), and hence to determine the insulinotrophic effect, ISR/G.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Time-weighted Average of Glucose Measured by Area Under the Curve (AUC) After a Single Dose of Oxyntomodulin (OXM)</title>
        <description>Participants received on Day (-1) an overnight intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin titrated to achieve baseline fasting plasma glucose on Day 1 of between 90 and 130 mg/dL. Participants also received on Day (-1) a single dose of liraglutide (Lg) or placebo for Lg, after which insulin infusion was discontinued. Following overnight fast, participants received on Day 1 OXM or placebo for OXM, accompanied by up to 160 minutes of graded glucose infusion (GGI). During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting approximately 40 minutes. Glucose levels were measured from blood collected at baseline and during GGI at the following minutes: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 165 in order to calculate the time-weighted average change from baseline in glucose AUC from 0-160 minutes.</description>

        <description>Participants received on Day (-1) an overnight IV infusion of insulin titrated to achieve baseline fasting plasma glucose on Day 1 of between 90 and 130 mg/dL. Participants also received on Day (-1) a single dose of Lg or placebo for Lg, after which insulin infusion was discontinued. Following overnight fast, participants received on Day 1 OXM or placebo for OXM, accompanied by up to 160 minutes of GGI. During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting approximately 40 minutes. Glucose levels were measured from blood collected at baseline and during GGI to determine the maximum ambient glucose concentration above baseline.</description>

        <description>Beta cell sensitivity measures the ability to mount an insulin secretory response relative to the level of ambient plasma glucose. Participants received on Day (-1) an overnight IV infusion of insulin titrated to achieve baseline fasting plasma glucose on Day 1 of between 90 and 130 mg/dL. Participants also received on Day (-1) a single dose of Lg or placebo for Lg, after which insulin infusion was discontinued.

During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting 40 minutes. Glucose (G), insulin and C-peptide levels were measured from blood collected at baseline and during GGI, with the decay in C-peptide concentration used to indirectly estimate the Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR). Beta Cell Sensitivity (Φ) was determined from the regression of the ISR on ambient plasma glucose (G).</description>

During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting approximately 40 minutes. Over these two treatment periods glucose (G), insulin and C-peptide levels were measured from blood collected at the highest glucose infusion rate; with the decay in C-peptide concentration used to indirectly estimate the Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR), and hence to determine the insulinotrophic effect, ISR/G.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Insulinotrophic Effect (ISR/G) After Single Doses of 0.6 mg Lg, or 1.2 mg Lg, Compared With Single Doses of Placebo or OXM</title>
        <description>Participants received on Day (-1) an overnight IV infusion of insulin titrated to achieve baseline fasting plasma glucose on Day 1 of between 90 and 130 mg/dL. Participants also received on Day (-1) a single dose of Lg or placebo for Lg, after which insulin infusion was discontinued. Following overnight fast, participants received on Day 1 a single dose of OXM or placebo for OXM, accompanied by up to 160 minutes of GGI. During GGI glucose (20% D/W) was gradually infused at rates of 2,4,6 and 10 mg/kg/min, with each rate lasting approximately 40 minutes. Glucose (G), insulin and C-peptide levels were measured from blood collected at baseline and during GGI; with the decay in C-peptide concentration used to indirectly estimate the Insulin Secretion Rate (ISR) and hence determine ISR/G.</description>
