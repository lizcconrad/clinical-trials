  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a disabling movement disorder characterized by repetitive patterned or sustained
      muscle contractions causing twisting or abnormal postures that may afflict 250,000 people in
      the U.S. While the pathophysiology of dystonia remains uncertain the treatment is rather
      rudimentary. A better understanding of neural mechanisms of dystonias is not only an
      invaluable prerequisite for developing better treatment options but also a step toward better
      understanding of the complex network of basal ganglia. In this study I will investigate if
      there is any difference between the dopamine receptors and dopamine in people with dystonia
      and healthy subjects.
