  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase II study with primary objectives to
      assess whether expression of select chemotherapy markers is associated with progression-free
      survival (PFS) in participants treated with bevacizumab plus leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and
      oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) or bevacizumab plus leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan
      (FOLFIRI). The study population will consist of participants with first-line mCRC.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until death or disease progression; assessed every 6 weeks (maximum up to 45 months overall)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor assessments were performed according to RECIST Version 1.1. Disease progression was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 20 percent (%) increase in sum of largest diameters (LD) of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum of LD on study, in addition to an absolute increase ≥5 millimeters (mm). Disease progression was further defined as the last documented progression determined by the Investigator no later than 1 day before initiation of second-line therapy. Death on study included death from any cause occurring no later than 3 months after the last component of study treatment. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to death or disease progression, whichever occurred first. The median duration of PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and expressed in months. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

    <description>Objective response was defined as CR or PR according to RECIST Version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and short-axis reduction to &lt;10 mm of any pathological lymph nodes. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. Confirmation of response at a consecutive assessment was not required. The percentage of participants with CR or PR was reported. The 95% CI was computed using normal approximation to the binomial distribution.</description>

    <time_frame>At time of resective surgery during study (maximum up to 45 months overall)</time_frame>
    <description>The timing of resective surgery was not defined in the protocol and was left at the discretion of the Investigator. Resection was classified as R0, R1, or R2 following surgery. R0 was defined as complete resection with clear margins ≥1 mm. R1 was defined as the presence of exposed tumor or histologically detected tumor cells at the line of transection, or &lt;1 mm microscopic margins. In the case of use of radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy, the resection was considered as R1. R2 was defined as macroscopic positive margins or incomplete resection at time of surgery. The percentage of participants with resection of liver or liver plus lymph node metastases was reported. The 95% CI was computed using normal approximation to the binomial distribution.</description>

             childbearing potential should agree to use effective, non-hormonal means of
             contraception during the study and for a period of at least 6 months following the
             last administration of study drugs. Female participants with an intact uterus (unless
             amenorrheic for the last 24 months) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to randomization into the study.

          -  Male participants must agree to use effective contraception during the study and for a
             period of at least 6 months following the last administration of study drugs, even if
             they have been surgically sterilized.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior systemic treatment for mCRC

          -  Adjuvant chemotherapy for CRC completed &lt;12 months

          -  Malignancies other than mCRC within 5 years prior to randomization, except for
             adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, and ductal
             carcinoma in situ treated surgically with curative intent

          -  Radiotherapy to any site for any reason within 28 days prior to randomization, except
             for palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions within 14 days prior to randomization

          -  Clinically detectable third-space fluid collections that cannot be controlled by
             drainage or other procedures prior to study entry

          -  Treatment with any other investigational agent, or participation in another
             investigational drug trial within 28 days prior to randomization

          <title>Bevacizumab + mFOLFOX6</title>
          <description>Participants with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who were candidates for first-line therapy received bevacizumab plus leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Bevacizumab was given as 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), leucovorin as 400 milligrams per meter-squared (mg/m^2), oxaliplatin as 85 mg/m^2, and 5-fluorouracil as 400 mg/m^2 bolus followed by 2400 mg/m^2 continuous 46-hour infusion. All treatments were administered via intravenous (IV) infusion and started on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle. Participants could be transitioned to oral capecitabine in the event of unacceptable toxicity to oxaliplatin and given as 850 or 1000 mg/m^2 twice a day on Days 1 to 14, with bevacizumab continued in 3-week cycles.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1</title>
        <description>Tumor assessments were performed according to RECIST Version 1.1. Disease progression was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 20 percent (%) increase in sum of largest diameters (LD) of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum of LD on study, in addition to an absolute increase ≥5 millimeters (mm). Disease progression was further defined as the last documented progression determined by the Investigator no later than 1 day before initiation of second-line therapy. Death on study included death from any cause occurring no later than 3 months after the last component of study treatment. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to death or disease progression, whichever occurred first. The median duration of PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and expressed in months. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

          <description>Tumor assessments were performed according to RECIST Version 1.1. Disease progression was defined as ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum of LD on study, in addition to an absolute increase ≥5 mm. Disease progression was further defined as the last documented progression determined by the Investigator no later than 1 day before initiation of second-line therapy. Death on study included death from any cause occurring no later than 3 months after the last component of study treatment. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to death or disease progression, whichever occurred first. The median duration of PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and expressed in months. The 95% CI was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

        <title>PFS According to RECIST Version 1.1 in Participants With High ERCC-1 and Low VEGF-A Levels</title>
        <description>Tumor assessments were performed according to RECIST Version 1.1. Disease progression was defined as ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum of LD on study, in addition to an absolute increase ≥5 mm. Disease progression was further defined as the last documented progression determined by the Investigator no later than 1 day before initiation of second-line therapy. Death on study included death from any cause occurring no later than 3 months after the last component of study treatment. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to death or disease progression, whichever occurred first. The median duration of PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and expressed in months. The 95% CI was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

        <description>Objective response was defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST Version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and short-axis reduction to less than (&lt;) 10 mm of any pathological lymph nodes. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. Confirmation of response at a consecutive assessment was not required. The percentage of participants with CR or PR was reported. The 95% CI was computed using normal approximation to the binomial distribution.</description>

Depending on the regimen to which the participant was randomized, bevacizumab was given as 5 mg/kg, leucovorin as 400 mg/m^2, oxaliplatin as 85 mg/m^2, irinotecan as 180 mg/m^2, and 5-fluorouracil as 400 mg/m^2 bolus followed by 2400 mg/m^2 continuous 46-hour infusion. All treatments were administered via IV infusion and started on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle. Participants could be transitioned to oral capecitabine in the event of unacceptable toxicity to oxaliplatin or irinotecan and given as 850 or 1000 mg/m^2 twice a day on Days 1 to 14, with bevacizumab continued in 3-week cycles. Participants with ERCC-1 level ≤1.7 × 10^-3 ERCC-1/B-actin mRNA at Baseline were included in separate analyses.</description>

          <description>Objective response was defined as CR or PR according to RECIST Version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and short-axis reduction to &lt;10 mm of any pathological lymph nodes. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. Confirmation of response at a consecutive assessment was not required. The percentage of participants with CR or PR was reported. The 95% CI was computed using normal approximation to the binomial distribution.</description>

        <description>Disease control was defined as CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST Version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and short-axis reduction to &lt;10 mm of any pathological lymph nodes. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. Confirmation of response at a consecutive assessment was not required. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to quality for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression (≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions plus absolute increase ≥5 mm) in reference to the smallest sum of LD on study. The percentage of participants with CR, PR, or SD was reported. The 95% CI was computed using normal approximation to the binomial distribution.</description>

Depending on the regimen to which the participant was randomized, bevacizumab was given as 5 mg/kg, leucovorin as 400 mg/m^2, oxaliplatin as 85 mg/m^2, irinotecan as 180 mg/m^2, and 5-fluorouracil as 400 mg/m^2 bolus followed by 2400 mg/m^2 continuous 46-hour infusion. All treatments were administered via IV infusion and started on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle. Participants could be transitioned to oral capecitabine in the event of unacceptable toxicity to oxaliplatin or irinotecan and given as 850 or 1000 mg/m^2 twice a day on Days 1 to 14, with bevacizumab continued in 3-week cycles. Participants with ERCC-1 level &gt;1.7 × 10^-3 ERCC-1/B-actin mRNA at Baseline were included in separate analyses.</description>

          <description>The timing of resective surgery was not defined in the protocol and was left at the discretion of the Investigator. Resection was classified as R0, R1, or R2 following surgery. R0 was defined as complete resection with clear margins ≥1 mm. R1 was defined as the presence of exposed tumor or histologically detected tumor cells at the line of transection, or &lt;1 mm microscopic margins. In the case of use of radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy, the resection was considered as R1. R2 was defined as macroscopic positive margins or incomplete resection at time of surgery. The percentage of participants with resection of liver or liver plus lymph node metastases was reported. The 95% CI was computed using normal approximation to the binomial distribution.</description>

        <description>Tumor assessments were performed according to RECIST Version 1.1. Disease progression was defined as ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to the smallest sum of LD on study, in addition to an absolute increase ≥5 mm. Disease progression was further defined as the last documented progression determined by the Investigator no later than 1 day before initiation of second-line therapy. Death on study included death from any cause occurring no later than 3 months after the last component of study treatment. PFS was defined as the time from randomization to death or disease progression, whichever occurred first. The median duration of PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and expressed in months. The 95% CI was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

Depending on the regimen to which the participant was randomized, bevacizumab was given as 5 mg/kg, leucovorin as 400 mg/m^2, oxaliplatin as 85 mg/m^2, irinotecan as 180 mg/m^2, and 5-fluorouracil as 400 mg/m^2 bolus followed by 2400 mg/m^2 continuous 46-hour infusion. All treatments were administered via IV infusion and started on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle. Participants could be transitioned to oral capecitabine in the event of unacceptable toxicity to oxaliplatin or irinotecan and given as 850 or 1000 mg/m^2 twice a day on Days 1 to 14, with bevacizumab continued in 3-week cycles. Participants with VEGF-A level &gt;5 pg/mL at Baseline were included in separate analyses.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control According to RECIST Version 1.1 in Participants With High VEGF-A Levels Versus Participants With Low VEGF-A Levels</title>
          <description>Disease control was defined as CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST Version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and short-axis reduction to &lt;10 mm of any pathological lymph nodes. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to sum of LD at Baseline. Confirmation of response at a consecutive assessment was not required. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to quality for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression (≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions plus absolute increase ≥5 mm) in reference to the smallest sum of LD on study. The percentage of participants with CR, PR, or SD was reported. The 95% CI was computed using normal approximation to the binomial distribution.</description>
