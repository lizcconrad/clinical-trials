             age (inclusive). Female subjects must be unable to become pregnant (postmenopausal for
             at least 1 year, or surgically sterile)

          3. Each subject shall be given, a general physical examination within 28 days of
             initiation of the study and will include, but is not limited to, blood pressure,
             general observations, and history.

          4. Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study
             screening process.

          5. Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of
             the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.

          6. Electrocardiograms of all participating subjects will be recorded before initiation of
             the study and filed with each subject's case report forms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a history of alcoholism or drug addiction (during past 2 years), or
             serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis,

             eligible for this study.

          2. Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are outside the normal range may be
             retested at the discretion of the clinical investigator. If the clinical values are
             outside the range on retesting, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the

             abuse as part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at check-in each
             dosing period. Subjects found to have urine/saliva concentrations of any of the tested
             drugs will not be allowed to participate.

          5. Subjects should not have donated blood and / or plasma for at least thirty (30) days
             prior to tile first dosing of the study.
