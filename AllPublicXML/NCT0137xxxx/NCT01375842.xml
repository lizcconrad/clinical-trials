    <textblock>
      This Phase I, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) administered as
      single agent to participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies or
      hematologic malignancies. The study will be conducted in two cohorts: Dose-escalation cohort
      and Expansion cohort.
