  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the effect of a mindfulness training program with special
      focus on diet and nutrition vs. dietary counseling in 40 obese adults (BMI range 30-40) and
      their partner/spouses (irrespective of their BMI), in a 6-month pilot randomized controlled
      trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with deficits in self regulation. Approaches that foster increased
      non-judgmental present moment awareness and increased acceptance have been demonstrated to
      enhance self regulation. One commonly used approach that synthesizes these concepts is
      mindfulness training. This study is designed to assess the effect of a mindfulness training
      program with special focus on diet and nutrition, on body mass index, cardiovascular risk
      markers, peripheral blood telomere length and telomerase levels in obese adults. The
      mindfulness training program is adapted from the Attention and Interpretation Therapy
      developed by study investigators at Mayo Clinic. The study is designed as a 6-month pilot
      randomized controlled trial involving 40 obese adults and their partners/spouses with
      standard dietary counseling as the control intervention. Promising feasibility and efficacy
      data from the study will prompt us to pursue a larger, multi-center trial to more
      definitively test this program as well as apply this intervention in clinical practice.
