    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Rotavin-M1 produced
      by the Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals (POLYVAC) in infants in
      Vietnam. In addition, we evaluate different dosages and schedules to determine the best
      regimen to test in a clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotavirus (RV) is the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide. In
      Vietnam rotavirus causes an estimated 122,000-140,000 hospitalizations and 2900-5400 deaths
      per year among children under 5 years of age (1). Over the past 13 years, sentinel hospital
      surveillance identified rotavirus in 44%-62% of children admitted for the treatment of acute
      diarrhea in Vietnam (2-4). Such a high burden of disease justified accelerated development of
      a new and locally manufactured vaccine against rotavirus in Vietnam. It is estimated that if
      a vaccine was introduced in the current childhood immunization schedule, it could reduce
      severe rotavirus disease by about 60% or more given current vaccine efficacies and coverage
      (5).

      The Government of Vietnam has pursued a policy to encourage local vaccine production so the
      country could be self-reliant with affordable vaccines for its population (6). Over the past
      decades, several locally produced vaccines for poliomyelitis, cholera, Japanese encephalitis,
      and Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus have contributed to the reduction in the prevalence of these
      diseases and to the eradication of polio over the past decade. While two commercial rotavirus
      vaccines, RotarixTM (GSK, Belgium) and RotaTeqÂ® (Merck), have both been tested in Vietnam,
      neither is currently available at an affordable cost for the national program. Therefore, the
      candidate vaccine, Rotavin-M1, was developed in order to fill this need for a more affordable
      vaccine for Vietnamese children (6). This vaccine is similar to RotarixTM, and was developed
      by selecting a common G1P[8] strain and attenuating it through serial passages and plaque
      purification in qualified Vero cells under GLP conditions.
