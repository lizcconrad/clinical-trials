  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators posit that it would be advantageous to reproduce the height of the entire
      patellofemoral joint in order to maintain the lever arm of the quadriceps mechanism at its
      preoperative level. Failure to do this may cause the quadriceps mechanism to be inefficient.
      For example the quadriceps mechanism would have to work harder if the total patellofemoral
      (PF) height is diminished. Alternatively, diminished motion or increased patellar strain may
      occur if the overall PF height is increased. The investigators theorize that either of these
      sizing errors could lead to anterior knee pain. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      clinical outcomes between two surgical techniques: 1) a technique of reproducing the total PF
      joint on both sides of the articulation (Group 1) and 2) the traditional technique of
      reproducing only the patellar thickness on one side of the joint (Group 2).

      There is no consensus on the source of the anterior pain or the most efficacious treatment.
      Multiple etiologies have been theorized concerning the cause of this problem including
      tibiofemoral instability, patellofemoral (PF) instability, PF maltracking and patella stress
      fractures. It has been reported that patellofemoral forces are associated with anterior knee
      pain. Moreover, it has been reported that a correlation exists between the tension of the
      quadriceps muscle and the forces on the patella. In a biomechanical, cadaver study, Browne et
      al. found that a longer extensor moment arm reduced the tension on the quadriceps and reduced
      the patellar forces.
