  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Genomic medicine, using genetic information to improve health outcomes, is heralded as
           the answer to rising medical costs by focusing on prevention and tailored care. Despite
           its potential, little investigation has focused on how genomic medicine can be applied
           in health care. To be effective, it requires new ways to learn, deliver, and communicate
           medical information. It will also raise new ethical questions.

        -  The overall goal of Guilford Genomic Medicine Initiative (GGMI) is to identify the
           specific challenges in &quot;re-structuring&quot; an existing medical system to integrate genomic
           medicine, and create solutions that can be used by other medical systems, such as the
           extensive military medical care system. To accomplish this goal, GGMI includes the
           development of a large-scale genomic medicine education initiative targeted at the
           community, providers, and patients, and a clinical systems model to implement strategies
           to facilitate the integration of genomic medicine into several pilot practices.
