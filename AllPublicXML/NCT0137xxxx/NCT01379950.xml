  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the resolution of an inflammatory
      reaction is an active process. This process requiring signals that turn off early
      inflammatory stages, as neutrophil infiltration and promote resolution phase, as clearance of
      apoptotic cells. In this array,the relationship between neutrophils, monocytes, and
      macrophages is crucial for the concert process.

      Macrophages possess a plasticity of phenotype that explains their protective as well as
      potentially detrimental role in chronic inflammation and tissue injury. Such heterogeneity
      arises as macrophages differentiate from monocytes and are exposed to specific tissue- and
      hematopoietic cell-derived stimuli. It is important to be able to identify the different
      types of macrophages in this setting. Today's literature can distinguish between 3 main
      phenotypic groups of macrophages. The classically activated M1 macrophages, the alternatively
      activated-M2 macrophages and the &quot;resolution phase&quot; - rMs macrophages. The third phenotypic
      macrophage might play a crucial rule in the resolution phase, and is called the &quot;resolving
      macrophage&quot;.

      All of those pro-resolving lipid mediators promote the return to tissue homeostasis .

      The investigators hypothesis is that in periodontal patients the inflammatory process
      continues because the process does not reach the resolution phase, and in that milieu, the
      macrophage might be a key component.

      Within the overall concept of periodontal disease as a model for an inflammatory disease with
      an stoppable inflammatory reaction, the primary aim of the study is to check the macrophage
      characteristics in periodontal patients and to compare it to healthy people.
