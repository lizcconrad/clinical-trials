  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes is increasing and the management of the disease is nowadays
      considered a major challenge. Affected patients have increased mortality and morbidity as
      well as a significant drop in the quality of life. The complications of diabetes can be
      classified as microvascular (e.g. nephropathy, neuropathy or retinopathy) or macrovascular
      (e.g. cardiovascular or cerebrovascular).

      Several large-scale epidemiologic studies indicating that wider retinal venous caliber is
      strongly associated with the fasting glucose level as well as with diabetes. Another retinal
      vascular abnormality that is associated with diabetes is an abnormal retinal vascular
      response to flicker stimulation. Retinal vessel dilatation in response to stimulation with
      diffuse flicker light occurs due to a phenomenon called neurovascular coupling. This means
      that increased activity of neurons is associated with an increased retinal metabolism. This
      leads to a release of endogenous vasodilator substances and increased blood flow. However,
      previous studies were limited by the fact that retinal vessel diameters and blood flow were
      not measured simultaneously.

      The present study aims to investigate whether the response of retinal vessel diameters and
      blood flow velocities to flicker stimulation is altered in patients with diabetes. Both
      parameters will be measured in real time using Fourier Domain Doppler OCT.
