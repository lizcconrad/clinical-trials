      This study is a 2-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study with a
      fixed dose regimen. The study will involve twenty (20) healthy subjects. The study will be a
      comparative study of safety and efficacy of DLBS1033 with placebo. Each study period will
      consist of 14 days treatment with a 2-week wash-out period in between. The evaluation of
      safety parameters will be performed at Day 1 (baseline), 7, and 14; while the efficacy
      parameters will be performed at Day 1, 2, 7, and 14.
