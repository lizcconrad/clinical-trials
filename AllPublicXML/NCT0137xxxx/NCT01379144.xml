  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare the change in intraocular pressure (IOP)
      of three different doses of latanoprost (75, 100 and 125 ug/ml) to that of the marketed 50
      ug/ml dose, in a dose ranging study.

    <description>Eligible patients were randomized to receive 1 of 4 different doses of latanoprost (50, 75, 100 or 125 ug/mL).
Study medication was supplied in clear bottles. Patients were instructed to instill one drop of study medication in one or both eyes (as instructed by their investigator) once daily in the evening between 7 PM and 9 PM during the entire treatment period. The first dose of study medication was instilled in the evening of the baseline visit and the last dose was instilled in the evening before the Week 4 (Day 28) visit.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18 years of age or older.

          -  Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) requiring unilateral
             or bilateral administration of intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering treatment,
             including patients who were naïve to IOP lowering treatment.

          -  IOP between ≥ 24 mmHg and ≤ 36 mmHg in at least one eye at the 8 AM time point at
             baseline/randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Closed/barely open anterior chamber angle or a history of acute angle closure.

          -  A history of discontinued prostaglandin IOP lowering treatment, unless the reason for
             discontinuation was participation in a clinical study.

          -  Ocular surgery or argon laser trabeculoplasty in one or both eyes within 3 months
             prior to the screening visit.

          -  Use or anticipated requirement during the study of any topical medication that was
             known to affect IOP.

          -  Anticipated need to modify systemic medication known to affect IOP (eg,
             beta-adrenergic antagonists, alpha-adrenergic agonists, calcium channel blockers,
             angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotension II receptor antagonists)
             during the study period.
