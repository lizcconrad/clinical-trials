    <textblock>
      This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1) discontinuation study is
      a 4-part study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple dose administration
      of amifampridine phosphate in patients with LEMS. Data from parts 2 and 3 (the double-blind
      parts of the study) are presented in this record.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) at 14 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment at Baseline and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The QMG is a physician-rated test including 13 assessments, including facial strength, swallowing, grip strength, and duration of time that limbs can be maintained in outstretched positions. Each of the 13 items is scored from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The total score can range from 0 to 39. Increased QMG total score correlates to worsening symptoms of LEMS.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SGI Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment at Baseline and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Subject Global Impression (SGI) is a measure of changes in subject's perception of change in overall wellbeing.
The patient is asked to use the 7-point scale below to rate their impression of the effects of the study medication during the preceding 3 days on their physical well being.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline Timed 25 Foot Walking Test (T25FW) at 14 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment at Baseline and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The T25FW test, a component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, was a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-foot walk (National Multiple Sclerosis Society). The patient was directed to walk a clearly marked 25-foot course as quickly and safely as possible. Following a rest of at least 5 minutes, the timed 25-foot walk was repeated. Patients could use assistive devices, such as canes, crutches, or walkers.
All data were normalized to the number of feet per minute, so if the patient walked 25 feet in less than a minute, the result was a speed greater than 25 feet/minute.
The measurement for the T25FW test was the average speed, expressed in feet/minute, of the 2 completed walks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Timed 25 Foot Walking Test (T25FW) at 14 Days</title>
        <description>The T25FW test, a component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, was a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-foot walk (National Multiple Sclerosis Society). The patient was directed to walk a clearly marked 25-foot course as quickly and safely as possible. Following a rest of at least 5 minutes, the timed 25-foot walk was repeated. Patients could use assistive devices, such as canes, crutches, or walkers.
All data were normalized to the number of feet per minute, so if the patient walked 25 feet in less than a minute, the result was a speed greater than 25 feet/minute.
The measurement for the T25FW test was the average speed, expressed in feet/minute, of the 2 completed walks.</description>
