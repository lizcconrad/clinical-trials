      This study will evaluate the role of everolimus in combination with local Transcatheter
      Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) procedure in patients with localized unresectable
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).

    The study was terminated due to low enrollment. This resulted in the study being underpowered

    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Progression (TTP) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented radiological confirmation of disease progression based on modified RECIST criteria. Progressive Disease: &gt;20% increase in sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of &quot;viable&quot; target lesion (arterial phase enhancement)</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on the Modified RECIST</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 months, end of study</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate was defined as the number of patients whose best overall response was either complete response or partial response according to the modified RECIST. Complete response: Disappearance of arterial phase enhance-ment in all target lesions. Partial response: &gt;30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of &quot;viable&quot; target lesion (arterial phase enhance-ment)Disease control rate was defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response, partial response or stable disease. The study was terminated early due to slow enrollment of 4 years, higher than anticipated screen failure rate due to a higher than anticipated proportion of patients having advanced liver disease and a change in clinical practice the total of 80 patients was not reached with only 59 patients recruited in total. The study was underpowered due to termination therefore data was not collected and the outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

    <description>Time to Progression (TTP) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented radiological confirmation of disease progression based on original RECIST criteria. Progressive Disease: &gt;20% increase in sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of target lesions with an absolute increase of ≥5 mm; new lesions. The study was terminated early due to slow enrollment of 4 years, higher than anticipated screen failure rate due to a higher than anticipated proportion of patients having advanced liver disease and a change in clinical practice the total of 80 patients was not reached with only 59 patients recruited in total.

        <description>Overall response rate was defined as the number of patients whose best overall response was either complete response or partial response according to the modified RECIST. Complete response: Disappearance of arterial phase enhance-ment in all target lesions. Partial response: &gt;30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of “viable” target lesion (arterial phase enhance-ment)Disease control rate was defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response, partial response or stable disease. The study was terminated early due to slow enrollment of 4 years, higher than anticipated screen failure rate due to a higher than anticipated proportion of patients having advanced liver disease and a change in clinical practice the total of 80 patients was not reached with only 59 patients recruited in total. The study was underpowered due to termination therefore data was not collected and the outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>
