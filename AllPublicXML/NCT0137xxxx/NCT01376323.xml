  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this combined, two part study is to evaluate the safety and glucose lowering
      effects of GSK256073 when administered to diabetic subjects for 12 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at centers in Europe and the United States. The study is being
      conducted in two parts. Part A (n = 90 subjects) will provide a preliminary evaluation of 12
      weeks of treatment. Initiation of part B (n = 210 additional subjects) will be dependent on
      the results observed in part A. The emerging data from part A will be used to guide selection
      of the doses in Part B. Up to 8 dose levels of GSK256073 may be included in part B. The
      emerging exposure response relationships from the part A interim analysis will be used to
      guide dose selection.

      Each subject enrolled in the study will undergo screening procedures, a 2 week placebo run-in
      period, baseline assessments, randomization, a twelve week treatment period, and a 2 week
      follow-up period. Following completion of the baseline visit and randomization into the
      study, subjects will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessments at Weeks 3, 6,
      9, and 12. A subject's total participation in the study will last up to approximately 20
      weeks. Subjects will continue their current prescribed regimen of metformin (glucophage)
      monotherapy and will monitor fasting blood glucose levels daily using a glucometer.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a study in participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus which was conducted across 14 centers in 4 countries (France [4], Spain [3], United Kingdom [4], Unites States [3]) from 13 July 2011 to 17 September 2012. Total of 89 participants were included in the pharmacokinetic population.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Eligible participants in this arm received GSK256073 matching placebo capsules twice a day (BID) and once daily orally as directed with water for 12 weeks in a fed state. According to the randomized dose regimen, participants either took 2 capsules in the morning (once daily arm) or 1 capsule each in the morning and evening (BID arms). The data for placebos-GSK256073 matched placebo BID and GSK256073 matched placebo once daily was pooled into one placebo group.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.</description>

        <description>Single 12-lead ECGs were obtained at each time point during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. It was assessed at Baseline (pre-dose Day 1), Day 2, Week 3, Week 6 and 12. Participants with normal, abnormal not clinically significant and abnormal clinically significant ECG were presented.</description>

The data for placebos-GSK256073 matched placebo BID and GSK256073 matched placebo once daily was pooled into one placebo group.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for analysis of HbA1c were collected at Baseline (Day -1), Day 41, Week 9 and Week 12. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the corresponding post-treatment values. Baseline was defined as Day -1 visit.

        <title>Change From Baseline in 12 Hour Non-esterified Fatty Acids (NEFA) and Glucose Weighted Mean Concentration Value at Day 2 and at Week 6</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the corresponding post-treatment values. Baseline was defined as weighted mean value at Day 1 visit. Statistics is provided for least square mean at Week 6. It was assessed on Baseline (Day 1), Day 2 and Week 6.</description>

            <description>Eligible participants in this arm received GSK256073 matching placebo capsules BID and once daily orally as directed with water for 12 weeks in a fed state. According to the randomized dose regimen, participants either took 2 capsules in the morning (once daily arm) or 1 capsule each in the morning and evening (BID arms). The data for placebos-GSK256073 matched placebo BID and GSK256073 matched placebo once daily was pooled into one placebo group.</description>

        <description>Mean of triplicate measurements at pre-dose time point were considered for the summary. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the corresponding post-treatment values. Baseline was defined as mean of Day 1 pre-dose visit.
