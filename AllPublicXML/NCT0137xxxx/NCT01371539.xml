    <measure>Corrected Distance Binocular Visual Measurement in Normal Illumination Reported as Binocular Distance Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The participant read a Snellen chart at a 20-foot equivalent distance with both eyes together while wearing study lenses. The Snellen acuity was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equated to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and was considered normal distance eyesight. A positive logMAR value indicated poorer vision, and a negative value denoted better visual acuity.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The participant read a Snellen chart at 40 centimeters with both eyes together while wearing study lenses. The Snellen acuity was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equated to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and was considered normal near eyesight. A positive logMAR value indicated poorer vision, and a negative value denoted better visual acuity.</description>

          <title>Corrected Near Binocular Visual Measurement in Normal Illumination Reported as Binocular Near Visual Acuity</title>
          <description>The participant read a Snellen chart at 40 centimeters with both eyes together while wearing study lenses. The Snellen acuity was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equated to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and was considered normal near eyesight. A positive logMAR value indicated poorer vision, and a negative value denoted better visual acuity.</description>
