  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoRT) has become the standard of care for
      treatment of many patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
      though many clinical questions remain. Prior experience has revealed locoregional control
      (LRC), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 years exceeding 80% after
      treatment with the use of hyperfractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and
      concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced HNSCC. This
      multi-institutional phase II ZCC00204 trial resulted in an acceptable quality of life (QOL)
      and toxicity profile. The current trial is an attempt to maintain high LRC, while further
      minimizing both acute and chronic toxicities, and maximizing QOL.
