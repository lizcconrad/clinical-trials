      1. Specific Aims

        1. To evaluate the effects of life skills/parenting groups that are embedded within a
           comprehensive multidisciplinary clinic for adolescent parents (the Young Parents
           Program), using a randomized control design. Specifically, the effect of group
           participation on the following adolescent parent outcomes will be investigated:

             -  Parenting attitudes and skills including empathy, non-violent discipline, role
                appropriateness and developmentally appropriate expectations.

             -  Skills of daily living, social relationships, and work/study at follow-up, as
                measured by the Ansell-Casey Life Skills Assessment Scale.

             -  Depression and perceived social support using the CESD-C and Duke Social Support
                scale.

             -  Repeat pregnancy rates at 12 and 24 months after first delivery.

        2. To evaluate the overall Young Parents Program service delivery as required by the Office
           of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs (project funder) using a cross cutting evaluation of
           health services utilization, social needs and work/educational outcomes.
