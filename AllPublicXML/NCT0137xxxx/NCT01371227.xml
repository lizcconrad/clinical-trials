      The purpose of this study is to evaluate tolerability of the combination therapy of JNS002
      and bortezomib in Japanese bortezomib-naive patients with multiple myeloma who have ever
      received at least 1 line of chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized (study drug is intentionally assigned to the patient), single-arm
      (one group of patients receiving the same treatment), open-label (all people involved know
      the identity of the intervention) study to evaluate tolerability of the combination therapy
      of JNS002 and bortezomib in 3 to 6 patients with multiple myeloma whose disease has either
      progressed after at least 1 line of prior therapy or was refractory to initial treatment.
      Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled and the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will
      be determined at the end of Cycle 1 to evaluate the study doses against the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD). If the incidence is =2/3, additional 3 patients will be enrolled to define the
      MTD. Safety endpoints include adverse events, laboratory tests (hematology, blood
      biochemistry, and urinalysis), electrocardiogram (ECG), LVEF, chest X-ray, vital signs (body
      temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure), and body weight. Efficacy evaluation will be
      performed in terms of antitumor effect, according to criteria for assessment of antitumor
      effect similar to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.
      Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 by rapid (bolus) intravenous (IV) administration will be given on Days
      1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle. In addition, JNS002 30 mg/m2 by IV infusion will be
      given at a rate of = 1 mg/minute on Day 4 of every 21-day cycle after bortezomib. Treatment
      will continue for a total of 6 cycles of therapy (126 days).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma with evaluable disease parameters
             (1.Presence of M-protein in the serum and/or urine, 2.Increased plasma cells in the
             bone marrow or biopsy-proven plasmacytoma, 3.Presence of related organ tissue
             impairment)

          -  Patients with progression of disease after an initial response (complete, partial, or
             minimal response based on the EBMT criteria) to at least 1 line of therapy.
             Progression of disease before responding to an initial line of therapy with a
             non-anthracycline containing regimen that included (at a minimum) an alkylating agent
             or high-dose corticosteroids. Rituximab alone or experimental agents alone were not to
             be considered a line of therapy

          -  Patients with progressive disease as defined by one of the following: i) &gt; 25%
             increase in M-protein, ii) Development of new or worsening lytic bone lesions, iii)
             Development of new or worsening plasmacytoma, iv) Development of new or worsening
             hypercalcemia (&gt; 11.5 mg/dL or 2.8 mmol/L corrected) that is not attributable to any

             protein &gt; 1 g/dL, ii) Urine monoclonal (light chain) protein &gt; 200 mg/24 hours
