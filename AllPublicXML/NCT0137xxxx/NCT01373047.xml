  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data on the safety and potential effectiveness of 2nd
      generation designer T cells delivered into the hepatic circulation in patients with liver
      metastases expressing the CEA tumor marker. Designer T cells are prepared by collecting white
      blood cells from the participant, and then modifying these cells in the laboratory so that
      they recognize the tumor antigen, CEA. These modified cells are then given back into the
      participant so that they can attack and kill tumor cells. The investigators hypothesize that
      regional delivery of the designer T cells directly into the hepatic artery will minimize
      systemic toxicity and optimize the changes for therapeutic effect.

    <textblock>
      T cells have the power to destroy malignant cells under certain conditions, as demonstrated
      by the rare spontaneous remissions of cancer. However, the endogenous T cell response to
      cancer fails in the vast majority of patients and the tolerogenic conditions within the liver
      may pose additional immunologic barriers for those with intrahepatic metastases. The
      investigators modify patient T cells to kill malignant cells based on their expression of
      tumor antigens using antibody-defined recognition. The investigators will achieve this by
      preparing chimeric IgCD28TCR genes in mammalian expression vectors to yield &quot;designer T
      cells&quot; from normal patient cells. Prior studies in model systems demonstrated that
      recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modified T cells to respond to antigen targets with IL2
      secretion, cellular proliferation, and cytotoxicity - the hallmarks of an effective,
      self-sustaining immune response.

      The present trial will test the regional infusion of anti-CEA designer T cells, given via the
      hepatic artery using a percutaneous approach. This is an intra-patient dose escalation trial,
      where patients will receive three doses over the course of six weeks. Doses are 10^8, 10^9
      and 10^10 modified T cells. Patients are monitored for safety and response. Patients are
      on-study for one month after dosing.
