    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  One way tumors are able to grow is by forming new blood vessels that supply it with
           nutrients and oxygen.

        -  Vandetanib (ZD6474) is an experimental drug that blocks certain proteins on the surface
           of tumor and blood vessel cells that are involved with the formation of new blood
           vessels.

        -  Blocking these proteins may prevent the tumor cells or blood vessels from continuing to
           grow.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether vandetanib can cause tumors to shrink or stabilize in patients with
           advanced kidney cancer.

        -  To determine how vandetanib may work in people with kidney cancer and to develop tests
           that may be helpful in studying kidney cancer.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients 18 years of age or older with advanced clear cell kidney cancer whose disease has
      worsened after treatment with one or more of the following drugs: sunitinib, sorafenib,
      interleukin-2 and temsirolimus; or patients who have had to stop treatment with these drugs
      due to unacceptable side effects; or patients who are unable to receive standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  Patients take a vandetanib pill once a day in 28-day cycles.

        -  Patients are followed in the clinic every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment
           and then every 4 weeks for a physical examination, blood and urine tests,
           electrocardiogram and a review of any drug side effects.

        -  Patients have imaging scans (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
           (MRI)) about every 8 weeks to monitor tumor growth. MRI scans are also done to look at
           tumor blood flow when treatment begins, 24 hours after the first dose of treatment, and
           again about 4 and 8 weeks after starting treatment

        -  Optional tumor biopsies (surgical removal of a sample of tumor tissue) may be done
           before starting vandetanib treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment to look for drug
           effects on the tumor.

      Background:

        -  von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) inactivation by mutation or promoter hypermethylation is seen in
           a high proportion of sporadic clear cell renal cancers.

        -  Inactivation of VHL leads to accumulation of proteins targeted for degradation through
           the ubiquitin pathway, which includes a group of transcriptionally active proteins
           called the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF), whose alpha subunits undergo degradation in
           a VHL-dependent fashion.

        -  Accumulation of HIFs results in overexpression of several genes including vascular
           endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), transforming growth
           factor (TGF-a), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and erythropoietin, which are
           believed to play a role in tumorigenesis, tumor progression and metastasis.

        -  Kinase insert domain-containing receptor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
           (kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)/vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR2)) is
           an endothelial cell receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and plays a
           crucial role in mediating tumor angiogenesis, while EGFR (a receptor for TGF-a and
           epidermal growth factor (EGF) is believed to mediate tumor growth and proliferation.

        -  ZD6474 is an orally administered receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity
           against the KDR/VEGFR2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

      Objective:

      Primary Objective

      -To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) of single agent ZD6474 in advanced clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate progression free survival in patients treated with ZD6474.

        -  To study the safety and tolerability of ZD6474.

        -  To evaluate the correlation between VHL mutational status and response to ZD6474.

        -  To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on circulating endothelial cells and endothelial
           progenitor cells and to explore the utility of these markers as surrogates of
           angiogenesis inhibition.

        -  To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on potential biomarkers of angiogenesis in plasma
           such as VEGF and soluble VEGFR2.

        -  To study the effect of ZD6474 treatment on tumor vascular flow and permeability using
           dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.

        -  To investigate the effect of ZD6474 on EGFR and VEGFR mediated signaling using tumor
           biopsy tissue (when available).

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults with measurable advanced clear cell renal carcinoma

        -  Patients must have received no more than three prior systemic therapies (no more than
           two agents known to inhibit VEGF or VEGFR) and must have either progressed on or be
           unable to receive 1) Sunitinib or sorafenib, and 2) High dose interleukin-2 (IL-2).

      Design:

        -  Single agent ZD6474 administered daily at a dose of 300mg/day.

        -  Patients will be evaluated for response every 8 weeks using Response Evaluation Criteria
           in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

        -  The study is based on an open label Simon two-stage optimal phase II design and will
           accrue a maximum of 37 patients.

    <description>Clinical response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression. Clinical response is assessed by the Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

             Patients with a history a major cardiac event more than 3 months prior to enrolment
             will be evaluated by a cardiologist to assess cardiac status and potential for
             increased risk with ZD6474 therapy.

             ventricular contraction (PVC), bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia] that is

             The average QTc from the three screening electrocardiograms (ECGs) must be less than
             480 msec in order for the patient to be eligible for the study).

             Patients who are receiving a drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation (see Appendix C,

             Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

             Patient known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and requiring
             antiretroviral therapy.

             Currently active diarrhea that may affect the ability of the patient to absorb ZD6474
             or tolerate further diarrhea.

             Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZD6474 is an anti-angiogenic agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with ZD6474, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with ZD6474.

             function, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates such as
             phenobarbital, or St. John's Wort.

             Inclusion of Women and Minorities:

             Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this

RECIST evaluates tumor response. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. For detailed information about RECIST, see the protocol Link module.</description>
