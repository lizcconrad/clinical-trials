  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common scenario in intensive care unit.
      Discussions about it is exponentially growing up due its high mortality rates all over the
      world and low quality of life among survivors. Mechanical ventilation is recognized to play
      an important role in treatment of patients with ARDS. However, mechanical ventilation itself
      has the potential to produce or worsen alveolar injury if inadequate strategies are chosen.
      Several studies compared different mechanical ventilation strategies in ARDS but the results
      remain uncertain regarding their influence on survival in patients with ARDS. Thus, this is a
      multicentric randomized controlled trial, with allocation concealment and intention to treat
      analysis to investigate if maximum alveolar recruitment maneuver in association to Positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrated by static compliance of respiratory system (ART
      strategy) is able to increase 28 days survival in patients with moderate to severe ARDS
      compared to conventional strategy proposed by the ARDS Clinical Network (ARDSNet strategy).
      Patients considered to this trial are those in mechanical ventilation with diagnosis of
      moderate to severe ARDS less than 72hours. Patients included will be randomized to receive
      ART strategy or ARDSNet strategy and will be followed until hospital discharge, 28 days and 6
      months.
