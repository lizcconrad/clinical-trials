    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, open label, parallel group, single administration, phase I trial, in
      subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment and a control group with normal renal
      function.

    <textblock>
      Current diabetes therapy does not stop progression of the disease and the development of
      diabetes mellitus (DM)-associated complications. A major concern in DM-patients is renal
      impairment due to nephropathy leading to a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It has
      been established that chronic (sub)clinical inflammation is crucial for the onset and
      progression of DM.

      CCL2, also known as Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP 1) is a chemokine from the
      cysteine-cysteine family, secreted by leukocytes or tissue cells. CCL2 promotes monocyte
      emigration from the bone marrow, activates monocytes and macrophages and directs their
      migration to sites of inflammation. Recent animal studies and clinical trials indicate a
      critical involvement of CCL2 in DM and diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that CCL2 may be a
      potential target for therapeutic intervention in DM. Finally, protein overload and oxidative
      challenge of the diseased kidney was suggested to stimulate CCL2 expression in renal tubuli,
      thereby accelerating the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

      As NOX E36 is designed to specifically target human MCP-1/CCL2. This study is performed to
      evaluate the role of renal impairment for adequate dosing recommendations in the planned
      target population.

In previous clinical trials, single intravenous doses of NOX E36 up to 2 mg/kg body weight and single subcutaneous doses of up to 0.5 mg/kg body weight appeared to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetic analyses have shown dose linearity</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects (age 18-75 years, both inclusive)

          2. Male subjects who agree to sexual abstinence and/or use a highly effective method of
             birth control. Female partners of male subjects must be of non-child bearing potential
             or must practice an adequate non-hormonal contraceptive method to prevent pregnancies.

          3. Subjects will be categorized as follows based on creatinine clearance(mL/min/1.73m2):
             Normal renal function: CrCl &gt; 80; mild renal impairment: 50 ≤ CrCl ≤ 80; moderate
             renal impairment: 30 ≤ CrCl ≤ 50; severe renal impairment: CrCl &lt; 30

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 22 and 40 kg/m², both inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women of childbearing potential

          2. Patients who have received kidney transplantation.

          3. Patients receiving hemodialysis to control their disease.

          4. Any clinically significant abnormality other than related to the renal impairment
             following the investigator's review of the physical examination, ECG and clinical
             laboratory tests at screening.

          5. Not able to communicate meaningfully with the investigator and staff.
