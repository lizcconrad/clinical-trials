  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The zNose速 MRSA test is a non-invasive breath test for markers of Staphylococcus aureus,
      which may predict the probability of bacterial organisms in the anterior nares, throat and
      respiratory tract, wounds, and anus and therefore be able to replace or supplement current
      active Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) surveillance efforts. It consists
      of:

        -  A collection apparatus for collection of volatile compounds from suspected infection
           sites onto a sorbent trap or Tedlar bag, as well as for the collection of a separate
           sample of room air.

        -  Analysis of the volatile organic compounds from suspected infection sites and room air
           by short acoustic wave gas chromatography.

        -  Interpretation of the volatile organic compounds with a proprietary algorithm in order
           to predict the probability of Staphylococcus aureus infection and colonization.

      This study will test the hypothesis that we can identify the presence of MRSA by sampling the
      &quot;head space&quot; above culture media of anterior nare samples provided by patients with MRSA.
      Additionally, this study will test the hypothesis that we can identify the presence of MRSA
      by sampling air exhaled through the nostrils (nasal exhalant).

        Patients will be selected upon suspicion of MRSA or MSSA infection or colonization.
        Increased concentration will be give to selection of persons from the following high risk
        groups:

          -  It has been documented that the patient has been previously discharged from a general
             acute care hospital within 30 days prior to the current hospital admission.

          -  The patient will be admitted to an intensive care unit or burn unit of the hospital.

          -  The patient receives inpatient dialysis treatment.

          -  The patient is being transferred from a skilled nursing facility
