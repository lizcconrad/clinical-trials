      1. To determine the apparent rate of disintegration of the sublingual wafer

        2. To determine the overall clinical tolerability of ketamine when administered as a single
           dose via the sublingual route. Tolerability will be assessed using a range of objective
           and subjective parameters as assessed using modified Likert and Bond and Lader scales.

             respiratory disease, as determined by the Principal Investigator.

          3. Good general mental health as determined by scores on the Symptom Checklist-90-R
             (SCL-90-R®), a screening instrument which evaluates a broad range of psychological
             problems and symptoms of psychopathology.

          4. Agree to and be capable of signing an Informed Consent Form.

          5. Have suitable venous access for blood sampling.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Renal impairment as evidenced by estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl), measured by
             the Cockcroft-Gault method, of less than 90 mL/min.

          2. Have a laboratory value at the Screening Visit that is outside the normal range,
             unless it is judged by the Investigator as not clinically significant after
             appropriate evaluation.

          3. A score of more than two standard deviations from the mean on any of the key nine
             scales in the SCL-90-R ®

          4. Any medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator may adversely impact on

             repeated demonstration of a QTc &gt;430 msec for males) at screening or prior to dosing
             on Day 1 in either study period will not be allowed to continue in the study.

         14. Significant history of illicit drug or alcohol use or abuse (as determined by the
