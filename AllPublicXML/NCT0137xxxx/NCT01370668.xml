  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a severe, chronic and recurrent illness, that affects nearly the 5% of
      the population. Recent research point at the relevance and persistence of cognitive
      dysfunctions in bipolar patients even beyond the acute phases, although cognitive impairment
      has been classically associated with schizophrenia and not bipolar disorder. Current findings
      suggest that some intervention is needed in order to improve not only affective symptoms but
      also cognitive dysfunctions, so that patients could benefit from cognitive remediation
      techniques to improve cognitive impairment and the functional outcome. There is no previous
      research on the efficacy of cognitive remediation programs on bipolar disorder.

  <detailed_description>

      The method consists of a randomized clinical trial with 3 arms: 1) one group (n=66) will
      receive a cognitive rehabilitation program + pharmacological treatment, 2) another group
      (n=66) will receive a psychoeducation program + pharmacological treatment, and 3) a control
      group (n=66) will only receive pharmacological treatment. A psychopathological,
      neuropsychological and functional assessment will be administered pre and post-intervention
      and a 12-month follow-up to assess the long term effects of the intervention.

    <description>The FAST is a valid and reliable instrument, easy to apply which requires a short period of time to administer. Evaluates functioning taking into account the last 15 days. It was developed for the clinical evaluation of the main difficulties presented by psychiatric patients, and has been validated in several languages for patients with bipolar disorder. The FAST scale consists of 24 items which allow the assessment of six specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time.</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to the experimental treatment will receive standard psychiatric care and will be enrolled in the neurocognitive intervention program composed of 21 sessions of 90 minutes, each aimed at improving the following cognitive domains: attention, memory and executive functions and psychosocial functioning.
The program will be performed in an 8-to-10 patient group conducted by 2 experienced neuropsychologists. with previous experience with bipolar patients (at least 3 years) and specific training on patients' group management.</description>

    <description>The group psychoeducation is a tested (Colom et al, 2003) and manualized intervention (Vieta and Colom, 2006) consisting on 21 sessions of 90 minutes, aimed at improving 4 main issues: illness awareness, treatment adherence, early detection of prodromal symptoms and recurrences and lifestyle regularity. The program will be performed in an 8-10 patient group conducted by 2 experienced psychologists with previous experience with bipolar patients and specific training on patients' group management. The structure of each session consists of a 30 to 40 minute speech on the topic of the day, followed by an exercise related to the issue (eg. drawing a life chart, writing a list of potential triggering factors) and a discussion.</description>
