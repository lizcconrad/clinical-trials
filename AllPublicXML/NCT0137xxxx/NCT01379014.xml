    <textblock>
      A decision aid tool (DAT) to assist mental health service users in reaching disclosure
      decisions in the context of employment was developed in a previous study (IRAS REC ref:
      07/Q0706/21). The initial feasibility and acceptability was assessed in a group of 15 mental
      health service users with mean decisional conflict scores reduced from 51.98 to 35.52 after
      completion. 60% of participants reported that the DAT was quick to complete, 40% that it was
      easy, 60% that it was relevant and 80% that they would definitely or probably use it in
      making disclosure decisions. This current study (CORAL: Proof of concept RCT) aims to
      determine whether a full randomised controlled trial of the DAT is justifiable and feasible,
      and to optimise its design. This will consider: 1) effects of the intervention; 2) baseline
      predictors of disclosure; and 3) exploration of the relationship between use of the DAT and
      the rate of disclosure.

      Eighty people who are on the caseload of a vocational specialist working with people with
      mental illness will be included in this study. All participants will be receiving treatment
      from an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service or a Community Mental
      Health Team (CMHT). An equal number from each group will be allocated to receive either the
      DAT intervention or treatment as usual. Individuals from both groups will complete baseline
      assessment and 3month followup assessments. Those allocated to the intervention will also
      complete an assessment immediately following the intervention. Qualitative interviews will
      also be conducted at 3 months with a maximum of 15 people from the intervention group and 6
      people from the control group.

    <textblock>
      The principal aims are to determine whether a full randomised controlled trial of the CORAL
      decision aid tool is justifiable and feasible and to optimise its design. Specific objectives
      are as follows:

        1. To examine the effect of the DAT on decisional conflict regarding disclosure both
           immediately and at 3 months post first use.

        2. To collect data to inform sample size calculations for the primary outcome measures for
           use in a future full scale trial(gaining employment and workplace accommodations).

        3. To test study procedures, including the sample that can be drawn using the inclusion and
           exclusion criteria; the full time equivalent needed for research assistants to recruit
           sufficient numbers and carry out the study procedures in the time available; and whether
           the measure leads to too much respondent burden.

        4. To pilot the use of a questionnaire on employment and disclosure related activities.

        5. To test the selected randomisation method, in this case individual level randomisation,
           including the methods for avoiding and measuring contamination.

        6. To pilot recruitment and retention methods for service users and vocational specialists.

        7. To estimate effect sizes and their confidence intervals for employment related
           activities (proxy outcome measures for gaining employment and workplace accommodations),
           in order to determine whether a full scale trial is justified.

        8. To modify the conceptual model
