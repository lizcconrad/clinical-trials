  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial of the use of Albuterol in the setting of acute decompensated
      Congestive Heart Failure with radiographic evidence of Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to carry out a randomized blinded placebo-controlled trial of inhaled
      Albuterol as an early therapy for patients with decompensated Congestive Heart Failure.
      Compared to placebo, inhaled Albuterol will improve oxygenation and decrease the need for
      non-invasive ventilation in patients with Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema.

    <description>Patients are evaluated for approximatly 8 hours with the Borg Dyspnea Score. Starting at the time of arrival, then one hour later and consequently every two hours until reaching 8 hours in total.
The Borg score is used to quantify the degree of shortness of breath a person is experiencing which is a measured on a 10 point visual-analog scale.</description>

    <description>Patients identified to have Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema, will receive 2.5mg of Albuterol nebulizer on enrollment in the study and again at 4 hours.

Although study drug administration will cease after 4 hours, we will continue to record ongoing data during the patient's hospitalization.</description>
