  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathogenesis of central serous chorioretinopathy is not entirely understood yet, therefore
      further investigations are needed. During this study patients with an acute episode of
      central serous chorioretinopathy are observed with established ophthalmologic methods
      (multimodal imagine) every 6 weeks until subretinal fluid is reabsorbed to gain further
      insides in etiology, course and prognosis of this disease.

      Patients with central serous chorioretinopathy are recruited from the Department of
      Ophthalmology at the Medical University of Vienna. All patients undergo ETDRS visual acuity
      measurement, Pelli-Robson contrast examination, Amsler-Grid testing, questionnaire testing,
      ophthalmologic examination, SD-OCT and polarization-sensitive OCT, fundus autofluorescence,
      fluorescein angiography, indocyanine-green angiography, fundus photo and microperimetry.
      Patients are re-examined after an interval of 6 weeks until subretinal fluid is entirely
      reabsorbed to gain further insides in etiology, course and prognosis of this disease.
