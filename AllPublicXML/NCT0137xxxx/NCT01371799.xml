  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, cross over study in which up to
      20 otherwise healthy male nicotine abstinent smokers will be tested following 3 acute
      treatment conditions (placebo, 4 and 8mg of GSK1034702). Each subject will undergo screening
      assessments within 30 days prior to administration of the first dose of study medication.
      There will be 3 treatment sessions and dosing will be separated by a minimum 1 week washout
      period. There will be two testing days (day 1 and day 2) per treatment session. On each
      treatment session subjects will be admitted on day 1. On day 1, subjects will be administered
      placebo and approximately 3 hours later, there will be a Baseline EEG/ERP recording,
      neuropsychological (Cogstate battery) testing and mood/craving/dependence questionnaire
      assessments . Subjects will be allowed to smoke until approximately midnight on day 1. On day
      2, subjects will undergo a pre-drug neuropsychological (Cogstate battery) testing and
      questionnaire assessments of mood/craving. This will be conducted approximately 1 hour prior
      to dosing. Subjects will be randomized to one of six treatment sequences. Post dose EEG/ERP
      recording, neuropsychological (Cogstate battery) testing and mood/craving measurements will
      be conducted between 3 and 6 hours post treatment to coincide with peak pharmacokinetic
      effects. This testing will be performed approximately at 12pm following at least 12hrs of
      nicotine abstinence. Blood samples will be collected at baseline (pre-drug) and following
      drug administration to quantify exposure levels.

             the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK
             Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice (and exotic
             citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices) from 7 days prior to the first dose

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
