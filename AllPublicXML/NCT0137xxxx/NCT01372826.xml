    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed written and dated informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures.

          -  Male or female volunteers aged 18 to 80 years (inclusive) having normal renal
             function, or suffering from moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD.

        Male subjects who are sexually active must be willing to use a barrier method of
        contraception (condom). Women must be of non-childbearing potential or, if of childbearing
        potential, must have a negative pregnancy test (at screening and at each admission) and be
        using a highly effective form of birth control for 3 months before enrollment and be
        willing to use a highly effective form of birth control during the study and until 3 months
        after their last dose of IP.

          -  Have a BMI between 18 and 40 kg/m2 (inclusive) and weigh at least 50 kg.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and to comply with study procedures, restrictions
             and requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant medical history which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator and Sponsor, may either put the subject at risk because of participation
             in the study, or influence the results, or the subject's ability to participate in the
             study.

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal hepatic or other condition known to interfere
             with disposition of the study drug (except for renal function impairment).

          -  Subjects who have a functioning kidney transplant.

          -  Acute illness, surgical procedures or trauma from within 2 weeks before enrollment
             until first administration of study drug

          -  Known or suspected history of drug abuse as judged by the Investigator.
