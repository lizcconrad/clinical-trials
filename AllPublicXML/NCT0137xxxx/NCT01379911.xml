  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Satiety is defined as the inhibition of eating, as a consequence of fullness after consuming
      food. Being able to effectively measure satiety is an important concept that has implications
      in the treatment and prevention of overweight and obesity. Increasing post-meal satiety is
      recognized a useful strategy for weight management. Recently, the category of foods marketed
      as having satiating effects has seen significant growth and this trend is expected to
      continue. The purpose of this project is to develop and validate methods for assessing the
      degree of satiety induced by foods and natural health products using commercially available
      food products.

      This trial will examine the effects of a commercially available yogurt (containing added
      protein and fibre) on self-reported satiety and hunger, as well as food intake in both
      controlled and uncontrolled settings.

    <time_frame>Outcome measures will be assessed at fasting (0 min) and postprandially (every 30 min) for 3 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>The study consists of two trial days (pre- and post home consumption) per study period, one for each of 2 yogurts. Each study visit involves a 4-hour stay at the HNRU. The pre-study visit will be followed by a 6-day yogurt self-administration period where participants will consume the assigned yogurt at breakfast. Thus, the acute satiety effects of the yogurts will be replicated in a controlled (laboratory) setting and evaluated over a 6-day period in an uncontrolled (home/lifestyle) environment.</description>
