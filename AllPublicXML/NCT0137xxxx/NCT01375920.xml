  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the most common mental health problems, with at least one in six adults
      suffering from this at some time in their life. It can become long-lasting and frequently
      recurs. Depression has a large negative impact on quality of life of patients and their
      carers and it has also been shown to be one of the leading causes of working age adults
      receiving disability payments in the UK. The need for improved treatment has been recognised
      by the Department of Health and others. Improvements in drug treatments are therefore
      required. There has been recent increased understanding of some of the causes of the frequent
      lack of complete response seen with antidepressants. The stress hormone, cortisol, is often
      elevated or poorly controlled in depression and there is laboratory and clinical research to
      show that this hormonal change reduces the benefits from antidepressants with associated poor
      outcome and memory problems. Recently it has been shown in small studies that giving
      treatments that reduce cortisol or block its harmful effects for between 1 and 3 weeks
      overcome these negative consequences. Our group is particularly interested and experienced in
      this topic. The investigators plan to study a drug that decreases cortisol levels in people
      who have not recovered with standard antidepressants so that the investigators can find out
      the usefulness of this treatment (compared with placebo (dummy tablet)) in day to day life as
      well as checking closely for side-effects (the initial studies have shown that the particular
      drug the investigators wish to study (metyrapone) has few side effects). The investigators
      will also measure cortisol and see if its level can tell us which people do best with this
      treatment. The investigators will carry out this study in 3 centres across the UK. The
      investigators will carry out some additional tests of specific sorts of memory and decision
      making and also do this while scanning the brain (in a painless test). The results of these
      tests, along with tests of brain wave patterns, should help us understand more fully how this
      new treatment is working and who responds best to it. The study will help us find out if this
      drug should be used more widely for people not responding to standard treatments and will
      also lead on to the development of other new treatments with an anti-cortisol effect to help
      tackle the major problem of poor outcome from depression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patient Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Depression Severity: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) score ≥18, consistent
             with a moderate to severe episode. The stability of the patient's clinical state will
             also be assessed at week 0. A repeat HDRS17 score at time 0 is required ≥18 or
             greater.

          2. Treatment refractoriness: assessed using the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
             staging method. This defines minimum effective doses of all currently-available
             antidepressants and an &quot;adequate trial&quot; as being for at least six weeks. For the trial
             to be considered a &quot;failure&quot;, it must have been considered by the clinical team to
             have been ineffective rather, than the drug not having been taken or tolerated.
             Patients must have failed to have responded to at least their second trial of an
             antidepressant. This equates to a minimum score of two on MGH staging. The maximum MGH
             score for inclusion in the study will be 10. A UK study showed mean MGH scores in
             primary care patients of less than one, in secondary care mental health settings of
             around five and of 11 in a population of patients referred to a tertiary centre (Dr D
             Christmas, Dundee, Personal Communication).

          3. Current antidepressant treatment: patients must be taking monotherapy or combination
             antidepressant therapy which includes a serotonergic drug (an SSRI, a tertiary amine
             tricyclic, venlafaxine, duloxetine or mirtazapine). They must not be on noradrenergic
             antidepressant monotherapy (e.g. with lofepramine, imipramine or reboxetine). At the
             point of randomisation, patients must have been on their current antidepressant
             medication, at the current dose, for a minimum of four weeks.

          4. Age: 18-65. For the mechanistic sub-studies the patients upper age limit is 60.

        Healthy Control Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged 18-60.

          2. Currently psychiatrically well, confirmed through SCID interview. HDRS17 score of ≤5,
             and no current psychotropic medication.

          3. No past history of psychiatric illness, as revealed by SCID interview, or requiring
             any treatment (formal psychotherapy or psychotropic medication).

          4. No first degree family history of psychiatric illness.

        Patient Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any other DSM IV Axis I disorder other than an anxiety disorder unless the depressive
             episode is considered to be secondary to the anxiety disorder, confirmed using the
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID).

          2. Physical co-morbidity which would render the use of Metyrapone inappropriate,
             including untreated hypothyroidism, disorders of steroid production, current, severe
             cardiac failure, current, severe or frequent angina, current renal failure or
             myocardial infarction within the last year.

          3. Pregnancy, determined by history and, if indicated, urine pregnancy test.

          4. Mothers who are breastfeeding.

          5. Use of concomitant medication that would interfere, in a pharmacodynamic or
             pharmacokinetic manner, with Metyrapone.

          6. Dependence on alcohol or other drug in the past 12 months, and/or current harmful use
             of alcohol or other drug.

          7. Recently having taken part in another research study that could interfere with the
             results of this one.

        Healthy Control Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any physical ill health which would render the use of Metyrapone inappropriate,
             including untreated hypothyroidism, disorders of steroid production, current, severe
             cardiac failure, current, severe or frequent angina, current renal failure, or
             myocardial infarction within the last year. NOTE: healthy controls are NOT treated
             with Metyrapone.

          2. Pregnancy, determined by history and, if indicated, urine pregnancy test.

          3. Mothers who are breastfeeding.

          4. Use of any medication that would interfere, in a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic
             manner, with Metyrapone.

          5. Dependence on alcohol or other drug in the past 12 months, and/or current harmful use
             of alcohol or other drug.

          6. Presence of any metal implants or foreign bodies such as from a surgical implant,
             accident or injury [this criteria only applies to those undergoing the fMRI scans -
             this is all 30 healthy subjects recruited in the North West (NW)and 15 of the 25
             recruited in the North East (NE)].

          7. Recently having taken part in another research study that could interfere with the
             results of this one.
