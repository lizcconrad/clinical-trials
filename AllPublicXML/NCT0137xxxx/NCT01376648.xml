    <textblock>
      Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is important in energy expenditure through thermogenesis although
      the regulatory factors are not well known in humans. There is evidence suggesting that the
      thyroid hormones affect BAT functions in lower mammals, but the effects of the thyroid
      hormones on BAT activity in humans are still unclear. The objective of this study was to
      investigate the effects of thyroid hormones on glucose metabolism of BAT and other organs in
      humans.

      Twenty consecutive patients with Graves'-caused hyperthyroidism who are newly diagnosed and
      untreated will be studied at the Endocrine Department of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University.
      All subjects are screened and examined by two senior investigators. Putative BAT activity is
      determined by the integrated 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT. After the first PET
      scan, hyperthyroid patients will be treated with Methimazole following clinical guidelines.
      None of them uses beta adrenergic blockade. The initial dose of methimazole employed is 10mg
      thrice a day. During follow-up, the thyroid hormone levels (free triiodothyronine and free
      thyroxine) will be measured every twenty days. The PET-CT scans and assessments will be
      repeated when the symptoms have disappeared and the thyroid hormone levels return to normal
      range. Then the dose of methimazole will be adjusted accordingly.

        Twenty Graves' disease-caused hyperthyroid patients who were newly diagnosed and untreated
        were included. All hyperthyroid patients were treated with Methimazole and had been
        followed up until their symptoms disappeared and the thyroid hormone levels went back to
        normal range.
