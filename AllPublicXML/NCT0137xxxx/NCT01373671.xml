      The primary objective of this protocol is to collect the 2-dimensional (2D) screening and
      diagnostic images, and 3-dimensional (3D) Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) scans from
      patient mammography examinations acquired on various commercially available Full Field
      Digital Mammography (FFDM) systems and the Siemens Inspiration DBT system, respectively.

    <measure>Efficacy Based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve in Breasts Analyzed With DBT as an Adjunct to FFDM vs. FFDM Alone</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of DBT and FFDM images together in comparison to FFDM images alone with respect to the ability of readers to detect and diagnose malignant lesions. A comparison of the breast-level ROC areas was used to evaluate the superiority of DBT as an adjunct to FFDM vs. FFDM alone.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects enrolled into the collection study must:

          -  Provide signed informed consent after receiving a verbal and written explanation of
             the purpose and nature of the study

          -  be females, 40 years of age or older at the screening mammographic evaluation or age
             30 or older presenting for a biopsy and have one of the following mammograms:

             o Normal cases at screening (BI-RADS® 1, 2 and 3):

               -  have a screening mammogram that includes the four standard screening views (RCC,
                  RMLO, LCC and LMLO), as well as have both MLO and CC DBT scans of each breast,

                  o Actionable cases at screening (BI-RADS® 0, 4 or 5) with final BI-RADS® 1, 2, 3,
                  4 or 5:

               -  have a screening mammogram with four SSVs and any clinically necessary diagnostic
                  mammographic views, such as straight lateral projections, rolled, magnification
                  view and spot compression views, and, both MLO and CC DBT scans of each breast
                  plus 4 SSVs repeated at the diagnostic or biopsy visit if the screening images
                  are unavailable or were acquired more than 45 days prior to DBT acquisition,

          -  have supporting ground-truth documentation for the final BI-RADS® assessment as
             follows:

               -  A one (1) year FFDM follow up without evidence of cancer for normal cases not
                  undergoing biopsy

               -  A six (6) or twelve (12) month FFDM follow up confirming benign status for biopsy
                  proven benign cases

               -  Pathology report for either benign or malignant biopsy finding

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with any of the following conditions or who have had the following procedures will
        be excluded from this study:

          -  Pregnant women or women who believe they may be pregnant or are trying to become
             pregnant.

          -  Mastectomy patients

          -  Subjects who have had lumpectomy ≤ 5 years prior to the study entry

          -  Inmates (in accordance with 45 CFR 46.306) or mentally disabled individuals

          -  BI-RADS® Category 6 (e.g., for which the mammogram was performed for the purpose of
             planning cancer therapy)

          -  BI-RADS® Category 4 or 5 without confirming pathology reports will be considered
             incomplete

          -  Subjects with mammograms that lack the required views or with views judged to be
             technically inadequate will be considered incomplete and the cases will not be
             considered for the MRMC reader studies

          -  Subjects being accrued from the screening population who know that they will not be in
             the United States or available for follow up mammograms in one year.
