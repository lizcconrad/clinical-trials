  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project imports social-personality theory and research on moral emotions and cognitions
      to the applied problems of crime, substance abuse, and HIV risk behavior. The primary aim of
      this study, a Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) of the restorative justice-inspired
      Impact of Crime (IOC) group intervention, is to examine the efficacy of treatment and to
      determine if changes in moral emotions and cognitions serve as mechanisms of action,
      explaining the impact of treatment involvement on reductions in post-release recidivism,
      substance abuse, and HIV risk behavior.
