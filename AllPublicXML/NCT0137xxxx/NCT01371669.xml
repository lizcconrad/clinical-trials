    <textblock>
      In the investigators study, and regarding results of small cohorts in the literature, the
      investigators hypothesize that hypoxemia is frequent in IPAH and CPEPH. The investigators
      will explore these patients with a one night polysomnography and transcutaneous capnography,
      searching for hypoxemia and hypercapnia and by determining its physiopathologic mechanisms.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare and severe disease of young adults, characterized by a
      progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistances leading to cardiac failure and death.
      Patients with PH are categorized in two major groups: primary PH (PPH) wich is idiopathic,
      and secondary PH associated with many conditions such as chronic pulmonary embolic diseases
      (CPED).Increase in vascular resistance in PH is secondary to vasoconstriction and to a
      proliferative remodeling process of the arterial wall leading to obliteration of the small
      arterioles. On the other hand, hypoxemia is known to cause similar changes in vascular
      architecture. Also, some small cohorts study in the literature mentioned an increase of sleep
      hypoxemia prevalence accounting for almost 70% of cases. The mechanisms of this hypoxemia are
      completely unknown.Our study is observational, prospective and transversal, searching for
      hypoxemic respiratory sleep disorders (HRSD) in PPH and in CPEPH. Included patients will have
      one night polysomnography (CIDELEC) with a continuous measurement of transcutaneous PCO2.The
      major objectives are to determine the prevalence of HRSD, their physiopathologic mechanisms
      and their possible causal factors according to PH history, clinical findings and hemodynamic
      severity.

        Patients with IPAH or CPEPH hospitalized in our pulmonary department for a standard
        follow-up. They have to be in a stable condition, as defined by the New York Heart
        Association classes for dyspnea and the six minutes walking test. Furthermore, no changes
        in medical therapy could have been made during the last three months.

             infection...)

          -  Patients who had a functional and/or a hemodynamic degradation during the last 3
             months or a change in pulmonary hypertension treatment
