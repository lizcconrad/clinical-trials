    <textblock>
      GV-TH-01 is an open label Phase 1 study of 9 HIV-1 infected adults with suppressed viremia
      who started anti-retroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of a negative HIV antibody test.
      This study has 3 phases. The first phase is the vaccination phase, where patients are
      vaccinated with pGA2/JS7 (JS7)DNA and MVA62B vaccines on a prime/boost regimen. The second
      phase of the study is a treatment interruption phase, whereby ART is interrupted for a 12
      week period approximately 8 weeks following the last vaccination. The third phase occurs
      after the 12 week treatment interruption phase and is called the treatment reinstitution
      phase, because subjects reinstitute ART and are followed for an additional 24 weeks. The
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the vaccines during the three phases of the
      study. A secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccines during the
      vaccination phase of the study.

      GV-TH-01 is an open label Phase 1 study of 9 HIV-1 infected adults with suppressed viremia
      who started anti-retroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of a negative HIV antibody test.
      This study has 3 phases. The first phase is the vaccination phase, where patients are
      vaccinated with pGA2/JS7 (JS7)DNA and MVA62B vaccines on a prime/boost regimen at weeks 1 and
      9 (JS7 DNA vaccine) and weeks 17 and 25 (MVA62B). Both vaccines express Gag, Pol, and Env.
      The second phase of the study is a treatment interruption phase, whereby ART is interrupted
      for a 12 week period approximately 8 weeks following the last vaccination. The third phase
      occurs after the 12 week treatment interruption phase and is called the treatment
