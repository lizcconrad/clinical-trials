      The purpose of this study is to evaluate surgical success or failure one year after surgery
      for pelvic organ prolapse.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective parallel cohort study comparing a laparoscopic sacral hysteropexy
      (LSHP) to a vaginal Uphold hysteropexy (VUHP). Symptomatic and anatomic improvement of pelvic
      organ prolapse will be evaluated at 3 months and 1 year.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome measure will be surgical &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; as a dichotomous outcome 1 year after surgery. Subjects will be considered a success if they meet the definitions of anatomic cure and deny vaginal bulging symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anatomic sure is defined as cervix above mid-vagina, and no prolapse beyond the hymen and no surgical treatment for pelvic organ prolapse or pessary use.
Symptomatic cure is defined as the absence of vaginal bulge symptoms as indicated by a negative response question 3 of the pelvic floor distress inventory- 20.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anatomic outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the anterior and posterior walls using point Aa, Ba, Ap and Bp, C, posterior fornix D and total vaginal length TVL; evaluate the size of the genital hiatus and perineal body; evaluation of cervical elongation and record any additional surgical procedures for anterior and posterior vaginal wall prolapse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptomatic improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>3months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Relief of symptoms of pelvic floor disorders, including incontinence, voiding dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, fecal incontinence defecation disorders and sexual dysfunction using validated instruments collected postoperatively at 3 months, and 1 year.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shortterm morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the treatment groups with respect to perioperative morbidity and mortality. Perioperative morbidity will be recorded at completion of surgery and at hospital discharge. Postoperative morbidity will be recorded at any time after discharge- 6 weeks, 3 months and 1 year and all adverse events will be documented. Perioperative measures of morbidity will include operative time, estimated blood loss, and complications. Length of hospital stay will also be recorded. Complications will be categorized using the Dindo surgical complication grading scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain and functional activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain- subjects will complete the modified surgical pain scale and a diary of pain medication use preoperatively, then daily for two weeks after surgery, then again at 6 weeks postoperatively. Postoperative functional activity level- subjects will complete the activity assessment scale which measures postoperative functional activity preoperatively, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Desires surgical treatment for uterovaginal prolapse.

          -  Symptomatic stage II-IV POP including:

          -  cystocele (AA or BA &gt; or = 0) by POP-Q and

          -  apical descent below the mid-vagina (point C &gt; -(TVL / 2)) by the POP-Q and

          -  a positive response to questions 3 of the PFDI 20: Do you usually have a bulge or
             something falling out that you can see or feel in the vaginal area? (Appendix A)

          -  Eligible for and undergoing one of the following procedures: laparoscopic sacral
             hysteropexy (LSHP) or Vaginal Uphold hysteropexy (VUHP)

          -  Female age 40 to 75.

          -  Completed childbearing confirmed by subject or practicing reliable form of birth
             control defined as permanent sterilization, hormonal contraception, abstinence, IUD.

          -  Prior hysterectomy.

          -  Patient with synthetic material placed to augment previous pelvic organ prolapse
             repair. (previous prolapse repair without synthetic mesh is acceptable).

          -  Current vaginal or pelvic foreign body complications (including but not limited to
             erosion, fistula, abscess). This includes foreign bodies of any type (e.g. synthetic
             and biologic including allograft, xenograft).

          -  Desires hysterectomy at the time of prolapse repair.

          -  Cervical elongation with anticipated need for cervical shortening at the time of
             prolapse repair as determined by surgeon.

          -  History of cervical dysplasia (diagnosed within the past 5 years) or increased risk of
             cervical dysplasia (HIV, immunocompromise, DES exposure), chronic pelvic pain, uterine
             abnormalities (symptomatic uterine fibroids, polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, cancer)
             or any uterine disease that would preclude prolapse repair with uterine preservation
             in the opinion of the surgeon.

          -  Any postmenopausal bleeding in the past 12 months (regardless of endometrial biopsy or
             ultrasound results) or any postmenopausal bleeding more than 12 months prior without
             adequate evaluation in the opinion of the investigator.
