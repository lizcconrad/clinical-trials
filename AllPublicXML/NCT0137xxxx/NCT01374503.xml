  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-man Phase I study is to determine whether the CXCR4-inhibitor
      ALX-0651 is safe and effective after single or multiple intravenous administrations to
      healthy male volunteers.

    <description>Plasma concentration of ALX-0651 will be determined at different timepoints between predose and 48 hours after the last study drug administration. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ALX-0651 will be derived from the resulting plasma concentration versus time plots.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male volunteers, aged &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 55 at screening.

          -  Willing to consent to using an effective contraceptive method for at least 3 months
             after test substance administration.

          -  Non-smokers, or ex-smokers abstinent from tobacco for at least 1 year.

          -  Body mass index (BMI): 19 - 29 kg/m2 (extremes included).

          -  Haematology and chemistry parameters within normal range or showing no clinically
             relevant deviations, as judged by the Medical Investigator. For haematology,
             haemoglobin and white blood cell (WBC) count must be within normal limits. For
             chemistry, calcium, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), (alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and lactate
             dehydrogenase (LDH) must be within normal limits.

          -  Normal electrocardiogram, showing no clinically relevant deviations, as judged by the
             Investigator. QTc &lt;= 450 ms.

          -  No history or presence of diseases of the kidneys, heart, lungs, liver,
             gastrointestinal tract or endocrine organs, or other conditions known to interfere
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  No history of clinically relevant allergies.

          -  Obtained, signed and dated informed consent.

          -  Ability and willingness to comply with protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intake of any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14 days prior to
             dosing.

          -  Intake of vitamin A derivates or retinoids within 30 days prior to the start of drug
             administration.

          -  History of thrombosis.

          -  Chronic infection or acute significant infection or fever within the last 5 weeks
             prior to the start of test substance administration.

          -  Subjects with any abnormality of the spleen (confirmed by echography) or history of
             splenic disease, or subjects that underwent splenectomy in the past.

          -  Blood donation (&gt;500 ml) or a comparable blood loss within three months prior to the
             start of drug administration.

          -  Subjects who, in the investigator's opinion, may not be capable of following the study
             schedule for any reason, with special emphasis on eligibility for the aphaeresis
             procedure.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug study within 60 days prior to drug
             administration, or within less than 6 times the terminal elimination half-life of the
             test substance used in the respective trial (whichever is longer).

          -  Malignancy, or prior malignancy, with a disease-free interval of &lt; 5 years after
             diagnosis and intervention, except curative treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer or
             resected carcinoma in situ.
