    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after enrollment of the last participant (maximum up to 27 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from baseline to the date of first occurrence of disease progression or death. According to RECIST v1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. PFS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Response by Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to disease progression or end of study (up to 12 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed according to RECIST v1.1. Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes must decrease to normal (short axis less than 10 mm), with no new lesions. Partial response (PR): greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease, and no new lesions. PD: &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD): not qualifying for CR, PR, or PD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to disease progression or end of study (up to 12 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response was defined as the percentage of participants with CR or PR as best overall response by RECIST v1.1. To be assigned the status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements were to be confirmed by repeated assessments no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than 10 mm), with no new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in sum for target nodes, while longest diameter was used in sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease, and no new lesions. Participants with no tumor assessment after start of study treatment were considered as non-responders. The percentage of participants with response is presented.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving CR, PR, or SD as Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to disease progression or end of study (up to 12 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Disease Control Rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had CR or PR or SD as Best Overall Response achieved within the time between the first drug administration and documented disease progression or end of study. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than 10 mm), with no new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease, and no new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, or PD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Primary and Secondary Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to disease progression (up to 12 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Primary resistance: participants did not reach SD or PR or CR before going to PD. Secondary resistance: participants experienced PD after having reached SD or PR or CR at least once. CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes must decrease to normal (short axis less than 10 mm), with no new lesions. PR: &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease, and no new lesions. PD: &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

To be assigned the status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements were to be confirmed by repeated assessments no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than 10 mm), with no new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in sum for target nodes, while longest diameter was used in sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease, and no new lesions. Participants with no tumor assessment after start of study treatment were considered as non-responders. The percentage of participants with response is presented.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving CR, PR, or SD as Best Overall Response</title>
        <description>The Disease Control Rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had CR or PR or SD as Best Overall Response achieved within the time between the first drug administration and documented disease progression or end of study. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than 10 mm), with no new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease, and no new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, or PD.</description>
