    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a more feasible method for
      reducing the pain and distress of childhood immunization with the standard method in use at
      the Pediatric Medical Group. A secondary aim is to evaluate the impact of parental
      involvement on the parent and child satisfaction with the immunization experience.

      Study Hypotheses: In the standard, pre-kindergarten, two- or three vaccine sequence, there
      will be no statistically significant group differences between PPT and ST with respect to:

        1. Child self-reported pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) scale13 (primary
           outcome);

        2. Parent report of child pain using the FPS-R;

        3. Observer-rated child distress and pain using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and
           Consolability (FLACC) scale14;

        4. Parent and child satisfaction with pain management during immunization measured by a
           5-point Likert type scales;

        5. Time required for completion of immunization from initiation of ST or PPT to 2 minutes
           after completion of the last injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Berberich and Landman conducted a randomized clinical trial demonstrating efficacy of a
      multimodal distraction technique to reduce immunization distress (RID) in 4-6 year old
      children receiving pre-kindergarten immunizations. Widespread implementation would require
      fewer steps and a reduction of personnel and the current study addresses the practical time
      and personnel limitations of the method. The current RID trial proposes a randomized design
      to compare our current method, the standard technique, (ST), with its minimally altered
      approach where arm gripping and rubbing adjacent to the injection site are to be performed by
      the medical assistant conducting the injection, substituting for the non-commercially
      available 'arm gripper'. Pressure and rubbing stimuli at injection sites are documented to be
      equally effective. The ST will be compared against the parental participation technique,
      (PPT), whereby the parent participates in the delivery of pain-relieving interventions in
      lieu of the second medical assistant. The primary aim of the present proposal is to compare
      the effectiveness of the more feasible PPT to the ST in reducing the pain and distress of
      childhood immunization. A secondary aim is to evaluate the impact of parental involvement on
      the parent and child satisfaction with the immunization experience.
