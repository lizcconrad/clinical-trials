  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence and length of treatment with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI) therapy may be
      associated with improved clinical outcomes for patients with enlarged prostates (EP) and
      lower health care related costs.

      The objectives of this study are to quantify 1.) the relationship between 5ARI adherence and
      length of therapy and the likelihood of acute urinary retention (AUR), prostate-related
      surgery (emergency and non-emergency), and clinical progression (defined as AUR and/or
      prostate-related surgery); and 2.) the monthly EP-related, medical costs in a Medicaid and
      Medicare population. The null hypothesis is that no differences will be observed in the
      outcomes and costs of patients who adhere to long-term 5ARI therapy and those who do not. The
      test hypothesis is that patients with higher levels of adherence to 5ARI for a longer period
      of time will experience significantly fewer adverse outcomes and significantly lower
      treatment costs.

      The data source for this analysis is the MarketScan database, which contains medical and
      pharmacy claims for commercial health plan members and Medicare recipients. Medical and
      pharmacy claims data are sourced directly from health plans and employers. The database
      represents approximately 18 to 20 million individuals annually and nearly 22 million Medicaid
      enrollees from multiple states. The database includes the Medicare-covered portion of
      payment, the employer-paid portion, and any out-of-pocket expenses paid by the beneficiary.

      The study design is a retrospective cohort analysis. Each patient's index date was defined as
      the date of the first fill for a 5ARI prescription.

        The study will include retrospective data from male patients aged 65 years and older with
        continuous health plan enrollment from July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2009. Patient records will
        be reviewed for data from the 6-months prior to and 1-year following the index date, which
        represents the first prescription fill for a 5ARI
