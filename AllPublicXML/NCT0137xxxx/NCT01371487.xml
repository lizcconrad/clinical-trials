      open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover study with incomplete wash-out to
      evaluate the effect of a high-fat, high calorie meal on the single dose PK of GSK1120212 in
      subjects with solid tumors. Subjects will be assigned to a fast/fed sequence according to the
      randomization code provided to the sites by GSK with subjects randomized to one of 2 possible
      treatment sequences (Table 1) with each sequence consisting of 2 treatments: a single 2.0 mg
      dose of GSK1120212 administered under fasted conditions and a single 2.0 mg dose of
      GSK1120212 administered with a high-fat, high-calorie meal
