    <textblock>
      Postherpetic Neuralgia is a painful nerve condition that can occur when nerve fibers are
      damaged following an outbreak of shingles.

      The purpose of this study is to identify and study abnormalities in the nerves and cells in
      the of patients with postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN) and characterize changes that could be
      responsible for causing nerve pain. This data will be compared to the tissue of healthy
      volunteers. Our goal is that this information will lead to the development of better
      treatment options for people with painful nerve conditions.

    <description>Using a punch biopsy, the study doctor will take a small sample of skin (3mm diameter) from a pre-defined site of the subject. For PHN patients, 4 biopsies will be obtained: 2 in an area of PHN and 2 in a contralateral control site. Biopsy sites for each PHN control subject will be matched anatomically to the corresponding PHN patient with two biopsies each from symmetrical sites in a left and right dermatome. One biopsy from each site in each subject will be fixed in a left and right dermatome. One biopsy from each site in each subject will fixed yb immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunocytochemical analysis, and the second biopsy form each site will be flash frozen for assessments of mRNA expression.</description>
