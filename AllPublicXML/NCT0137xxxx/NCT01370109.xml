  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib are used in the treatment of renal cell
      carcinoma and have significant off-target effects with cardiac toxicity and resultant
      ventricular cardiac dysfunction being a major concern. However, the mechanisms of these
      effects in humans remains poorly defined, as are the clinical methods to risk stratify and
      identify patients who will ultimately suffer from cardiac dysfunction. The goal of this
      multi-center study is to characterize the cardiovascular measures of cardiac function; 2)
      comprehensive measures of arterial function and left ventricular afterload; 3) biomarkers
      reflective of the pathophysiologic alterations. Through this work, the investigators will
      translate our basic understanding of sunitinib cardiotoxicity to humans and identify early
      predictors of sunitinib cardiotoxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib have dramatically improved the overall
      management of certaincancers including renal cell carcinoma. However, recent data suggest
      that these therapieshave significant off-target effects with cardiac toxicity, including
      significant hypertension and ventricular cardiac dysfunction being a major concern. However,
      the biologic mechanisms underlying cardiotoxicty in humans remain poorly defined. Moreover,
      there is a critical need to develop methods to improve the risk stratification and early
      identification of patients who will suffer from hypertension and cardiac dysfunction with
      exposure to therapy. The over all objectives ofthis study are to further characterize the
      cardiovascular changes that occur with sunitinib exposure in order to improve our
      understanding of sunitib toxicity and determine early, mechanistically and clinically
      relevant predictors to identify patients at increased risk of hyptertension and cardiac
      dysfunction. The specific aims of this study are: 1) To define the changes in arterial
      hemodynamics that may occur with exposure to sunitinib, 2) To define the changes in sensitive
      echocardiographic measures of cardiac function that may occur with exposure to sunitinib, 3)
      To determine blood markers that are associated with changes in vasculature or cardiac
      function with exposure to sunitinib. and 4) To determine if there are early imaging or
      biomarker predictors of subitinib cardiotoxicity.
