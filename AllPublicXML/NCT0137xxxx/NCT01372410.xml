    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further characterize the dose response of GSK573719 at doses
      of 15.6 micrograms (mcg) to 125 mcg once daily in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). Treatment with doses of GSK573719 dosed twice daily will also be included to
      further evaluate dosing frequency. Treatment with tiotropium (18 mcg) once daily via the
      Handihaler will be included as an active control. A placebo treatment will be included in
      order to evaluate absolute treatment effect of the different doses of GSK573719.

    <textblock>
      Inhaled bronchodilators, such as beta 2 agonists and anticholinergics, and inhaled
      corticosteroids are the mainstays of therapy in patients diagnosed with COPD. Anticholinergic
      bronchodilators or long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists function by blocking
      endogenous airway smooth muscle cholinergic tone. Treatment with anticholinergics has been
      shown to significantly improve forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), resting and
      dynamic lung hyperinflation, symptoms, and exercise capacity in patients with COPD. Currently
      tiotropium is the only approved long acting muscarinic antagonist available for treatment of
      COPD.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, three way crossover,
      incomplete block study to evaluate 4 doses of GSK573719 inhaled once daily and 2 doses of
      GSK573719 inhaled twice daily over 7 days in patients with COPD. Tiotropium will be included
      as an open label active comparator. A placebo treatment will be included to evaluate
      treatment effect of each GSK573719 dose. Pharmacokinetic profiles of GSK573719 will also be
      determined. Each eligible subject will receive a sequence of 3 of 8 potential treatments for
      a total of 3 treatment periods per subject. There will be 7 clinic visits, during three of
      which 24 hour serial spirometry will be performed. The total duration of subject
      participation is approximately 9 weeks.

    <measure>Final Dose-response Model for Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 8 of each treatment period (up to Study Day 50)</time_frame>
    <description>The trough FEV1 data for both the once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) UMEC doses were included in a parametric analysis in order to evaluate trough FEV1dose response. The Day 8 dataset and a pooled dataset for Day 7 and Day 8 were analyzed separately and reported. The rationale for pooling Day 7 and Day 8 (post-hoc analysis) was to ensure informative interpretation of FEV1 response as a function of dose given the repeated measures for trough FEV1 response within each participant on different days. The fixed-effects parameters of the dose response model include Emax (the maximum predicted FEV1 response), ED50 (potency), and S0 (estimated Baseline FEV1). FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Data for Emax and S0 are reported in this table. mITT=Modified Intent-to-Treat; par.=participants; BL=Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Day 8 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8 of each treatment period (up to Study Day 50)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 8 is defined as the value obtained 24 hours after the morning dose administered on Day 7. Analysis was performed using a mixed model with covariates of mean Baseline, period Baseline, treatment, and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. Baseline is the FEV1 value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant, and period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each particiapant. Change from Baseline for each treatment period is the trough FEV1 at Day 8 minus the Baseline value for that treatment period.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Serial FEV1 Over Time on Day 7 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 7 of each treatment period (TP; up to Study Day 49)</time_frame>
    <description>Serial FEV1 for once daily dosing is recorded at the pre-AM dose (AMD; time 0 hour [h]) and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12,13, 15, 23, and 24 hours after the AMD on Day 7. For twice daily dosing, the 12 h AMD corresponds to the pre-PM dose (PMD), the 13 h AMD corresponds to the 1 h PMD, the 15 h AMD corresponds to the 3 h PMD, the 23 h AMD corresponds to the 11 h PMD, and the 24 h AMD corresponds to the 12 h PMD in this table. Analysis was performed using a mixed model with covariates of mean BL, period BL, treatment, period, time, time by period BL interaction, time by mean BL interaction, and time by treatment interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. BL is the value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BLis the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant. Change from BL for each timepoint within a TP is the serial FEV1 measure at that timepoint minus the BL value for that TP.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Weighted Mean FEV1 Over 0 to 24 Hours After the Morning Dosing on Day 7 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 7 of each treatment period (TP; up to Study Day 49)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The weighted mean FEV1 was calculated using 0-24 hour post-dose measurements at Day 7 of each treatment period, which included pre-dose and post-dose 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 23, and 24 hours. Analysis was performed using a mixed model with covariates of mean BL, period BL, treatment, and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. BL is the FEV1 value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant. Change from BL for each TP is the weighted mean FEV1 at Day 7 minus the BL value for that TP.</description>

        <title>Final Dose-response Model for Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)</title>
        <description>The trough FEV1 data for both the once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) UMEC doses were included in a parametric analysis in order to evaluate trough FEV1dose response. The Day 8 dataset and a pooled dataset for Day 7 and Day 8 were analyzed separately and reported. The rationale for pooling Day 7 and Day 8 (post-hoc analysis) was to ensure informative interpretation of FEV1 response as a function of dose given the repeated measures for trough FEV1 response within each participant on different days. The fixed-effects parameters of the dose response model include Emax (the maximum predicted FEV1 response), ED50 (potency), and S0 (estimated Baseline FEV1). FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Data for Emax and S0 are reported in this table. mITT=Modified Intent-to-Treat; par.=participants; BL=Baseline.</description>

        <population>mITT Population: par. randomized to treatment who received &gt;=1 dose of study medication. Par. with &gt;=1 post-BL assessment and non-missing covariate data are included in the analysis. Different par. may have been analyzed at different time points (n=X in category titles); the overall number of par. analyzed reflects everyone in the mITT Population.</population>

          <title>Final Dose-response Model for Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)</title>
          <description>The trough FEV1 data for both the once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) UMEC doses were included in a parametric analysis in order to evaluate trough FEV1dose response. The Day 8 dataset and a pooled dataset for Day 7 and Day 8 were analyzed separately and reported. The rationale for pooling Day 7 and Day 8 (post-hoc analysis) was to ensure informative interpretation of FEV1 response as a function of dose given the repeated measures for trough FEV1 response within each participant on different days. The fixed-effects parameters of the dose response model include Emax (the maximum predicted FEV1 response), ED50 (potency), and S0 (estimated Baseline FEV1). FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Data for Emax and S0 are reported in this table. mITT=Modified Intent-to-Treat; par.=participants; BL=Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Serial FEV1 Over Time on Day 7 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Serial FEV1 for once daily dosing is recorded at the pre-AM dose (AMD; time 0 hour [h]) and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12,13, 15, 23, and 24 hours after the AMD on Day 7. For twice daily dosing, the 12 h AMD corresponds to the pre-PM dose (PMD), the 13 h AMD corresponds to the 1 h PMD, the 15 h AMD corresponds to the 3 h PMD, the 23 h AMD corresponds to the 11 h PMD, and the 24 h AMD corresponds to the 12 h PMD in this table. Analysis was performed using a mixed model with covariates of mean BL, period BL, treatment, period, time, time by period BL interaction, time by mean BL interaction, and time by treatment interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. BL is the value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BLis the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant. Change from BL for each timepoint within a TP is the serial FEV1 measure at that timepoint minus the BL value for that TP.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Weighted Mean FEV1 Over 0 to 24 Hours After the Morning Dosing on Day 7 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The weighted mean FEV1 was calculated using 0-24 hour post-dose measurements at Day 7 of each treatment period, which included pre-dose and post-dose 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13, 15, 23, and 24 hours. Analysis was performed using a mixed model with covariates of mean BL, period BL, treatment, and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. BL is the FEV1 value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each TP, mean BL is the mean of the BLs for each participant, and period BL is the difference between the BL and the mean BL in each TP for each participant. Change from BL for each TP is the weighted mean FEV1 at Day 7 minus the BL value for that TP.</description>

        <title>Final Dose-response Model for Trough FEV1 for ED50 (Potency) Parameter</title>
        <description>The trough FEV1 data for both the once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) UMEC doses were included in a parametric analysis in order to evaluate dose response. Both a Day 8 dataset and a pooled dataset for Day 7 and Day 8 were analyzed and reported. The rationale for pooling Day 7 and Day 8 (post-hoc analysis) was to ensure informative interpretation of FEV1 response as a function of dose given the repeated measures for trough FEV1 response within each participant on different days. ED50 is defined as the potency and is the dose that yields 50% of Emax (maximum predicted FEV1 response). FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Day 8 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 8 is defined as the value obtained 24 hours after the morning dose administered on Day 7. Analysis was performed using a mixed model with covariates of mean Baseline, period Baseline, treatment, and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. Baseline is the FEV1 value recorded pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment period, mean Baseline is the mean of the Baselines for each participant, and period Baseline is the difference between the Baseline and the mean Baseline in each treatment period for each particiapant. Change from Baseline for each treatment period is the trough FEV1 at Day 8 minus the Baseline value for that treatment period.</description>
