    <textblock>
      The study is designed to detect adverse drug reactions (particularly clinically significant
      adverse drug reactions) occurring in clinical settings, to examine factors likely to affect
      the safety and efficacy of sumatriptan tablet, and to discuss the need of special
      investigation and postmarketing clinical study.

      A special focus was placed on the investigation of occurrence of &quot;ischaemic heart
      disease-like events including arrhythmia, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction&quot; in the
      present study.
