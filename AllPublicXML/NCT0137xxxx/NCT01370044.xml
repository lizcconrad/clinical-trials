      The aim of this clinical trail is to evaluate the efficacy of a Carbogen inhalation in
      patients with febrile seizures compared to a placebo-inhalation.

      Further aims are the evaluation of the safety of the Carbogen inhalation via a low-pressure
      can with a breathing mask in a home-setting, the manageability of the Carbogen inhalation via
      a low pressure can with a breathing mask in a home-setting or on the way (mobility), the
      quality of life of the parents and children using the low pressure can with a breathing mask
      in a home-setting or on the way (mobility) and the contentment and anxiety of the parents.

      DIoxide for the treatment of Febrile seizures: rationale, feasibility, and design of the
      CARDIF-study. J Transl Med. 2013 Jun 27;11:157. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-11-157.

      BACKGROUND: 2-8% of all children aged between 6 months and 5 years have febrile seizures.
      Often these seizures cease spontaneously, however depending on different national guidelines,
      20-40% of the patients would need therapeutic intervention. For seizures longer than 3-5
      minutes application of rectal diazepam, buccal midazolam or sublingual lorazepam is
      recommended. Benzodiazepines may be ineffective in some patients or cause prolonged sedation
      and fatigue. Preclinical investigations in a rat model provided evidence that febrile
      seizures may be triggered by respiratory alkalosis, which was subsequently confirmed by a
      retrospective clinical observation. Further, individual therapeutic interventions
      demonstrated that a pCO2-elevation via re-breathing or inhalation of 5% CO2 instantly stopped
      the febrile seizures. Here, we present the protocol for an interventional clinical trial to
      test the hypothesis that the application of 5% CO2 is effective and safe to suppress febrile
      seizures in children.

      METHODS: The CARDIF (CARbon DIoxide against Febrile seizures) trial is a monocentric,
      prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. A total of 288 patients with
      a life history of at least one febrile seizure will be randomized to receive either carbogen
      (5% CO2 plus 95% O2) or placebo (100% O2). As recurrences of febrile seizures mainly occur at
      home, the study medication will be administered by the parents through a low-pressure can
      fitted with a respiratory mask. The primary outcome measure is the efficacy of carbogen to
      interrupt febrile seizures. As secondary outcome parameters we assess safety, practicability
      to use the can, quality of life, contentedness, anxiousness and mobility of the parents.

      PROSPECT: The CARDIF trial has the potential to develop a new therapy for the suppression of
      febrile seizures by redressing the normal physiological state. This would offer an
      alternative to the currently suggested treatment with benzodiazepines. This study is an
      example of academic translational research from the study of animal physiology to a new
      therapy.
