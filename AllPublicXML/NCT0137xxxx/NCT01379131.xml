  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some myocardial infarctions (MI) occur as the first manifestation of atherosclerotic disease.
      Such MIs are important because of the high likelihood of missed opportunities for prevention.
      A recent analysis using CALIBER data estimated this proportion at 60%.

      Further to this research, another level of complexity can be added to improve our
      understanding of these MIs. This is the concept of a completely 'unanticipated' MI, which can
      be defined as: MI occurring as the first manifestation of atherosclerotic disease and without
      any traditional cardiovascular risk factors and without any prior chest pain. Such
      'unanticipated' MIs cannot be foreseen by the medical profession and their frequency in the
      population is unknown.

      Therefore the aim of this study is to describe the distribution of previously diagnosed
      cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factors and chest pain in patients with first MI.
      This will provide an estimate of the number of 'unanticipated' MIs and of the levels of risk
      factors in unheralded, compared to heralded MI.

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

      Using data from GPRD, MINAP, ONS mortality data and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), this
      study will identify patients with a first MI (STEMI and non-STEMI). Information from
      in-patient hospital visits, general practice data and self-reported data in MINAP, this study
      will allow the quantification of the level and timing of cardiovascular disease before first
      MI. It will also measure the levels of cardiovascular risk factors and chest pain occurring
      before MI.

        The study population is comprised of patients registered at those GPRD practices that
        agreed to the linkage with the MINAP database, and whose practices are &quot;up to standard&quot;
        according to GPRD criteria. Practices taking part in the GPRD are chosen to be
        representative of all UK practices, and 98% of people in the UK are registered with a GP.
        Therefore the GPRD should be a representative sample of the UK population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in GPRD practices which are deemed &quot;up to standard&quot; by GPRD criteria will be
             included if their practice agreed to be linked to the MINAP dataset.

          -  Age over 18.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded after experiencing their first MI.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they do not fulfil one of the inclusion criteria.
