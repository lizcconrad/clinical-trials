      The purpose of this study is to assess stool consistency, in combination with additional
      health-related parameters including gastrointestinal tolerance and health-related quality of
      life, in a large sample of Chinese infants. We will also assess the timing of, frequency, and
      reasons for changes in the choice of formula or method of feeding among infants in this
      sample, as well as incidence of common infant illness and associated healthcare usage.
      Anthropometric measures and the frequency and duration of physician- and parent-reported
      gastrointestinal and other adverse events will be evaluated.

        Healthy term infants aged approximately 42 days (range 35 - 49 days) who are brought to the

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, term (37-42 weeks gestation), singleton infant at birth.

          -  Post-natal age between 35 and 49 days (date of birth = day 0) at time of study entry.

          -  At enrollment, weight-for-age ≥ 5th and ≤ 95th percentile according to World Health
             Organization growth tables / charts.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants who are consuming any types/brands of formula other than the new study formula
             (either exclusively or in a mixed feeding regimen) at time of study enrollment.

          -  Suspected or documented severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the infant inappropriate for entry into the study.
