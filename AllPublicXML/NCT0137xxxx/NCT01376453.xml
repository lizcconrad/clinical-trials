  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find the maximum tolerable dose of sorafenib when
      administered along with another drug called 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and to find out more about
      whether these drugs, along with radiation, can help people with rectal cancer when given
      before surgery. 5-FU and radiation are both approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for use in people with rectal cancer.

      The investigators will utilize a standard 3 + 3 phase I study design. In the phase I part of
      the study, the investigators will attempt dose escalation of sorafenib in combination with
      standard infusional 5-FU and external beam at standard doses. Clinical staging should be done
      by endorectal ultrasound (ERUS) and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for T and N
      stage; chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) for staging of metastatic disease; undergo
      sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy done by crude odds ratios (CORS); biopsy is taken for
      diagnosis and extra is sent for tissue bank. At the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib
      we will expand the cohort to 6 more patients to further evaluate toxicity profile and
      efficacy.

      Participants' study regimen will include 5 ½ weeks of radiation. Radiation sessions will be
      daily, Monday through Friday, except for holidays. 5-FU will be delivered at a dose of 225
      mg/m² daily through a catheter in a large vein continuously until the last day of radiation.
      In addition, sorafenib will be taken by mouth twice daily every day until the last day of
      radiation. The dose of sorafenib participants may receive will be one of the following: 200
      mg every other day, 200 mg daily, 400 mg daily, or 800 mg daily. Following completion of this
      phase of the study, participants will receive no study drug or radiation for one month. At 4
      to 5 weeks after stopping study drug and radiation, participants will have another CT scan or
      MRI to assess their cancer. About 6 to 8 weeks after the end of radiation, participants will
      undergo surgery and every effort will be made to remove the tumor. The surgery will occur
      just as it would if participants were not in the study, except that a portion of their tumor
      obtained during surgery will be used for research biomarker testing (as described in the
      consent form).

      Approximately 6 -10 weeks after participants' surgery, when they have adequately healed, they
      may receive additional chemotherapy at their study doctor's discretion.
