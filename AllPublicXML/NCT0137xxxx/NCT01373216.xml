  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GLP-1 has not only beneficial effects on glucose metabolism but also direct positive effects
      on cardiac function and metabolism in both experimental models and in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Clinical data on the effects of GLP-1 agonists on cardiac function and
      glucose control in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are not known. Based on the results of
      experimental studies there is a potential for exenatide to positively influence both cardiac
      function and glucose metabolism in cardiac surgery patients with and without type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. The primary endpoint of this study is to examine whether pre- and peri-operative
      administration of exenatide affects perioperative hemodynamics, echocardiographic parameters,
      necessity of antiarrhythmic and inotropic treatment and glucose control in patients with
      coronary atherosclerosis and decreased left ventricular function undergoing elective coronary
      artery bypass grafting operation (CABG). In addition, safety and tolerability of
      peri-operative administration of exenatide in these patients will be examined as a secondary
      study objective.
