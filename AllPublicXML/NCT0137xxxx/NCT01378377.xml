    <textblock>
      The research trial is testing the experimental drug MSC1936369B (Pimasertib) and the drug
      TORISEL, given together, in the treatment of advanced solid tumors. The primary purpose of
      the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D)
      of the drug combination.

    <description>The starting dose of MSC1936369B will be 45mg QD.
The starting dose of Temsirolimus will be 12.5 mg/week
Dosing of MSC1936369B and Temsirolimus will occur in combination: MSC1936369B will be taken orally, QD, on days 1-15 and temsirolimus will be infused IV on days 1, 8 and 15 in successive 21-day cycles. Dose escalation will proceed until Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached.
Number of Cycles: The treatment will be continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, investigator's decision to discontinue treatment, or withdrawal of consent by the subject.</description>
