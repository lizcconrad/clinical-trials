  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency department patients receiving opioid pain medicine such as morphine, fentanyl, or
      Dilaudid are eligible. After receiving the pain medication, a small soft plastic tube will be
      placed between the upper lip and nose. This tube is used to measure the amount of carbon
      dioxide the patient is breathing out. It can also be used to deliver oxygen if the provider
      feels the patient needs it. The carbon dioxide breathed out is measured and collected. Other
      information collected are height, weight, and vital signs. Patient participation time is
      approximately 2 hours during the emergency department visit.
