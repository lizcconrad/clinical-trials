    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine if individuals who had a stroke more than one
      year before entering the study and whose ankles remain substantially impaired are able to
      sense and move the affected leg better after 9-13 weeks of treatment with a robotic therapy
      device (AMES).

      Our research objective is to develop procedures to rehabilitate those stroke patients who,
      through conventional therapies, are not brought to a level of maximal recovery. The aims of
      the proposed project are to obtain a set of data from a total of 20 chronic stroke subjects,
      all with severe lower extremity disability, between the ages of 18-85, using a robotic
      therapeutic device placed in a rehabilitation clinic. This data will allow us to quantify the
      extent to which a combination of robotic-assisted exercise and tendon vibration from the AMES
      beta device induces secondary recovery from the effects of stroke on the lower extremity.

    <description>An investigational device flexes and extends the ankle over a range of 30 degrees while vibrators stimulate the tendons attached to muscles that move the foot. The subject's task is to assist the motion of the device by pulling or pushing with the foot. Feedback of ankle torque or the electrical signal produced by the muscles (EMG) while the subject is assisting the motion is provided during the 30 treatment sessions.</description>
