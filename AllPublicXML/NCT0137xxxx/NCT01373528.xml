      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a complex inflammatory disease that is treated primarily with
      sinus surgery and the long-term use of topical steroid therapy. Budesonide irrigation is a
      common method of topical steroid treatment for these patients. However, the effects of
      budesonide irrigation on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with CRS
      following sinus surgery, is as of yet not defined. The objective of this study is to
      determine if topical sinonasal budesonide steroid irrigation leads to acute recoverable
      and/or long-term suppression of the HPA axis. Participants in this prospective cohort study
      will have CRS and have recently undergone endoscopic sinus surgery. They will also have had
      planned use of budesonide irrigations as their postoperative medical treatment. The acute
      effects of this treatment on the HPA axis will be evaluated using serial serum cortisol
      measurements both the day before and the day of the first budesonide irrigation. The
      long-term effect of sinonasal budesonide irrigation will be evaluated using both a pre- and
      post-treatment adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test as well as repeated urine
      free cortisol levels over the length of the study. The results will determine the need for
      additional steroids when patients stop treatment or with a physiologic stressful event.

      CRS is an inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses that is difficult to treat. Current
      treatment strategies rely upon medical treatment with the long-term daily use of a topical
      corticosteroid as its foundation. Once medical therapy becomes ineffective at controlling CRS
      and its resultant symptoms, surgical treatment is offered. Following surgery, patients must
      again continue with medical treatment to control the inflammation present in CRS. Previously,
      topical steroids could be applied using only a commercially prepared applicator that is
      effective at treating no more than the front of the nose and parts of the paranasal sinuses.
      However, relatively new nasal saline irrigation devices have made it possible to treat all of
      the paranasal sinuses. Corticosteroid medication can be added directly to the saline
      irrigation. In an operated patient the sinus openings have been greatly enlarged which then
      allows the irrigation to more effectively reach all of the paranasal sinuses. Therefore,
      irrigation with a corticosteroid solution allows for better delivery of the corticosteroid
      medication to treat the mucosal inflammation that is widely present. More effective treatment
      of the paranasal sinus inflammation thereby leads to improved control of inflammation and to
      the alleviation of patient symptoms such as chronic facial and dental pain, headache,
      obstructed nasal breathing, loss of smell and discharge from the nose. As of yet, with this
      method of treatment it has not been determined whether there is significant systemic
      absorption and a resultant suppression of the HPA axis.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. a single 0.5 mg dose of budesonide will result in acute but recoverable suppression of
           pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion with a resultant transient
           decrease in adrenal cortisol production; and that

        2. the long term use of budesonide, 0.5 mg twice daily (BID), will result in a gradual and
           cumulative suppression of the HPA axis to the extent that significant hypocortisolism
           will be present when budesonide irrigation is discontinued necessitating replacement
           glucocorticoid therapy.

      Specific Aim of Project This study will determine if there is acute recoverable and long-term
      suppression of the HPA axis when budesonide irrigations are used in patients with CRS
      following endoscopic sinus surgery. This important information is currently not available in
      the literature.
