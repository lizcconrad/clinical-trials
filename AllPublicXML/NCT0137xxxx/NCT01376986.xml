      The aim of the study is to investigate different novel IC technologies for promoting physical
      activity and health and preventing obesity in young men. The purpose is to provide new
      evidence-based knowledge on the effectiveness of an ICT-based physical activation and to
      identify factors predicting a positive response.

      Specific objectives

        -  to identify the factors associated with physical activity and physical activity
           relationship in young men

        -  to develop an interactive method, based on peer networks, aimed at activating young men
           with use of their own skills, participation and modern ICT

        -  to assess the effectiveness of the chosen activation on the physical activity, weight,
           fitness, health, and relationship towards physical activity among young men

      The study population consists of all conscription aged men in the Oulu area in 2011-2013
      (n=4000). Conscription-aged men provide a large, population based representative sample of
      young men. In Finland military service is mandatory and annually all 18-year old men are
      called for military service. In the call-ups fitness for service is determined based on
      medical examination.

      All those who are determined fit for service or who are granted postponement due to obesity
      will be invited for the activation intervention study. Those with severe obesity are exempted
      from service, but will also participate in the trial. After the call-up, the men will be
      randomised to an intervention group and a control group. The primary outcome variable is
      change in physical activity.

      The study will be conducted during 2011-2015. The study includes technology development (ICT
      platform), collection of cross-sectional data at the call-ups, and a 6-month physical
      activity intervention (a randomized controlled trial) implemented between the call-up and
      start of military service. Game mechanics are integrated into the ICT platform to increase
      user engagement and participation.

      Physical activity, fitness (aerobic and muscular), body composition,lifestyle and
      psychological and physical health will be followed. In addition, the subjects' entry into
      military service and its course will be followed.
