  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to establish chimerism and avoid graft-versus-host-disease
      (GVHD) in patients with inherited metabolic disorders.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective for the study is to establish chimerism following reduced intensity
      conditioning with no grade III/IV GVHD. The primary endpoint we will follow is production of
      the missing enzyme at ≥ 10% of the normal level at day 180 post-transplant in &gt; 90% of
      patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorder / inborn
             error of metabolism. Diagnosis should be confirmed by appropriate test(s) (enzyme
             and/or mutation analysis) before study entry. Patients must not be eligible for
             myeloablative chemotherapy as a preparative regimen for transplant due to age,
             co-morbidities or organ dysfunction.

             Inborn errors of metabolism / Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMD) eligible for this
             study include the following:

               -  Hurler Syndrome (MPS I)

               -  Hurler-Scheie Syndrome with early neurologic involvement and/or sensitization to
                  ERT

               -  Hunter Syndrome (MPS II)

               -  Sanfilippo Syndrome (MPS III)

               -  Krabbe Disease (Globoid Leukodystrophy)

               -  Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD and AMN)

               -  Sandhoff Disease

               -  Tay Sachs Disease

               -  Pelizaeus Merzbacher (PMD)

               -  Alpha-mannosidosis

          2. Patients must have adequate function of other organ systems as measured by:

               -  Creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance ≥60
                  cc/min/1.73m2. Newborns must have a creatinine clearance ≥ 25 cc/min. For babies
                  less than or equal to 3 months of age, the raw value on glomerular filtration
                  rate (GFR) must be ≥ 1 cc/kg/min.

               -  Hepatic transaminases (ALT/AST) 2.5 x normal, bilirubin &lt;2.0mg/dl

               -  Normal cardiac function by echocardiogram or radionuclide scan (ejection fraction
                  or shortening fraction &gt;80% of normal value for age)

               -  Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) demonstrating forced expiratory volume at one
                  second (FEV1) of ≥50% of predicted for age. If child is too young or unable to
                  perform PFTs, crying vital capacity result of &gt;50% of normal value for age or
                  resting pulse oximeter &gt;92% on room air or clearance by pulmonologist will be
                  required.

          3. Patient must have a related donor (identical or mismatched for 1, 2 or 3 Human
             Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A, -B or -DR loci).

          4. Patient, and parent, or legal guardian must have given written informed consent
             according to FDA guidelines.

          5. Patients must have a minimum life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential cannot be pregnant or
             lactating/breast-feeding and must be either surgically sterile, postmenopausal (no
             menses for the previous 12 months), or must be practicing an effective method of birth
             control as determined by the investigator (e.g., oral contraceptives, double barrier
             methods, hormonal injectable or implanted contraceptives, tubal ligation, or partner
             with vasectomy).

          7. There is no upper or lower age limit for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients with uncontrolled seizures, apnea, evidence of recurrent or uncontrolled
             aspiration, or need for chronic mechanical ventilation.

          2. Patients with allogeneic stem cell transplant with cytoreductive therapy in the past 6
             months.

          3. Subjects must not have had previous radiation therapy that would preclude total body
             irradiation (TBI) (as determined by radiation therapist)

          4. Uncontrolled infection or severe concomitant diseases, which in the judgment of the
             Principal Investigator, could not tolerate reduced intensity transplantation.

          5. Subjects with a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test result

          6. Subjects who are pregnant, as indicated by a positive serum human chorionic
             gonadotropin (HCG) test

          7. Subjects whose only donor is pregnant at the time of intended transplant

          8. Subjects of childbearing potential who are not practicing adequate contraception as
             defined by the investigator at the site

          9. Jehovah's witnesses being unwilling to be transfused

         10. Patients that have any comorbid condition which, in the view of the Principal
             Investigators, renders the patient at too high a risk from treatment complications and
             regimen related morbidity/mortality.

         11. Lack of related donors
