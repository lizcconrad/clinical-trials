      To identify the risk factors of the revisit of the adult HF patients in emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmission in many
      hospitals worldwide.

      Identifying the risk factors of these HF patients in emergency department is the important
      reason for the proper management of the HF patients in the future. And can reduce number of
      hospitalization and readmission in our hospital.
