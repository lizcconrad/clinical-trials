    <description>The 7-day point prevalence of abstinence was defined as being abstinent from smoking and using tobacco products during the last 7 days at Week 12, 24, and 52. The participant`s smoking status and other nicotine use was evaluated based on the &quot;last 7 days&quot; questions on the NUI and confirmed by CO expiration. Responders were defined as those, who answered &quot;no&quot; to both questions (&quot;Has the subject smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 7 days?&quot;; and &quot;Has the subject used any nicotine products and/or other tobacco.... in the last 7 days?&quot;) and whose expired CO &lt; 10 ppm. Missing CO was imputed as negative (CO ≤ 10 ppm).</description>

The participant`s smoking status and other nicotine use was evaluated based on the &quot;last 4 weeks&quot; questions on the NUI and confirmed by CO expiration. Responders were defined as those, who answered &quot;no&quot; to both questions (&quot;Has the subject smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 4 weeks?&quot;; and &quot;Has the subject used any nicotine products and/or other tobacco.... in the last 4 weeks?&quot;) and whose expired CO &lt; 10 ppm.

        <description>The 4-week point prevalence of abstinence was defined as being abstinent from smoking and using tobacco products during the last 4 weeks of the study. The participant`s smoking status and other nicotine use was evaluated based on the &quot;last 4 weeks&quot; questions on the NUI and confirmed by CO expiration. Responders were defined as those, who answered &quot;no&quot; to both questions (&quot;Has the subject smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 4 weeks?&quot;; and &quot;Has the subject used any nicotine products and/or other tobacco.... in the last 4 weeks?&quot;) and whose expired CO &lt; 10 ppm.
