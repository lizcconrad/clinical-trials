  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For more than 20 years, alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor therapy (Zemaira®) has been the standard
      treatment for patients who have too little alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor in blood. Adult
      patients with this condition eventually develop emphysema. Most HIV-1 patients who have low
      viral load also have too little alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor in blood. Recent strong evidence
      shows that the number of CD4 cells in blood goes up when alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor goes
      up. Patients were asked to participate in a pilot study to see whether the use of Zemaira®
      (alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor) would increase blood levels of alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor
      and consequently increase CD4 cells.

    <textblock>
      HIV-1 patients were asked to participate in a pilot study to see whether the use of Zemaira®
      would increase blood levels of alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor and consequently increase CD4
      cells. HIV-1 patients were specifically selected to receive Zemaira® therapy if they had &lt;500
      HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, &lt;200 CD4 cells/ul, below normal alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor, and were
      on antiretroviral therapy and in general good health.

      Patients received an I.V. infusion of Zemaira® once a week for 8 or 12 weeks and returned one
      week following the final infusion for blood collection. Each session lasted approximately 45
      minutes. Each infusion was less than 30 minutes. At the time of infusion, patients were
      admitted to the hospital and 3 tablespoons of blood was collected. Blood was used to monitor
      viral load, CD4 cell numbers and function, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL, and
      alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor levels.

    <time_frame>Cytokine release and signaling by CD4 lymphocytes were assessed once every 3 weeks for the duration of the study which lasted either 9 or 13 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess whether the new crop of CD4 lymphocytes were immunocompetent, CD4 cells were harvested from blood and activated. This outcome measure was conducted only when the research subject had sufficient CD4 lymphocytes to perform the test. CD4 lymphocytes were stimulated using antibodies reactive with CD2, CD3, and CD28 for 3 days. Culture supernatant was measured for release of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN gamma (pg/ml). Cells were harvested and examined for NFkB activation using flow cytometry which measured log fluorescence of stimulated cells as compared to unstimulated cells.</description>

    <description>Although Zemaira® (alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor) treatment is the standard treatment for patients with too little alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor, its use in HIV-1 patients has not been established. This pilot study was performed to show that Zemaira® treatment can be used in HIV-1 patients to elevate alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor and has the added benefit of elevating CD4 cells.</description>

    <description>The Zemaira® dose used will depend on the patient's body weight. For example, a patient weighing 150 pounds would be infused with approximately ½ cup containing 8.4 grams of Zemaira®. Patients will be admitted to hospital for infusion. The I.V. infusion will be approximately 1 teaspoon/minute. Patients will receive weekly infusions of Zemaira® for 8 or 12 weeks. At the time of infusion, 40ml (3 Tablespoons) of blood will be collected (IRB approval #R04-003). The blood sample will be used to monitor viral load, CD4 cell numbers and function, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL, and alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor.</description>
