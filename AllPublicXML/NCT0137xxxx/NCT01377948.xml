  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Anger Control Therapy (ACT) with Regulate
      and Gain Emotional-Control (RAGE-Control) is a feasible behavioral therapy to provide on a
      pediatric inpatient psychiatric unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggression and disruptive behavior are the most common reasons for child and adolescent
      inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. Aggressive children and adolescents who merit
      admission to inpatient psychiatric hospitals for treatment typically display dramatic
      problems with self-regulation that interfere with global adaptive functioning. The goal of
      this study is to teach self-regulation techniques by combining Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      with a biofeedback video game in effort to motivate patients to learn and practice these
      coping skills, which will translate to decreased feelings of anger and aggression while
      hospitalized.

    <description>To provide information about feasibility, ratings of perceived helpfulness were collected using the Therapeutic Helpfulness Questionnaire5, which elicits both quantitative and qualitative data in three dimensions: 1) the degree to which it is helpful versus hurtful 2) the degree to which the focus of the treatment was helpful 3) overall satisfaction with the treatment. Participants rated each item from 1 = very unhappy or unhelpful to 7 = very happy or helpful.</description>
