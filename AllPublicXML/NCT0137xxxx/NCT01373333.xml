  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compassionate use of orphan drug 3,4-Diaminopyridine(DAP) in Treatment of Lambert Eaton
      Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS). 3,4-DAP is used to decrease the muscle weakness associated with
      LEMS and hopefully will decrease the need for prednisone and all other therapies that were
      previously required to control symptoms. How long a patient will take 3,4 DAP depends upon if
      he/she is seeing benefits from the medication or experiencing side effects that will prevent
      them from continuation in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) decreases symptoms of weakness in patients with LEMS, and
      therefore can be used to decrease the amount of immune modulation therapy needed to provide
      an equivalent degree of disease control.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of LEMS with or without any of the following: evidence of
             underlying malignancy, presence of P/Q or N-type calcium channel antibodies,
             electrodiagnostic evidence of a presynaptic defect of neuromuscular junction
             transmission.None of these laboratory findings are required for inclusion in this
             study.

          2. P/Q and N type calcium channel antibodies are measured in the blood as a routine
             laboratory test during the course of initial diagnosis, but 10-20% of patients with
             LEMS do not have elevated levels of these antibodies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.

          2. History of past or current seizures.

          3. History of asthma.

          4. Evidence of prolonged QT syndrome. There is no absolute upper limit of normal for the
             QTc interval.

          5. Family history of prolonged QTc syndrome, history of unexplained syncope, seizures or
             cardiac arrest.
