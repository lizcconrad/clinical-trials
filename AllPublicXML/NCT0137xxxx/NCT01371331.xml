  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how much of Modigraf is absorbed and used in the
      body and how fast it leaves the body (Pharmacokinetics). The results will then help to decide
      how much Modigraf in future can be given safely to children and young people following
      transplantation.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tacrolimus
      following oral administration of Modigraf, after the first oral dose and at steady state in
      paediatric subjects undergoing de novo allograft transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is the recipient of a solid organ (liver, kidney or heart) transplant.
             Multiorgan transplants are acceptable as long as one of the organs transplanted is
             liver, kidney or heart

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has previously received another organ transplant (including liver, kidney
             or heart re-transplantation)

          -  Subject has a high immunological risk, defined as a Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA)
             score &gt;50% in the previous 6 months (only applicable for renal transplant recipients)

          -  Cold ischemia time of the donor kidney greater than 30 hours (only applicable for
             renal transplant recipients)

          -  Subject receives an AB0 incompatible donor organ

          -  Subject has significant renal impairment, defined as having serum creatinine ≥230
             μmol/l (≥2.6 mg/dl) pre-transplantation (not applicable for renal transplant
             recipients)

          -  Subject has significant liver disease, defined as having elevated Alanine
             Aminotransferase (ALT) and/or Asparate Aminotransferase (AST) and/or Total Bilirubin
             levels 3 times the upper value of the normal range during the 28 days prior to
             transplantation (not applicable for liver transplant recipients)

          -  Subject with pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 Wood units which is
             unresponsive to treatment

          -  Subjects with malignancies or a history of malignancy within the last 5 years

          -  Subject has a significant, uncontrolled systemic infection and/or severe diarrhea,
             vomiting, active upper gastrointestinal disorder that may affect the absorption of
             tacrolimus or has an active peptic ulcer

          -  Subject requires systemic immunosuppressive medication for any indication other than
             transplantation

          -  Recipient or donor known to be HIV, HCV or HBV positive

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to steroids, macrolide antibiotics, basiliximab or
             tacrolimus

          -  Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial and/or has been taking an
             investigational drug in the 3 months prior to transplantation

          -  Subject is unlikely to comply with the visits scheduled in the protocol

          -  Subjects taking or requiring to be treated with medication or substances prohibited by
             this protocol
