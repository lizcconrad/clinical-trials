  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines against human papillomaviruses are now commercially available. One of the commercial
      vaccine contains antigens of both LR HPV types which cause virtually all cases of RRP.
      Clinical trials have documented the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine as well as its
      effectiveness in prevention of incident and persistent infection of the vaccinal types as
      well as a development of lesions caused by these types. After vaccination the antibodies
      level increases dramatically and the high levels of antibodies are present in the blood still
      after 6 years. Furthermore, the neutralization antibodies to the vaccinal antigens have been
      detected in the cervical mucus of vaccinated women. The preliminary data are now available
      showing the presence of HPV-specific antibodies in the oral cavity in women after
      vaccination. The level of antibodies has been dependent on time since vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our previous studies we have documented that in patients with RRP the level of
      HPV-specific antibodies is low and increases only after numerous surgery procedures.
      Therefore the application of this vaccine to patients with RRP can stimulate increased level
      of antibodies in the blood as well as presence of virus-specific neutralization antibodies on
      the surface of upper aero digestive tract and neutralize viruses shed from new papillomas and
      in this way protect patient from spreading of the infection as well as to facilitate the
      decrease of load of infectious virus shed from the lesion. This can possibly lead to the
      inhibition of growth of the papillomatous lesion.
