  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) is rare neurological disorder that results in muscle
      weakness and limited reflex activity. More than half of LEMS cases are associated with a
      malignancy, usually small cell lung cancer, and tend to progress more quickly than cases not
      coupled with malignant cells.

      3,4diaminopyridine (3,4DAP)is a drug that has been demonstrated to be effective in treating
      the weakness associated with LEMS as it increases strength and improves autonomic symptoms in
      LEMS patients. It is not currently approved by the FDA for use in the United States. The
      investigators plan to use 3,4DAP to treat patients with LEMS here at the Columbia University
      MDA/ALS Research Center.
