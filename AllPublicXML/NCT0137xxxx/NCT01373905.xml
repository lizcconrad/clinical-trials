    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a severe lung disease caused by a variety of direct
      and indirect issues. It is characterized by inflammation of the lung parenchyma leading to
      impaired gas exchange and persistent hypoxemia. This condition is often fatal, usually
      requiring mechanical ventilation. Recruitment maneuver aimed to enhance the effect of
      mechanical ventilation.The objective of this study was to compare safety and efficacy of two
      lung recruitment maneuvers.

    <textblock>
      In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), protective lung strategy and
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) therapy should be started as early as possible to
      avoid lung damage by high pressures, volumes and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).
      Recruitment is a strategy aiming at re-expanding the collapsed lung tissue and then
      maintaining an adequate level of PEEP to prevent subsequent de-recruitment. The objective of
      this study was to compare safety and efficacy of two lung recruitment maneuvers (RM):
      stepwise PEEP elevation with determination of the alveolar collapsing pressure versus
      sustained lung inflation in ARDS patients

PEEP was increased by 5 cm/ H2O every 2 minutes till Maximum of 40 cmH2O, patient was considered recruited if PaO2 of 250 mmHg was achieved. Then progressive decreases of PEEP in steps of 2 cmH2O every 2 minutes till PaO2 dropped by a 10% or more (alveolar collapsing pressure)</description>
