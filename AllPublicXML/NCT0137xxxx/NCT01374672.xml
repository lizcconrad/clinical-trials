    <textblock>
      This research study is studying biomarkers in predicting response to chemotherapy in samples
      from young patients with osteosarcoma. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with
      cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and
      identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will
      respond to treatment.

      Study Subtype: Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model: Cohort Time Perspective:
      Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study
      Population Description: Children's Oncology Group Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether methylation status predicts response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      samples from children and young adults with osteosarcoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (good vs
      poor).

      DNA and RNA extracted from biopsy samples are analyzed for methylation changes and
      transcription changes by ligation-mediated PCR and mass-array genotyping.
