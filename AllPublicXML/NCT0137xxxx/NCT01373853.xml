  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a controlled, open, prospective, single-centre, multi-surgeon eye
      study to determine the safety and efficacy of intraocular cuts for femtosecond laser assisted
      lens frag-mentation to support phacoemulsification of the cataractous lens prior to IOL
      implantation. The cuts are applied by means of the FEMTEC femtosecond laser system with the
      CustomLens soft-ware module using a cylindrical and radial cut pattern with diameter and
      height dependent on anterior chamber depth, pupil diameter and ocular lens size.

      The hypothesis of the study is that by means of femtosecond laser assisted lens fragmentation
      the required ultrasound energy used for phacoemulsification can be reduced in a safe and
      effective way.
