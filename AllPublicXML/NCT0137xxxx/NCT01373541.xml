  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of infant formula with high percentage
      of palmitic acid at the sn-2 position (InFat™) on improving fat absorption and general
      gastrointestinal tolerance in Chinese formula-fed term infants.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of infant formula with high percentage of
      palmitic acid at the sn-2 position (InFat™) as compared to standard vegetable oil based
      infant formula on general gastrointestinal tolerance and fat absorption, reducing calcium
      soaps formation and stool hardness in Chinese formula-fed term infants.
