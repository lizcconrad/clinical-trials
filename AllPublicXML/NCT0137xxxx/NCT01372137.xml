  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical trial with NOX-H94. The purpose of this clinical trial is to
      identify a safe and efficacious treatment regimen for the clinical development of NOX-H94 in
      patients with anemia of chronic disease (inflammation).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NOX H94 is a pegylated Spiegelmer that specifically binds to human hepcidin, thereby
      antagonizing its role in hemostasis, and is therefore indicated for use in anemia of
      inflammation. Human hepcidin has emerged as the central regulatory molecule of systemic iron
      homeostasis. Hepcidin expression in hepatocytes is regulated by multiple, in particular
      opposing signals, including systemic iron availability, hepatic iron stores, erythropoietic
      activity, hypoxia, and inflammatory states. These different signals are integrated
      transcriptionally. In chronic inflammation, such as occurs in rheumatoid arthritis, chronic
      kidney disease or cancer, elevated hepcidin levels have been measured and may be a key factor
      leading to anemia in these patients.

      NOX-H94 is therefore indicated for treatment of patients with an anemia of inflammation,
      which is characterized by increased intracellular iron stores, increased serum ferritin
      concentrations and reduced sensitivity to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents
      (ESAs), due to the limited availability of serum iron. Antagonism of hepcidin by NOX-H94
      therefore leads to elevated levels of iron and transferrin saturation in the peripheral blood
      and could supply iron for erythropoiesis thereby correcting the anemia.
