  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic pain can experience considerable changes in their cognitive function
      such as forgetfulness, increased absentmindedness, confusion etc. Opioids (e.g. morphine and
      morphine-like analgesics) are often used in treatment of acute and chronic pain and can lead
      to worsening of the cognitive function. The interaction between pain, treatment and cognitive
      function is very complex and is far from understood.

      The hypothesis of the present study is that by use of experimental pain in healthy volunteers
      it will be possible to elucidate the interaction between pain, treatment and cognitive
      function.
