      The purpose of this study is to assess the longterm safety and efficacy of the vaginal
      application of Gynoflor®, an extremely low dosed estrogen therapy with lactobacilli, on
      atrophic vaginitis in postmenopausal breast cancer patients who have been treated with
      aromatase inhibitors.
