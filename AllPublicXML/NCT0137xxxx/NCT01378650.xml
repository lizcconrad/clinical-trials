  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Overview of tinnitus Tinnitus is a noisy sound which is perceived without any external
           sound source. According to the survey of the US, 10-20% of adult have the symptom of
           tinnitus and 3-5% of tinnitus patients have severe discomfort of daily life. Severe
           tinnitus can result in psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety disorders.
           Enhancement of environmental sound, hearing aids, sound generators, cognitive therapy,
           transcranial magnetic therapy, and drug therapy have been tried for treatment of
           tinnitus. Nitric oxide(NO) is a well-known neurotransmitter acting as a vasodilator
           through regulation of production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate(cGMP) and can be
           found in various sites of cochlea. It is reported that cGMP enhances activity of protein
           kinase A (PKA), a mediator of platelet aggregation inhibition and vasodilatation and
           results in increase of vascular flow.

        2. Characteristics of the clinical research drug, cilostazol Cilostazol inhibits
           phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) selectively and increases amount of cAMP by inhibition
           of degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP). cAMP again by increasing the
           active form of PKA suppress the production of blood clots and increase blood flow by
           expanding blood vessels. Anti-platelet activity and vasodilatation effect of cilostazol
           have been used for improvement of diabetic peripheral vascular disorders and suppression
           of stroke recurrence. Previous studies reported that by increasing the activity of NO
           and PKA, the blood flow of stria vascularis and cochlear hair cells can be improved.
           These studies implies that cilostazol, which causes inhibition of PDE3 and increase of
           PKA, can have a potential effect on improvement of tinnitus by increase of blood flow to
           peripheral cochlear cells. Thus, we hypothesized that cilostazol, which has been widely
           used for enhancing peripheral blood flow, can bring improvement of tinnitus by causing
           better peripheral blood flow of cochlea.

        3. The aim of the study We planned this study to validate the assumptions of the
           background. The aim of our study is whether administration of cilostazol can improve
           tinnitus in terms of subjective degree of symptoms in chronic tinnitus patients.

      1. Clinical research methods

             -  Determination of eligibility by history taking, physical examination, pure tone
                audiometry, speech audiometry, and distortion product otoacoustic emission test.

             -  Randomization by random sequence generation

             -  Administration : cilostazol 100mg Bid 4 weeks for the study group and placebo
                tablet Bid 4 weeks for the control group.

             -  Evaluation battery: questionnaires (tinnitus handicap inventory, visual analogue
                scale, Quality of life SF-36)

             -  Time of evaluation : pre-administration, 2 weeks after administration, 4 week after
                administration

             -  Monitoring of side effects

        2. Evaluation of treatment response - Statistical analysis of scores of questionnaires
           using SPSS K12.0 (paired t-test for changes of each group and Mann-Whitney U test for
           comparing the mean scores of two groups)
