    <textblock>
      Post-operative pain will be measured using a pain diary for one week post-surgery. The
      purpose is to test the assumption that the arthroscopic technique leads to less
      post-operative pain and results in shorter hospital stays when compared to the open
      technique. It is believed that the arthroscopic technique will result in minimal pain when
      compared to the open technique, allowing this procedure to be performed as day surgery.

    <description>A scale from 0-10 is used for patients to record the amount of pain they are experiencing at a given time. Multiple questions are asked on a daily basis in a pain diary to report pain in the morning, at night, with movement, before and after pain medication.</description>
