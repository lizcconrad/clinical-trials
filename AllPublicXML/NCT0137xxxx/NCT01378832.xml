      A prospective, randomized study was performed between January and December 2010. Patient
      inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms and plans to undergo an elective
      curative surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (intra-abdominal irrigation
      with normal saline) and Group 2 (intraperitoneal irrigation with a solution of 240 mg
      gentamicin and 600 mg clindamycin). The occurrence of wound infections and intra-abdominal
      abscesses were investigated. Following the anastomosis, a microbiological sample of the
      peritoneal surface was obtained (sample 1). A second sample was collected following an
      irrigation with normal saline (sample 2). Finally, the peritoneal cavity was irrigated with a
      gentamicin-clindamycin solution and a third sample was obtained (sample 3).

    <description>The lavage was performed immediately prior to closure of the abdominal wall. Prior to the lavage, a microbiological sample from the peritoneal surface (parietal and visceral) was obtained with a swab (sample 1), followed by a lavage with 500 ml normal saline, similar to the one performed in Group 1. After this lavage, a new microbiological sample was obtained from the peritoneal surface (sample 2), and a second lavage with an antibiotic solution, including gentamicin (240 mg) and clindamycin (600 mg) dissolved in 500 ml normal saline was performed. During this lavage, the solution was allowed to sit in the abdominal cavity for 3 minutes. After aspirating the lavage, a third microbiological sample was obtained in the same way as the two previous ones (sample 3).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms and plans to undergo an elective surgery with
             curative aims.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  preoperative diagnosis of chronic renal failure, because of the risk of nephrotoxicity
             associated with intraperitoneal gentamicin absorption
