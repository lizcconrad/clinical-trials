      The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of a new prototype colonoscope with a
      standard colonoscope used world-wide today. The prototype colonoscope is more flaccid with a
      smaller diameter than the standard colonoscope. The hypothesis to be tested is that the
      prototype will improve negotiation of sharp bends and inflict less discomfort or pain to the
      patient. Both colonoscopes are manufactured by the same company.
