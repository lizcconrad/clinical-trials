      In this study, the investigators will be using The Online Advocate, a Web-based
      health-related social problems screening and referral tool, to explore the relationship
      between health-related social problems and children's diet quality among families with young
      children attending the Children's Hospital Primary Care Center. The Online Advocate consists
      of a 60-80 question screening survey for health-related social problems (such as food
      insecurity, employment and income, homelessness) and allows participants to select referrals
      for local health and social service agencies that might help them with the problems
      identified through the survey. Layered into The Online Advocate for this study is an
      adaptation of the Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire (HSFFQ) that can assess
      children's diet quality. The investigators plan to recruit 350 parent/guardians of otherwise
      healthy children age 3-10 years who are presenting to the primary care center for routine
      well child care. Eligible parent/guardians will have the opportunity to take The Online
      Advocate (plus HSFFQ) on a laptop computer in the waiting area before seeing their
      pediatrician or healthcare provider. Participants will receive a small incentive for their
      time as well as written information on healthy nutrition and an age appropriate coloring book
      for the child. At one month, participants will be contacted by the study team by email or
      phone and asked follow up questions about the status of their health-related social problems
      identified through The Online Advocate and whether the referrals they received were helpful.
      Participants will receive a small incentive for their time, along with a reminder message
      promoting healthy nutrition for their child. At three months, participants will be contacted
      by the study team by email or phone and asked follow up questions about the status of their
      health-related social problems identified through The Online Advocate and whether the
      referrals they received were helpful. They will also re-take the adapted HSFFQ. Participants
      will receive another small incentive for their time. Participants will also have the
      opportunity to re-take The Online Advocate at three months, though this is optional. The
      investigators believe this pilot study will provide foundational knowledge about the
      intersection between health-related social problems and children's diet quality and may
      inform future research studies and interventions.

      Our Study Aims are:

        1. To use The Online Advocate to evaluate the association between health-related social
           problems and diet quality in children in a cross-sectional sample.

        2. To evaluate the relationship between resolution of health-related social problems using
           The Online Advocate and change in diet quality in children over a 3 month period.

      Our Study Hypotheses are:

        1. A greater number of health-related social problems per family will be associated with
           poorer diet quality in children at baseline.

        2. After 3 months, families demonstrating resolution of one or more health-related social
           problems addressed with The Online Advocate will demonstrate greater improvement in diet
           quality in children.
