    <textblock>
      The role of laparoscopic surgery in pediatric inguinal hernia repair is clear. Laparoscopic
      hernia repair is especially advantageous for bilateral diseases and minimally invasive
      technique in children because it avoids vas injury. However, the problem of recurrent rate
      has not been resolved. The aim of this study was to refine the current criteria used the
      lateral umbilicus ligament covering the internal hernia opening region, and eliminated
      recurrence in laparoscopic inguinal hernia (LIH) repair in children. The investigators
      hypothesized that the lateral umbilicus ligament covering the internal hernia opening region
      after the laparoscopic purse-string knot would result in lower recurrence and the same
      operation relative complication

      The primary outcome measure was the recurrence rate after surgery, and the secondary outcome
      measures included degree of postoperative pain, the amount of postoperative analgesia,
      procedural duration, number of days to recovery normal activity, surgical complications,
      cosmetic results, and patient satisfaction. The outcome was recorded at the outpatient visits
      10 days, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after the surgery. The cosmetic result was
      scored (unsatisfactory = 0, satisfactory = 1, good = 2, and excellent = 3) by the patients or
      parents, the attending nurse, and the surgeon (maximum points = 9). The patient satisfaction
      was scored similarly (unsatisfactory = 0, satisfactory = 1, good = 2, and excellent = 3). The
      long axis of the testes was measured.
