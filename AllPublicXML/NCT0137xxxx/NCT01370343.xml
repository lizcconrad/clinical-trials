      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of a single dose of PF-04991532 in healthy adult subjects with and without
      co-administration of cyclosporine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female (non-childbearing potential) subjects between the ages of
             18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests. Women
             must be of non childbearing potential as defined in Lifestyle Guidelines. Body Mass
             Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject or a legally acceptable
             representative.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, sychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal
             allergies at time of dosing) disease or clinical findings at Screening.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant infections within the past 3 months (for example,
             those requiring hospitalization, or as judged by the Investigator), or evidence of any
             infection within the past 7 days.

          -  Screening supine blood pressure &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic), on a
             single measurement [confirmed by a single repeat, if necessary] following at least 5
             minutes of rest.
