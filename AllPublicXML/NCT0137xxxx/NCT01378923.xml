    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to examine the acceptability and effectiveness of the Re-Entry Values
      and Mindfulness Program (REVAMP), a group intervention for jail inmates. It is hypothesized
      that REVAMP will reduce post-release recidivism, substance abuse, and HIV risk behavior.
