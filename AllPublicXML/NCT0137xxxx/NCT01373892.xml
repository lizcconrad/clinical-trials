  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to measure effect of obesity on brain structure and
      molecular pathways, food-stimuli mediated brain activation response, on hormones affecting
      both feeding and energy balance as well as on bone metabolism and bone marrow fat. In the
      first phase the studies are performed at baseline before bariatric surgery and in the second
      phase post-operatively after 6 months. Regional free fatty acid uptake are studied with PET
      and 14(R, S)-[18F]-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([18F]FTHA). Changes in body fat
      distribution are investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Brain reward system
      response to food stimuli is assessed using functional MRI (fMRI) and white and grey matter
      volumes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Brain neurotransmitter system will be measured
      with [11C]raclopride and [11C]carfentanil and PET. In the second part of the study the same
      variables are studied after bariatric surgery: either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

      Regional free fatty acid uptake in myocardium, skeletal muscle, subcutaneous fat, visceral
      fat, pancreas, liver, brain, intestine and the bone are studied with PET and 14(R,
      S)-[18F]-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([18F]FTHA). Changes in body fat distribution are
      investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
      Brain reward system response to food stimuli is assessed using functional MRI (fMRI) and
      white and grey matter volumes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

      The study consists totally of 60 study subjects. Of these 40 are morbidly obese adults, BMI
