      The purpose of this study is to assess the overall disease control rate of Ofatumumab wo/w
      Dacarbazine in subjects with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC 2009) unresectable
      stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, sequential, 2-cohort, phase 2 study to assess
      the overall disease control rate of Ofatumumab according to criteria of RECIST (Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) v. 1.1. in subjects with unresectable stage III B (T1-
      4a, N2b-c), stage III C or stage IV (American Joint Committee on Cancer 2009) disease.

      Cohort 1: 10 eligible patients will be treated with ofatumumab alone. If interim analysis
      shows that at least 1 confirmed overall response occurs, an additional 19 eligible patients
      will be treated, for a total of 29 patients.

      Cohort 2: If no confirmed overall response by ofatumumab alone-therapy is seen in the first
      10 patients, cohort 2 will be opened. Initially, 13 eligible patients will be treated with a
      combination of Dacarbazine plus ofatumumab. If interim analysis gives at least 2 confirmed
      overall responses, additional 26 patients will be recruited.

    <description>Patients with melanoma unresectable stage III B (T1- 4a, N2b-c), stage III C or stage IV (AJCC 2009) will be included in this study. Ofatumumab will be administered at a dose of 1000mg iv weekly for 8 weeks and q4w for another 16 weeks. Tumor imaging is performed at wk 4 (screening for rapid disease progression), 8, 16 and 24. In case of PD, patients will have the opportunity to receive at least 3 cycles of ofatumumab q4w in combination with DTIC (1000 mg/m2) q4w (see Arm2).</description>

          -  Metastatic non-ocular melanoma - unresectable stage III B (T1- 4a, N2b-c), stage III C
             (AJCC 2009) or stage IV (AJCC 2009).

          -  measurable disease with more than one metastatic lesion, according to RECIST v. 1.1
             criteria,

          -  One of these metastases must be resectable prior to anti-CD20 therapy.

             carrying the respective mutational profile, patients refusing this kind of therapy for
             any reason, patients being not eligible to those therapies due to contraindications or
             disease progression under such kind of therapy.

          -  Life expectancy of 3 month or longer

          -  Negative pregnancy test in female patients of childbearing potential and adequate
             contraception in female patients of childbearing age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active brain metastasis (exception: brain metastases being stable with
             and without corticosteroids for 2 months after treatment by surgery or radiation
             therapy) and immunoglobulin-deficiency will be excluded.

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in an ofatumumab study:

          -  Subjects who have current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of

             chronic liver disease per investigator assessment)

          -  Treatment with any known non-marketed drug substance or experimental therapy within 5
             terminal half lives or 4 weeks prior to enrollment, whichever is longer, or currently
             participating in any other interventional clinical study

          -  Other past or current malignancy. Subjects who have been free of malignancy for at
             least 5 years, or have a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer, or
             successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.

          -  Chronic or current infectious disease requiring systemic antibiotics, antifungal, or
             antiviral treatment such as, but not limited to, chronic renal infection, chronic
             chest infection with bronchiectasis, tuberculosis and active Hepatitis C.
