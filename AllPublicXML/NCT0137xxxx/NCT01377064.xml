  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of advances in drug treatment, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are living longer,
      but are also at greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Exercise and
      increased physical activity can reduce the risk factors for these diseases in PLWHA, but no
      studies have tested an at-home exercise program that would benefit low income people and
      others who do not have access to exercise facilities. This study will test the feasibility of
      an at-home exercise program for PLWHA and prepare for a full-scale intervention study, which
      may lead to a reduction in CVD risk among PLWHA.

    <description>Accelerometer data will be the primary means of determining the participants' physical activity levels. Participants will be instructed to wear the accelerometer at baseline, 4 months, and 9 months. The participants will be required to wear the accelerometer during the waking hours for seven consecutive days. Data from participants with at least four days and at least 10 hours per day will be included.</description>

    <measure>Cardiorespiratory Fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will complete a graded exercise stress test (GXT) with indirect calorimetry. This test will be used to screen for abnormal physiological responses to exercise and for determining the participant's maximal ability to utilize oxygen (an index of cardiorespiratory fitness).</description>
