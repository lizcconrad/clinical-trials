  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) infusion is supposed be a promising regeneration
      therapy with mild side effect as indicated by large quantities of animal experiments and some
      clinical trials. There are few UC-MSCs clinical trials with regard to diabetes mellitus. The
      investigators hypothesize that infusion of USC-MSCs may provide multiple signals for
      beta-cell regeneration and even re-differentiate into local tissues in diabetes mellitus
      patients, resulting in improvement of diabetic control, of which the effect may be promoted
      by concomitant infusion of bone marrow mononuclear cells and maximized by intra-arterial
      pancreatic infusion through angiography.
