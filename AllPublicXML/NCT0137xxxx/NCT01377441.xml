  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen before and after surgery has
      not been studied extensively. Subjects are being asked to participate in this study because
      they are scheduled for surgery and because the investigators want to study ways to improve
      recovery from surgery. Ibuprofen will be given several times before and after surgery. The
      investigators will ask questions to determine recovery and the investigators will draw blood
      to determine inflammatory response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human and animal studies suggest cyclooxygenase-inhibitors (COX-inhibitors) decrease the
      production of inflammatory mediators. Studies also suggest that COX inhibitors attenuate
      increases in corticosterone and eicosanoid levels after endotoxin injection. COX inhibitors
      also appear to have anticancer effects, inhibiting angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastatic
      burden. These results suggest a role for IV ibuprofen in preventing untoward inflammatory
      responses, shortening post-surgical convalescence, improving patient satisfaction, and
      reducing the rate of complications occurring during the recovery from surgery. However, there
      are no studies that have evaluated the relationship between administration of IV ibuprofen,
      ensuing immunomodulation, and long-term outcomes.

      Study Objective. The aim of the proposed study is to examine the effect of intravenous(IV)
      ibuprofen on the inflammatory response in major surgery. More importantly, the investigators
      will correlate changes in the concentration of inflammatory mediators with meaningful
      clinical outcomes.

    <description>Concentration of the cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1Beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma as well as prostaglandin E2 at different time points will be our primary outcome. Changes in mediator levels in the IV ibuprofen versus placebo groups will be compared.

    <description>The secondary outcome parameters will be the quality of recovery score (QoR-40) to measure quality of recovery from surgery, a simple fatigue scale, digits forward and backward, and the global depression schedule. Forty questions in five dimensions will be scored by patients on a five-point Likert scale. Seven point fatigue scales (in- and out-patient) is often used to assess progress of recovery in head trauma patients. Metrics will be administered on at the baseline visit and or on the day of surgery and on postoperative days 1, 2, 4 and 6.</description>
