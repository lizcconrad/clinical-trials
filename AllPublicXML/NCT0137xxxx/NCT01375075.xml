    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if 12 weeks of treatment with LY2484595
      administered as a monotherapy will significantly increase high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL-C) and decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in Japanese
      participants.

             acid (EPA). Subjects taking probucol, fibrate or nicotinic agents within 8 weeks
             before screening are excluded from the study

          -  Are currently using, plan to use, or are likely to require during the course of the

             Currently use, have used within 60 days prior to screening, or plan to use during the
             trial period prescriptions or OTC formulations intended for weight loss

          -  Are currently using, have used within 60 days prior to screening, plan to use, or are
             likely to require during the course of the study, drugs or foods that are inducers
