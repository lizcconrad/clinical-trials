    <textblock>
      Based the proven efficacy and the ability to induce rapid response of various combinations of
      bortezomib including PAD combination in refractory and newly diagnosed patients with Multiple
      Myeloma, the investigators intend to investigate the efficacy of 2 cycles of PAD combination
      (Ps-341/Bortezomib, Adriamycin, and Dexamethasone) and to examine the feasibility of
      harvesting G-CSF mobilized PBSC and performing early AHCT after 2 cycles of PAD.

      1.PAD combination chemotherapy

        -  Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 will be given by intravenous bolus injection on days 1, 4, 8, 11 of
           each cycle. Oral or intravenous dexamethasone 40 mg will be administered on days 1-4 and
           8-11 with doxorubicin 9 mg/m2 by intravenous bolus on days 1-4 of each cycle. The cycle
           will be repeated every 3 weeks. A total of 2 cycles is planed before AHCT.

        -  For mobilization, G-CSF 10ug/kg/d alone will be given by subcutaneous injection from day
           12 of the second PAD cycle until completion of harvesting.

      Melphalan 100 mg/m2/day will be administered on day -3 and day -2 for high-dose chemotherapy.

      -Maintenance :Thalidomide 100 - 200 mg/d for 2 years

    <description>To investigate the effectiveness of bortezomib, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (PAD) combination therapy in the treatment of previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma who are eligible for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT).

Many physicians use vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) for three to four months as induction therapy (Alexandrian et al, 1990). VAD produces partial response (PR) in about 50% patients, with complete response (CR) observed in 5%-10% patients (Kyle et al, 2004).</description>
