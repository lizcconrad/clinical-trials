  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants with chronic lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) are commonly
      treated with inhaled steroids, an optional treatment according to textbooks and guidelines .
      However, the evidence supporting this treatment in spontaneously breathing infants is
      limited, and based on only two randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCT) with relative
      small number of infants . The Cochrane review concluded that these studies do not allow firm
      conclusions with regard to the efficacy of inhaled steroids in non-ventilated infants . Thus,
      there is no doubt that there is a need for more RCT in order to ascertain the role of inhaled
      steroids in infants with BPD. Because of its physical properties that theoretically make QVAR
      an attractive therapy in infants and studies showing it to be as effective as and with
      similar safety profile as other inhaled steroids in children, the investigators hypothesized
      that inhaled QVAR will be an effective therapy in infants with BPD.
