  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - One way to treat prostate cancer is to use a laser to direct extreme heat to a small area
      of the prostate. The heat destroys tumor cells but does not affect healthy tissue. Doctors
      want to see if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to improve this treatment. MRI
      will be used to help locate tumor cells and guide the laser during surgery. However,
      MRI-guided laser therapy has not been used to treat many people with prostate cancer. More
      studies are needed to see whether it can destroy tumor cells permanently.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of treating prostate tumors with laser therapy guided
      by magnetic resonance imaging.

      Eligibility:

      - Men at least 18 years of age who have prostate cancer that can be seen with an MRI and has
      not spread to other parts of the body.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have blood tests and imaging studies, and will complete questionnaires about their
           health.

        -  Participants will have the MRI-guided laser treatment in the hospital. The doctor will
           use the MRI to control how much energy is delivered by the laser and how much tissue is
           destroyed. The entire procedure usually takes from 1.5 to 3 hours.

        -  After the treatment, participants will have a catheter put in to keep the bladder
           emptied. The catheter will stay in for 1 to 7 days. Drugs to prevent infection and
           bladder spasms will be given. Participants will leave the hospital once they are well
           enough to go home.

        -  Participants will have followup visits 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after the
           therapy. They will have physical exams, and blood and urine tests. They will also answer
           questionnaires. Participants will have MRI scans 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the
           therapy. They will have a prostate biopsy to see if there is any tumor every 12 months
           for the first 2 years. Another biopsy may be done in the third year.

      Background:

        -  Pilot study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of thermal laser ablation
           of focal prostate tumors.

        -  Prostate cancer is relatively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors
           estimated at 2 to 4 years.

        -  Some prostate cancers prove to be small, low grade, and noninvasive and they appear to
           pose little risk to the life or health of the host. Recent patient series suggest that
           20% to 30% of men undergoing radical prostatectomy have pathologic features in the
           radical prostatectomy specimen consistent with an insignificant or indolent cancer which
           poses little threat to life or health.

        -  We propose that patients with low volume and low grade disease can be best served with
           focal ablation of the visible prostate cancer without the side effects of urinary
           incontinence and erectile dysfunction associated with radiation therapy or radical
           surgery.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      -To determine feasibility and safety of magnetic resonance image-guided focal laser ablation
      of biopsy confirmed and MR visible prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Greater than 18 years of age

        -  Organ confined prostate cancer, observed on MR, and confirmed by Transrectal biopsy

        -  Preoperative workup as dictated by the NCCN.org prostate cancer guidelines

        -  PSA &lt; 15 ng or PSA density &lt; 0.15 ng/ml in patients with a PSA &gt; 15 ng

      Design:

        -  Pilot study, testing feasibility, safety and tolerability of thermal ablation of focal
           prostate cancer

        -  It is anticipated that 15 patients will be accrued for this study
