  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the CardioSond digital
      electronic stethoscope in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with and
      without known disease who are referred to cardiac computed tomography angiography (CT scans).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CardioSond is a noninvasive medical device which detects heart sounds using
      ultrasensitive acoustic technology. The CardioSond produces a flow micro bruit score which is
      used to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease.

      The CardioSond exam will be given to patients two times: once prior to administration of
      vasodilators and potential beta blockade agents as part of the normal cardiac CT angiography
      protocol and again immediately post CT angiography. No other data will be taken on the
      patient and the patients involvement in the study will cease after data collection.

      CT angiography data will be analyzed at a core lab at Medstar Research Institute and withheld
      from SonoMedica until all CardioSond acoustic data is analyzed and flow micro bruit scores
      are determined.

      A data review panel lead by the principal investigator will examine the results of both the
      CardioSond and CT angiography data to determine the comparative accuracy of the CardioSond in
      detecting CAD in the study population.

    <measure>Determine the comparative diagnostic accuracy of the CardioSond digital electronic stethoscope versus CT angiography in detecting CAD, as defined as a stenosis of a major epicardial coronary artery of 50% or greater.</measure>

    <description>The CardioSond digital electronic stethoscope's flow micro bruit score will be used as an indication of probability of disease in patients with and without known disease and compared to the results of CT angiography.</description>

    <time_frame>Patient participation will be limited to the day of their CT angiography exam (day 1). Patients will receive two seperate CardioSond examinations which on averages takes approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's flow micro bruit scores from each CardioSond examination (one pre CT angiography and one post CT angiography) will be compared to each other to assess the effects on the score of vasodilators administered as part of the CT angiography exam.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willingness to sign an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  History of prior myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (i.e.
             stents) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery

          -  Heart rate over 70 beats per minute post beta blockade

          -  Artery calcification resulting in non-diagnostic CT angiographic images

          -  Supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias that would be expected to affect CT
             angiography image quality (e.g. atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular
             tachycardia, bigeminy and trigeminy). Patients with isolated premature atrial
             contraction and premature ventricular contractions may enroll

          -  Any pulmonary condition that would create abnormal physical findings that would
             interfere with the fidelity of the cardiac sound recordings (e.g. obstructive
             pulmonary disease, such as asthma or COPD, with audible wheezing)

          -  Presence of audible aortic or pulmonic diastolic murmurs, tricuspid or mitral flow
             diastolic murmurs or continuous murmurs

          -  Any chest wall configuration preventing adequate contact between the CardioSond
             acoustic recording sensor and precordium

          -  Any medical condition that would be expected to affect CT angiography image quality
