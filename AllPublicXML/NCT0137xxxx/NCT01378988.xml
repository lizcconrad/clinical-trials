      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety
      of dexmedetomidine at 2 different dose levels in pediatric subjects, aged 12 months through
      &lt;24 months, administered as an intravenous loading dose followed by continuous infusion for a
      minimum of 6 hours and up to 24 hours in an intensive care setting.

    <textblock>
      Phase II, randomized, open-label, single-center, study evaluating the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of dexmedetomidine in pediatric subjects across two dose levels (Dose Level
      1 consists of a 0.7 mcg/kg loading dose immediately followed by a 0.5 mcg/kg/hr maintenance
      infusion; Dose Level 2 consists of a 1.0 mcg/kg loading dose immediately followed by a 0.75
      mcg/kg/hr maintenance infusion). The study population will consist of intubated and
      mechanically ventilated pediatric subjects who require sedation in an intensive care setting
      for a minimum of 6 hours but not to exceed 24 hours. Subjects eligible for enrollment are 12
      months to &lt;24 months of age.
