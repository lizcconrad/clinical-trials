    <textblock>
      Our aim is to observe whether anti-TNF-alpha regimen will effect serum adiponectin
      concentration after myocardial infarction/reperfusion and also beneficial for the patients
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic/reperfusion injury in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with increased inflammatory cytokines
      that including TNF-alpha that can exert deleterious effects and therefore contribute to
      cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Several studies on rodents have reported
      administration of sTNFR-Fc, a scavenger of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha at the
      time of reperfusion would protect against ischemic/reperfusion injury. Also reports had shown
      that serum TNF-alpha concentration is negatively correlated with a cardioprotective cytokine
      adiponectin. Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic
      processes. The major intracellular pathway activated by Ad includes phosphorylation of
      AMP-activated protein kinase, which is responsible for many of Ad's metabolic regulatory,
      anti-inflammatory, vascular protective, and anti-ischemic properties. The aim of the present
      study was to verify whether the administration of Etanercept, an FDA approved rheumatoid
      arthritis treating sTNFR-Fc, at the reperfusion time would protect against
      ischemic/reperfusion injury on patient, and effect serum adiponectin level.
