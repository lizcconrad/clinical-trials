  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide efficacy and safety data of 3 consecutive monthly
      intravitreal injections with 0.5 mg ranibizumab in Japanese patients with visual impairment
      due to macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (BRVO or CRVO) to support the
      applicability of the phase III study results of BRAVO and CRUISE in this indication, in the
      Japanese ethnic patients.
