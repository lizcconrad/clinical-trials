  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isoproterenol is used as a cardiac stimulant in electrophysiology studies (EP). Preliminary
      data suggests that administration of isoproterenol increases the Bispectral index (BIS). BIS
      is used to monitor neuronal signals under anesthesia. The BIS level is suggested to
      correspond to the level of consciousness. We hypothesize that isoproterenol increases BIS
      values because it increases the patient's level of consciousness through its central nervous
      system (CNS) stimulatory effects. In this study, we will administer increasing doses of
      isoproterenol to EPS patients. We will measure the BIS levels continuously before and after
      isoproterenol administration. In addition, we will test the level of awareness of patients by
      their response to a modified isolated forearm technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Isoproterenol is a direct acting Beta-1 and Beta-2 agonist useful for its effects on
      bronchodilation and myocardial contractility. Its CNS side effects include nervousness,
      headache, dizziness, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, tension, blurring of vision, fear, and
      excitement. In addition to our preliminary data, two case reports show an increase in BIS
      with administration of isoproterenol. Our hypothesis is that administration of isoproterenol
      will increase the level of consciousness of the patient as reflected in the BIS reading.

      The BIS Vista Monitor is a non-invasive device that measures the electrical activity of the
      brain. It computes a number between 0 and 100 which corresponds to a level of consciousness
      which is known as the Bispectral (BIS) value. Using the BIS value to guide administration of
      anesthetic medication, clinicians can make informed decisions for optimal anesthesia. This
      technology has the potential to prevent over sedation, but is currently not a standard
      monitoring device.

      Another approach to evaluating the level of consciousness of anesthetized patients is to
      assess their ability to form memories or recall events which occurred while under anesthesia.
      Conscious recall is the first to disappear with decreasing levels of consciousness. A BIS of
      60 or less has been shown in various studies to be sufficient to prevent conscious recall in
      the vast majority of patients. We propose to use a modified isolated forearm technique test
      in which the patient is asked to squeeze an observer's hand during anesthesia to ascertain if
      awareness can occur without recall at a BIS of 60 to 70. (6) Implicit memory in which there
      is no conscious recall or evaluation of awareness can be assessed by word stem completion
      tests and has been shown to occur with a BIS as low as 40 - 60 although these results are not
      consistent across all studies. (7)

    <time_frame>During time of Electrophysiology (EP) studies.</time_frame>
    <description>Increasing doses of isoproterenol (5,10,15,20 mcg/minute) were administered to patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. BIS levels were measured continuously before and after isoproterenol administration. Number of participants with increase in BIS reading during anesthetic steady state are reported below. The BIS scale ranges from 0 to 100. The individual's baseline BIS was measured continuously and was maintained in an anesthetic steady state with minimum variance prior to isoproterenol. A deviation from the mean in excess of 3 points (2 STD) was defined categorically as a positive response and was counted dichotomously.</description>

    <description>Increasing doses of isoproterenol (5,10,15,20 mcg/minute) were administered to patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Patients under steady state total venous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil infusions with BIS around 50 normally do not move even in the absence of neuromuscular blockade. Spontaneous movement appearing like restlessness during sleep is unusual. Several patients under anesthesia after isoproterenol appear to wake up and move spontaneously.</description>

          <description>Increasing doses of isoproterenol (5,10,15,20 mcg/minute) were administered to patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. BIS levels were measured continuously before and after isoproterenol administration. Number of participants with increase in BIS reading during anesthetic steady state are reported below. The BIS scale ranges from 0 to 100. The individual's baseline BIS was measured continuously and was maintained in an anesthetic steady state with minimum variance prior to isoproterenol. A deviation from the mean in excess of 3 points (2 STD) was defined categorically as a positive response and was counted dichotomously.</description>

        <description>Increasing doses of isoproterenol (5,10,15,20 mcg/minute) were administered to patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Patients under steady state total venous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil infusions with BIS around 50 normally do not move even in the absence of neuromuscular blockade. Spontaneous movement appearing like restlessness during sleep is unusual. Several patients under anesthesia after isoproterenol appear to wake up and move spontaneously.</description>
