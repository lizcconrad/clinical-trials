  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this non-interventional study is a description of use of darunavir in daily
      practice, in retrospective and perspective manner. Darunavir will be prescribed in the usual
      manner and in accordance with the terms of marketing authorization. The assignment of a
      patient to a particular therapeutic strategy will not be decided in advance by this study
      protocol but instead, it will be part of the current clinical practice. The prescription of
      the medicinal product will be clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in
      the study. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures will be applied to the patients,
      and epidemiological methods will be used for the analysis of collected data. After having
      agreed with the patient on starting treatment with darunavir, and provided that all inclusion
      and exclusion criteria apply, the physician will document the patient's data. Patients will
      be observed for at least 48 weeks from baseline visit except for those who withdraw from the
      study earlier. Patients data will be collected at approximately 0, 1, 3 and 6 months after
      starting treatment and subsequently every 3 months in accordance with routine practice. The
      expected number of patients to enroll is about 900. The patients will be treated with
      darunavir according to the Italian label. The patient must be withdrawn from the study if the
      treatment with darunavir has been stopped. A last evaluation must be documented when
      possible, and a resistance test will be collected if available for patients discontinuing for
      virologic failure. At the end of study visit, information on therapy given after darunavir
      discontinuation will be collected. For patients discontinuing for virologic failure, data
      will be collected until the end of the present study, and at least two consecutive
      measurements of viral load after starting new antiretroviral therapy will be collected, if
      available. All data collected must be the result of the normal medical care of the patient.
      The patient's baseline data will be collected within the first week before darunavir
      administration (at Visit 1). For patients already in treatment with darunavir, baseline and
      follow up data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively. Further data collection
      will occur approximately at 1, 3, and 6 months and subsequently about every 3 months
      according to routine practice, after initiating darunavir treatment.

    <textblock>
      The patient's baseline data will be collected within the first week before darunavir
      administration, Visit 1. For patients already in treatment with darunavir, outside the Early
      Access Program, baseline and follow-up data will be collected retrospectively and
      prospectively. For patients switched to commercial darunavir from the Early Access Program
      and already in treatment with darunavir, Baseline Visit data will be collected from the Early
      Access Program Baseline Visit. For patients already in treatment with darunavir outside the
      Early Access Program, baseline data will be collected retrospectively starting from the first
      darunavir intake. For all patients, laboratory examination results collected within 6 months
      before darunavir treatment starts will be considered as baseline data. For patients switched
      to commercial darunavir from the Early Access Program and already in treatment with
      darunavir, Visit 2 won't be performed. For patients starting commercial darunavir or already
      in treatment with commercial darunavir outside the Early Access Program, laboratory exams
      related to follow-up visits, Visit 2 onward, can be performed within a time window of one
      month before or after the corresponding visit date. Further data collection will occur
      approximately at 1, 3, and 6 months and subsequently about every 3 months according to
      routine practice, after initiating darunavir treatment. If a patient stops treatment with
      darunavir at any time, the end of study visit should be performed as soon as possible.
      Darunavir film-coated tablet, orally administered. Orange, oval-shaped tablet, debossed with
      400MG or 600MG or 300MG on one side and TMC on the other side. Duration of observation
      minimum 48 weeks.
