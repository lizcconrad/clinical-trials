  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This chronic, prospective, non-randomized feasibility study is designed to evaluate the
      Integrated Patient Care (IPC) concept in subjects who already have either a Medtronic
      Chronicle Implantable Hemodynamic Monitor (IHM) or Chronicle Implantable Cardioverter
      Defibrillator (ICD) device implanted, and are currently enrolled in the Chronicle Offers
      Management to Patients with Advanced Signs &amp; Symptoms of Heart Failure (COMPASS-HF) Extension
      Phase Study (IDE # G020304). The purpose of the study is to use daily cardiac filling
      pressures from the Chronicle device to provide timely medication adjustments (diuretics) to
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to transmit to the CareLink Network daily. Data specific to this study
      (subject's daily estimated Pulmonary Arterial Diastolic (ePAD) pressure values) will be
      extracted from the CareLink database and transferred to the IPC clinician website.

      As each subject is enrolled, clinicians at each participating site will determine the
      appropriate target pressure range for each subject based on a review of the subject's
      pressure data. Each day after enrollment, the subject's current pressure data will be
      compared to a target pressure range that the clinician sets for that subject.

      The patient instruction set (PtIS) is limited to a daily diuretic prescription and associated
      supplements, per physician discretion. The PtIS should not include adjustments of non-heart
      failure medications and should not include heart failure medications that are not indicated
      for day-to-day adjustments (e.g. ACE-Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), and
      Beta-Blockers). The PtIS will be sent from the IPC clinician website to the subject through a
      Patient Home Monitor.
