  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a newly developed technique in the field of
      endoscopic treatment for GI neoplasms, because of its high rate of en bloc resection. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD for GI neoplasms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is widely accepted as a minimally invasive treatment for
      GI neoplasms.However, one disadvantage of EMR is that lesions larger than 2 cm in diameter
      must be removed in pieces, which may result in a high recurrence rate of residual tumor
      tissue. In addition, in most patients, pathological assessment cannot be conducted after the
      procedure. ESD can overcome the disadvantages of EMR. However, it is difficult to perform ESD
      for GI neoplasms because of the high rate of complications.

    <description>ESD was carried out by using a single-channel upper gastrointestinal endoscope with a water-jet system (Q260J; Olympus Optical Co, Tokyo, Japan) and a high-frequency generator with an automatically controlled system (ENDOCUT mode) (Erbotom ICC 200; ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, TÃ¼bingen, Germany). The transparent attachment was fitted on the tip of the endoscope mainly to obtain a constant endoscopic view and to create tension on the connective tissue for the submucosal dissection.</description>
