  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will critically evaluate the effects of a novel dietary fiber administered to
      subjects at high risk for developing diabetes to determine if this intervention will improve
      insulin sensitivity compared to control product administration and, thus, decrease risk for
      developing diabetes.

      The hypothesis is that consuming this novel fiber twice a day for 12 weeks will significantly
      decrease fasting plasma glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin values in pre-diabetic
      subjects (i.e. subjects with fasting plasma glucose levels 95-140 mg/dl at screening)
      compared to consumption of the control product.

             at a sufficient level to complete study-related materials

          -  Age: at least 30 and no more than 70 years at randomization into this trial

          -  BMI: 25-40 kg/m2 at randomization into this trial

             history of gestational diabetes or first degree relative (parent or sibling) with
             history of diabetes; for those with glucose 100-125 mg/dl, will be enrolled as the
             primary target for recruitment; for those with glucose 126-140 mg/dl (asymptomatic
             diabetes), must not have prior diagnosis of diabetes and must not have prior
