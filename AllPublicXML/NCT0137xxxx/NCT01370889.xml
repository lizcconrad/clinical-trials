    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies resveratrol in postmenopausal women with high body mass
      index. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of
      resveratrol may keep cancer from forming. Studying samples of blood and urine in the
      laboratory from postmenopausal women who are taking resveratrol may help doctors learn more
      about the effects of resveratrol on biomarkers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of pharmacological doses of resveratrol on serum estradiol levels
      in post-menopausal women with high body mass index (BMI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of resveratrol on serum estrone, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding
      globulin (SHBP).

      II. Assess the effect of resveratrol on serum levels of insulin and C-peptide. III. Assess
      the effect of resveratrol on adipocytokine expression and secretion as measured by serum
      leptin and adiponectin.

      IV. Assess the effect of resveratrol on inflammatory cytokines as measured by serum
      C-reactive protein (CRP).

      V. Assess the effect of resveratrol on oxidative stress as measured by urinary
      8-isoprostaglandin F2 alpha (8-iso-PGF2 alpha) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG).

      VI. Assess the safety of resveratrol intervention as measured by reported adverse events,
      complete blood count with differential (CBC/diff), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and
      lipid profile.

      VII. Assess the relationship between systemic study agent exposure and biomarker modulation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive resveratrol orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 2 weeks
