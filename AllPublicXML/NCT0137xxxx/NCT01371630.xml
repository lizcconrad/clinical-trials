      If you are reading and signing this form on behalf of a potential participant, please note:
      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of the Phase I part of this clinical research study is to test 2 dose levels of the
      drug inotuzumab ozogamycin to find the highest tolerable dose that can be given in
      combination with chemotherapy. The goal of Phase II is to learn if inotuzumab ozogamycin
      given in combination with chemotherapy can help to control acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (ALL). The safety of the study drugs will also be studied.

      Participants in this study are at least 60 years of age and have newly diagnosed ALL or have
      refractory-relapsed ALL regardless of age.

      Inotuzumab ozogamycin is designed to attach to a protein that is often found in leukemia
      cells. This may cause the cancer cells to die.

      Rituximab is designed to attach to cancer cells and damage them, which may cause the cells to
      die.

      Hyper-CVD includes a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dexamethasone,
      methotrexate, Ara-C (cytarabine), and Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). The maintenance therapy used
      in this study is called POMP, which includes a combination of mercaptopurine, methotrexate,
      vincristine, and prednisone. These chemotherapy drugs are designed to interfere with the
      multiplication of cancer cells, which may slow or stop their growth and spread throughout the
      body. This may cause the cancer cells to die.

      This is an investigational study. Inotuzumab ozogamycin, rituximab, Hyper-CVD, methotrexate,
      cytarabine, blinatumomab, and POMP maintenance drugs are FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of leukemia. Combining inotuzumab ozogamycin with rituximab is
      investigational.

      Up to 256 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. One (1) group of 6 participants will be enrolled in
      the Phase I portion of the study, and 1 group of up to 60 participants will be enrolled in
      Phase II.

      The Phase I group will receive the lowest dose level of inotuzumab ozogamycin. The Phase II
      group will receive a higher dose of inotuzumab ozogamycin, if no intolerable side effects
      were seen.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of the rest of the study drugs.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive up to 8 cycles of induction and consolidation therapy and possibly 4 cycles
      of blinatumomab treatment. Each induction/consolidation cycle is about 3-4 weeks.
      Blinatumomab cycles are about 42 days.

      Hyper-CVD: Cycles 1, 3, 7, and 9:

      On Days 1-3 of Cycles 1, 3, 7, and 9, you will receive cyclophosphamide every 12 hours by
      vein over about 3 hours.

      On Days 1-3 of Cycles 1, 3, 7, and 9, you will receive mesna as a continuous infusion
      starting about 1 hour before you receive cyclophosphamide and ending about 12 hours after the
      last dose of cyclophosphamide. Mesna is given to lower the risk of side effects.

      On Days 1 and 8 of Cycles 1, 3, 7, and 9 (+/- 2 days), you will receive vincristine by vein
      over about 30 minutes.

      On Days 1-4 and 11-14 of Cycles 1, 3, 7, and 9 (+/- 2 days), you will take dexamethasone by
      vein or by mouth 1 time a day.

      On Days 2 and 8 of Cycles 1 and 3 (+/- 2 days), you will receive inotuzumab ozogamycin by
      vein over about 60 minutes (+/- 15 minutes). The dose you receive will depend on when you
      start treatment. If your doctor thinks it is needed to lower the risk of side effects, you
      will take acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and hydrocortisone before your doses of inotuzumab
      ozogamycin. Acetaminophen will be given by mouth. Diphenhydramine will be given by mouth or
      by vein over 15-30 minutes. Hydrocortisone will be given by vein over 15-30 minutes.

      On Days 1 and 8 of Cycles 1 and 3 (+/- 2 days), if your doctor feels it is in your best
      interest, you may receive rituximab. The study doctor will decide how long the infusion will
      last.

      You will also receive methotrexate alternating with cytarabine by a spinal tap
      (intrathecally) to help lower the risk of the disease coming back in the fluid surrounding
      your brain. A spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture) is when fluid surrounding the spinal
      cord is removed by inserting a needle into the lower back. The affected area is numbed with
      local anesthetic during the procedure. It can also be used to give chemotherapy.

      On Day 2 of Cycles 1 and 3 (+/- 2 days) and on Day 8 of Cycles 2 and 4, you will receive
      intrathecal methotrexate.

      On Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 3 (+/- 2 days) and on Day 5 of Cycles 2 and 4, you will receive
      intrathecal cytarabine.

      On Day 4 of Cycles 1, 3, 7, and 9 (+/- 2 days) you will receive pegfilgrastim as an injection
      under the skin.

      Methotrexate alternating with cytarabine by vein: Cycles 2, 4, 8, and 10 On Day 1 of Cycles
      2, 4, 8, and 10, you will receive methotrexate by vein over about 24 hours (+/- 3 hours).

      On Days 2 and 3 of Cycles 2, 4, 8, and 10 you will receive cytarabine by vein 2 times a day
      over about 3 hours each time.

      On Days 1 and 8 of Cycles 2 and 4 (+/- 2 days), if your doctor feels it is in your best
      interest, you may receive rituximab by vein over about 2-6 hours.

      On Days 2 and 8 of Cycles 2 and 4 (+/- 2 days), you will receive inotuzumab ozogamycin by
      vein over about 60 minutes (+/- 15 minutes). If your doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest, you may receive inotuzumab ozogamycin more often.

      On Day 4 of Cycles 2, 4, 8, and 10 (+/- 2 days), you will receive pegfilgrastim as an
      injection under the skin.

      On Days 2-5 of Cycles 2, 4, 8, and 10 you will receive leucovorin by vein over about 1 hour
      or by mouth every 6 hours for 8 doses beginning about 12 hours (+/- 2 hours) after you finish
      receiving methotrexate. Leucovorin is given to lower the risk of side effects.

      On Days 1-29 of Cycles 5-6 and 11-12, you will receive blinatumomab by vein as a continuous
      infusion followed by 2 weeks of rest without treatment. During Cycle 5, you will receive a
      lower dose on Days 1-4, then the dose will be increased on Days 5-29. During Cycles 6, 11,
      and 12, the dose will be the same each day. You may be asked to remain in the hospital on
      Days 1-6 of Cycle 5 and Days 1-2 of Cycle 6. If you are tolerating the treatment well, you
      may receive the remaining treatment as an outpatient. You will be asked to return to MD
      Anderson at specific times so the infusion bag can be properly changed.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 5, 6, 11 and 12 you will receive dexamethasone by vein over 15 - 30
      minutes about 1 hour before beginning the treatment with blinatumomab to lower the risk of
      side effects.

      Your dose of the study drugs may change depending on any side effects you may have.

      You may be given other drugs to help prevent side effects. Your doctor will tell you about
      these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.

      Maintenance Therapy:

      After you complete the cycles described above, you will receive POMP maintenance therapy for
      up to 1 year if you received all 4 blinatumomab cycles, or otherwise up to 3 years.

      You will take mercaptopurine by mouth 2 times a day for 3 years.

      You will take methotrexate by mouth 1 time a week for 3 years.

      You will receive vincristine by vein over about 30 minutes 1 time a month for 1 year.

      You will take prednisone by mouth 1 time a day for 5 days every month for 1 year.

      If bone marrow samples drawn during consolidation and maintenance therapy show that the
      disease is not gone, your doctor may recommend that you receive additional doses of
      inotuzumab ozogamycin. You would receive it at a lower dose 1 time every 3-4 weeks for up to
      6 doses instead of receiving the POMP maintenance therapy.

      If you did not receive blinatumomab during induction and consolidation, and if you doctor
      thinks it is in your best interest, you may receive 4 cycles of blinatumomab, during
      maintenance as described in Cycles 5, 6, 11, and 12 above.

      Study Visits:

      Within 1 week before Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked how you are feeling and about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to test how
           the study drugs may affect cancer cells.

        -  If you are receiving rituximab and if you have a history of irregular heartbeat or chest
           pain due to heart trouble, you will have ECGs performed before the rituximab infusion, 1
           time during the infusion, and within 2 hours after the infusion. The rituximab infusion
           will be stopped if you have any serious episodes of irregular heartbeat.

      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests 1-3 times each week during Cycles
      1 and 2, at least every 1-2 weeks during consolidation, and every 2-4 weeks during
      maintenance cycles.

      You will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy (about 1 teaspoon) to check the status
      of the disease between Days 14-21 (+/- 3 days) of Cycle 1, and then every 2-4 cycles during
      consolidation.

      Within 1 week before Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, you will have a chest x-ray to check
      your lungs.

      Every 3 months during maintenance:

        -  You will be asked how you are feeling and about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy (about 1 teaspoon). Bone marrow
           aspirations and/or biopsies may be done every 3-6 months beginning in the 2nd year of
           maintenance.

      The blood draws for routine tests, bone marrow aspirations/biopsies, and ECGs may be repeated
      more often anytime the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the study drugs for up to 12 cycles and then maintenance therapy for up to 3
      years. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up.

      Follow-up:

      You will have a follow-up visit 30 days after your last dose of the study drugs. At this
      visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may be having. If you cannot make it to
      the clinic for this visit, it can be done over the phone with a member of the study staff.
      The phone call should last about 10 minutes.
