      Overall improvement, severities and changes of specific clinical symptoms were surveyed in
      outpatients with depression or in a depressed state to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      PAXIL tablets in patients in whom the PAXIL dose was increased and those treated with a
      constant dose.

    <measure>Efficacy evaluation based on Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator asked the patient to fill out a set of self-administered BDI-II forms at each time of the patient's visits to the medical center (Patients were to make visits around 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after starting PAXIL).</description>

    <measure>Efficacy evaluation based on overall improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator comprehensively assessed the general condition of the patient at each time of the patient's visits to the medical center and rated the condition on a seven-grade eight-category scale (7 grades of markedly improved, moderately improved, slightly improved, unchanged, slightly worsened, worsened and severely worsened; a category of unassessable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy evaluation based on severities of specific symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator rated the severities of depressed mood, anxiety, feeling irritated, hypobulia, physical symptoms and sleep disorder on a four-grade scale (none, mild, moderate and severe) based on the interview and the results of BDI-II at each time of the patient's visits to the medical center (patients were to make visits around 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after starting PAXIL).</description>
