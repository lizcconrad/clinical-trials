    <textblock>
      Effect of intravenous iron substitution (iron carboxymaltose (Ferinject®), total dose 15 mg/
      kg (maximal dose: 1000mg) in 250 ml 0.9 % NaCl; intravenous infusion in 20 min)in non-anemic
      premenopausal women with iron deficiency on

      Primary objective:

      - Mitochondrial capacity (Phosphocreatine Recovery rate assessed by 31P-MR-spectroscopy of
      the lower leg muscle)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Maximal oxygen uptake during a graded cycling exercise test and time to exhaustion at
           submaximal power during a constant-load cycling exercise test

        -  Plantarflexor muscle fatiguability as assessed by isokinetic dynamometry

        -  Trial with medicinal product

    <description>The patients will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups (12 patients in each group): Group I: intravenous iron carboxymaltose; Group II: intravenous placebo. Group I (intravenous iron): Ferinject will be applied via a short infusion. Patients will receive 15mg/kg of iron as iron carboxymaltose Ferinject® in 250 ml 0.9% NaCl intravenously (time of infusion 20 mins), in a single dose. The maximum dose is limited to 1000mg iron. Group II (intravenous placebo): Intravenous placebo (250 ml 0.9 % NaCl will be administrated in the same manner and time schedule than group I.</description>
