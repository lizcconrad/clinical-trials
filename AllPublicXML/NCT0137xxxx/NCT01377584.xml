  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effect of a couple-oriented education
      and support intervention on patient- and partner -reported outcomes (positive airway pressure
      (PAP) adherence) in patients newly diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is an effective treatment for obstructive
      sleep apnea (OSA), but adherence is poor. CPAP adherence interventions to date have been met
      with limited success. Intervention strategies would be optimized by added support for
      patients and alternative strategies for intervention delivery. Significant others (SO) are
      likely to exert positive and negative effects on the patient's adoption and use of positive
      airway pressure (PAP) therapy and are frequently described as the greatest source of social
      support for patients with chronic illness. Beginning the intervention before PAP initiation
      would capitalize on the teachable moment shortly following diagnosis when education and
      social support may be most essential. The aims of the research plan are to examine the
      effects of a couple-oriented education and support intervention on patient- and
      partner-reported outcomes as compared to a patient-oriented education and support
      intervention and usual care and to examine the relationship between PAP adherence and
      patients' and partners' sleep quality and daytime functioning. Patients in the pilot study
      will be randomized to the couple-oriented intervention, patient-oriented intervention, or
      standard clinical care group.

    <measure>Daytime Sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months after CPAP initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is an 8-item questionnaire that assesses daytime sleepiness.Total scores range from 0 to 24. A score of &gt; 10 indicates excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep-related Functional Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months after CPAP initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire-10 is 10-item questionnaire assesses the impact of sleep disorders of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of everyday living. Scores for five domains of functioning (e.g., activity, vigilance, intimacy and sexual relationships, general productivity, and social outcome) are obtained. Each domain score ranges from 1 to 4 (1 indicating more difficulty). The total score is derived by calculating the mean of the domain scores and multiplying by five. The total score ranges from 5 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater functioning.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months after CPAP initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19 item questionnaire that measures self-reported sleep quality and disturbances over the last 1 month time period. The questionnaire measures 7 components of sleep quality: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. A global PSQI score is obtained by summing the 7 component scores (range = 0-21). A PSQI global score &gt; 5 indicates a poor sleeper.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>one week, one month, and 3 months after CPAP initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be measured as the amount of time that the CPAP machine is turned on and maintained at prescribed pressure. The latter number represents the amount of time power is on and the mask is positioned properly on the face. All patients will be using a CPAP machine with remote monitoring capabilities. Adherence reports are automatically uploaded to a secure data center daily. Adherence data can be accessed through the web-based patient compliance management system, EncoreAnywhere.</description>

Couple-oriented intervention: The first session will occur before the patient receives his/her CPAP. This session will provide the couple with education on sleep apnea and CPAP, demonstration of PAP equipment, explore patient's concerns about starting CPAP treatment, and provide a goal setting exercise. The second face to face session will occur one week after the patient receives his/her CPAP. The second session will provide the couple with information on CPAP usage and pre- and post-treatment AHI, explore barriers to CPAP use and benefits of CPAP use, and provide a goal setting exercise. The individual telephone follow-up sessions will occur two weeks after the patient has received his/her CPAP.

          <description>Patients randomly assigned to the couple-oriented (CO) group will attend two face to face sessions and participate in an individual telephone follow-up session.
Couple-oriented intervention: The first session will occur before the patient receives his/her CPAP. This session will provide the couple with education on sleep apnea and CPAP, demonstration of PAP equipment, explore patient's concerns about starting CPAP treatment, and provide a goal setting exercise. The second face to face session will occur one week after the patient receives his/her CPAP. The second session will provide the couple with information on CPAP usage and pre- and post-treatment AHI, explore barriers to CPAP use and benefits of CPAP use, and provide a goal setting exercise. The individual telephone follow-up sessions will occur two weeks after the patient has received his/her CPAP. This session will review CPAP usage and explore barriers and facilitators of CPAP use.</description>

        <description>The Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire-10 is 10-item questionnaire assesses the impact of sleep disorders of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of everyday living. Scores for five domains of functioning (e.g., activity, vigilance, intimacy and sexual relationships, general productivity, and social outcome) are obtained. Each domain score ranges from 1 to 4 (1 indicating more difficulty). The total score is derived by calculating the mean of the domain scores and multiplying by five. The total score ranges from 5 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater functioning.</description>

The second face to face session will occur one week after the patient receives his/her CPAP. The second session will provide the couple with information on CPAP usage and pre- and post-treatment AHI, explore barriers to CPAP use and benefits of CPAP use, and provide a goal setting exercise. The individual telephone follow-up sessions will occur two weeks after the patient has received his/her CPAP. This session will review CPAP usage and explore barriers and facilitators of CPAP use.</description>

        <title>Sleep Quality</title>
        <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19 item questionnaire that measures self-reported sleep quality and disturbances over the last 1 month time period. The questionnaire measures 7 components of sleep quality: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. A global PSQI score is obtained by summing the 7 component scores (range = 0-21). A PSQI global score &gt; 5 indicates a poor sleeper.</description>

Patient-oriented intervention: The first session will occur before the patient receives his/her CPAP. This session will provide the patient with education on sleep apnea and CPAP, demonstration of PAP equipment, explore patient's concerns about starting CPAP treatment, and provide a goal setting exercise. The second face to face session will occur one week after the patient receives his/her CPAP. The second session will provide the patient with information on CPAP usage and pre- and post-treatment AHI, explore barriers to CPAP use and benefits of CPAP use, and provide a goal setting exercise. The telephone follow-up sessions will occur two weeks after the patient has received his/her CPAP. This session will review CPAP usage and explore barriers and facilitators of CPAP use.</description>

          <title>Sleep Quality</title>
          <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19 item questionnaire that measures self-reported sleep quality and disturbances over the last 1 month time period. The questionnaire measures 7 components of sleep quality: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. A global PSQI score is obtained by summing the 7 component scores (range = 0-21). A PSQI global score &gt; 5 indicates a poor sleeper.</description>

        <title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Adherence</title>
        <description>Adherence will be measured as the amount of time that the CPAP machine is turned on and maintained at prescribed pressure. The latter number represents the amount of time power is on and the mask is positioned properly on the face. All patients will be using a CPAP machine with remote monitoring capabilities. Adherence reports are automatically uploaded to a secure data center daily. Adherence data can be accessed through the web-based patient compliance management system, EncoreAnywhere.</description>

          <title>Patients in the Couple-oriented Intervention</title>
          <description>Patients randomly assigned to the couple-oriented (CO) group will attend two face to face sessions and participate in an individual telephone follow-up session.
Couple-oriented intervention: The first session will occur before the patient receives his/her CPAP. This session will provide the couple with education on sleep apnea and CPAP, demonstration of PAP equipment, explore patient's concerns about starting CPAP treatment, and provide a goal setting exercise. The second face to face session will occur one week after the patient receives his/her CPAP. The second session will provide the couple with information on CPAP usage and pre- and post-treatment AHI, explore barriers to CPAP use and benefits of CPAP use, and provide a goal setting exercise. The individual telephone follow-up sessions will occur two weeks after the patient has received his/her CPAP. This session will review CPAP usage and explore barriers and facilitators of CPAP use.</description>
