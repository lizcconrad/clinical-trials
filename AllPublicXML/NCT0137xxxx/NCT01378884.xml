      The purpose of this study is to determine whether domperidone can be used safely and
      effectively for patient with gastroparesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who have been diagnosed with gastroparesis and have failed at least one standard
      therapy will be offered to trial domperidone as a possible remedy to their condition.
      Patients on the medication will be expected to to be followed by the physician at 3 months, 6
      months 12months, and then annually while on the medication. Any change or significant adverse
      reaction to the medication or in their condition should be reported immediately to their
      physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female

          2. Age 18 or older

          3. Symptoms or manifestations secondary to GERD (e.g., persistent esophagitis, heartburn,
             upper airway signs or symptoms or respiratory symptoms), gastrointestinal motility
             disorders such as nausea, vomiting, severe dyspepsia or severe chronic constipation
             that are refractory to standard therapy.

          4. Subjects must have a comprehensive evaluation to eliminate other causes of their
             symptoms.

          5. Subject has signed informed consent for the administration of domperidone. The
             informed consent informs the subject of potential adverse events including:

               -  increased prolactin levels,

               -  extrapyramidal side effects,

               -  breast changes,

               -  cardiac arrhythmias including QT prolongation, and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of or current cardiac disease, including ischemic or valvular heart disease,
             other structural heart defects, cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure.

          2. History of or current arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular
             fibrillation and Torsade des Pointes. Subjects with minor forms of ectopy (PACs) are
             not necessarily excluded.

          3. Clinically significant bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction, or heart block. Prolonged
             QT syndrome (QTc greater than 450 milliseconds for males, greater 470 milliseconds for
             females) or family history prolonged QT syndrome.

          4. Presence of a prolactinoma (prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor).

          5. Conditions that result in electrolyte disorders, such as severe dehydration, vomiting,
             malnutrition, eating disorders, renal diseases, or the use of potassium-wasting
             diuretics or insulin in acute settings. (Note that the presence of vomiting, that may
             accompany gastroparesis or pseudo-obstruction does not by itself exclude the subject -
             only if accompanied by electrolyte disturbance must the subject be excluded.)

          6. Pregnant or breast feeding female.

          7. Known allergy to domperidone or any components of the domperidone formulation.

          8. Significantly significant electrolyte disorders.

          9. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or obstruction.
