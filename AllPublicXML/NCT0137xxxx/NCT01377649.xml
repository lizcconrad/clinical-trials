      Contrast ultrasound is a technique that can quantify blood flow in the tissues of the body by
      ultrasound detection of microbubble contrast agents that behave in the circulation similar to
      red blood cells. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that contrast ultrasound of
      blood flow in the leg (thigh and calf) at rest and during stress produced by medications that
      mimic exercise (vasodilator stress) can provide information on the location and severity of
      peripheral vascular disease (blockages of the blood vessels in the leg). The investigators
      will also determine whether symptom improvement after revascularization (procedures to open
      up or bypass the blockages) is directly related to the improvement in blood flow.
