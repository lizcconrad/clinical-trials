      This study will attempt to study the effect of memantine, on memory, and motor
      praxis/expressive language skills in children with autism.

      The investigators will recruit children ages 6-12 years who are verbal and meet criteria for
      Autism Spectrum Disorder. The children will be assessed for memory function, expressive
      language output and motor skills/praxis. They will then be randomized to memantine or placebo
      for 6 months. The effects of this medication and its safety in this population will be
      studied over the 6 month period.

    <textblock>
      Abnormalities in the modulation of the glutamate system have been reported by multiple
      investigators studying animal models, post-mortem brains, and single gene disorders that have
      overlapping phenotypes with autism. Abnormalities in glutamatergic function have been
      reported in disorders affecting a variety of behavioral and neurological domains, from mood
      stability, to cognitive flexibility, memory, and motor function. Numerous studies have
      reported a variety of memory and motor deficits in children with autism. Whereas the
      neurobiology of such deficits is an area of active research, there is a paucity of
      intervention research for such deficits in autism. This study will attempt to study the
      effect of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) inhibitor, memantine, on memory, and motor
      praxis/expressive language skills in children with autism.

      Methods: Children ages 6-12 years who are verbal and meet criteria for Autism Spectrum
      Disorder will be recruited across 2 sites. After consent, the children will be assessed for
      memory function, expressive language output and motor skills/praxis. They will then be
      randomized 1:1 to memantine versus placebo for 6 months. The effects of this medication on
      the above mentioned symptoms domains as well as its safety in this population will be studied
      over the 6 month period.

    <description>Outcome Measure is going to report a change. The NEPSY provides a developmental neuropsychological assessment for children age 3-12.

    <description>Outcome Measure is going to report a change. The Vineland Scale is a semi-structured informant interview that assesses subjects' daily functioning. It is typically administered to a caretaker/family member. This scale has been found to assess social deficits in autism and relative strengths in daily living skills.</description>

    <description>The SMURF consists of three parts. Part 1 contains a &quot;General Inquiry&quot; to obtain all information about possible physical complaints, using general probes. Part 2 comprises &quot;Specific Inquiries&quot; about physical complaints, organized roughly around different body systems. Part 3 concludes with a &quot;Closing Inquiry&quot; in which the clinician can ask about any physical or other problems he/she has pre-existing knowledge about or which he/she noticed during the rest of the inquiry.</description>
