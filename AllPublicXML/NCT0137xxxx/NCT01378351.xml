  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the accompanying symptoms, evaluation and
      management of patients with chronic vestibular dysfunction presenting with nausea and
      vomiting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on prior study, a significant portion of patients referred for refractory gastroparesis
      in fact have signs suggestive of vestibular dysfunction as the cause of chronic nausea and
      vomiting. Our prior retrospective study identified a population of said subjects.

      The aim of this study is to further characterize the concomitant symptoms, course of
      diagnosis, treatment and long-term follow up (up to 5 yrs) of this condition.
