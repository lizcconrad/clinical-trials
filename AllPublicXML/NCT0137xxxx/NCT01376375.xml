  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical treatment. Thin needles are used to stimulate
      specific points in the body. Previous studies have found that acupuncture can be useful in
      treating low back pain. This study will explore how acupuncture affects low back pain.
      Researchers will look at blood samples for changes in different chemicals related to
      inflammation and pain.

      Objectives:

      - To test the effect of acupuncture on blood chemicals associated with chronic low back pain.

      Eligibility:

        -  People at least 18 years of age who have chronic low back pain.

        -  Those who have had back surgery or had acupuncture for any medical condition may not
           participate.

      Design:

        -  This study requires eight visits over 2 to 3 weeks. Each visit will take 1.5 to 2 hours.

        -  At the first study visit, participants will give a medical history and complete two
           questionnaires about their low back pain. They will also spend 30 minutes lying down on
           a bed, relaxing quietly.

        -  The next visits will occur every 2 to 3 days for the next 2 weeks. Participants will
           receive 30 minutes of either sham or standard acupuncture. Sham acupuncture will mimic
           the standard procedure, but no needles will be used. The standard procedure will be
           performed in the same location. A licensed, experienced acupuncturist will insert small
           disposable needles into acupuncture sites on the back, arms, and legs. Those in the
           study will not know whether they are receiving the sham or the standard acupuncture
           procedure.

        -  At some visits, participants will provide blood samples for testing. At every visit,
           participants will complete the questionnaires about low back pain.

      Objective:

      Inflammation and primary mechanical derangements are thought to be the two major causes
      leading to low back pain (LBP) syndromes. Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines and
      hormones, including IFN-gamma, IL-17, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, MMP10, NGF, PGE2, NO and
      IL-8, play critical roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory LBP. This study will
      investigate the effect of acupuncture on LBP by measuring serum cytokine and hormone levels
      before and after treatment in participants. To define the molecular mechanism by which
      acupuncture affects LBP, histone modification, including H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, as well as
      methylation patterns of CpG islands on the promoters of selected genes in the peripheral
      CD4(plus) T cells will be also tested.

      Study Population:

      Five participants with chronic LBP will receive treatment.

      Design:

      In this non-randomized, single group pilot study, participants will be given sham acupuncture
      and subsequently treated with acupuncture for a total of eight visits over the span of 17
      days. Blood will be drawn and analyzed at scheduled intervals.

      Outcome Measure:

      The primary outcome is to investigate the potential effect of acupuncture treatment, as
      compared to sham acupuncture and quiet relaxation, on the regulation of IFN-gamma and IL-17
      in participants with LBP, including the serum level of these two cytokines, frequency of
      CD4(plus)IFN-gamma(plus) and CD4(plus)IL-17(plus) cells in the peripheral blood, and the
      patterns of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and DNA methylation on their promoters in CD4(plus) T cells in
      response to acupuncture treatment. Secondary outcomes investigate the effects of acupuncture,
      as compared to sham acupuncture and quiet relaxation, on the following outcome measures:
      level of serum cytokines and hormones, including IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, MMP10, NGF, PGE2, NO,
      IL-8, IL-6, TGF-beta, IL-10, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-17F before and after acupuncture treatment;
      genome-wide gene expression profile of CD4(plus) T cells before and after acupuncture
      treatment; genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification in CD4(plus) T cells
      before and after acupuncture treatment; genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3
      modification in CD4(plus)T cells before and after acupuncture treatment; DNA methylation
      status change of selected CpG islands before and after acupuncture treatment; and the
      severity of LBP before and after two weeks of acupuncture treatment according to the Brief
      Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) for pain severity, as well as the Randall Morris
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) for LBP-related interference scores.
