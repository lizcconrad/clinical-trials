    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multi-institutional therapeutic study of NK-cell based nonmyeloablative
      haploidentical transplantation for the treatment of high-risk acute myeloid diseases.
      Enrollment will use a two-stage design. Stage 1 will enroll 15 patients unless an early
      stopping rule is met. If 9 or more of these first 15 patients achieve leukemia free
      neutrophil engraftment at day +28 accrual will move to stage 2. In stage 2, an additional 28
      patients will be enrolled for a total of 43 patients. Patients will be followed for disease
      response for 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A reduced intensity conditioning using Fludara, Cytoxan, and irradiation will start on day
      -22, followed by infusion of donor NK (natural killer) cells on day-17, 6 doses of
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) to promote NK expansion (day -17 to day -7), 2 doses of ATG for
      additional immunosuppression to promote engraftment (day -5 to -4), and infusion of a TCR
      α/β-depleted same donor graft on day 0.

    <description>The rate of donor neutrophil engraftment in the absence of leukemia at day +28 will be determined. Successful neutrophil engraftment is defined as an absolute donor-derived neutrophil count of &gt;500 cells/μl. Leukemia free is defined as &lt;5% bone marrow blasts, absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; but cytogenetic or molecular minimal residual disease is allowed.</description>
