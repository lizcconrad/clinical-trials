      The study aims to:

        1. Achieve molecular imaging of EGFR in patients with colorectal neoplasia in vivo using
           confocal laser endomicroscopy.

        2. Compare the results of in vivo EGFR-specific molecular imaging with CLE and ex vivo
           immunohistochemistry .

    <textblock>
      Various kinds of tumor markers have been shown to be over-expressed in colorectal cancer,
      including epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). The conventional detection method of EGFR
      expression in colorectal neoplasia is immunohistochemistry which is time-consuming, and the
      immunoreactivity can be affected by storage and fixation of tissues. Confocal laser
      endomicrosopy is a newly developed device which could identify the cellular and subcellular
      structures clearly with the magnification at×1000, making it possible to explore the
      physiological and pathological molecular mechanism of the gastrointestinal tract. So the
      study aims to achieve molecular imaging of EGFR in colorectal neoplasia in vivo using
      confocal laser endomicroscopy.
