  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis is a condition where a defect in the protective lining of the bladder
      causes the urinary symptoms such as urgency, frequency and pain/burning on urination. One way
      to help ease the symptoms of this disease is to fill the bladder full of water every 4 to 6
      months.

      Since this is a painful procedure an anesthesiologist will give you a drug that will make you
      unconscious for the procedure. General anesthesia can be given to you through an IV tube that
      is placed in a vein in your arm. There are only a few agents that induce sedation and these
      agents have certain disadvantages such as waking up slowly, low blood pressure, and pain at
      the injection site and a prolonged time to consciousness.

      This study will be comparing doses of a new IV sedation induction agent drug to put you to
      sleep called fospropofol (Lusedra®).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female outpatients

             -&gt; 18-65 years of age,

          -  weight 60-90 kg,

          -  with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of P1 to P3 are
             eligible for enrollment.

          -  Female patients of child bearing age will have a negative urine pregnancy test result
             and have used an acceptable method of birth control for &gt;1 month prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Patients will be NPO &gt;6 hours and scheduled for outpatient urological hydrodilation
             under general anesthesia.

          -  Patients also will not be enrolled in another study or have received an experimental
             drug in the prior 30 days.

        Exclusion criteria are:

          -  hypersensitivity or allergy to any anesthesia, opioids, benzodiazepines or any drugs
             used in the study, failure to meet NPO status or an abnormal, clinically significant
             ECG finding.

          -  Another exclusion is the presence of a difficult airway that would prevent use of the
             laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or successful LMA insertion.

          -  Women who are breast feeding would also be excluded from participation.
