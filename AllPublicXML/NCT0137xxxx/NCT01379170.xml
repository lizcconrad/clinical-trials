      Background of the study:

      Thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are known to promote weight loss,
      which could be beneficial for treating obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Thyroid hormone
      treatment stimulates energy expenditure resulting in increased body heat production, in which
      brown adipose tissue play an important role. It is hypothesized that thyroid hormones would
      induce increased energy expenditure via a process called mitochondrial uncoupling, thereby
      creating an inefficient energy status. Indeed, an in vivo study showed a 70% increased flux
      through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and an unchanged ATP synthesis rate upon T3
      treatment in lean, healthy young men. The disproportionate increase in TCA flux compared with
      ATP synthesis suggests increased mitochondrial uncoupling. It is however unknown whether
      increased mitochondrial uncoupling would increase fat oxidation and exerts favorable effects
      on insulin sensitivity. There is compelling evidence that type 2 diabetic patients have high
      levels of fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues, such as skeletal muscle, heart and liver.
      Ectopic fat accumulation is related to insulin resistance, however, why this fat accumulates
      in peripheral organs is not known. Recently, studies reported compromised mitochondrial
      oxidative capacity in type 2 diabetic patients and first-degree relatives of diabetic
      patients, suggested to play an important role. Therefore, subjects suffering from overweight
      and/or type 2 diabetes with overt hypothyroidism form an interesting group for examining the
      metabolic effects of thyroid hormone treatment, as less is known about the effects of thyroid
      hormone treatment in these groups.

      Objective of the study:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether thyroid hormone replacement therapy in type
      2 diabetic patients suffering from overt hypothyroidism, will improve muscular mitochondrial
      function, lower ectopic fat accumulation in muscle and liver, increase brown adipose tissue
      activity and enhance insulin sensitivity.

      Study design:

      Type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed with hypothyroidism will undergo 3 months of thyroid
      hormone replacement therapy (THRT) (Euthyrox®, Merck, Germany). Patients will be
      metabolically characterized (such as insulin sensitivity and fat accumulation in peripheral
      tissues) before and after this thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

      Study population:

      17 type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed with overt hypothyroidism (9 from the Netherlands, 8
      from Germany which will only do the PET-CT)

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      Thyroid hormone-induced change in whole body insulin sensitivity (change in
      insulin-stimulated glucose disposal) and muscle mitochondrial function.

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):

      Thyroid hormone-induced change of lipid content in skeletal muscle and liver and brown
      adipose tissue activity.

    <description>A dose of 25 μg per day of Euthyrox® will be administered orally during the first week and will be increased to 50 μg per day during the second week and to 75-100 μg per day in the third week depending on TSH, free T4 and T3 concentrations monitored throughout the treatment period. Patients will be instructed to take Euthyrox® after an overnight fast, 30 min before breakfast in the morning daily. After 3 months, free T4 and total T3 concentration must be in the normal range (free T4: 8.0-26 pmol/l, T4: 60-140 nmol/l and T3 1.2 - 3.4 nmol/l) and TSH 0.4-2.5 mU/l.</description>
