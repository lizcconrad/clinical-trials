      Primary Objective:

      - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of corrected adequate clinical and parasitological
      response at Day 28 of Artesunate Amodiaquine (ASAQ) versus chloroquine

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the non inferiority on the same way as the main criteria:

        -  at Day 28 before corrected cure rate

        -  at Day 14 and Day 42 before and after corrected cure rate

        -  To compare the two groups of treatment in terms of:

        -  Efficacy:

             -  Proportion of aparasitaemic patients at 24, 48 an 72 hours

             -  Proportion of afebrile patients at 24, 48 and 72 hours

             -  Percentage of gametocyte carriers during follow-up

             -  Evolution of the mean of gametocytes during the 42 days of follow-up

             -  Evolution of haemoglobin value between Day 0 and Day 7, Day 0 and Day 28

        -  Clinical and biological tolerability:

             -  Proportion of any adverse event

             -  Biological safety: haematology (Red blood cells, Haemoglobin, White Blood Cells,
                neutrophils, platelets), biochemistry (creatinine, transaminases (alanine amino
                transferase/ALT), bilirubins)

             -  ECG (electro encephalogram) (Day 0, Day 3,Day 28) only for patients 10 years old
                and above
