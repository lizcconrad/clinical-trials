      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of 6-weeks of relaxation acupressure
      compared to stimulating acupressure or a standard of care on sleep and daytime functioning.
      Also, to evaluate the ability of teaching acupressure using web-based applications.

      It is believed that self-administered relaxation acupressure will result in improvements of
      sleep quality and quantity as compared to stimulating acupressure or a standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a significant health problem and is associated with increased mental health
      issues: It is estimated that 9% to 15% of the adult population suffers from chronic insomnia.
      These estimates are considerably higher in primary care where from 20% to 33% suffer from
      chronic insomnia. Insomnia adversely affects psychological, physical and occupational
      functioning and places a significant burden on society. Moreover, several cohort studies have
      found that people with insomnia have significantly higher absenteeism at work, report poor
      self-esteem, less job satisfaction, and less efficiency at work compared to good sleepers.

      Acupressure is a TCM technique based on a philosophy similar to that of acupuncture (the
      placement and stimulation of very fine needles into acupuncture points). Acupressure involves
      placing physical pressure by fingers, thumb, elbow, or with the aid of various devices such
      as pencil erasers on different acupuncture points (acupoints). Depending on the date of the
      review and the inclusion criteria, e.g., searched in Chinese language databases, there are
      anywhere from 7^12 to 4^68 randomized clinical trials (RCT) of various types of acupuncture
      (inclusive of acupressure) for treating insomnia. Regardless of the review the conclusions
      are remarkably consistent. Mainly, that the majority of RCTs demonstrated that acupuncture
      was significantly more effective than BDZs, sleep hygiene counseling, no treatment and sham
      acupuncture for treating insomnia.

      The investigators will attempt to prove that self-administered Relaxation Acupressure (RA)
      will result in improvements in measures of sleep quality and quantity, compared to
      Stimulating Acupressure (SA) and a wait list control (WL). Also, that they will be able to
      teach the acupressure points using a web-based application.

      Participants will be randomized into 1 of 3 arms; RA, SA, or WL (standard of care). If
      randomized into one of the acupressure arms, the participants will view their appropriate
      acupressure training lesson online and be tested on their understanding. They will also be
      asked to perform their acupoints once per day for a total of 6 weeks.

    <description>Insomnia will be assessed/determined by daily sleep/wake diaries and the Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire. Sleep Diary: insomnia = &lt;85% sleep efficiency ratio.
Daytime functioning will be determined by the Fatigue Severity Scale of Sleep Disorders (FSS).</description>

    <measure>Success of teaching the acupressure interventions using a novel web-based application measured by an Acupressure Fidelity Form at week 1 and week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The success of learning acupressure via a web-based application will be assessed using an Acupressure Fidelity Form. The form will assess the participants ability to locate each acupressure point, demonstrate proper pressure/technique, and know the frequency of their treatments. Acupressure Form A is worth a total of 12 points while Form B is worth 13 points. Each correct answer is worth 1 point. We will consider our web based intervention &quot;successful&quot; if 95% of participants (49 of them) received a score of 100% at both visits.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to continue doing whatever their healthcare providers advise for their insomnia, but not to start any new treatments during the study. They will also be given a sleep hygiene handout as a standard of care. After six weeks, they will be reassessed and then provided the opportunity to engage in the web-based acupressure intervention.</description>

    <description>In addition to being given a sleep hygiene handout as a standard of care, participants will be asked to apply pressure on each of following points (bilaterally where indicated).

Each of the 9 acupoints will be stimulated for 3 minutes per point giving a total treatment time of 27 minutes done once daily.</description>
