      Study objectives Primary: To compare toxicity free survival of patients treated with ALC
      (acetylcarnitine) plus cisplatin-containing chemotherapy (CHT) versus those treated with
      placebo plus cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.

      Secondary: To compare progression free survival, overall survival, the compliance to
      treatment, the number of episodes of grade 3-4 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, neurotoxicity, as well as the proportion of
      patients experiencing grade 2-3-4 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events, neuropathic pain intensity, the clinical signs and/or symptoms (such as
      burning, numbness, itching, etc.) of the sensorial neuropathy between the two treatment arms.
      Study design Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III,
      superiority study in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer).

      Patients to be screened for study inclusion are those for which the decision to start a
      cisplatin-containing treatment has been already taken in the context of the clinical
      practice. The type of cisplatin-based treatment is not fixed, but each single investigator is
      free to choose for each single patient among those already approved for first line treatment
      of advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

      Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized with a 1 : 1 ratio to receive
      ALC + cisplatin-containing CHT or Placebo + cisplatin-containing CHT until patient refusal,
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death. The study will be conducted in Italy in
      approximately 20 investigational centers in order to recruit 650-675 subjects over a 30-month
      period.

      Both efficacy and safety data will be collected. Follow-up will be according to the clinical
      practice. Data capture will continue, for each patient, until death or study closure.

           from treatment complication

        -  Known drug abuse/ alcohol abuse

        -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity
