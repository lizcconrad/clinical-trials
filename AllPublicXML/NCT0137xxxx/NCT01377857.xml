  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over twenty percent of HIV-positive persons in the United States are unaware of their
      infection, leading the Institute of Medicine to recently urge further work to compare the
      effectiveness of HIV screening strategies. This study will use a randomized trial to compare
      several variants of emergency-room-based HIV-testing policies in order to determine how HIV
      test acceptance rates can be increased. The testing policies will be designed using
      principles from behavioral economics, varying the choice architecture and offering small
      monetary incentives. This will be the first study to measure differences in take-up rates
      across a variety of promising but largely untested approaches within a unified randomized
      trial. Three defaults will be tested: traditional opt-in (test only those patients who
      request testing), opt-out (routinely testing unless patients decline), and active-choice
      testing (patients are required to state whether they want to be tested). The study will also
      be the first to test the effect of small monetary incentives ($1, $5, $10) on test take-up.
      An additional novel study contribution will be to test the hypothesis that compliance with
      large requests (accept an HIV test) increases after making a small request or pre-commitment
      - this &quot;foot in the door&quot; technique has not been previously studied in this setting. The
      factorial design will permit a direct comparison of all interventions, as well as
      interactions. The study will contribute a nuanced empirical understanding of how testing
      protocols from behavioral economics theory affect the effectiveness and efficiency of
      screening programs in an actual scaled- up setting (San Francisco General Hospital). This
      will assist in implementing and assessing recent CDC guidelines on HIV screening, while also
      more generally advancing scientific knowledge related to applying behavioral economics in
      comparative effectiveness research.

    <description>Opt-in refers to a default of no test - patients must ask for the test in order to receive it. Patients are informed of the availability of rapid testing. They are tested only if they request the test.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>At a time that does not interfere with patients' medical care, patients will be approached by a member of the research team to consent to and complete a short (3 minutes) questionnaire. The questionnaire is designed to elicit two things: subjective risk of infection (e.g., What are the chances you have HIV? [Not possible, Unlikely, Possible, Likely, Certain]) and objective risk of infection (e.g., In the past year, have you given anyone drugs or money for sex?). The questionnaire will be administered as one of two timing treatments - a) at the beginning of care, before the patient is offered an HIV test (Early questionnaire) or b) after the patient has been offered an HIV test (Late questionnaire).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 13 - 64 years who are awake, alert, not intoxicated, and understand the
             premise of the test will be offered the test and questionnaire according to their
             treatment group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have altered levels of consciousness, are critically ill (e.g., serious
             trauma), are known to have preexisting HIV diagnosis, or who have been tested for HIV
             in the past 3 months will be excluded from the study.

          -  Pregnant patients will be excluded due to alternative guidelines for incorporating
             opt-out testing during prenatal care.

          -  Any patients who are in police custody will also be excluded due to their lack of
             control over study participation decisions and ethical concerns over possible
             coercion.
