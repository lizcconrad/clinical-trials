  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot project is to determine whether using one inertial sensor on the
      waist during routine clinical balance testing (i.e. Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)),
      will be a more immediate, objective, reliable and sensitive way to measure and quantify
      balance deficits in individuals with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI).

      The purpose of this pilot project is to gather preliminary data to determine whether using
      one inertial sensor at the waist during the BESS could provide the examiner with a more
      immediate, objective, reliable and sensitive way to quantify deficits in postural control in
      the post-concussive population. The investigators hypothesize that the metrics obtained from
      the iSWAY will be better able to distinguish mTBI subjects from control subjects than the
      standard clinical assessment. The specific aims are:

        1. To determine test-retest and inter-rater reliability of the clinical BESS compared to
           the instrumented BESS test.

        2. To determine if an instrumented BESS can distinguish mTBI from age-matched control
           subjects better than the commonly used BESS and to determine the best metrics of sway to
           separate groups.
