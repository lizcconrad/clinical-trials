      This is a compassionate use protocol to allow palliative therapy for patients with malignant
      pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pheochromocytomas (PHEO) and paragangliomas (PGL) are rare tumors, with an incidence of 2-8
      cases per million annually. These tumors develop in both children and adults. About 15-20%
      metastasize. Chemotherapy for this tumor usually consists of a combination of
      cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine delivered over two days and repeated every 3
      weeks. Such combined chemotherapy is ineffective for the majority of patients with metastatic
      PHEO/PGL. A few patients with malignant PHEO have experienced remissions with sunitinib, but
      the drug may produce severe toxicity and the experience with that drug is limited. Those
      patients who do experience a remission with chemotherapy must continue it indefinitely to
      stay in remission. However, most such patients experience such severe side effects from the
      chemotherapy (marrow suppression, neuropathy, etc) that their chemotherapy must be
      discontinued. Thus, chemotherapy is either ineffective or intolerable for the vast majority
      of patients with metastatic PHEO/PGL.

    <description>Therapeutic 131I-MIBG will be synthesized at Nuclear Diagnostic Products (NDP; Rockaway, New Jersey) with specific activities of 9-18 Ci/mmole. The therapeutic dose: 8-12 mCi/kg (maximum 500 mCi ± 10% at investigator's discretion) will be diluted in 25 ml of normal saline, and will be infused intravenously through a patient's peripheral or central line over 120 minutes. The patient will remain in a radiation protected isolation room until radiation emissions are ≤ 2 mr/hr at a 1 meter distance or meets institutional and state guidelines. This usually takes 4-6 days. In all cases, special shielding will be equipped in the room to minimize exposure to the outside environment and personnel will observe institutional radiation safety precautions. A radiation safety officer will instruct the patient, family, and caretakers about specific UCSF radiation safety guidelines for both hospitalization and discharge.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis: Refractory or relapsed PHEO/PGL with original diagnosis based on tumor
             histopathology or the finding of PHEO/PGL tumor cells in the bone marrow. The
             diagnosis may also be based upon the presence of high plasma fractionated
             metanephrines or high urine catecholamines/metanephrines with diagnostic MIBG uptake.

          -  Age: &gt; 2 years and able to cooperate with radiation safety restrictions during therapy
             period.

          -  Disease status: It must be determined that either the PHEO/PGL tumors are not amenable
             to safe surgical resection or are metastatic. Disease evaluable by MIBG scan must be
             present within 6 weeks of study entry and subsequent to any intervening therapy.

          -  Life Expectancy: greater than 3 months.

          -  Lanksy and Karnofsky Performance Status: 70% or higher.

          -  Prior Therapy: Patients may enter this study with or without having had other therapy
             for recurrent tumor. Patients may be treated who have not had chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy. Patients may also be treated who have failed to respond to standard
             chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Patients must have fully recovered from the toxic
             effects of any prior therapy. At least 2 weeks should have elapsed since any
             anti-tumor therapy and the patient must meet hematologic criteria below. Three months
             should have elapsed in the case of completing radiation to any of the following
             fields: total craniospinal, total abdominal, whole lung, total body irradiation).
             Cytokine therapy (eg G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, erythropoietin) must be discontinued a
             minimum of 24 hours prior to MIBG therapy. Prior 131I-MIBG therapy is allowed if &gt; 8
             weeks from previous treatment. Cumulative lifetime dose of 131I-MIBG, including the
             planned treatment, should not exceed 36 mCi/kg.

          -  Liver function: bilirubin &lt; 2x upper limit of normal (ULN). Exception: Gilbert
             syndrome); AST &lt; 10x ULN.

          -  Kidney function: Creatinine =&lt; 2x ULN.

          -  Hematopoietic Criteria Patients must have adequate hematopoietic function (without
             transfusion): ANC &gt;750 x 10E9/L; Platelets &gt;50 x 10E9/L if stem cells are not
             available; if stem cells are available, the patient should be independent of platelet
             transfusions with a platelet count of at least 20 x 10E9/L. Hemoglobin &gt;10g/dl at time
             of treatment (transfusion allowed). Patients with granulocytopenia and/or
             thrombocytopenia due to tumor metastatic to the bone marrow may be eligible after
             discussion with Dr. Fitzgerald or designee.

          -  Normal lung function as manifested by no dyspnea at rest or exercise intolerance, no
             oxygen requirement.

          -  No clinically significant cardiac dysfunction, normal EKG and EJ &gt;50%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with disease of any major organ system that would compromise their ability to
             withstand therapy. Any significant organ impairment should be discussed with the Study
             Chair or Vice Chair prior to patient entry.

          -  Patients with proteinuria in the absence of urinary infection 4 weeks prior to the
             planned treatment date.

          -  Because of the teratogenic potential of the study medications, no patients who are
             pregnant or breast feeding will be allowed. Patients of childbearing potential must
             practice an effective method of birth control while participating on this study, to
             avoid possible pregnancy.

          -  Patients who are on hemodialysis.

          -  Patients with active infections that meet grade 3-4 toxicity criteria.
