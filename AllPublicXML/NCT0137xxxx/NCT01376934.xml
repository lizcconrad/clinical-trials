      Nowadays,hysteroscopy is a golden standard procedure to describe the morphology of uterine
      cavity and investigate of abnormal uterine bleeding . The success of the procedure is based
      on the distension of the cavity . It can cause pain and discomfort and sometimes the
      procedure fails. . There are two techniques to make the procedure , one with gas and the
      other with saline solution. Objective: to compare two techniques concerning pain , procedure
      duration and image quality

      The objective of this study is to compare two techniques in office hysteroscopy.In this
      clinical trial postmenopausal women will undergo a diagnostic hysteroscopy using carbon
      dioxide or saline solution to uterine cavity distension.

      There will be two groups of 70 women each. The objective is to determine which technique
      provides better image,time of procedure and less discomfort.
