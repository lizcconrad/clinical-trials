    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of treatment of
      solifenacin succinate versus placebo in participants who are incontinent after Robotic
      Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.

      This study will also assess the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with solifenacin succinate
      versus placebo on quality of life (QOL) as measured by questionnaires.

      The study duration includes a 14-day treatment free wash-out period. The maximum total study
      duration is 15 weeks (2-3 week screening/washout period and a 12 week treatment period). The
      Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 visits will be telephone contact visits.

      Participants will complete an electronic daily pad use diary during the study duration.
      Participants will also be asked to complete several questionnaires during the study.

    <measure>Time From First Dose to Urinary Continence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary continence is defined as the first of three consecutive 24-hour days in which a participant uses no pads, or a pad for security which remains completely dry, during the 12-week treatment period. Participants recorded their daily pad usage in an electronic diary. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the distribution of cumulative incidence of urinary continence over the 12-week study treatment period. Participants who did not experience the event during the 12-week treatment period were considered as censored at the End of Treatment (EOT) visit or Week 12, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <measure>American Urology Association Symptom Score (AUASS) at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was measured by the American Urology Association Symptom Score (AUASS). The AUASS includes 7 questions addressing symptoms of frequency, urgency, nocturia (waking during the night to urinate), hesitancy, weak urinary, incomplete emptying, and intermittence. The questionnaire asked participants to consider how these symptoms affected them over the past month on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost always).
The AUASS is a sum of the 7 symptom scores and ranges from 0 (best) to 35 (worst).</description>

    <description>The ICIQ-SF is a validated self-administered questionnaire designed for patients with urinary incontinence. The ICIQ-SF assessed urinary incontinence using 3 scored questions which ask patients about their frequency of urine leakage, how much urine leakage, and perceived impact of leakage on daily lives over the past 4 weeks. The ICIQ-SF is a sum of the 3 scores and ranges from 0 (low bother) to 21 (maximum bother).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Work productivity was measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). WPAI asks participants about the effect of urinary leakage on their ability to perform their work-related functions and carry out daily activities over the past seven days. Percent work time missed is derived from the number of hours of work missed due to urinary leakage as a percentage of total hours that should have been worked. A higher percentage indicates more hours missed.</description>

        <description>Urinary continence is defined as the first of three consecutive 24-hour days in which a participant uses no pads, or a pad for security which remains completely dry, during the 12-week treatment period. Participants recorded their daily pad usage in an electronic diary. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the distribution of cumulative incidence of urinary continence over the 12-week study treatment period. Participants who did not experience the event during the 12-week treatment period were considered as censored at the End of Treatment (EOT) visit or Week 12, whichever occurs first.</description>

        <description>Quality of life was measured by the American Urology Association Symptom Score (AUASS). The AUASS includes 7 questions addressing symptoms of frequency, urgency, nocturia (waking during the night to urinate), hesitancy, weak urinary, incomplete emptying, and intermittence. The questionnaire asked participants to consider how these symptoms affected them over the past month on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost always).
The AUASS is a sum of the 7 symptom scores and ranges from 0 (best) to 35 (worst).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in American Urology Association Symptom Score (AUASS)</title>
          <description>Quality of life was measured by the American Urology Association Symptom Score (AUASS). The AUASS includes 7 questions addressing symptoms of frequency, urgency, nocturia (waking during the night to urinate), hesitancy, weak urinary, incomplete emptying, and intermittence. The questionnaire asked participants to consider how these symptoms affected them over the past month on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost always).
The AUASS Symptom Score is a sum of the 7 symptom scores and ranges from 0 (best) to 35 (worst).
End of treatment is the last on-treatment assessment during the treatment period.</description>

          <description>The ICIQ-SF is a validated self-administered questionnaire designed for patients with urinary incontinence. The ICIQ-SF assessed urinary incontinence using 3 scored questions which ask patients about their frequency of urine leakage, how much urine leakage, and perceived impact of leakage on daily lives over the past 4 weeks. The ICIQ-SF is a sum of the 3 scores and ranges from 0 (low bother) to 21 (maximum bother).</description>
          <population>Full analysis set with available ICIQ-SF data at both Baseline and each time point; &quot;n&quot; indicates the number of participants with available data at each time point.</population>

        <description>Work productivity was measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). WPAI asks participants about the effect of urinary leakage on their ability to perform their work-related functions and carry out daily activities over the past seven days. Percent work time missed is derived from the number of hours of work missed due to urinary leakage as a percentage of total hours that should have been worked. A higher percentage indicates more hours missed.</description>

        <description>Work productivity was measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). WPAI asks participants about the effect of urinary leakage on their ability to perform their work-related functions and carry out daily activities over the past seven days. Percent overall work impairment takes into account both hours missed due to urinary leakage and the participant's assessment of the degree to which urinary leakage affected their productivity while working. A higher percentage indicates greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
