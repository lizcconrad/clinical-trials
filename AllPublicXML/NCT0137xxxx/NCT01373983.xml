      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the effect of ziconotide can be tested by
      intrathecal bolus doses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intrathecal route for administration of analgesia has been in use in clinical practice
      for the last 3 decades. It is recommended to trial the patient with intrathecal drug therapy
      prior to implanting an intrathecal drug delivery device. Trials can be performed using a
      single bolus injection or by a continuous intrathecal infusion administered through an
      external catheter. Ziconotide has been approved by EMA for the treatment of chronic severe
      pain in 2005. So far trials of ziconotide have largely been conducted using external
      catheters with the drug administered by intrathecal infusion over a number of weeks.
      Infusions trials have been shown to be expensive, associated with a risk of meningitis and
      inconvenient to both patient and physician. The option of conducting a trial of intrathecal
      ziconotide therapy by bolus injection remains unexplored.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bolus dose of ziconotide (Prialt®)
      to evaluate the option of continuous administration of the drug via implanted pump in the
      event of a successful trial.

    <description>The average VASPI-score post-injection will be compared to the pre-injection value to yield a percentage pain reduction. Positive outcome is defined as a reduction of ≥30% in VASPI on two consecutive occasions at the same dosage without significant adverse events.

             pharmacological treatment

          -  only patients with peripheral neuropathic pain or central neuropathic pain, due to
             trauma or surgery, will be included

             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Limited life expectancy (investigator's judgement)

          -  Allergy to ziconotide or any of the excipients in the ziconotide vial

          -  History of psychiatric disorders which in the investigator's opinion would put the
