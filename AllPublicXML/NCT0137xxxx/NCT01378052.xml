    <textblock>
      Many studies previously showed the significant association between urinary arsenic profiles
      and urothelial carcinoma (UC) risk and observed the increased UC risk in people with lower
      plasma folate and higher homocysteine than those with higher plasma folate and lower
      homocysteine. The investigators would expect to explore the interactions among global DNA
      methylation, one-carbon metabolic pathway factors, urinary arsenic profiles and UC.

        This is a hospital-based case-control study. Patients with urothelial carcinoma are
        recruited by pathological verification of UC was done by routine urological practice
        including endoscopic biopsy or surgical resection of urinary tract tumors followed by
        histopathological examination by board-certified pathologists. Healthy controls without
        evidence of UC or any other malignancy were recruited including those receiving adult
        health examinations at China Medical University Hospital.
