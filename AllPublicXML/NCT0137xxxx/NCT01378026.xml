  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      G72 gene is located on the common linkage locus in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and it
      encodes D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA). There are evidences that elucidated G72 and
      D-amino acid oxidase(DAO) together playing a critical role in the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. Recently, reports discovered missense mutations in the DAO (R199W DAO and R38H
      DAO) are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), and our preliminary
      data showed that the level of G72 autoantibody decreases in patients with ALS compared with
      normal control. Thus, we want to find out whether G72 plays a role in ALS and
      neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease and Parkinson's disease. First, we
      detect G72 protein and its autoantibody in sera of neurodegenerative diseases patients using
      ELISA and Western blotting, and the data are compared with normal control. We hypothesize the
      levels of G72 protein and its autoantibody in neurodegenerative diseases are less than those
      in normal control. Then, we extract genomic DNA of neurodegenerative diseases patients, and
      use polymerase chain reaction(PCR) to detect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of G72. We
      aim to detect G72 missense SNP variants presented in ALS, AD and PD.
