    <textblock>
      This study will objectively evaluate ocular surface lubricants in subjects with dry eye
      syndrome. Lubricants contain compounds that are purported to improve dry eye symptoms,
      although objective data is not available. The investigators seek to objectively evaluate the
      effectiveness of two lubricants and compare the results to a saline eye drop (control).

      The investigators will assess the lipid layer before and after the administration of three
      products in the same eye of 25 dry eye subjects using the ellipsometry, imaging in a &quot;normal&quot;
      environment. Subsequently the investigators will change the environment to one that causes
      the subjects' ocular surface to experience &quot;evaporative stress&quot; (warmer, less humid and
      greater air flow) and perform the before and after drop administration measurements with the
      same three products in the same eye as the first environment.

    <time_frame>Measurements: There is no time restriction between the screening and 1st measurement. 6 measurement visits occur approximately 7 days apart but can range from 3 to 14 days. The time between visit 3 and 4 are not be closer than 3 days, but no upper limit.</time_frame>
    <description>The wavefront sensor instrument measures the eye's ability to create a sharp image.
Ellipsometer (E) data identifies changes in lipid thickness and refractive index over the cornea.
A thermal (T) imaging system provides thermal maps of the subject's eyes and face adjacent to the eyes.
A questionnaire (Q) will ask subjects about their test eye's comfort. Subjects will be asked the questions prior to instillation of the eye drop and after each set of measurements.</description>
