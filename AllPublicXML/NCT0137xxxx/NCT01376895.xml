    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop and test a program to help Black men who have sex with
      men and women reduce their chances of getting or giving HIV infection to their sex partners.
      The program is designed to be delivered via the internet so that it would be available to
      more men. Men who agree to participate in the study will be assigned by chance to receive the
      POWER intervention or a similar program that is focused on general health called
      POWER-HEALTH. They will also complete a computer administered interview when they first
      enroll in the study, 2 weeks following the last session of the program and 3 months after
      that. Participants will receive a small compensation for their time and effort.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the preliminary efficacy, feasibility and
      acceptability of delivering a culturally and developmentally tailored HIV risk reduction
      intervention via the Internet in real-time that promotes risk reduction among black men who
      have sex with men and women (BMSMW). During the Developmental Phase, our activities will
      consist of completing development (finalizing sessions, completing the manuals) of a
      theoretically grounded, culturally based, individual intervention, Project POWER, to reduce
      risk of HIV acquisition and transmission among BMSMW.

      The investigators will then conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the
      preliminary efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of POWER compared to HEALTH. Using chain
      referral methods, the investigators will recruit 200 BMSMW (100 per arm) and assign them to 1
      of 2 conditions (POWER or HEALTH). Participants will complete an assessment battery delivered
      via ACASI at baseline, immediate post intervention and at 3 months post intervention. The
      investigators will also measure uptake of HIV and STI testing. Participants will also
      complete acceptability/feasibility assessments after the

    <description>POWER is a three session intervention to help Black men who have sex with men and women lead healthier lives, make informed sexual choices and reduce their chances of getting or giving HIV to their sex partners. Interventions are designed to be delivered via the internet in real time by a trained health educator. Each session will last between 1 and 2 hours. The sessions are grounded on the social learning theory and use cognitive behavioral approaches. Participants learn the multiple influences on their behavior, how to identify their triggers and then use problem solving skills to develop a safer strategy for life. The sessions use videos and games to teach the lessons; participants are also given work that they must complete between the sessions.</description>
