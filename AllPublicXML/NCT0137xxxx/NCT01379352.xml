    <textblock>
      The vecuronium requirements may be reduced for recipients of living donor liver
      transplantation, as the vecuronium is eliminated principally by the liver. Furthermore, the
      requirements may be different according to the phase of surgery. The requirements may also be
      different according to the preoperative hepatic function as measured by MELD score during
      prehepatic phase, or graft to recipient body weight ratio (GRWR) during neohepatic phase.
      Therefore, the investigators are trying to investigate the difference of vecuronium
      requirements according to the phase of surgery or MELD score, GRWR.

      The vecuronium requirements may be reduced for recipients of living donor liver
      transplantation, as the vecuronium is eliminated principally by the liver. Furthermore, the
      requirements may be different according to the phase of surgery. The requirements may by
      further reduced during anhepatic phase of liver transplantation. And the requirements may be
      increased as the graft functions during neohepatic phase.

      We also postulated that the requirements may be different according to the preoperative
      hepatic function during preanhepatic phase, and according to the graft to recipient body
      weight ratio (GRWR) during neohepatic phase.

      Therefore, we are trying to investigate the difference of vecuronium requirements according
      to the phase of surgery, MELD score, GRWR.
