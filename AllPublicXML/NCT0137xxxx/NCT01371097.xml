  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of progressive resistance strength training
      (PRT) in elderly hospitalised patients. The hypothesis is that PRT given as an additional
      training would improve the rehabilitation and increase the level of activity of daily living.

    <textblock>
      Elderly inpatients included in the study were randomised into a control group or a training
      group. All included patients received the regular in-physiotherapy, but the training group
      received progressive resistance training in groups in addition.

    <description>The Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG) test assess basic functional mobility.(14). The test measures the time (in seconds)that the subjects used for standing up from the seating position on a chair (chair seat height = 45 cm) with armrest, walking 3 m, turning around and walking back to the chair and sitting down again.</description>

    <description>BI consists of 10 functional tasks of which 3 tasks focus the function of mowing and walking. Task numbers 8 in BI &quot;Transfer&quot; assess the ability to move and are rated on a 0, 5 and10 point ordinal scale. Task number 9 in BI &quot;Walking&quot; assess the ability to walk rated on a 0, 5 or 10 point scale.
Task number 10 in BI &quot;Stairs&quot; assesses the ability to walk on stairs and is rated with 0, 5, 10 or 15 points.</description>
