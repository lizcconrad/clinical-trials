  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of racial
      disparity in Barrett's esophagus (BE), the premalignant lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
      Specifically, the investigators hypothesize that environmental factors, genetic factors, and
      potentially gene environment interactions play crucial roles in the observed racial disparity
      in developing Barrett's esophagus.

      Patients are recruited through UNC hospitals prior to scheduled esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      (EGD). Participants complete a questionnaire, have body measurements obtained, and have
      blood, biopsies, and gastric aspirate collected. Participants also complete a 24 hour pH
      impedance test.

      Participants: Patients aged 18-80 presenting at the Gastrointestinal (Gl) Endoscopy Clinic at
      UNC-Chapel Hill for elective upper endoscopy with a primary or secondary indication of reflux
      symptoms.

      Procedures (methods): Endoscopic biopsy, pH impedance and sampling of gastric secretions will
      be performed according to our standard protocol. A series of questionnaires assessing
      demographics, environmental exposure (e.g., smoking, drinking), markers of socioeconomic
      status (SES), body measurement, previous health history, and gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) symptomatology will be administered to our subjects.

    <description>Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be used to estimate the association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE) among Caucasian Americans and African Americans, separately, in relation to patterns of the exposures of interest (tobacco use, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetable intake and other dietary measures, no NSAID use, and various measures of SES), with adjustments made for the frequency matching factors, age at reference (date of diagnosis for cases and date of identification for controls) and sex.</description>

    <measure>To investigate the association between BE and genetic and epigenetic status of Cdx1/Cdx2</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The promoter regions of Cdxl and Cdx2 genes will be examined for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pyrosequencing will be used to quantitatively determine the methylation status of Cdxl and Cdx2 promoters in esophageal biopsy tissues. For the single functional genotype analyses, conventional unconditional logistic regression will be used and ORs will be estimated for &quot;at-risk&quot; homozygotes and heterozygotes relative to &quot;wild-type&quot; homozygotes by creating indicator variables for each genotype.</description>

        The source of the study population will be patients aged 18-80 presenting at the
        gastrointestinal (Gl) Endoscopy Clinic at UNC-Chapel Hill for elective upper endoscopy with
        a primary or secondary indication of reflux symptoms. Any patient undergoing endoscopy with
        classic reflux symptoms is eligible to participate in the study. These symptoms include a
        substernal chest burning or warmth, a &quot;waterbrash&quot; sensation, regurgitation, or any chest
        pain worst when supine or after meals.

        Race will be self-identified race or ethnicity (SIRE) from a researcher-provided list.
        According to the NIH Policy on Reporting Race and Ethnicity Data published in August 8,
        2001 (NOT-OD-01-053), we will &quot;use two separate questions with ethnicity information
        collected first followed by the option to select more than one racial designation.&quot;
        Patients in this study should be &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino&quot;, and either &quot;African American&quot; or
        &quot;White&quot;.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 to 80

          -  Self-identify is &quot;not Hispanic or Latino&quot; and either &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;White.&quot;

          -  Cases will be eligible for inclusion if they have endoscopically evident Barrett's
             Esophagus (BE) of any length. BE will be defined as: 1) Any upward displacement of the
             squamocolumnar junction noted on endoscopy such that the interface of squamous and
             columnar mucosa is no longer at the interface of the most distal tubular esophagus and
             the proximal gastric folds. The characteristic pale pink coloration of the squamous
             epithelium in these areas will be replaced by the darker salmon color commonly seen in
             BE. 2) Histologic interpretation of biopsies consistent with intestinal columnar
             metaplasia containing goblet cells, which are positively stained by Alcian blue
             staining as barrel-shaped cells.

          -  Controls will be eligible for inclusion if they have classic symptoms of
             gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but no endoscopic or histological evidence of
             BE. Both erosive and non-erosive GERD will be eligible. Because we expect GERD to
             outnumber BE and patients with GERD may be slightly less willing to participate in the
             study than patients with BE (based on recruitment for the studies noted above), we
             plan to randomly sample one fourth of eligible controls. If approximately 20% fewer
             GERD than BE participate, a final study population with an approximately 1:2 BE to
             GERD ratio will be achieved. Oversampling of patients with GERD will improve study
             power.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to read or comprehend the informed consent or written
             questionnaires;

          -  Patients who are status post partial or complete esophageal resection;

          -  Patients with prevalent BE who have undergone endoscopic ablation;

          -  Patients found to have high-grade dysplasia or esophageal cancer on the index
             endoscopy;

          -  Patients with surgical anti-reflux procedures;

          -  Patients of races other than Caucasian and African Americans;

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Patients with a bleeding diathesis or other contraindication of endoscopic biopsy.

          -  Current use of warfarin, heparin, and/or low molecular weight heparin (requires
             discontinuation of medication 5 days prior to and 7 days after EGD).
