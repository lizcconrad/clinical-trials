      laser device can help to reduce the circumference of the upper arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper arm body contouring is designed to remove excess skin and/or fatty tissue from the
      upper arms. Cosmetic procedures are growing in prevalence, upper arm body contouring
      procedures increased 4059% from 2000 to 2008, and in 2009, just over 16,100 upper arm lifts
      were performed in the United States (U.S.). Currently available procedures to reduce upper
      arm circumference include brachioplasty (arm lift), a surgical procedure to remove excess
      skin and fatty tissue from the upper arm; liposuction of localized fatty deposits in the
      upper arm; and diet and exercise to reduce excess body fat. Both brachioplasty and
      liposuction are surgical procedures with risks and potential complications including trauma;
      fluid accumulation requiring drainage; injury to the skin; infection; permanent scars; and
      complications from anesthesia. Low level laser light therapy offers a safe, non-invasive and
      essentially risk-free alternative to reducing upper arm circumference.

      The device being evaluated for the reduction of upper arm circumference, the Erchonia ML
      Scanner (MLS) is cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under K082609 for &quot;... use
      as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment for the reduction of circumference of
      hips, waist, and thighs.&quot; Furthermore, FDA identifies this generic type of device as: &quot;A Low
      Level Laser System for Aesthetic Use is a device using low level laser energy for the
      disruption of adipocyte cells within the fat layer for the release of fat and lipids from
      these cells for non-invasive aesthetic use.&quot; Therefore, the biochemical effect of the
      Erchonia® MLS low level laser light therapy device stimulates the mitochondria of the
      adipocyte cells which in turn increases the production of Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP).
      The newly synthesized ATP triggers the up-regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
      (cAMP). cAMP has been shown to stimulate cytoplasmic lipase, triggering the conversion of
      triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol that can easily pass through the cell membrane.
      The transitory pore is evidence that the laser is allowing for the movement of fatty acids,
      glycerol, and triglycerides to pass across the membrane and into extra-cellular space.
      Through vasodilation of nearby blood vessels and arteries, oxidization of the triglycerides
      and fatty acids occurs within the extra-cellular space.

    <measure>Change in Combined Upper Arm Circumference Measurements From Baseline to Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in combined upper arm circumference measurements is calculated as the difference in combined upper arm circumference measurements from baseline to endpoint (2 weeks) for each of the right upper arm and the left upper arm, separately. A change of at least +1.25 centimeters, for each of the right upper arm and the left upper arm, separately, is considered positive for study success for an individual subject. It was pre-determined that the overall study would be considered a success if at least 50% (16 or more out of 31) of the test group subjects attained individual subject success and individual subject successes in the placebo group were at least 35% lower than for test group subjects (5 or less out of 31).</description>

    <description>The Erchonia ML Scanner (MLS) is a low level laser light therapy device comprising 4 independent rotating diodes, each emitting 17mW 635nm of red laser light. The diodes are mounted in scanner devices positioned 120 degrees apart from each other, tilted at a 30 degree angle. The Erchonia® MLS is activated for 20 minutes per arm during which time the 4 rotating diodes create a spiraling circle pattern that is totally random and independent from the others. These patterns overlap each other to guarantee total coverage within the target area. The total laser energy the test subject is exposed to per treated arm is approximately 3.94 joules per square centimeter. Six procedures are administered evenly across 2 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change in Combined Upper Arm Circumference Measurements From Baseline to Endpoint</title>
        <description>Change in combined upper arm circumference measurements is calculated as the difference in combined upper arm circumference measurements from baseline to endpoint (2 weeks) for each of the right upper arm and the left upper arm, separately. A change of at least +1.25 centimeters, for each of the right upper arm and the left upper arm, separately, is considered positive for study success for an individual subject. It was pre-determined that the overall study would be considered a success if at least 50% (16 or more out of 31) of the test group subjects attained individual subject success and individual subject successes in the placebo group were at least 35% lower than for test group subjects (5 or less out of 31).</description>

            <description>The Erchonia ML Scanner (MLS) is a low level laser light therapy device comprising 4 independent rotating diodes, each emitting 17mW 635nm ed laser light. The diodes are mounted in scanner devices positioned 120 degrees apart from each other, tilted at a 30 degree angle. The Erchonia® MLS is activated for 20 minutes per arm during which time the 4 rotating diodes create a spiraling circle pattern that is totally random and independent from the others. These patterns overlap each other to guarantee total coverage within the target area. The total laser energy the test subject is exposed to per treated arm is approximately 3.94 joules per square centimeter.
