  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blockage of the heart arteries (coronary artery disease) can lead to angina (chest pain),
      heart attacks, heart failure, and/or death. Positron emission tomography (PET) stress
      myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a powerful tool to help identify blockages in the
      coronary arteries. During the PET MPI test, a drug is given to mimic the effects of exercise
      on the heart. The study was done to measure blood flow to the heart using two similar drugs
      approved to mimic the effects of exercise on the heart in people during a heart stress test.
      The first drug, called adenosine, has been approved for this use for several decades. The
      second drug, called regadenoson, was approved in 2008. The investigators were looking at
      whether the increase in blood flow to the heart with the newer drug (regadenoson) was similar
      to the increase in blood flow with the older drug (adenosine). This information is important
      for the use of these drugs in patients and for interpreting the blood flow values.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this study was that Regadenoson will produce a very similar degree of
      maximal hyperemia (increased blood flow) as adenosine, the other vasodilator agent. There
      were only 2 days on study for each subject.

      On Day 1 of the study, subjects were interviewed and had a physical exam, including a resting
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to exclude evidence of silent ischemia or myocardial
      infarction, and other cardiovascular disorders. Subjects were instructed to have a light meal
      at least 4 hours prior to the PET MPI. Subjects were instructed to abstain from
      caffeine-containing products for 24 hours prior to the PET scan. Day 1 of the study occurred
      less than or equal to 4 weeks of Day 2.

      On Day 2 of the study, each subject underwent three PET N-13 ammonia (10-20 mCi) dynamic
      emission acquisitions: resting, regadenoson (0.4 mg/5 mL IV), and adenosine (140
      microgram/kg/min; order of regadenoson vs adenosine was randomized according to subject's
      birth year), and three transmission acquisitions for attenuation correction. Each emission
      acquisition was separated by 50 min to allow for radioactive decay. At the end of the drug
      infusions, subjects were monitored for 5-30 min. Based on the known short biological
      half-lives of these stress agents, the pharmacologic effects of each drug should have
      dissipated by the time the next drug was administered.

    <description>MBF is the rate of blood supplied to the myocardium, or heart muscle. Hyperemic MBF is the rate of myocardial blood flow in the heart muscle during either regadenoson or adenosine stress. Myocardial blood flow was calculated using commercial software (PMOD Technologies, version 2.4).
The Hyperemic MBF was measured approximately 4 hours after arrival in the PET unit.</description>

Hyperemic MBF is the rate of myocardial blood flow in the heart muscle during either regadenoson or adenosine stress.

The Hyperemic MBF was measured approximately 4 hours after arrival in the PET unit.</description>
