    <textblock>
      This study will be an observational study in which patients who have been prescribed
      CerefolinNAC® are invited to participate in surveys regarding their experiences with
      CerefolinNAC®. CerefolinNAC® is a medical food indicated for the distinct nutritional
      requirements of individuals under treatment for early memory loss with particular emphasis
      for those individuals diagnosed with or at risk for neurovascular oxidative stress and/or
      hyperhomocysteinemia; mild to moderate cognitive impairment with or without vitamin B12
      deficiency, vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study is to
      increase the understanding of the role of CerefolinNAC® in managing proper neuronal function
      in the brain, provide patients with personalized education and support, and contribute to the
      overall understanding of the needs and concerns of patients being treated for early memory
      loss.

      Surveys used to conduct this study will be administered via telephone by InfoMedics, Inc., a
      company with an established system for developing such patient-physician feedback programs.
      Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program after
      CerefolinNAC® has been prescribed and provide them with a brochure containing an introduction
      to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients self-enroll, take a brief survey
      before starting their CerefolinNAC® prescription, and then two brief follow-up surveys at 6
      weeks and 12 weeks. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will
      receive individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and
      progress. Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to
      continue taking CerefolinNAC® as directed. Patients will also receive educational materials
      about managing their early memory loss.
