  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Millenium development goals (MDGs) call for reducing by half the proportion of people
      without sustainable access to safe drinking water. This goal was adopted in large part
      because safe drinking water has been seen as critical to fighting diarrheal disease. Source
      protection is considered the main intervention area to achieve this goal. However, research
      worldwide that has shown that even drinking water which is safe at the source is subject to
      frequent and extensive fecal contamination during collection, storage and use in the home.
      This contamination is through the introduction of cups, dippers or hands, contamination by
      flies, cockroaches, and rats. Even piped water supplies of adequate microbial quality can
      pose infectious disease risks if they become contaminated due to unsanitary collection,
      storage conditions and practices within households.

      To reduce this problem, point-of-use water treatment has been advocated as a means to
      substantially decrease the global burden of diarrhea and to contribute to the MDGs. However,
      research indicates that there are many unanswered questions around Household water treatment
      (HWT) that require small or medium scale epidemiological studies and randomized controlled
      trials, especially with regard to effectiveness, acceptability and identifying suitable
      target populations. Some of the most urgent questions to be resolved are:(1) How much of the
      currently cited disease reduction of HWT is due to bias? (2) What is the effect of HWT on
      nutritional status (weight gain and growth)?(3) At which populations should HWT be targeted?
      (4) Is it acceptable and sustainable in poor communities where the risk of diarrheal disease
      is high.

      hypothesis: Do household water treatment with chlorine reduce diarrhea among underfive
      children? hypothesis: Do household water treatment with chlorine acceptable in the community?
