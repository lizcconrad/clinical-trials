    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that on an equivalent calorie basis, oat based
      breakfast cereals do not provide the same satiety benefit. The study will also demonstrate
      the satiety comparison of the cereals related to product density.

      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that on an equivalent calorie basis, oat based
      breakfast cereals do not provide the same satiety benefit. The study will also demonstrate
      the satiety comparison of the cereals related to product density. Ninety-six healthy men and
      women 18 years of age or older will be enrolled into this study and divided into 2 groups of
      48 each to investigate the satiety impact of two oat based breakfast cereals compared to the
      leading ready-to-eat (RTE) oat based breakfast cereal. Each subject will participate in two
      test sessions (1 test cereal vs the leading RTE cereal). Subjects will come to the Ingestive
      Behavior Laboratory between 8 and 10 am after having nothing to eat for 10 hours prior to the
      scheduled visit time and be given one of the three cereals. The second session will be
      scheduled at least 1 week after the first. Visual analogue scales of hunger, satiety and
      subjective energy will be completed at baseline, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes. Subjects
      will return on another day separated by at least a week to repeat the breakfast. Area under
      the curves of appetite and satiety will be compared with a mixed model.
