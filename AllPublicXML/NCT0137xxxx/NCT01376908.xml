    <measure>Number of Subjects With Normal Neuromotor Developmental Milestones Assessed Using Denver Developmental Scale (DDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 26</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with normal neuromotor development were assessed by standardized developmental milestones using a parent/guardian report form in the following areas: fine motor, gross motor, language, and personal-social using DDS Test. DDS Test is a widely used to examine the developmental progress of 0-6 years of children. The scale reflects what percentage of a certain age group is able to perform a certain task. Tasks are grouped into 4 categories (social contact, fine motor skill, language, and gross motor skill) and include items such as smiles spontaneously (performed by 90% of three-month-olds), knocks 2 building blocks against each other (90% of 13-month-olds), speaks 3 words other than &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; (90% of 21-month-olds), or hops on 1 leg (90% of 5-year-olds). The more items a child fails to perform (passed by 90% of his/her peers), the more likely the child manifests a significant developmental problems.</description>

    <measure>Neurodevelopmental Status Assessed Using Bayley III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Neurodevelopmental assessments was done using the following age-dependent scales: Bayley III for subjects less than (&lt;) 3.5 years of age and WPPSI III for subjects greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3.5 to &lt;4 years of age, based on following scores: adaptive behavior composite (ABC) score, cognitive composite (CC) score, language composite (LC) score, motor composite (MC) score., and social-emotional composite (SEC) score. Composite scores ranged from 40 (very poor) to 160 (excellent) and are classified as following: &gt;=115: accelerated performance; 85-114: development within normal limits; 70-84: mildly delayed development; less than or equal to (&lt;=) 69: significant delayed development.</description>

    <measure>Number of Samples With Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (PAH) Gene Mutations</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (within 42 days prior to Day 1 of the 26-week study period)</time_frame>
    <description>The DNA samples received were quantified by using a nanophotometer, and were aliquoted to a concentration of 20 nanogram/microliter DNA and aliquots from each sample were distributed to one 96-well plate. All samples were Sanger sequenced regarding exons 1 to 13 of the PAH gene in forward direction using the DNAs in the 96-well plate. All samples showing variants were Sanger sequenced regarding the concerned exon in reverse direction using DNA from the original tube. All samples showing a homozygous mutation were analyzed by MLPA. All samples showing only 1 mutation were analyzed by MLPA. All samples showing only 1 or no mutation were resequenced completely (exons 1 to 13) in both directions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Apparent Clearance (CL/f)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 5 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>CL/f is the rate at which a drug is removed from the body via renal, hepatic and other clearance pathways.The reason for pooling subjects receiving Kuvan and subjects with Phe-restricted Diet was to facilitate the estimation of baseline endogenous value of BH4 which can only be observed in subjects not receiving the treatment. Ignoring this baseline endogenous value would have led to biased stimated of the Kuvan PK parameters. This pooling assumes that the addition of Kuvan does not confound the BH4 measurements in these analyses as a consequence the population PK parameters describing the PK of BH4 are the same for the 2 arms and so cannot be presented in terms of per arm/per treatment group based as per the planned analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Population PK Parameter: Apparent Volume of Distribution (V/f)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 5 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>V/f is defined as the distribution of a medication between the plasma and the rest of the body after the dose. It is the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of the drug. The reason for pooling subjects receiving Kuvan and subjects with Phe-restricted Diet was to facilitate the estimation of baseline endogenous value of BH4 which can only be observed in subjects not receiving the treatment. Ignoring this baseline endogenous value would have led to biased stimated of the Kuvan PK parameters. This pooling assumes that the addition of Kuvan does not confound the BH4 measurements in these analyses as a consequence the population PK parameters describing the PK of BH4 are the same for the 2 arms and so cannot be presented in terms of per arm/per treatment group based as per the planned analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Population PK Parameter: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Curve, Time 0 to Infinity (AUC [0-infinity])</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 5 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>AUC [0-infinity] was estimated by determining total area under the curve of the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinity. Since AUC could not be obtained from non-compartmental analysis because of sparse data, AUC = Dose/(CL/F); CL/F was population apparent clearance estimated from the population PK model, &amp; Dose the actual total dose received by the patient on one dosing interval. The reason for pooling subjects receiving Kuvan &amp;subjects with Phe-restricted Diet was to facilitate estimation of baseline endogenous value of BH4 which can only be observed in subjects not receiving treatment. Ignoring this baseline endogenous value would have led to biased estimated of Kuvan PK parameters. This pooling assumes that the the addition of Kuvan does not confound the BH4 measurements in these analyses as a consequence the population PK parameters describing the PK of BH4 were same for the 2 arms and cannot be presented per arm/per treatment group as per planned analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Population PK Parameter: Terminal Elimination Half-life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 5 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>The t1/2 was defined as the time required for plasma concentration of drug to decrease 50 percent (%) in the final stage of elimination. Since t1/2 could not be obtained from non-compartmental analysis because of sparse data, t1/2 was estimated as Log(2)*(V/F)/(CL/F), where V/F &amp; CL/F were the population apparent central Volume &amp; clearance, estimated from population PK model. The reason for pooling subjects receiving Kuvan &amp; subjects with Phe-restricted Diet was to facilitate the estimation of baseline endogenous value of BH4 which can only observed in subjects not receiving treatment. Ignoring this baseline endogenous value would have led biased stimated of the Kuvan PK parameters. This pooling assumes that the addition of Kuvan does not confound the BH4 measurements in these analyses as a consequence the population PK parameters describing the PK of BH4 are the same for the 2 arms and so cannot be presented in terms of per arm/per treatment group based as per the planned analysis.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study treatment and up to 31 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Normal Neuromotor Developmental Milestones Assessed Using Denver Developmental Scale (DDS)</title>
        <description>Subjects with normal neuromotor development were assessed by standardized developmental milestones using a parent/guardian report form in the following areas: fine motor, gross motor, language, and personal-social using DDS Test. DDS Test is a widely used to examine the developmental progress of 0-6 years of children. The scale reflects what percentage of a certain age group is able to perform a certain task. Tasks are grouped into 4 categories (social contact, fine motor skill, language, and gross motor skill) and include items such as smiles spontaneously (performed by 90% of three-month-olds), knocks 2 building blocks against each other (90% of 13-month-olds), speaks 3 words other than &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;dad&quot; (90% of 21-month-olds), or hops on 1 leg (90% of 5-year-olds). The more items a child fails to perform (passed by 90% of his/her peers), the more likely the child manifests a significant developmental problems.</description>

        <description>CL/f is the rate at which a drug is removed from the body via renal, hepatic and other clearance pathways.The reason for pooling subjects receiving Kuvan and subjects with Phe-restricted Diet was to facilitate the estimation of baseline endogenous value of BH4 which can only be observed in subjects not receiving the treatment. Ignoring this baseline endogenous value would have led to biased stimated of the Kuvan PK parameters. This pooling assumes that the addition of Kuvan does not confound the BH4 measurements in these analyses as a consequence the population PK parameters describing the PK of BH4 are the same for the 2 arms and so cannot be presented in terms of per arm/per treatment group based as per the planned analysis.</description>

          <description>Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride) tablets were administered orally at a dose of 10 milligram/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day). If after 4 weeks, there was less than 20 percent (%) increase in subject's Phe tolerance versus baseline, the dose was escalated to 20 mg/kg/day. Phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet was adjusted every 2 weeks, based on the mean Phe levels of the previous 2 weeks using pre-defined Phe adjustment criteria.</description>
