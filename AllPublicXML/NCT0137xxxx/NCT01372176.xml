  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of patients survive critical illness and intensive care, but describe
      having impaired physical function several years after discharge as a consequence of extensive
      loss of muscle mass. Reasons for loss of muscle mass and physical function are multiple, but
      insufficient nutrition is likely to contribute.

      This randomised trial will investigate the effect of an optimised nutrition therapy during
      intensive care, on short term clinical outcome and physical quality of life. We hypothesise,
      that early nutritional therapy, directed towards patient-specific goals for energy and
      protein requirements, will improve both short- and long-term outcomes.

    <description>Initiation of early supplementary parenteral nutrition (≤ 24 hours of admission).
Measurement of requirements (indirect calorimetry, 24-hour urinary urea) leading to patient-specific, individualised and goal-directed nutritional therapy.
Intervention goal: delivering 100% of patient-specific requirements, measured or calculated throughout entire admission (EN+PN).</description>

    <description>EN will be the preferred route of nutrition, and will be initiated within the first 24 hours of ICU admission, in accordance with best evidence. The amount is gradually increased over the first days of admission as tolerated by the patient (assessed from gastric aspirates). If EN fails to reach calculated goals at day 7, supplementary PN will be initiated at admission day 8 to reach goals. Protein and energy goals will be calculated as 25 kcal/kg/day and 1.2 g protein/kg/day.</description>
