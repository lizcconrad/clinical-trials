  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researcher's primary hypothesis is that VCE allows for safe outpatient management of ED
      patients with suspected upper GI hemorrhage. A prospective multicenter randomized control
      trial was designed to investigate the safety of this approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The typical primary care, urgent care or emergency care provider is unable to evaluate common
      and serious conditions of the gastrointestinal tract such as a bleeding peptic ulcer. As
      such, more than 80% of patients who present to US ED's with suspected bleeding in their upper
      GI tract require hospitalization, procedural sedation by an anesthesiologist, and a
      traditional tube-based upper endoscopy by a gastroenterologist. While this traditional
      process is safe and effective, it is not efficient for our low-risk patients and not timely
      for our high-risk patients. The opportunity to bring Video Capsule Endoscopy to the
      front-lines of US medical care will revolutionize how we manage upper GI bleeding and shed
      light on critical diseases that have heretofore been hidden from most providers. This trial
      is an important step toward demonstrating that VCE is a safe and effective tool to
      risk-stratify upper GI bleeding and improve quality of emergency care for all patients.

    <description>This group receives standard of care plus &quot;Pill Cam&quot; (Video Capsule Endoscopy, VCE). VCE will be read immediately by site PI or co-PI and by site GI doctor. However, if PillCam appears normal or shows a low-risk problem and the patient is stable medically, then the patient will be discharged home. If the patient is discharged, patient will be called to get an endoscopy as an outpatient within 3 days. Patient will be monitored for a minimum of 4 hours. Repeat CBC every 4 hours. If the patient has stable Blood Pressure and pulse for 4 plus hours then the subject will be discharged home with a follow up (standard of care) EGD within 3 days.</description>

    <description>This group also receives standard of care plus &quot;Pill Cam&quot; (Video Capsule Endoscopy,VCE). VCE video will be archived and read at a later date. Patient will be admitted. VCE will not be used for clinical decisions. Same day or next day (&lt;24 hour) Endoscopic examination of the upper GI tract will be offered to all patients within 24 hours, and hemostasis therapy will be applied as necessary. All patients in this group will be admitted for next day endoscopy in the hospital. This is standard of care.</description>
