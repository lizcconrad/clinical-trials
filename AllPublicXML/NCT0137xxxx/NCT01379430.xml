    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of AdCh63 ME-TRAP and
      MVA ME-TRAP candidate vaccines in healthy adult volunteers in a malaria endemic region. The
      regime proposed in this trial has protected non-immune volunteers against sporozoite
      challenge in clinical trials performed by Oxford, and so may be protective against naturally
      acquired infection in Kenya.The study population will comprise 30 healthy adult males aged
      18-50.

      The investigators do not propose to include a placebo group. At this stage the investigators
      objective is to describe the safety profile in a small number of individuals, and the
      confidence intervals for the proportion of individuals with a particular event would be too
      wide for meaningful comparison with a placebo group. Immunogenicity will be judged by
      comparison with baseline.
