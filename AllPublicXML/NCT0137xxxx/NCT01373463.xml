      This study is open to patients that have been diagnosed with non-squamous Stage III Non Small
      Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and will have surgery to remove the tumor.

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Test a combination of two chemotherapeutic drugs along with radiation therapy, when
           given prior to surgery and see what effects (good or bad) it has on someone with this
           type of cancer. Chemotherapeutic drugs selectively destroy diseased cancer cells and
           tissues.

        -  Test the safety of different dose levels of radiation when given with each combination
           of chemotherapy;

        -  Determine what side effects are associated with combining radiation with these two
           chemotherapy combinations.
