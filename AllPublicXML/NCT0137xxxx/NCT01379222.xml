      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the long term safety and effectiveness of the
      Endurant Stent Graft System for the endovascular treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic
      aneurysms in a post-approval environment, through the endpoints established in this protocol.

      The clinical objective of the study is to evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of
      the Endurant Stent Graft System assessed at 5 years through freedom from Aneurysm-Related
      Mortality (ARM).

    <description>The Endurant Stent Graft System is designed to treat infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms using an endovascular approach. When placed within the aneurysm, the Endurant Stent Graft is designed to provide a permanent, alternative conduit for blood flow within the patient's vasculature by excluding the aneurysmal sac from blood flow and pressure.</description>
