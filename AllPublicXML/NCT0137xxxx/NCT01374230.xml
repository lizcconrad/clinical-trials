    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to document the long-term outcome of the E1® Tibial Bearings
      used with the Vanguard® Knee System in 50 patients receiving total knee arthroplasty. All
      patients will receive the E1® Tibial Bearing in a Vanguard® knee replacement. Radiographic
      analysis and patient reported outcomes will be used as follow-up measures to track wear,
      mechanical performance, and patient satisfaction.
