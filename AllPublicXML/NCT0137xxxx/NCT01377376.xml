  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the combination regimen of ARQ 197
      with erlotinib will improve overall survival (OS) compared to erlotinib monotherapy in
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with wild-type EGFR who have
      received 1 or 2 prior systemic anti-cancer therapies in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed surgically unresectable locally advanced or
             metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) non-squamous NSCLC with wild-type (excluding major
             activating mutation (exon 19 deletion and/or exon 21 L858R mutation)) EGFR gene status
             confirmed by a highly sensitive PCR assay

          3. Evaluable disease according to RECIST, Version 1.1

          4. Received one or two prior lines of systemic anti-cancer therapy for advanced or
             metastatic disease, one of which must be a platinum-based therapy

          5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          6. Demonstrate adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal functions, defined as:

             • ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN, ANC
             ≥1.5 × 10^9/L, platelet count ≥100 × 10^9/L, hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL, and serum
             creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL.

          7. Voluntary written informed consent form before performance of any study-specific
             procedures or tests

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Prior therapy with an EGFR inhibitor and/or tivantinib

          2. Any systemic anti-tumor treatment for NSCLC or investigational agents within 4 weeks
             prior to randomization

          3. Palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks, or radiotherapy for curative intent of target
             lesions within 8 weeks for chest and within 4 weeks for other areas prior to
             randomization

          4. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to randomization

          5. History of cardiac disease

          7. Need to breastfeed a child during or within 12 weeks of completing the study

          8. Significant gastrointestinal disorder that could interfere with absorption of
             tivantinib and/or erlotinib

          9. History of malignancy other than NSCLC

         10. Known infection with HIV, active HBV or HCV

         11. Clinically significant interstitial lung diseases detected by CT scan or prior history
             of such diseases

         12. Psychiatric disease that could affect the informed consent process

         13. Subjects who wish to have a child and who would not agree to use one or more
             contraceptive measures that are highly effective

         14. Positive serum or urine pregnancy test in female subjects of childbearing potential

         15. Any other significant co-morbid condition that, in opinion of the
             investigator/sub-investigator, would impair study participation or cooperation
