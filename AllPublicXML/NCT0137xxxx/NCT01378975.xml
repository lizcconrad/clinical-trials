  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety in
      participants with metastatic melanoma who developed brain metastases. Participants may or may
      not have received prior systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma [except treatment with
      v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) or mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MEK) inhibitors]. Participants will receive oral doses of 960 mg vemurafenib twice daily
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal.

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) Within Brain of Previously Untreated Participants (Assessed by Independent Review Committee [IRC] Using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to the disease progression or death from any cause (approximately 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>BORR assessed by IRC is defined as percentage of participants who were responders [with best overall response (BOR) documented as confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)]. The RECIST v1.1 criteria modified for independent review of body and brain lesions was based on current radiology practices. The modifications to RECIST v1.1 included allowing target lesions in the brain to be &gt;=5 mm by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan (in traditional RECIST v1.1 this is &gt;=10 mm), allowing up to 5 target lesions in the brain (in traditional RECIST v1.1 only 2 target lesions), and examining the lesions within the brain and outside the brain separately for analytical purposes. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm), PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) in the Brain of Participants With Previously Treated or Untreated Brain Metastases as Assessed by the IRC Using RECIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to the disease progression or death from any cause (approximately 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who were responders with BOR documented as confirmed CR or PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD). CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

    <description>BORR within brain assessed by IRC is defined as percentage of participants who were responders (with BOR documented as confirmed CR or PR). According to RECIST v1.1 criteria modified for brain metastases, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm, PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>BORR outside of brain assessed by IRC is defined as percentage of participants who were responders (with BOR documented as confirmed CR or PR). According to RECIST v1.1 criteria modified for brain metastases, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm, PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>Duration of response was defined as the time interval between the date of the earliest qualifying response and the earliest date of PD or death from any cause.

        <title>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) Within Brain of Previously Untreated Participants (Assessed by Independent Review Committee [IRC] Using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST])</title>
        <description>BORR assessed by IRC is defined as percentage of participants who were responders [with best overall response (BOR) documented as confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)]. The RECIST v1.1 criteria modified for independent review of body and brain lesions was based on current radiology practices. The modifications to RECIST v1.1 included allowing target lesions in the brain to be &gt;=5 mm by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scan (in traditional RECIST v1.1 this is &gt;=10 mm), allowing up to 5 target lesions in the brain (in traditional RECIST v1.1 only 2 target lesions), and examining the lesions within the brain and outside the brain separately for analytical purposes. CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm), PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants who were responders with BOR documented as confirmed CR or PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD). CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).

        <title>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) in the Brain of Participants With Previously Treated Brain Metastases as Assessed by the IRC Using RECIST v1.1</title>
        <description>BORR within brain assessed by IRC is defined as percentage of participants who were responders (with BOR documented as confirmed CR or PR). According to RECIST v1.1 criteria modified for brain metastases, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm, PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to the disease progression or death from any cause (approximately 4 years)</time_frame>

SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).
