  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)
      intervention in the context of Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) program improves women's
      quality of life and reduces violence relative to the NFP alone using a cluster randomized
      controlled trial. Our hypothesis is that an IPV intervention can be designed that is
      acceptable to participants in the NFP, feasible to implement, and that this intervention will
      improve quality of life for women and reduce exposure to violence.

    <measure>The Public Health Nurses' Responses to Women Who Are Abused</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected from nurses at baseline, 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nurses' readiness to treat IPV. In the 20-item PHNR, nurses respond to one of two scenarios that resemble real-life experiences they would encounter in a postpartum home visit. The instrument measures nurses' thoughts, feeling and actions in response to identifying and responding to IPV. The PHNR has good internal consistency with an overall Cronbach alpha of 0.79.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The protocol for number and timing of visits will be the same for both NFP+IPVI and Standard Care, as follows: weekly for the first four visits, every other week for the remainder of the pregnancy, every week for six weeks in the postpartum and every other week until the infant is 21 months old after which it is once a month for the last three months. We recognize that the intervention might prompt the nurse and mother to alter the regular visit schedule if IPV is present.</description>

    <description>The NFP nurses currently receive some training regarding IPV, but it is minimal. Between intake and when the child is 3 months and 12 months old, there is a brief instruction that the nurse assess for IPV. If the client acknowledges current abuse when completing the Abuse Assessment Screen, the nurse should &quot;assist her to evaluate threats to personal safety and make referrals as needed&quot;. There is a prompt to be mindful of client safety, and to make referrals as needed.</description>
