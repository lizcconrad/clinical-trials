  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a form of ventilation delivered by a mask and is an
      important mode of treatment in patients with both acute and chronic respiratory (breathing)
      failure. Humidification is widely accepted as an essential part of the ventilation strategy
      in patients receiving invasive ventilation (i.e. via a tube inserted into the mouth), but its
      role during NIV use is not proven. Consequently, there is a variation in practice with regard
      to humidification during NIV. Humidification is important in maintaining upper and lower
      airway mucosal function and patients requiring NIV often report symptoms, such as throat
      dryness, due to a lack of airway humidity. Success of NIV in the acute setting is dependent
      on many factors including, patient tolerance of NIV during the acute phase. In patients with
      chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), poor tolerance results in NIV failure, which
      necessitates endotracheal intubation or treatment failure. Furthermore, invasive ventilation
      increases the risk of a hospital acquired pneumonia, which is associated with a worse
      outcome. In the long term setting of NIV use, again patients frequently report symptoms due
      to drying of the airways and adherence to NIV can be highly variable. Adherence in these
      patients is important in improving both quality and length of life. Humidification devices
      may be technically effective, but clinicians have concerns regarding potential negative
      effects of these devices. There is a requirement to evaluate the use of humidification in
      both the acute and long term use of NIV, particular, in terms of patient ventilator
      interaction, which will impact on comfort and adherence to NIV. This will effect the overall
      effectiveness of ventilation. The investigators propose a randomised controlled trial to
      investigate the effects of a humidification system during noninvasive ventilation.
