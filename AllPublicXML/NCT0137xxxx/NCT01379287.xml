  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iso-fludelone is a type of chemotherapy drug called an epothilone. Epothilones are drugs that
      attach to proteins in your body called &quot;tubulins&quot;. Tubulins help cells to grow, and are found
      in both normal and cancer cells. When research animals with cancer were given the study drug,
      Iso-fludelone, the drug attached itself to &quot;tubulin&quot; and slowed or stopped the cancer cells
      from growing. Other types of epothilones have been tested in cancer patients and were found
      to be safe. A similar epothilone drug and other drugs called taxanes are currently approved
      by the FDA for treating certain types of cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to see the effects, good and/or bad, of this investigational
      drug, Iso-fludelone, on cancer. The term &quot;investigational&quot; means the study drug being tested
      has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other
      regulatory agencies. This study is the first time the investigators are using iso-fludelone
      in people. This is a Phase I study. In a Phase I study, the first people to receive the drug
      are given a fairly low dose.
