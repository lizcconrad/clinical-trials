    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a faith-placed lay health advisor
      intervention is effective in increasing use of Pap smears among middle-aged and older
      Appalachian women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project development relied on principles of community based participatory research.
      Participants were recruited from faith institutions in four distressed Appalachian Kentucky
      counties. Investigators at the University of Kentucky worked closely with local staff who
      implemented study procedures in the field.
