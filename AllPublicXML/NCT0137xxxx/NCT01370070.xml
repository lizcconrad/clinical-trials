        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged &gt; 18 year, able to give written informed consent.

          -  History of histologically or cytologically confirmed non-keratinizing NPC that has
             recurred at locoregional and/or distant sites, and is not amenable to potentially
             curative radiotherapy or surgery.

          -  Patients must have progressed within 24 months of receiving one or two prior line of
             chemotherapy for recurrent disease, of which at least one line must contain platinum
             drugs such as Cisplatin, Carboplatin or oxaliplatin.

          -  Adequate organ reserve: neutrophils &gt;1.5x109/L, platelets ≥100 x109/L, hemoglobin ≥9
             g/dL, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT&lt;
             5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases, serum bilirubin &lt; 2.5 x ULN, serum
             creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Presence of measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST ver 1.1).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except to bone metastases) or investigational treatment
             within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          -  Patients with diabetes or in risk for hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials
             with MK-2206, but the hyperglycemia should be well controlled before the patient
             enters the trial.

          -  Cardiovascular: baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt;470 msec (female) Left bundle
             branch block, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, bifascicular block, sick sinus syndrome,
             Wolff-Parkinson-white syndrome, significant sinus bradycardia (&lt; 50bpm) . However,
             patients with asymptomatic right bundle branch block or 1st degree AV block, in the
             absence of known cardiac disease (e.g. coronary, valvular) are NOT excluded..

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
