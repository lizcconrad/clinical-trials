  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare, for the first time ever, single shot popliteal fossa
      blocks to ankle blocks as primary anesthesia for patients undergoing forefoot procedures. The
      primary outcome variable for this study is the percentage of patients that convert to general
      anesthesia following either a single shot popliteal fossa block or ankle block.

      H0: There is no difference in the percentage of patients that convert to general anesthesia
      between single shot popliteal fossa blocks and ankle blocks.

      HA: There will be a lower percentage of patients receiving a single shot popliteal fossa
      block that convert to general anesthesia compared to patients receiving an ankle block.

    <description>Popliteal fossa and ankle blocks are types of anesthesia used during surgery. If these methods are not effective as an anesthetic during surgery the anethesiologist will convert to general anesthesia.</description>
