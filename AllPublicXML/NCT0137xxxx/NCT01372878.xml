      This multi-center study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PillCam
      Platform with the PillCam COLON 2 capsule as demonstrated by the identification of subjects
      with polyps, compared to optical colonoscopy.

      884 subjects participated in this study. All subjects that were enrolled in this study were
      indicated and scheduled to undergo colonoscopy based on their age and demographics for
      screening for polyps.

      Each subject was required to follow a bowel preparation regimen and to undergo capsule
      endoscopy (CE) followed by optical colonoscopy (OC). The optical colonoscopy procedure was
      scheduled 4-6 weeks after CE procedure to allow for the central readers reading of the
      PillCam RAPID video.

      The colonoscopist was kept blinded to the CE results

    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of PillCam Platform with the PillCam COLON 2 capsule in detecting subjects with polyps equal to or larger than 6 mm. For a given polyp, a match between the PillCam Colon 2 Capsule and optical colonoscopy was considered if the polyp size was assessed within plus or minus 50% of the size of the estimate of the OC measurement and the polyp as appearing within the same colon segment or in adjacent segments. The polyp size measurement by optical colonoscopy was used as the reference standard.
Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such.
Specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified as such.

        <title>Sensitivity and Specificity of PillCam Platform With the PillCam COLON 2 Capsule in Detecting Patients With Polyps ≥6 mm Where OC Considered as the Gold Standard Reference</title>
        <description>Sensitivity and specificity of PillCam Platform with the PillCam COLON 2 capsule in detecting subjects with polyps equal to or larger than 6 mm. For a given polyp, a match between the PillCam Colon 2 Capsule and optical colonoscopy was considered if the polyp size was assessed within plus or minus 50% of the size of the estimate of the OC measurement and the polyp as appearing within the same colon segment or in adjacent segments. The polyp size measurement by optical colonoscopy was used as the reference standard.
Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such.
Specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified as such.
