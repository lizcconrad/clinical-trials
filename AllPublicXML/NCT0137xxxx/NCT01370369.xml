          <description>For single dose pharmacokinetics (PKs), a single application of 2.50 mL (two strokes) of the testosterone gel 2% was applied to the inner thigh followed by a 7-day washout period. After this washout period, the second single application of 2.50 mL (two strokes) of the testosterone gel 2% was applied to the abdomen followed by another 7-day washout period. After this washout period, the third single application of 2.50 mL (two strokes) of the testosterone gel 2% was applied to the shoulder/upper arm.
After the last 24 hour PK sampling from the shoulder/upper arm, three ascending doses of testosterone gel 2%, 1.25, 2.50 and 3.75 mL (one stroke, two strokes and three strokes, respectively), were sequentially applied once daily for 10 consecutive days to the shoulder/upper arm. Steady-state PK evaluations were performed starting on the morning of the last administered dose. There was no washout between each of the 10-day treatments.</description>
