    <description>Clinician-rated interview-based scale (with both child and parent or guardian) to assess 17 distinct symptom areas to derive an index of depression severity. Discrepancies between informants' responses were resolved by using most impaired rating given by valid informant. Rated on a 7-point scale; range from 1 (no impairment) to 7 (indicates greater impairment). Total score calculated as sum of the 17 items (range 1 to 119); higher score indicates greater impairment. Adjusted mean presented.</description>

        <description>Clinician-rated interview-based scale (with both child and parent or guardian) to assess 17 distinct symptom areas to derive an index of depression severity. Discrepancies between informants' responses were resolved by using most impaired rating given by valid informant.
