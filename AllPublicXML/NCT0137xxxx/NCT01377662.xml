  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the outcome of a drug combination treatment on
      detoxified and stabilized methamphetamine (METH) and/or cocaine (COC) dependent users. The
      combination regimen consists of oral administration of a generic immediate-release
      methylphenidate (MPh-IR) formulation (e.g., Ritalin®) and a novel delayed, pulsatile-release
      formulation of the antiemetic ondansetron (Ond-PR002). Various psychological assessment tools
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to assess the treatment
      outcome. In addition to the treatment outcome measures, we will determine whether the 14-day,
      once-a-day treatment leads to significant changes in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
      (PK/PD), safety and tolerability parameters of MPh-IR and/or Ond-PR002 formulations and
      drug-drug interactions between the two drugs.
