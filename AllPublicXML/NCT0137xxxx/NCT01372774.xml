      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and
      cause less damage to normal tissue. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor
      cells. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiosurgery is more effective than
      whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases that have been
      removed by surgery.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial studies how well stereotactic radiosurgery works
      compared to whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases that
      have been removed by surgery.

      Primary Goals

        1. Overall Survival - To determine in patients with one to four brain metastases whether
           there is improved overall survival in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed
           compared to patients who receive WBRT.

        2. Neurocognitive Progression - To determine in patients with one to four brain metastases
           whether there is less neurocognitive progression post-randomization in patients who
           receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT.

      Secondary Goals

        1. Quality of Life (QOL) - To determine in patients with resected brain metastases whether
           there is improved QOL in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to
           patients who receive WBRT.

        2. Central Nervous System Failure - To determine in patients with one to four brain
           metastases whether there is equal or longer time to central nervous system (CNS) failure
           (brain) in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive
           WBRT.

        3. Functional Independence - To determine in patients with one to four brain metastases
           whether there is longer duration of functional independence in patients who receive SRS
           to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT.

        4. Long-Term Neurocognitive Status - To determine in patients with one to four brain
           metastases whether there is better long-term neurocognitive status in patients who
           receive SRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive WBRT.

        5. Adverse Events - To tabulate and descriptively compare the post-treatment adverse events
           associated with the interventions.

        6. Local Tumor Bed Recurrence - To evaluate local tumor bed recurrence at 6 months with
           post-surgical SRS to the surgical bed in comparison to WBRT.

        7. Local Recurrence - To evaluate time to local recurrence with post-surgical SRS to the
           surgical bed in comparison to WBRT.

        8. CNS Failure Patterns - To evaluate if there is any difference in CNS failure patterns
           (local, distant, leptomeningeal) in patients who receive SRS to the surgical bed
           compared to patients who receive WBRT.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age in years (&lt; 60
      vs ≥ 60), extracranial disease controlled (≤ 3 months vs &gt; 3 months), number of pre-operative
      brain metastases (1 vs 2-4), histology (lung vs radioresistant [brain metastases from a
      sarcoma, melanoma, or renal cell carcinoma histology] vs other), and resection cavity maximal
      diameter (≤ 3 cm vs &gt; 3 cm). Patient must complete baseline QOL and neurocognitive tests
      prior to registration/randomization. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) once a day, 5 days a week, for
           approximately 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using a gamma knife or a linear
           accelerator procedure.

      Event monitoring occurs up to 5 years post registration/randomization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Pre-registration Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Number of Brain Metastases - Four or fewer brain metastases (as defined on the
             pre-operative MRI or CT brain scan) and status post resection of one of the lesions.

          2. Non-CNS Primary Site - Pathology from the resected brain metastasis must be consistent
             with a non-central nervous system primary site. Note: Patients with or without active
             disease outside the nervous system are eligible (including patients with unknown
             primaries), as long as the pathology from the brain is consistent with a non-central
             nervous system primary site.

          3. Size of Metastases - Any unresected lesions must measure &lt; 3.0 cm in maximal extent on
             the contrasted MRI or CT brain scan obtained ≤ 35 days prior to pre-registration. The
             unresected lesions will be treated with SRS as outlined in the treatment section of
             the protocol. Note: The metastases size restriction does not apply to the resected
             brain metastasis; with resected brain metastases only surgical cavity size determines
             eligibility.

          4. Size of Resection Cavity - Resection cavity must measure &lt;5.0 cm in maximal extent on
             the post-operative MRI or CT brain scan obtained ≤35 days prior to pre-registration.

             Note: It is permissible for the resection of a dominant brain metastasis to include a
             smaller &quot;satellite&quot; metastasis as long as the single resection cavity is less than the
             maximum size requirements.

          5. Tumor Staging Procedures - All standard tumor-staging procedures necessary to define
             baseline extra cranial disease status completed ≤42 days prior to pre-registration.

          6. Treatment with Gamma Knife or Radiosurgery - Able to be treated with either a gamma
             knife or a linear accelerator-based radiosurgery system.

          7. Age ≥ 18 years

          8. Neurocognitive Testing - Willing and able to complete neurocognitive testing without
             assistance from family and companions. Note: Because neurocognitive testing is one of
             the primary goals of this study, patients must be able to utilize English language
             booklets (and/or French booklets if enrolled in Canada).

          9. Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaires - Willing and able to complete QOL by themselves
             or with assistance

         10. ECOG Performance Status - ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0, 1, or 2.

         11. SRS Credentialed by IROC Houston Quality Assurance - The site's SRS facility is IROC
             Houston Quality Assurance approved.

         12. Neurocognitive Testing Credentialing - The site study team member performing
             neurocognitive testing of patients must have credentialing confirming completion of
             the neurocognitive testing training of the protocol.

         13. Written Informed Consent - Provide written informed consent

         14. Mandatory Samples for Correlative Tests - Willing to provide mandatory blood and urine
             samples for correlative research purposes.

             randomization scan if obtained ≤ 28 days prior to randomization.

             1.3 Note: If there are no unresected brain metastases (i.e., all brain metastases have
             been resected), a post-operative CT brain scan may be used if obtained ≤ 28 days prior
             to randomization.

          2. Size of Resection Cavity - Post-operative MRI or CT scan confirms resection cavity
             measures &lt; 5.0 cm in maximal extent.

             2.1 Note: The pre-registration, post-operative brain scan may be used for the
             randomization scan if obtained ≤ 28 days prior to randomization.

             2.2 Note: If there are no unresected brain metastases (i.e., all brain metastases have
