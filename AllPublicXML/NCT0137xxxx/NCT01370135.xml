  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proliferative ischemic retinopathies lead to a formation of abnormal vessels on the iris
      surface induced by an increased level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In
      progressive stages fibrovascular membranes occlude the anterior chamber angle which inhibits
      aqueous outflow resulting in neovascular glaucoma. The increased intraocular pressure is
      often difficult to control and frequently results in loss of vision.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the short- and long-term outcome after adjuvant
      intraocular Ranibizumab application in patients with neovascular glaucoma and rubeosis and to
      analyze the role of ranibizumab within a holistic treatment regime.
