  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This surveillance study is designed to detect adverse events (particularly clinically
      significant adverse drug reactions) occurring in clinical settings and to examine factors
      likely to affect the safety and efficacy of paroxetine in long-term use (1 year).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence/absence of concomitant use of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks after discontinuation or completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PAXIL inhibits drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6, and it takes about 1 week following discontinuation of PAXIL for this CYP2D6 function to recover from the inhibiting effect. Since it requires attention if drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 are administered during this recovery period, it was decided to investigate the presence/absence of use of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 within 2 weeks after discontinuation of treatment in patients for whom treatment with PAXIL was discontinued, as well as the safety thereof.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence/absence of concomitant use of products containing Saint John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum; &quot;SJW&quot;, hereinafter)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Although the action mechanism for this is not clear, SJW has been reported to have the action of inhibiting reuptake of serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine, and to exhibit an antidepressant effect. Since PAXIL also acts to inhibit serotonin reuptake, concomitant use of products containing SJW is thought to have an effect upon the serotonin reuptake inhibiting action of PAXIL, so it was decided to check for concomitant use of products containing SJW and investigate the safety of such concomitant use.</description>
