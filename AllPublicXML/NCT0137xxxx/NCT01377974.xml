    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether miltefosine is effective in the treatment
      of mucosal leishmaniasis compared to meglumine antimoniate, the standard treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucosal leishmaniasis is a rare form of the disease, that affects only 6% of the patients
      with cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World. It causes deformities and may be lethal if not
      treated. It is part of the neglected tropical diseases because on the past sixty years there
      was few progress regarding other treatment options or improvement at quality of life of its
      patients. Also, there was little interest from the pharmaceutical industry and government
      authorities to develop new researches. The standard treatment, meglumine antimoniate, is
      toxic, invasive, requires trained personnel and has many adverse effects and restrictions. On
      the other hand, miltefosine is the first oral drug to demonstrate efficacy against
      mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Few clinical trials have being performed in Central and South
      American countries, but so far, just one involved mucosal leishmaniasis patients, and
      compared miltefosine to amphotericin B. None studies comparing its efficacy to the standard
      treatment have being done.
