      The goal of this study is to determine if nutritional therapy can effectively treat/prevent
      T2DM and its consequent cardiomyopathy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be &gt;30 and &lt;65 years of age, in order to limit the confounding affect of
             age on our endpoints.

          -  Subjects must have an ejection fraction &gt;45% (based on their echocardiogram)

          -  Patients with T2DM and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or steatohepatitis may be
             included since they have extensive evidence of steatosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had a myocardial infarction or resting ischemia (by history or as
             evidenced by hypo/akinesis on the pre-intervention echocardiogram) will be excluded
             because hypo/akinesis would affect our endpoints of LV mass and diastolic function.

          -  Subjects who are unstable, not able to lie flat for the imaging studies, unable to
             give informed consent, pregnant, lactating, with atrial fibrillation (which would
             compromise measurement of E'), or current smokers will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with other major systemic diseases per their clinical charts, history,
             physical exam, or significant renal insufficiency will also be excluded, as these
             other system diseases may affect our study endpoints and subject follow-up.

          -  We will exclude patients with significant LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction
             &lt;45%)

          -  We will not exclude patients with sleep apnea because it does not detrimentally affect
             LV diastolic function.

          -  Subjects will be excluded a priori if they have any history or evidence of liver
             disease other than NAFLD, consumed &gt;20 g alcohol per day.
