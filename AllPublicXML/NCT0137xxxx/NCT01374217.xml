    <description>Hypothesis testing will be used to test the null that 5% patients will have a response versus the alternative hypothesis of 25% (a 20% improvement). If 3 or more out of 19 patients had response, the null hypothesis is rejected at a type I error rate of 0.05 (one-sided) given 20% type II error rate.
If initial review after 12 patients shows at least 1 response, 7 more patients will be enrolled. The therapy will be continued until progression or intolerable adverse effects. Clinical response will be evaluated by calculating the increase or decrease in the M-protein levels in blood and marrow.</description>
