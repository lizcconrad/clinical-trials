  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed project is to develop a novel, behavioral approach to smoking
      cessation that can be integrated with residential drug use treatment for low income substance
      using smokers with elevated depressive symptoms. The approach utilizes behavioral activation
      strategies which have been shown to reduce smoking among community samples and which can be
      easily targeted for the particular needs of low income substance users.

      This project will take place in two phases. In the first phase, the investigators will
      utilize pilot testing with 10 participants (two groups of 5 individuals) to integrate two
      existing behavioral activation manuals to develop the Behavioral Activation for Drug Abusing
      Smokers (BA-DAS). In Phase II, the investigators will randomize 80 patients to either: 1)
      standard smoking cessation treatment (ST) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or 2) BA-DAS
      (which includes ST and NRT). Based on the outcome of this preliminary trial, the BA-DAS
      protocol will be further refined and readied for larger-scale clinical trials to develop a
      comprehensive approach to treating smoking among low income, largely minority, depressed
      smokers in residential drug use treatment, which may be instrumental in reducing smoking
      among this especially at risk group.

    <description>Participants will receive a standard, individual smoking cessation treatment, based on the most recent clinical practice guideline for treating tobacco use from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Treatment will be delivered in 5, 90-minute group sessions over an 4-5 week period. Patients in ST will also keep a weekly written journal throughout treatment elaborating on observations about the day's events, their thoughts, feelings, and insights about their reactions to these events as a means to equate for time spent on daily activity monitoring in the BAD-AS condition.</description>
