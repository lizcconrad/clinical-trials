          -  Other than asthma, in general good health

          -  Able to perform reproducible pulmonary function testing

          -  Is a nonsmoker and/or has not used nicotine or nicotine-containing products for at
             least 12 months

          -  Have body mass index (BMI) ≥17 kg/m^2, but ≤35 kg/m^2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Demonstrate a decrease in absolute forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of &gt;20%
             from the Screening Visit to the Baseline Visit

          -  Experience a decrease in AM or PM peak expiratory flow (PEF) below the Stability Limit
             on any 2 consecutive days prior to the Baseline Visit

          -  Require the use of &gt;8 inhalations per day of short-acting beta2-agonist metered dose
             inhaler (MDI) or &gt;2 nebulized treatments per day of 2.5 mg albuterol, on any 2
             consecutive days from the Screening Visit up to the Baseline Visit

          -  Experience an exacerbation defined as a clinical deterioration of asthma, as judged by
             the clinical investigator, that results in emergency treatment, hospitalization due to
             asthma, or treatment with additional, excluded medication (other than short-acting
             beta agonists [SABA]) at any time from the Screening Visit up to the Baseline Visit

          -  Have been hospitalized for treatment of asthma or required oral corticosteroids for
             treatment of asthma within the past 6 months, or has ever required ventilator support
             for respiratory failure secondary to asthma

          -  Require the chronic use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids

          -  Have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or any other
             clinically relevant lung disease, other than asthma

          -  Have a history of any illness that might confound the results of the study or poses
             additional risk to the participant

          -  Have had recent (within 4 weeks of first dose) or ongoing upper or lower respiratory
             tract infection

          -  Is nursing

          -  Have a history of significant multiple and/or severe allergies (including latex
             allergy), or has had an anaphylactic reaction or significant intolerability to
             prescription or non-prescription drugs or food
