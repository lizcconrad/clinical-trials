  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of MK-8808 in
      combination with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP), and as a single
      agent, for participants with B-lymphocyte antigen cluster of differentiation 20
      (CD20)-positive follicular lymphoma who have had no prior chemotherapy. The primary study
      hypothesis is that MK-8808 will be safe and well tolerated in combination with CVP and as a
      single agent.

      The study was terminated early by the Sponsor due to business reasons. All participants were
      discontinued from MK-8808 + CVP, but could continue to receive maintenance therapy with
      MabThera™ (rituximab) per standard of care.
