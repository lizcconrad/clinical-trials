  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) account for over 60% of deaths from coronary artery
      disease. The annual incidence of OHCA treated by Emergency Medical Systems (EMS) is 41-89 per
      100,000 population. Outcome of OHCA and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is very poor:
      Less than 1/3 of the victims regain spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 40-60% of those achieving
      ROSC suffer significant neurological disability due to brain hypoxia and only 1.7-6.4% are
      discharged from the hospital. In order to minimize hypoxia time, the primary goal of CPR is
      to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as fast as possible. Metabolic (lactic)
      acidosis develops rapidly during CA and is considered detrimental to CPR outcome. Sodium
      bicarbonate (SB), a generic, commonly used acid buffer, was subjected only to a single,
      small, prospective controlled trial that found a trend towards improved outcome in prolonged
      OHCA and CPR. Another study indicated that EMS's that used SB early and often during CPR had
      significantly higher ROSC rates and better long-term outcome compared with EMS's that used SB
      more seldom and administered it late in the course of CPR.

      Aim of the Study:

      To determine whether early administration of SB during OHCA and CPR improves short-term CPR
      outcome.

      General: Prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
      Exception from Informed Consent, under the regulations for the conduction of research in
      emergency situations, has been approved by the Helsinki Committee of the Rambam Medical
      Center and by the Supreme Helsinki Committee of the Israeli Ministry of Health. Included will
      be adult patients who suffer an OHCA, who do not respond to basic CPR and to early
      defibrillation and in whom advanced CPR is initiated. 1st dose (1 mEq/Kg) of SB/placebo will
      be administered by Israeli Magen David Adom (MDA) advanced life support (ALS) teams
      immediately following the first IV epinephrine. SB/placebo vials or syringes will be masked
      and coded. Calculated sample size is 2130 patients. Study endpoints include only short-term
      outcome variables - rates of ROSC and of admission to the emergency room.

      Expected results: Based on previous analysis we expect a 20% improved short-term outcome in
      the SB treated group. Sample size was calculated accordingly.

      Importance: Around 2.2 million OHCA's are treated by EMS worldwide annually. Current ROSC
      rate is ca. 30%. A 20% better short-term outcome will result in over 130,000 additional
      patients regaining spontaneous circulation annually.

      Probable implications to Medicine: The use of SB in CPR is controversial. Current
      International Guidelines for CPR present very reserved recommendations regarding SB use.
      Results of this study may have a direct impact on the Guidelines and on the conduction of CPR
      world-wide. Based on the results of this trial, a Phase II trial, researching the effects of
      early SB administration on long-term outcome (hospital discharge and final neurological
      outcome) may be warranted and conducted.
