  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the effects of oxycodone/naloxone combination in
      comparison to oxycodone for the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery. The hypothesis is that the duration of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction and
      the need of laxatives will decrease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction is common in cardiac surgery patients postoperatively.
      Opioids are needed to treat severe postoperative pain, but they have troublesome side-effects
      such as nausea, vomiting and bowel dysfunction. These symptoms also limit the use of
      gastrointestinal tract for nutrition and medication. Combined prolonged-releases oxycodone
      and naloxone has been shown to provide as effective analgesia as PR oxycodone.
      Oxycodone/naloxone has also been suggested to improve bowel function without compromising
      analgesic efficacy.

      The aim of the study is to describe the effects of oxycodone/naloxone combination in
      comparison to oxycodone for the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery. During the first three months of the study, all cardiac surgery patients
      will be treated with PR oxycodone. During the second part of the study (3 months), all
      cardiac surgery patients will be treated with PR oxycodone/naloxone. The primary end point is
      the duration of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Need of laxatives will be recorded.
