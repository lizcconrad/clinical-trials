  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate preoperative tumor detection and staging are fundamental for treating patients with
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with unresectable tumors can benefit from being spared an
      extensive operation associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, cost, and pain. On
      the other hand, patients with localized disease, which is amenable to surgical removal, have
      the option of operation. Therefore, accurate staging of pancreatic cancer requires the
      detection of the tumor, and evaluation of its size, its relationship to major peri-pancreatic
      vascular structures and portal venous system, locoregional lymph nodes, and distant
      metastases. Multiple imaging techniques have been used to evaluate the pancreas. Although, at
      this point, no consensus exists as to the best staging algorithm, multidetector (MD) computed
      tomogrophy (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide sufficient information for the
      management of most patients.

      Patients with a tumor larger than 3 cm are characterized as non-surgical. CT sensitivity in
      detecting small pancreatic tumors of less than 2 cm is low. Multiple methods have been
      suggested to increase the sensitivity of CT. The sensitivity of CT increases with using
      multidetector CT which now has an accuracy rate of about 95-97% for initial detection and
      approximating that of 100% for staging.

      Secretin (a natural hormone produced by the duodenal mucosal cells) is known to increase
      blood flow to the pancreas. The principal use of secretin in imaging today is in exocrine
      function of the pancreas or morphological evaluation of the pancreatic duct under ultrasound
      or MRI. Theoretically, pancreatic contrast enhancement should also increase after secretin
      administration. This would imply that tumor conspicuity might also be increased if contrast
      enhancement of the normal pancreas increases. Secretin CT has been advocated by other centers
      to improve depiction of the ampulla and periampullary/duodenal diseases and to improve
      contrast enhancement. O'Connell et al, used secretin in patients suspected or with known
      pancreatic mass and concluded that administration of intravenous secretin leads to greater
      enhancement of the pancreas with greater tumor conspicuity, than imaging without secretin.

      MRI of the pancreas has undergone a major change because it can provide noninvasive images of
      the pancreatic ducts and the parenchyma. MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) enables detection
      of anatomic variants such as pancreas divisum. Although contrast material-enhanced CT is
      still considered the gold standard in acute pancreatitis and for the detection of
      calcifications in chronic pancreatitis, MR imaging and secretin-enhanced MRCP are useful in
      evaluating pseudocysts and pancreatic disruption.

      The role of MR is still debated in pancreatic neoplasms except the cystic lesions where MR
      imaging provides critical information regarding the lesion's content and a possible
      communication with the pancreatic ducts. Although some articles have shown that MRI was
      equivalent to CT in diagnosis and staging, others have shown the opposite. Nishiharu et al.
      found comparable tumor detection but a benefit with CT, notably for peripancreatic and
      vascular invasion. Comparing CT, echoendoscopy, and MRI, Soriano et al. demonstrated that CT
      showed the highest level of precision in primary tumor staging, local-regional staging,
      vascular invasion, distant metastases, Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging, and tumor
      resectability. MRI retains its originality in imaging the parenchyma, the pancreatic and
      biliary ducts, and vascular structures; however, in many institutions, CT remains the
      reference imaging choice for diagnosing and staging pancreatic cancer. Other than CT's
      advantages for the tumor, its excellent spatial resolution also provides detailed
      reconstructions in all planes and arterial mapping and therefore makes it possible to search
      for surgical contraindications such as celiac trunk stenosis. MRI is still used today as a
      second-intention tool when there is doubt or when CT and echoendoscopy are not sufficiently
      conclusive; it is not currently recommended to use MRI in first-intention diagnosis of
      pancreatic cancer.

      The aim of this pilot study is to determine whether the administration of intravenous
      secretin before contrast-enhanced CT and MRI improves pancreatic enhancement and pancreatic
      tumor conspicuity and to evaluate which technique is more appropriate for pancreatic tumor
      detection, staging and evaluation of resectability.

    <description>Quantitative analysis will be performed using CT attenuation values obtained from the pancreas and from pancreatic tumors. The average CT attenuation will be calculated for the normal pancreatic tissue and any tumor. The mean pancreatic enhancement for the pancreatic and portal venous phases will be obtained by subtracting the mean CT attenuation value on nonenhanced images from the mean CT attenuation obtained from pancreatic and portal venous phase enhanced images. Mean enhancement for the pancreatic and portal venous phases will be calculated for both secretin and nonsecretin patients.</description>
