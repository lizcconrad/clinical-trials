    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of weekly epoetin alfa (Hemax® )
      administered for 12 weeks in patients with non curable solid tumors or lymphoma with anemia
      (hemoglobin &lt; 10g/dl) undergoing palliative care chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Patients with non curable solid tumors or lymphoma with anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 10g/dl)
      undergoing palliative care chemotherapy will enter this 12 week single arm open label study.
      Epoetin alfa 40.000-60.000 IU/week will be administered subcutaneously and controlled every 2
      weeks. Up or down titration will be performed according to the currently approved
      prescription guidance for a total of 12 weeks of treatment. Study end points will be assessed
      every 4 weeks until final 12 week visit.
