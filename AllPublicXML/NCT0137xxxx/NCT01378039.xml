    <textblock>
      Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) are common diseases, which tend to
      even increase in many countries. Both from a clinical and a pathophysiological point of view,
      this is an important issue. However, an understanding of the relationship between the complex
      array of cells and mediators involved in asthma and COPD is not yet fully dissected which
      makes difficult to find a specific and sensitive panel of biomarkers that can reflect
      intensity of these pathological processes and can help to predict the individual outcome.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the patterns of pathophysiology and genetic predisposition of COPD and asthma

      Tasks:

      To evaluate patients that respond to corticosteroids and those who do not

      Compare the inflammatory markers:

        -  of COPD and asthma patients before and after treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids

        -  of COPD and asthma patients that respond to inhaled glucocorticoids and those who do not

        -  of nonsmokers and smokers asthma patients

      To identify a small set of markers that can be used to predict corticosteroid-treatment
      response in patients with COPD.

      To evaluate epigenetic factors

      To compare gene mutation and polymorphism between study groups

      To evaluate the relationship between genetic predisposition and pathophysiology, clinical
      symptoms

      To evaluate the relationship between patterns of pathophysiology and clinical symptoms, lung
      function, quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.
