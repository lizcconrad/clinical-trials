      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new educational program for people who have
      recently had gastric bypass surgery. This program involves both the use of newly developed
      wireless home monitoring technology (medication box, weight scale, and pedometer) and
      telephone-based, individually tailored health counseling with a bariatric dietician.

      Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 in kg/m2, has reached epidemic levels in the
      United States (US). Morbid obesity, which is classified as a BMI&gt;=40, is the fastest growing
      obesity category. It has increased 52% between 2000 and 2005, to now affect 15 million US
      adults. Morbid obesity is associated with serious medical co-morbidities, and these
      obesity-related diseases have a significant impact on the individual patient, as well as on
      our healthcare system as a whole. Gastric bypass surgery is the only current effective
      treatment for MO. Approximately 220,000 operations were carried out in 2008, making it one of
      the most commonly performed procedures in the U.S. The most common form (80%) of bariatric
      surgery performed in the U.S. is laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB). While there has been
      considerable clinical focus on multidisciplinary pre-surgical screening regarding medical,
      behavioral, and psychosocial suitability of candidates for bariatric surgery, there is a
      paucity of post-surgical follow-up examining behavioral adaptation and adherence. The purpose
      of this study is to examine such post-surgical behavioral components that are relevant to
      weight loss surgery. Specifically, the investigators will assess the feasibility,
      reliability, usability, and satisfaction of some newly developed wireless home monitoring
      technology (i.e., medication box, weight scale, and pedometer) in a group of patients who
      have recently had gastric bypass surgery. A prospective cohort study design will be
      conducted. Questionnaire data will be collected and data analysis will be descriptive in
      nature.

    <description>Participants will use three home monitoring devices (i.e., weight scale, pedometer, pillbox) for two months. In addition, participants will receive weekly phone calls from the study's bariatric dietician during weeks 1-4 of the study and then receive biweekly calls during the second month. The structured phone calls (approximately 10-15 minutes each call) will focus on discussing the patient's adherence data, discussing any barriers to adherence, and providing tailored patient education.</description>
