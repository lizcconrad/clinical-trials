      Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Caucasians. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most
      frequent skin cancer with around 44.000 new tumours per year in the Netherlands, and its
      incidence is still rising. Prior to treatment, a punch biopsy (PB) is taken from the
      suspected lesion, in order to determine the subtype of BCC. There are three different
      histological subtypes of BCC, from least to most aggressive: superficial, nodular and
      aggressive. Based on the most aggressive subtype seen in the PB, a suitable surgical margin
      is chosen. Surgical excision (SE) is the treatment of first choice in all BCC subtypes
      according to the Dutch guidelines. Recent developments of non-invasive therapies for
      superficial BCC might be the first choice of treatment in the future. These non-invasive
      treatments (photodynamic therapy (PDT), Imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)) have better
      cosmetic results than SE and are therefore also used in the Maastricht University Medical
      Center. Drawback is a higher recurrence rate than SE. As nodular and aggressive subtypes grow
      deeper into the dermis, they have to be treated with SE with a 3 mm and 5 mm margin
      respectively. If BCC are located in the H-zone, the treatment will be Mohs micrographic
      surgery (MMS). Unfortunately, 30% of subtypes seen in the PB do not correspond with the
      subtype seen in the subsequent SE/MMS. The consequence is overtreatment and undertreatment. A
      potential better or equal way to determine the BCC subtype might be the clinical diagnosis.
      To our knowledge, there is no literature about the diagnostic value of the clinical diagnosis
      to determine the subtype of BCC seen in the SE/MMS specimen. We want to confirm the
      hypothesis that the clinical diagnosis is as good as, or even better than the histological
      diagnosis by PB to determine the BCC subtype in the subsequent SE/MMS. In this case, patients
      don't have to undergo an extra procedure, diagnostic route is shortened.

      - Primary objective: to establish the observed agreement of clinical diagnosis compared to
      histological diagnosis by to determine the most aggressive subtype of BCC

      - Secondary objectives: inter-observer and intra-observer variability of dermatologists and
      pathologists to determine subtype BCC.

      - Basal cell carcinoma throughout the world:

      Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) being the most
      frequent form of all skin cancers, and the incidence is still rising without future signs of
      a plateau. Because there is no national registry for BCC in the Netherlands, incidence rates
      are derived from the only register centre in the southern part of our country. From a recent
      study we know that approximately 26.625 new patients with BCCs occurred in 2006 in the
      Netherlands. The average number of BCC per patient is 1.65, resulting in 44.000 new BCCs in
      that year. With an increase of approximately 10% per year the estimated incidence rate at
      2011 will be around 70.800 in the Netherlands. Three important histopathologic subtypes of
      BCC can be distinguished, namely superficial, nodular and aggressive. In the past, nodular
      basal cell carcinoma (nBCC) was the most common histopathologic subtype, but superficial
      basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) and aggressive basal cell carcinoma (aBCC) are the subtypes with
      the fastest growing incidences. Nowadays, the distribution of histopathologic subtypes of BCC
      is 40.6% nodular, 30.7% superficial and 28.7% aggressive. The shift from nodular BCCs to
      other subtypes needs accurate detection of the correct subtype, as treatment per subtype is
      different. The sharp raising incidence of 10% annually makes BCC an even bigger health
      problem in the near future.

      - Diagnosis of BCC:

      BCC is diagnosed with a 3 mm punch biopsy (PB) of the suspected skin lesion. Based on the
      most aggressive histopathologic subtype seen in this biopsy, an appropriate treatment is
      chosen. Three subtypes are relevant for a suitable treatment choice: superficial, nodular and
      aggressive. The last one includes all BCCs with aggressive growth, such as
      infiltrative/morpheaform BCC, micronodular BCC, and BCC with squamous differentiation.
      Unfortunately, 31-33% of histopathologic subtypes seen on punch biopsies of primary and
      recurrent BCCs do not correspond with the subtype seen in the subsequent surgical excision
      (SE)/ Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). The consequence is overtreatment and undertreatment.

      - Guidelines on the treatment of basal cell carcinoma:

      The national advisory board of Dutch dermatologists and plastic surgeons has published
      multidisciplinary guidelines on the treatment of BCCs in 2007. In these guidelines the
      different treatment options for all sort of BCCs are discussed and conclusions are drawn for
      each treatment option. Recommended treatments for all BCCs regardless of the
      histopathological subtype is SE. Both sBCC and nBCC have to be excised with 3 mm margin while
      aggressive subtypes need a 5 mm margin. BCCs in the H-zone will be excised with MMS.
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT), Imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are also options for sBCC on
      low-risk sites because of better cosmetic results.Recent studies show overall estimated
      treatment success at 5-year follow-up of 65% for PDT and 78-80% for Imiquimod. These
      percentages are far lower than the 99% overall estimated treatment success of SE in sBCC.
      There is no literature on treatment effect of 5-FU at long term follow-up. Only two studies
      report 86-87% complete response rate to different 5-FU treatment regimens after 6-12 weeks.

      - Treatment of basal cell carcinoma at the Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC):

      In the past, BCC has been a disease of the elderly patient but as a consequence of
      recreational sun exposure and tanning beds, more young patients develop a skin cancer as
      well. Therefore, cosmetic results play a more important role when choosing a suitable
      treatment. Therefore in today's dermatologic practice at the MUMC patients with a sBCC can be
      treated non-invasively with PDT, Imiquimod, 5-FU or with SE/MMS. These non-invasive
      treatments show good cosmetic results but higher recurrence rates than SE. Any non-responding
      or recurrent sBCC has to be retreated with SE/MMS.

      - Undertreatment and overtreatment:

      Preliminary data from our own study show that in case of a discrepancy between
      histopathologic BCC subtype in the PB and excision, 58% of patients are overtreated and 42%
      undertreated. Half of the overtreated patients will have a histological nBCC or aBCC on PB,
      but only superficial in the SE/MMS. This could be partly due to the fact that the most
      suspected part has already been biopsied and is not present in surgical excision anymore.

      Overtreatment consists of unnecessary tissue loss because of too wide SE margins. In
      addition, large excisions might lead to more complications like scarring, infection,
      continued or subsequent bleeding and dehiscent wounds. Undertreated patients have to be
      re-treated again in case of positive resection margins with SE, resulting in extra stress for
      patients, time and health care costs.

      - Clinical diagnosis:

      Histological diagnosis of BCC subtype by PB might not be the perfect procedure because of the
      30% mismatch with the subtype seen in the SE/MMS. A potential better way to determine the BCC
      subtype might be the clinical diagnosis. To our knowledge, there is no literature about the
      observed agreement of the clinical diagnosis to determine the most aggressive histological
      subtype of BCC. We want to confirm the hypothesis that the clinical diagnosis is as good as
      or even better than the histological diagnosis by PB to determine the most aggressive BCC
      subtype. Confirmation of this hypothesis will result in clinical diagnosis instead of punch
      biopsies, more patients receiving early and correct treatment, saving time and health care
      costs. The conclusions from the proposed study can serve as a basis for updating guidelines
      for the diagnosis of BCC.

    <intervention_name>Punch biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>Punch biopsy is a 10 minutes treatment at the outpatient department of dermatology. Patient will lie down on a bed, the skin will be disinfected and local anaesthesia (lidocaine 1% with epinephrine) will be given, which is briefly painful. Then a PB of 3 mm is taken from the most suspected area. In the case of continuing bleeding the wound will be sutured. A properly taken biopsy will leave no or minimal scarring, but this is not relevant since a SE will be performed afterwards. In very rare cases post-biopsy bleeding or infection occurs.</description>

    <intervention_name>Surgical excision</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgical excision takes place in 30 minutes. Patient will lie down on a bed, the skin will be disinfected and local anaesthesia will be given. sBCC and nBCC will be excised with a 3 mm margin, aBCC with a 5 mm margin. Most BCC can be surgically excised, but some have to be treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). MMS ensures total BCC removal, preserving as much surrounding skin with 100% margin control. All BCCs will be excised with a 2 mm margin and examined under the microscope. This will totally take 1.5-2.0 hours. If tumour is still present, another tissue layer with 2 mm margin will be excised. It usually takes removal of 1-3 tissue layers to complete MMS.
After both treatments, wounds will be sutured and removed after 1-2 weeks, depending on the localisation. Within the first two weeks posttreatment, patients have to avoid physical heavy movements and keep the suture dry. Possible complications: scarring, continuous or subsequent bleeding, infection and dehiscent wounds.</description>
