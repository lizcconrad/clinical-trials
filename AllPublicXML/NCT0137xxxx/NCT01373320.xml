      The study purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of a set of culturally appropriate,
      faith-placed lay health advisor interventions aimed at facilitating smoking cessation and
      increasing cancer screening among Appalachian participants.

      The developmental phase of this project incorporated community based participatory research
      (CBPR) principles to identify the needs and preferences of community members with regard to
      cancer prevention. In the intervention phase, this group-randomized trial administers and
      evaluates a set of culturally appropriate interventions aimed at facilitating smoking
      cessation and increasing cancer screening among participants in 6 distressed Appalachian
      counties. Faith institutions are recruited and randomized to treatment or wait-list control
      conditions, and participants are recruited and enrolled within those institutions.
      Participants select one or more targeted health behaviors from a menu including smoking
      cessation, colorectal cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, and breast cancer
      screening, and subsequently receive the intervention(s) aimed at their selected health
      behaviors.

    <time_frame>Assessed approximately 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>For smoking cessation: Self-reported smoking status. For cancer screenings: Self-reported receipt of cervical, breast, and/or colorectal cancer screening. This assessment occurs after the Early Treatment group has completed the intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stage of readiness to change the selected health behavior(s) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed approximately 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using reliable and valid instruments which were pretested in focus groups comprised of members of the target population. Positive change (i.e., increasing stage of readiness) from baseline to post-test will be coded as &quot;1,&quot; while negative or no change will be coded &quot;0.&quot; This assessment occurs after the Early Treatment group has completed the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of visits completed</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 4 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This process measure will reflect the number of visits/classes attended by participants, as a means of assessing participation rate and feasibility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention (i.e., number of participants who complete all planned assessment timepoints)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately one year after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Retention numbers will be assessed as a process measure outcome. Participants who complete all study assessment timepoints will be coded as &quot;1,&quot; while participants who drop out will be coded &quot;0.&quot; Number/percentage of participants who remained enrolled and complete all study procedures and assessments will be used as an indicator of feasibility in the community setting.</description>
