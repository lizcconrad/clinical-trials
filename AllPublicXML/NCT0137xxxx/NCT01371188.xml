  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Non-mechanized sugar cane harvesting preceded by burning, an important and
      prevalent professional activity of agribusiness segment of the Brazilian economy, exposes
      workers and people of neighboring towns to high concentrations of pollutants and, therefore,
      potentially several risks to health hazards.

      Objectives: Assessing cardiopulmonary impacts and inflammatory markers in sugarcane workers
      and volunteers from a nearby town in non-harvest and harvest periods.
