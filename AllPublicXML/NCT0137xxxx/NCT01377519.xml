  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of a noninvasive, FDA approved
      treatment for uterine fibroids called MR Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS). Our hypothesis
      is that MRgFUS provides superior relief of fibroid symptoms compared with the placebo, a sham
      MRgFUS treatment. The investigators will recruit 20 premenopausal women with symptomatic
      uterine fibroids to participate in the trial. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 2:1
      ratio to the active treatment arm (MRgFUS) versus the sham MRgFUS treatment. Participants
      will remain blinded to their group assignment for 3 months. After 3 months, participants will
      be told their treatment group and those assigned to the sham group will be offered
      complimentary MRgFUS if they desire it. Women will be excluded if they are inappropriate
      candidates for a 3 month delay in fibroid treatment, such as those with significant anemia.
      The investigators will assess the change from baseline to 1 and 3 months after treatment in
      fibroid symptoms, quality of life, fibroid volume measured by MRI, and hematocrit.
