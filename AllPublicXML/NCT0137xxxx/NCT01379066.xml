    <textblock>
      The Pulmonary Colonization Test is a non-invasive breath test for markers of lower
      respiratory tract infection, which may predict the probability of mycobacterial organisms in
      the lower respiratory tract. It consists of:

        -  A breath collection apparatus for collection of volatile organic compounds in breath
           onto a sorbent trap and Tedlar bag, as well as for the collection of a separate sample
           of room air.

        -  Analysis of the volatile organic compounds in breath and room air by short acoustic
           wave/gas chromatography.

        -  Interpretation of the volatile organic compounds with a proprietary algorithm in order
           to predict the probability of lower respiratory tract colonization and infection.

        -  Analysis of the volatile organic compounds in sputum culture by short acoustic wave/gas
           chromatography.

      This study will test the hypothesis that the investigators can identify the presence of
      mycobacteria in an individual by sampling the breath of patients with active tuberculosis and
      by sampling &quot;head space&quot; above culture media of sputum provided. This study will test the
      hypotheses:

        -  that the investigators can identify positive cultures for mycobacterium tuberculosis
           through sampling of the headspace above the cultures prior to standard laboratory
           culture identification

        -  that the investigators can identify control of tuberculosis by sampling exhaled breath
