      Background: The elderly population in western countries and in Israel is constantly growing.
      Falls are one of the common problems among this population. Thus there is a need for falls
      prevention exercise program to be offered in the different settings elderly reside. Most
      methods for physical exercise are dedicated to muscle strengthening and improving balance by
      strengthening external muscles. Pilatis exercise program focuses mainly on strengthening the
      in-depth muscles. The advantage of this method is in its simplicity and availability. This
      method is suitable also for special populations as patients in acute hospitalization. In this
      study, the investigators will evaluate if the pilatis exercise can improve balance of elderly
      population. Physical exercise usually improves the mood. Like any physical exercise, Pilatis
      exercise has a mental advantage, therefore, this study will also examine if pilatis exercise
      can improve quality of life of elderly population.

      Working hypothesis and aims: Pilatis exercise will improve balance and stability
      measurements, and quality of life among elderly population.

      Methods: Randomized, prospective study among elderly patients aged 65 and above belonging to
      Clalit Health Services primary care clinic . Participants of the intervention and control
      group will receive a brochure that will include nutrition and healthy life style
      recommendations. Intervention group: will receive 12 weeks of pilatis exercise 3 times a
      week. The control group will be offered the same intervention at the end of the study period.
      Balance evaluation will be performed using the: Tinetti Balance Gait Scale, Berg Balance
      Scale, Multidirectional Reach Test, Timed Up and Go, Step execution test. The SF-36
      questionnaire will be use to evaluate quality of life.

      Importance: This study will examine the influence of pilatis exercise on balance among the
      elderly. If findings will determine that pilatis does improve balance in the elderly, the
      investigators can further examine pilatis's influence on falls prevention, and minimizing
      falls damages.

      Probable implications to the welfare and health of the aged population:

      Improving balance, falls preventing and minimizing falls damages among elderly; improvement
      in elderly quality of life.
