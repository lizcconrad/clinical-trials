    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure prothrombin time (PT) expressed in International
      Normalised Ratio (INR) units in persons receiving coumadin (warfarin) treatment on an
      experimental device and a commercially available device. This study will involve taking a
      finger-puncture and testing onto a strip and meter system for the experimental and
      commercially available devices.
