    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining two active
      agents;Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and low dose Vidaza® (azacitidine) for the treatment of
      patients with low to intermediate-1 MDS excluding patients with 5 q deletion. The rationale
      for adding Vidaza® (azacitidine) after 3 months of revlimid monotherapy is that combination
      therapy will result in higher response rates, and potentially longer response duration than
      that achieved with either agent.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and
      low dose Vidaza® (azacitidine) in patients with low - intermediate-1 risk MDS non 5 q
      deletion who have not responded after 3 months of Revlimid® (lenalidomide) monotherapy

      Secondary:

      To determine the response rate in patients with low - intermediate-1 risk MDS non 5 q
      deletion receiving Revlimid® (lenalidomide) in combination with low dose Vidaza®
      (azacitidine), as defined by the IWG 2006 Revised Response Criteria

      Eligibility criteria

        1. Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form.

        2. Age 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

        3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

        4. Diagnosis of low- or intermediate-1-risk IPSS (see Appendix III) MDS without an
           abnormality of chromosome 5 involving a deletion between bands q31 and q33.

           Pathologic diagnosis via pathology performed at Rush University Medical Center or made
           available to Rush from outside institution.

        5. Prior treatment with &lt; 3 cycles (84 days) of Revlimid® (lenalidomide) are eligible for
           enrollment regardless of response.

        6. ECOG performance status of 2 at study entry (see Appendix II).

        7. Disease free of prior malignancies for &gt; 5 years with exception of currently treated
           basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma &quot;insitu&quot; of the cervix or
           breast.

        8. Serum bilirubin levels &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range for the
           laboratory (ULN). Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to active
           hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis.

        9. Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or
           serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) levels &lt; 2 x
           ULN.

       10. Serum creatinine levels &lt; 1.5 x ULN

       11. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm³

       12. Platelet count &gt; 30,000/mm³

       13. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and be
           willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®.

Patients who fail to respond (2006 IWG criteria) after receiving two cycles of combination therapy will receive lenalidomide at the same dose administered in Cycle 3 and azacitidine 50 mg/m2 SC or IV given daily on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle, if no grade 4 toxicity developed or no delay greater than 2 weeks in starting a new cycle was experienced during the first 2 cycles of combination therapy.</description>
