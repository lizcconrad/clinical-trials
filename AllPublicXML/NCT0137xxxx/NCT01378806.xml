    <textblock>
      Young children who are overweight or at risk for overweight are at increased risk for
      becoming obese as young adults and developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. To
      date, there have been no interdisciplinary interventions that targeted predominantly ethnic
      minority low-income children and parents and taught them to work together to improve
      nutrition and exercise. Using a two-group, repeated measures experimental design, this
      proposed study will test a 12-week intensive intervention on nutrition, exercise and coping
      skills (Phase I) and 9 months of continued monthly contact (Phase II) to help overweight 2nd,
      3rd, and 4th grade children and their parents improve self-efficacy, health behaviors, weight
      status, and adiposity. The study will take this intervention to the community in which
      children and parents live, working with four schools in Alamance-Burlington County, NC, and
      four schools in Wilson County in the early evening. A total of 356 Black, Hispanic, and White
      children with a BMI &gt;85th percentile and 356 parents with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m2 will be inducted
      over 3 Â½ years and randomized by school to either the experimental or control group. Data
      will be collected at Time 1 (Baseline), Time 2 (Post Phase I-Intensive Intervention), Time 3
      (Post Phase II-Continued Contact), and Time 4 (6-Month Follow-Up). Data collected will
      include scores on the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II in the parents; eating
      self-efficacy in the children (CATCH) and parents (Eating Self-Efficacy Scale) and exercise
      self-efficacy in the children (CATCH) and parents (Exercise Self-Efficacy); health behaviors
      in the children and parents (3 Day 24-Hour Food Recall and 4 Day Accelerometry Measurement);
      weight status in the children (BMI percentile) and parents (BMI); and adiposity in the
      children and parents (waist circumference and triceps and subscapular skinfolds). Data
      analysis will use general linear mixed models to test the hypotheses. Decreasing overweight
      in children and parents is urgently needed, and helping children and parents to work together
      to improve their nutrition and exercise patterns by making small lifestyle pattern changes
      may decrease future health care costs and decrease morbidity and mortality. The knowledge to
      be gained from this study may provide a foundation for extending this intervention to other
      Black, Hispanic, and White children and parents in other communities to assist them to manage
      their weight.
