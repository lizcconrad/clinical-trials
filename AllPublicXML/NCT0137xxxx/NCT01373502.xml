             revascularization (CABG)

          -  Patient has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and
             has provided written informed consent as approved by the Ethical Committee of the
             respective clinical site

          -  Patients with clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and/or a positive functional
             study(e.g. stress test); documented stable (CCS I-IV) or unstable angina pectoris
             (Braunwald class I-II B and C) or documented silent ischemia

          -  LVEF&gt;30%

          -  Requires treatment of a single de novo lesion in a native coronary artery in one or
             two different major epicardial vessels (LAD, LCX or RCA). The second lesion must fit
             with inclusion/exclusion criteria and must be treated with the same study stent as the
             first lesion

          -  Target lesion should be located in a target vessel with a diameter ranging from 3.0 to
             3.75 mm

          -  Target lesion diameter stenosis &gt; 50% and &lt; 100% by visual estimate, with a TIMI flow
             of ≥ 1

          -  The target lesion must be appropriately covered (margin of 2.5 mm on both sides of the
             stent) by one study stent (DES Limus Carbostent or Taxus Liberté, according to the
             randomization arm). Any occurred dissection of the target vessel must be treated with
             an additional stent (DES Limus Carbostent or Taxus Liberté, according to the
             randomization arm)

          -  Patient that underwent BMS implantation more than 6 months before the enrolment or DES
             implantation more than 1 year before the enrolment in an other vessel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female with childbearing potential or lactating

          -  Known sensitivity to sirolimus, paclitaxel, the polymeric matrix, stainless steel or
             cobalt chromium

          -  Acute Q-wave or non Q-wave myocardial infarction within 72 hours, or presents with CK
             elevation greater than 2 times upper limit normal associated with elevated CK-MB

          -  Cardiogenic shock

          -  Cerebrovascular accident within the past 6 months

          -  Known bleeding or hypercoagulable disorder

          -  Prior anaphylactic reaction to contrast agents or contrast sensitivity that cannot be
             controlled with pre-medication

          -  Currently under immunosuppressant therapy

          -  Currently, or has been treated with either Rapamune or paclitaxel within 12 months of
             the procedure

          -  Active infection

          -  Co-morbidities that could interfere with completion of study procedures, or life
             expectancy less than 1 year;

          -  Participating in another investigational drug or device trial that has not completed
             the primary endpoint or would interfere with the endpoints of this study

          -  Patient underwent coronary revascularization to any vessel within 30 days

          -  Patient underwent target vessel revascularization within 6 months

          -  Target vessel has had prior stent placement

          -  Presence of two lesions located in the same vascular territory (same major epicardial
             vessel)

          -  Prior coronary brachytherapy

          -  There is a planned target lesion treatment with any technique other than the
             pre-dilatation balloon angioplasty

          -  Treatment of more than two lesions is required at the time of enrolment, or is planned
             within 30 days following enrolment

          -  Any planned surgery within 6 months after index procedure

          -  Left main disease greater than 50% diameter stenosis

          -  Significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require
             revascularization or impede run off

          -  Heavily calcified vessel and/or lesion which cannot be successfully predilated

          -  Target lesion is located or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft

          -  Ostial target lesion or lesion located within 2 mm of a bifurcation

          -  Target lesion involves a side branch &gt;2.0 mm in diameter with an ostial disease

          -  Target lesion has TIMI 0 flow

          -  Target vessel with angiographically visible thrombus or unsuitable for proper stent
             delivery and deployment.
