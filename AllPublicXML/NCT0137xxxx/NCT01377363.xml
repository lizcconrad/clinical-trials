  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective Clinical Trial without drugs, to determine the HER2 status in the
      metastasis of patients with primary breast cancer HER2. 236 patients have been recruited and
      32 Sites have been taking part in this Clinical Trial.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine prospectively the probability of stage HER2 conversion between the
           different subtypes of primary breast cancer (luminal, triple negative and HER2) and
           their metastasis.

      Secondary Objective:

      - To determine the probability of changes in ER and PR between different subtypes of primary
      breast cancer and their metastasis.

        -  Analyze the variability in the measurement of HER2, ER and PR between local laboratories
           and central laboratory.

        -  Evaluate HER2 conversion rate compared to previously received treatment.

        -  Evaluate whether the location of metastasis biopsied relates to the probability of
           conversion of HER2.

        -  Compare the disease-free survival (DFS) and survival post relapse (SPR) of patients with
           or without conversion of HER2 and ER/PR.

        -  Compare the response rate (RR) and time to progression (TTP) for subsequent anti-tumor
           treatment of patients with or without conversion of HER2.

        -  Analyze the extent to which discrepancies in the HER2 receptor status, ER and PR between
           the primary tumor and metastasis alter the clinical management of patients.

        -  Analyze the feasibility of performing biopsies.

        -  Evaluate whether the HER2 status conversion really is associated with activation of
           intracellular markers of the HER2 signaling pathway: pMAPK, PERK, pAKT, PTEN, PIGF-1R in
           paired samples (primary tumor and their metastasis).

        -  Check if there is any change in the molecular subtypes (luminal, triple negative, HER2)
           between primary tumors and metastases in patients with HER2 conversion.
