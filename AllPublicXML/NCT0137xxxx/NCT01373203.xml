  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The important character of acute lung injury (ALI) is alveolar capillary membrane damage
      caused by different diseases, such as sepsis, trauma and shock. One of the important
      pathological stages is the varying degrees of interstitial fibrosis and semi-permeable
      alveolar membrane fibrosis. It has been proved that CXCL12/SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived
      factor-1) induces fibrocyte migration, and promotes fibrosis progression. Study indicated
      that inhibition of TLR4 receptor signaling pathway improves fibrosis progression induced by
      ALI, however, the role of fibrocyte in ALI is still unclear. The fibrocytes was significantly
      increased in asthmatic patients with pulmonary fibrosis, which companies with increased CTGF
      expression. Therefore, this project assumes that fibrocyte will differentiation to
      fibroblast/myofibroblast in patient with acute lung injury, which in turn leads to
      progression of fibrosis. The central hypothesis of this project is that peripheral progenitor
      cell fibrocytes play an important role in alveolitis caused by acute lung injury. The overall
      objective of this project is to study the role of fibrocytes in acute lung injury.
