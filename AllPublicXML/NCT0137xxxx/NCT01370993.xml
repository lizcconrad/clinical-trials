      The purpose of this study is to develop the hypoxemia prediction model during fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy under MAC(monitored anesthesia care) anesthesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, diverse sedatives and analgesic methods are used during fiberoptic bronchoscopy
      for reducing patients' discomfort and facilities of procedures as British Thoracic Society
      recommendation. MAC anesthesia, one of the widely used sedative method during bronchoscopy,
      have many advantages, occurrence of respiratory depression, hypoxemia are not uncommon during
      the procedures. The investigators try to find out risk factors and develop the prediction
      model for hypoxemia during bronchoscopy under MAC anesthesia.
