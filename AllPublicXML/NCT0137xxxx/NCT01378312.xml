  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      in healthy adult subjects who are HIV-negative, BCG-vaccinated, and have no evidence of
      tuberculosis infection. The study will be conducted at one clinical research site in India.

      The available live tuberculosis vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), provides incomplete
      protection against pulmonary tuberculosis. For unknown reasons, a BCG revaccination or
      &quot;booster&quot;, while not toxic, does not provide much additional protection. AERAS-402 presents
      tuberculosis antigens in the setting of a new, live, replication-deficient adenovirus vaccine
      that may increase T cell-mediated immunity and thus protection from tuberculosis. Since
      BCG-vaccinated individuals are the population for which AERAS-402 might be indicated,
      AERAS-402 will be administered to individuals already vaccinated with BCG.
