  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On a yearly basis roughly 40.000 individuals aged 65+ contact the emergency departments in
      Denmark as a result of an accidental fall, and in about 30% of these cases hospitalization is
      required. The cost of these admissions vary according to the type of injury with hip
      fractures being the most expensive accident {{113 Chrischilles,E. 1994; }}. The total average
      cost of a severe hip fracture in the Danish healthcare system resulting in nursing home
      placement has been estimated to approximately 365.000 Danish Kroner (Dkk) per year {{288
      Christensen,P.M. 2005;}}. In addition, about 20 % of the elderly individuals who sustain a
      hip fracture will die within 6 months {{200 Brot,C. 2006; }}. For the society the outcome of
      falling in the elderly population is therefore not only associated with severe human but also
      economical consequences. Hence, it is essential to refine, develop and think &quot;out of the box&quot;
      when future intervention programs are designed and employed in the elderly community.

      One such &quot;out of the box&quot; intervention could be balance training with a Nintendo Wii Fit
      board (Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Co Ltd, Minami-ku Kyoto, Japan). The Nintendo Wii Fit board is
      a new generation of computer game which uses 3D tracking of the participants' motion and
      gestures. This means that the user interacts in and controls elements of the 3D gaming world
      with their own body {{307 LaViola,J.J.,Jr 2008;}}. In the case of the Wii Fit board, it
      detects the body sway and center of pressure (COP) of the participant and displays it onto a
      TV screen in different balance sceneries. A virtual character on the TV then reacts according
      to the user's movement and gesture (ex. skiing down a ski slope passing thru gates). This
      enables the user to perform tasks that, they may not be able to execute safely or at all in
      real-world situations. Interestingly in this context a study by Sihvonen et al from 2004
      showed a compliance of 97,5% using the same technique as the Wii Fit only in 2D and with a
      poor graphical display. Further, the Sihvonen-study showed that 2D &quot;biofeedback&quot; intervention
      of only 4 weeks proved successful in terms of improved postural balance, physical activity
      and life quality {{297 Sihvonen,S. 2004;}}. Finally, traditional methods when promoting
      physical activity in the elderly population has been limited by lack of motivation or poor
      compliance (REFS), which possibly has prevented the elderly from reaching a maximum
      rehabilitation potential(REFS). Furthermore, in the follow-up period after these traditional
      intervention studies, it has been documented how difficult it is for the elderly to sustain
      the same training volume on themselves (REFS).

      Virtual reality systems like the Nintendo Wii Fit have been developed specifically for
      rehabilitation of the upper- {{301 Kuttuva,M. 2006;300 Dvorkin,A.Y. 2006;}} and
      lower-extremities and gait training {{298 Deutsch,J.E. 2007;}}. Further virtual reality
      platforms have been use for rehabilitation and training of reaching movements {{302 Piron,L.
      2001;}}, motor coordination {{303 Broeren,J. 2002;}}, hand strength and range of motion,
      speed of hand movement{{304 Jack,D. 2001;305 Merians,A.S. 2002;}}. But so far most of these
      systems have not become commercially available possible due to a very high cost {{294
      Deutsch,J.E. 2008;}}. Moreover in some cases the virtual rehabilitation environment has to be
      constructed from scratch making the hole process and implication very complicated {{306
      Weiss,P.L. 2004;}}. Thus, designing an intervention program that utilizes the low-cost
      ready-to-use Wii Fit platform could be a possible research direction to explore. At the
      moment few studies have been conducted using the Nintendo Wii console. Among the few some
      have investigated the energy expenditure in kids (11-17 years of age) playing Wii Sports
      (bowling, tennis and boxing) compared to sedentary xbox games and actual bowling, tennis and
      boxing {{ 295 Graves,L.E. 2008; 296 Graves,L. 2008; }} while others have explored the
      Nintendo Wii console for rehabilitation of an adolescent with cerebral palsy {{294
      Deutsch,J.E. 2008; }}.

      To the authors knowledge no studies have investigated the effect of 10 weeks of Nintendo Wii
      Fit balance training in seniors (+65 years). The main purpose of the study is to investigate
      the hypothesis: That 10 weeks of Nintendo Wii Fit balance training in a group of seniors (+65
      years of age) have a significant effect on postural balance and muscle strength.
