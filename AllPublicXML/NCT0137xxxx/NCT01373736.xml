    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a clinical indication for 123I-MIBG imaging to evaluate for the
             presence, extent, or status of neuroendocrine tumors;

          -  subjects must be able and willing to comply with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with history of renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level &gt; 3.0 mg/dL [265
             Âµmol/L]) and inability to be withdrawn from medications known to interfere with
             123I-MIBG uptake;

          -  Subjects unable to tolerate lying supine;

          -  Subjects pregnant or breastfeeding, unless the information to be gained outweighs the
             possible hazardous effects of 123I-MIBG administration. Where the assessment of the
             risk/benefit ration suggests the use of 123I-MIBG in nursing mothers, the
             breastfeeding should be discontinued for at least 48 hours post-injection.
