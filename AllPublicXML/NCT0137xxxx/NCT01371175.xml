      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of plasmid DNA and
      recombinant MVA (Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara) in a prime-boost regimen.

      Approximately 111 volunteers (90 vaccine recipients/21 placebo recipients) will be enrolled
      at two sites. Approximately 56 volunteers will be enrolled at each site. An over-enrolment of
      up to 10% (approximately 10 additional volunteers) will be permitted in the study.

             of enrolment;

          3. Available for follow up for the planned duration of the study (screening plus 18
             months);

          4. Able to give written informed consent;

             contraceptive pill; injectable contraceptive; IUCD; condoms; anatomical sterility in

             willing to undergo urine pregnancy tests at screening and prior to each vaccination
             and 4 months after the last vaccination;

          7. If sexually active male, willing to use an effective method of contraception (such as
             condoms) from screening until 4 months after the last vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically relevant abnormality on history or examination including history of
             immunodeficiency or use of systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive, antiviral,
             anticancer, or other medications considered significant by the designated trial

             , absolute CD4 count, platelets); urinalysis, biochemistries (total bilirubin,
             creatinine, AST, ALT). Volunteers with mild laboratory abnormalities which are judged
             by the principal investigator or designee to be not clinically significant may be
             enrolled.

          4. If female, pregnant or planning a pregnancy within 4 months after last vaccination or
             lactating;

             enrolment;

          6. Receipt of blood transfusion or blood products 6 months prior to enrolment;

          7. Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational product currently or
             within last 12 weeks or expected participation during this study;

          8. History of severe local or general reaction to vaccination or history of allergic
             reactions;

          9. History of grand-mal epilepsy, or currently taking anti-epileptics;

         10. Confirmed HIV-1 or HIV-2 seropositive;

         11. Positive for hepatitis B (surface antigen) or confirmed diagnosis of active syphilis
             at the time of enrolment (RPR positive and TPHA positive or equivalent), positive for
             hepatitis C antibodies;

         12. Unlikely to comply with protocol. Prior receipt of smallpox vaccination should be
             documented, but will not be an exclusion criterion.
