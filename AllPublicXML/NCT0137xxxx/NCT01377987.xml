  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal is to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and resistance to
      effective treatment of sleep disordered breathing in patients with heart failure, with a
      focus on selecting patients that will benefit specifically from acetazolamide treatment.

      The study addresses three primary hypotheses: 1) Acetazolamide treatment will reduce the
      apnea-hypopnea index and improve markers of heart-failure severity in heart-failure patients
      with sleep apnea. 2) Acetazolamide will provide the greatest improvement in patients with the
      most severe ventilatory control instability (strongest chemoreflex response to carbon
      dioxide; highest loop gain). 3) Acetazolamide will act primarily via stabilizing ventilatory
      control (reducing loop gain), rather than via improvement to upper airway anatomy, pulmonary
      congestion, and cardiac function.

    <description>Higher pulmonary closing volume can indicate subclinical pulmonary edema, which is expected to improve if there is any considerable diuretic effect of acetazolamide or reduction in left ventricular filling pressure.
