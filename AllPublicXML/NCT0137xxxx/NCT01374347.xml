      The study will be an open label one and will include 30 patients who underwent ischemic
      stroke 3 month to 3 years prior to the study. All patients will undergone a baseline brain
      SPECT perfusion study. 15 patients will take one dose of 20 mg cialis, and will have a second
      brain SPECT 24 hours after cialis administration. 15 other patients (age and risk factor
      matched) will be prescribed 5 mg of cialis once daily for 7 days, and a second SPECT study
      will be performed 24 hours after the last dose.
