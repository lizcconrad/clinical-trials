  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although a significant amount of work has been done to validate simulators as viable systems
      to teach technical skills outside the operating room, the next necessary step is to integrate
      simulator training into a comprehensive curriculum. The purpose of this study is to develop
      and validate a comprehensive ex-vivo curriculum for laparoscopic colorectal surgery. This
      curriculum will include training on a virtual reality simulator, cognitive training and
      cadaver lab training. The investigators will assess the effectiveness of the curriculum by
      conducting a randomized single blinded controlled trial. The investigators will be comparing
      the technical performance of curricular trained and non-trained residents in the operating
      room, during a procedure on a patient. The investigators hypothesize that surgical residents
      who participate in the curriculum will have superior technical proficiency and cognitive
      knowledge relating to performing laparoscopic colorectal surgery compared to conventionally
      trained residents.

    <description>Surgical residents participating in the study will perform a laparoscopic right colectomy in the operating room. The procedure will be video-recorded through the laparoscopic camera. The videos will be given to a blinded expert in video assessment who will assess the technical proficiency of the resident using a validated global rating scale.</description>

    <description>Residents in the curricular training group will participate in the entire ex-vivo training curriculum. They will train to proficiency on a virtual reality simulator. This training program has 8 tasks at an &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; level. They will also participate in a cognitive training component. This consists of self-directed reading, and a video training component. In the video training component, residents will watch videos of laparoscopic right and sigmoid colectomies with a staff facilitator. Finally, all residents in the intervention group will participate in a cadaver lab where they will perform a laparoscopic right or sigmoid colectomy on a cadaver.</description>
