      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of hospitalization for acute kidney
      injury among patients with type 2 diabetes who are new initiators of Saxagliptin and those
      who are new initiators of other oral antidiabetic drugs in classes other than Dipeptidyl
      peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors.

      Prospectively designed retrospective database study. This study will be conducted using
      administrative claims data and electronic medical records that are collected as part of
      routine clinical practice.

      This will be a prospectively-designed database cohort study comparing hospitalizations for
      acute kidney injury among new initiators of Saxagliptin compared to those who are new
      initiators of OADs in classes other than DPP4 inhibitors. The study time frame will be from
      2009 through 2014.

        This study will carried out using databases containing administrative claims data [
        HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and Medicare in the U.S.] and electronic
        medical records [ General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and The Health Improvement
        Network (THIN) in the UK]. The US population includes patients from health plans in the
        northeast, southeastern, mid-Atlantic, central, mid-western, and western regions (HIRD) as
        well as US citizens 65 years of age and older (Medicare). The UK population includes
        patients seeking medical care from general practitioners (GPRD and THIN).
