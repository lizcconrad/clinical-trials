    <description>The CDRS-R consists of 17 items. The total score is the sum of responses to the 17 items and ranges from 17 to 113. Lower total scores indicate lower intensity of symptoms. Remission on the CDRS-R was defined as a CDRS-R score &lt;=28. It was recommended that the CDRS-R be performed prior to the Clinical Global Impression assessments. Mean change from baseline=score at Week 26 minus score at baseline of study B2061032.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale is a tool that summarizes all available patient data, including history, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on ability to function. The scale consists of 2 measures: the CGI-S, which rates the severity of illness from 1 to 7, and the CGI-Improvement Scale, which assesses improvement in illness since baseline. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale a clinician uses to rate a patient's severity of illness. Scores range from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and 7, &quot;among the most extremely ill patients.&quot; Higher score on the CGI-S indicates greater severity of illness. Mean change from baseline=score at Week 26 minus score at baseline of study B2061032.</description>

        <title>Change in Score From Baseline to Week 26 on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale, Based on Observed Cases</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale is a tool that summarizes all available patient data, including history, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on ability to function. The scale consists of 2 measures: the CGI-S, which rates the severity of illness from 1 to 7, and the CGI-Improvement Scale, which assesses improvement in illness since baseline. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale a clinician uses to rate a patient's severity of illness. Scores range from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating “normal, not at all ill” and 7, “among the most extremely ill patients.” Higher score on the CGI-S indicates greater severity of illness. Mean change from baseline=score at Week 26 minus score at baseline of study B2061032.</description>

        <title>Change in Score From Baseline to Week 26 on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale, Based on Observed Cases (Combination Group)</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale is a tool that summarizes all available patient data, including history, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on ability to function. The scale consists of 2 measures: the CGI-S, which rates the severity of illness from 1 to 7, and the CGI-Improvement Scale, which assesses improvement in illness since baseline. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale a clinician uses to rate a patient's severity of illness. Scores range from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating “normal, not at all ill” and 7, “among the most extremely ill patients.” Higher score on the CGI-S indicates greater severity of illness. Mean change from baseline=score at Week 26 minus score at baseline of study B2061032.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants by Score on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale, Based on Observed Cases (Combination Group)</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale is a tool that summarizes all available patient data, including history, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on ability to function. The scale consists of 2 measures: the CGI-Severity scale, which rates the severity of illness from 1 to 7, and the CGI-I scale, which assesses improvement in illness since baseline. The CGI-I is a 7-point scale used a clinician uses to assess improvement in a patient's illness relative to baseline. Scores range from 1 to 7, with 1 representing “very much improved” and 7 representing “very much worse”; a value of 0 meant not assessed. Lower score indicates greater improvement. Response on the CGI-I defined as the CGI-I scores of 1 or 2. Mean change from baseline=score at Week 26 minus score at baseline of study B2061032.</description>
