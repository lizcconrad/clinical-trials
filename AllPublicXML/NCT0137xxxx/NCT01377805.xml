  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis patients commonly develop generalized ventricular dilation with or without
      cerebral atrophy over time. Case studies in the literature have noted some multiple sclerosis
      patients develop the typical &quot;normal pressure hydrocephalus&quot; triad of dementia, gait
      disturbance and incontinence which were responsive to shunts.

      Many patients with connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome) develop Multiple
      Sclerosis and studies indicate that in the Multiple Sclerosis population, there exists over
      10% more Ehlers-Danlos patients than in the normal population.

      Because studies are indicating a form of external communicating hydrocephalus in the
      Ehlers-Danlos population, the author hypothesizes the same type of hydrocephalus may occur in
      the Multiple Sclerosis population.

      To evaluate this hypothesis, investigators will retroactively evaluate the head circumference
      of Multiple Sclerosis patients between birth and 15 months (before the skull sutures have
      closed).

      patients develop the typical &quot;normal pressure hydrocephalus&quot; triad of dementia, gait

      of Multiple Sclerosis patients between birth and 15 months (before the skull sutures have
      closed).

      High pressure on the brain (even if subtle) could be evidence of congenital CCSVI
      (cerebrospinal venous insufficiency), increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, the
      poor drainage of cerebral spinal fluid, or a combination of all. Retrospective examination of
      skull expansion is a necessary step to ascertain these possibilities, allowing for early
      treatment and the hope of avoidance of the neurological symptoms, and often disabling
      effects. It is the author's belief that &quot;Benign External Hydrocephalus&quot; is not a benign
      condition.
