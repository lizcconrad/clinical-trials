    <textblock>
      Hypothesis to be tested:

      Bilateral Deep Brain Stimulation to the Nucleus Accumbens is associated with clinically and
      statistically significant improvement in patients with treatment resistant bipolar disorder.

      Overall Objective:

      The aim in this interdisciplinary, psychiatric-neurosurgical project is to evaluate safety
      and efficacy of bilateral Deep Brain Stimulation to the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) using the
      Medtronic Activa RC Neurostimulator in patients with treatment resistant Bipolar Disorder.

    <measure>Depression Severity rated with Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (abbreviated MADRS) is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. It was designed in 1979 by British and Swedish researchers as an adjunct to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) which would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than the Hamilton Scale is.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>One of the most frequently used rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. This scale will be used to assess the development of manic symptoms over time, mainly in order to assess treatment emergent manic symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Severity rated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS24)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), also known as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) or abbreviated to HAM-D, is a multiple choice questionnaire that clinicians may use to rate the severity of a patient's major depression. The questionnaire rates the severity of symptoms observed in depression such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and weight loss. The questionnaire is presently one of the most commonly used scales for rating depression in medical research.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Event Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events induced by the Stimulation will be recorded during the study using a structured questionnaire. 12 months after stimulation onset results will be compiled and rated as being due to DBS or not.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 20-70 years old. • German mother tongue • Ability to provide written informed
             consent.

          -  At least one manic or hypomanic episode according to DSM IV previous to onset of last
             depressive episode.

          -  Global Assessment of Function (GAF) score of &gt; 46 • 5 years after the first episode of
             MD • DSM IV criteria for a current Major Depressive Episode (MDE) diagnosed by
             structured clinical interview for DSM IV. Diagnosis will be confirmed by two
             independent psychiatrists. • Current episode of MD &gt; two years duration OR a history
             of more than 4 lifetime depressive episodes. • Minimum score at study entry of 28 on
             the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS24).

          -  Average pre-operative HDRS24 score of 28 or greater (averaged over screening period)
             and a final preoperative HDRS24 score no more than 30% lower than the baseline
             screening HDRS score. • Treatment-resistant depression defined as: • Failure to
             respond to a minimum of four different antidepressant treatments, including
             medications and evidence-based psychotherapy (&gt; 20 sessions with an experienced
             psychotherapist) administered at adequate doses and duration during the current
             episode. We will require documentation (i.e., statement from the treating
             psychiatrist) that a treatment trial has failed (either no response to maximum
             tolerable doses for a minimum of 5 weeks, or side-effects at sub-maximal doses) as
             coded by the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF). The study investigators
             will document each treatment by way of review of records from referring psychiatrists.
             • Failure or intolerance of an adequate course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
             during any episode (&gt; 6 bilateral treatments).
