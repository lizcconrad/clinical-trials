  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - TRC105 is an experimental cancer drug. It is designed to slow or stop the growth of tumors.
      It does this by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that feed these tumors. People
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (or liver cancer) sometimes do not respond to standard
      treatments. This includes the cancer drug sorafenib.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of TRC105 to treat liver cancer that has not responded
      to standard therapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  People at least 18 years of age who have hepatocellular carcinoma (or liver cancer) that
           has not responded to standard therapy. Participants also will not be eligible for a
           liver transplant.

        -  No anticoagulation therapy is allowed with the exception of low-dose aspirin.

        -  No history of bleeding disorders, peptic ulcer disease or gastritis.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will also have blood
           and urine tests, and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will receive TRC105 once a week. They will also have two daily doses of a
           steroid the day before each treatment. This will help prevent known side effects.

        -  Participants will be monitored with blood and urine tests. They will also have imaging
           studies every two months to study the effect of the drug on tumor growth.

        -  Participants will continue to have TRC105 as long as they do not have severe side
           effects and their liver cancer stops growing or shrinks. After stopping TRC105, they
           will have yearly visits with physical exams and blood tests.

      Background:

        -  Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy with a
           median survival of 6-9 months. The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) study
           established Sorafenib as a standard consideration in this disease and set the bar for
           future studies of systemic therapy. There is no standard therapy for patients whose
           disease has progressed despite Sorafenib therapy.

        -  TRC105 is a chimeric, anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody that binds CD105, a
           transmembrane receptor overexpressed by proliferating endothelial cells. TRC105 binds to
           CD105-expressing endothelial cells and mediates growth inhibition, apoptosis and
           antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      -To evaluate time to tumor progression (TTP) for TRC105 in HCC.

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate safety of TRC105 in HCC.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of TRC105 as measured by human antichimeric antibody
           (HACA) and human antimouse antibody formation.

        -  To evaluate anti-tumor response as determined by standard and European Association for
           the Study of the Liver (EASL) -modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
           (RECIST) response criteria.

        -  To perform correlative studies assessing potential biomarkers of response to TRC105.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC.

        -  Childs-Pugh A or B (7 points) cirrhosis only is allowed.

        -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection.

        -  Patients must have progressed on or been intolerant of prior sorafenib therapy.

        -  No history of bleeding varices (unless subsequent liver transplant). All patients must
           have had endoscopic evaluation within 6 months of starting study.

        -  No history of bleeding varices in previous 1 year (unless subsequent liver transplant).
           No anti-coagulation (except low-dose aspirin).

      Design:

        -  This is a single-arm phase II study of TRC105 in patients with HCC.

        -  TRC105 will be administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks. Patients will be
           re-staged every 8 weeks.

        -  The primary endpoint of the study will be Time to Tumor Progression (TTP). The primary
           purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of TRC105 as a second line treatment to
           improve upon the time to progression (TTP) of patients with refractory HCC.

    <description>Time to tumor progression is defined as the proportion of participants who are progression free after 4 months on study. Progression is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have histopathological confirmation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) by
             the Laboratory of Pathology of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) prior to entering
             this study.

        Or

        histopathological confirmation of carcinoma in the setting of clinical and radiological
        characteristics which, together with the pathology, are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of
        HCC.

          -  Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection or
             ablative techniques. In addition, disease must not be amenable to transhepatic
             arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Patients may have had prior TACE and had disease
             progression following it. Patients must not be considered potential candidates for
             liver transplantation. This determination will be made after hepatobiliary surgical
             input at the NCI multidisciplinary conference.

          -  All patients enrolled will be required to have measurable disease.

          -  If liver cirrhosis is present, patient must have a Child-Pugh A classification.

          -  Patients must have progressed on or been intolerant of prior sorafenib therapy.

          -  Patients must with cirrhosis have had esophagogastric endoscopy within the previous 6
             months prior to study entry for the assessment of varices. If the patient has not had
             this done they must be willing to undergo this procedure prior to study entry.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 3 times upper normal limits

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or
                  equal to 10 times upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times upper normal limits OR creatinine
                  clearance greater than or equal to 40 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with
                  creatinine levels above institutional normal, as calculated by the Cockcroft
                  Gault formula.

          -  Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy,
             including surgery. Toxicity should be less than or equal to grade 1 or returned to
             baseline.

          -  Patients must not have other invasive malignancies within the past 3 years (with the
             exception of non-melanoma skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of the cervix and
             noninvasive bladder cancer).

          -  Enrolled patients must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, the duration of study
             participation and 3 months after the end of the treatment.

          -  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, large field radiotherapy, or major surgery must
             wait 4 weeks prior to entering the study (2 weeks is sufficient for targeted systemic
             therapy provided toxicity has recovered to less than or equal to grade 1).

          -  Patients may not be receiving any anti-cancer agents not approved by the Food and Drug
             Administration (FDA) within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Proteinuria, as demonstrated by a 24 hour protein of greater than or equal to 2000 mg.
             Urine protein will be screened by urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPC). For urine
             protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio &gt; 1.0, a 24-hour urine protein will need to be
             obtained and the level should be &lt; 2000 mg for patient enrollment.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, hypertension
             (systolic blood pressure (BP) 160, diastolic BP &gt; 100), ongoing or active systemic
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  No anti-coagulation therapy is allowed with the exception of low-dose aspirin.

          -  No bleeding diathesis.

          -  Patients with a history of bleeding varices in previous 1 year are excluded (unless
             patient has subsequently had a liver transplant). Those with gastric varices or
             varices that are deemed as high risk by the endoscopist should be placed on
             appropriate medical therapy as advised by the gastroenterologist.

          -  History of peptic ulcer disease or hemorrhagic gastritis within 6 months of TRC105
             administration, unless patient has received adequate treatment for peptic ulcer
             disease or hemorrhagic gastritis and has evidence of complete resolution documented by
             esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Mild gastritis is allowed.

          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 500 msec.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy
             are excluded from this study due to the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions
             between antiretroviral medications and TRC105. HIV positive patients not receiving
             antiretroviral therapy are excluded due to the possibility that TRC105 may worsen
             their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the
             attribution of adverse events with respect to TRC105.

          -  History of hypersensitivity reaction to human or mouse antibody products.

          -  Patients with a history of familial bleeding disorders.

          -  Patients with a history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu
             syndrome).

          -  Pregnancy and breast feeding are exclusion factors. Enrolled patients must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry, the duration of study participation and 3 months after the end
             of the treatment.

          <description>TRC105 is an experimental cancer drug designed to slow or stop the growth of tumors. It does this by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that feed these tumors. This drug is being used to test the safety and effectiveness to treat liver cancer that has not responded to standard therapy. TRC105 will be given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks.</description>

        <title>Time to Tumor Progression (TTP) for TRC105 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).</title>
        <description>Time to tumor progression is defined as the proportion of participants who are progression free after 4 months on study. Progression is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).</description>
