  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neuromuscular function from baseline to 13 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly for 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological exams to determine neuro-muscular function, which is typically compromised in patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases. Standard clinical neurological/neuromuscular assessment scales will be used</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects experiencing adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Al least monthly for 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Standard laboratory tests to evaluate organ function will be used to assess adverse effects on organ systems and function. Electrocardiograms will be recorded to assess any effect on cardiac conduction. Subjects will be monitored for any clinical adverse signs at least monthly, and more frequently if patient condition warrants. In each case of reported adverse events, an assessment will be made if the event is due to EPI-743 administration or to underlying/intercurrent disease.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Newcastle Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Score from baseline at 13 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Newcastle Pediatric Mitochondrial Disease Score (NPMDS)is a validated scale to assess the clinical severity of mitochondrial disease. The NPMDS will be scored at baseline and at 13 weeks, and the difference will be assessed as improved, stable or deteriorated.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of EPI-743 after first dose and at steady state</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning of the study (baseline) and after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Serial blood samples (4-8 samples, 1.5 mL)will be drawn after the first dose of 50 mg and after the first dose escalation to 100 mg. Plasma concentrations ofEPI-743 will be analyzed and pharmacokinetic parameters calculated.</description>

          8. Presence of caregiver to ensure study compliance

          9. Abstention from use of all pill-form dietary supplements and non-prescribed
             medications (except as allowed by the investigator)

         10. Abstention from foods or beverages or bars fortified with Coenzyme Q10, vitamin E,

         11. Abstention from use of idebenone

         12. Clinically staged with a Mitochondrial Disease Scale such as the Newcastle Score

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Allergy to EPI-743, vitamin E or sesame oil

          2. Clinical history of bleeding or abnormal PT/PTT (excluding anticoagulation Rx)

          3. Hepatic insufficiency with LFTs greater than two times normal

          4. Renal insufficiency requiring dialysis

          5. Fat malabsorption syndromes precluding drug absorption

          6. Any other concurrent inborn errors of metabolism
