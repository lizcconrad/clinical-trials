    <textblock>
      We grafted the concept of metabolic surgery (long limb Roux-en Y reconstruction) into gastric
      cancer surgery. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of long limb Roux-en
      Y reconstruction after gastrectomy in non-obese type II diabetes with gastric cancer.

      Type II diabetes in the world is increasing rapidly, and it is known that patients with type
      II diabetes with morbid obesity that underwent bariatric surgery have resolution of impaired
      glucose metabolism.

      In Asia, most type II diabetes are not morbidly obese and still, it is controversy whether
      metabolic surgery is effective or not in non-morbid obese patients. As life expectancy is
      increased, the number of patients with gastric cancer and T2DM is increased as well.

      Recently, we studied the outcome of T2DM after gastrectomy and conventional reconstruction in
      non-obese gastric cancer patients.(Kim JW et al, World J Gastroenterol 2012;18:49) The study
      was a large-series retrospective study including about 400 patients and the result regarding
      DM improvement was not satisfactory. Based on our previous results, it is needed to find more
      effective way to resolve the type II diabetes in gastrectomized patients with gastric cancer.

    <description>For the evaluation of safety, morbidity were analyzed. For the evaluation of short-term safety, complications higher than the Clavien-Dindo grade II (Dindo et. Ann Surg 240:205 2004) were collected.
*Clavien-dindo classification of surgical complications Grade II: Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications. Blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition are also included.
Grade III: Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention Grade IV:Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications)‡ requiring IC/ICU-management Grade V:Death of a patient Suffix'd' : If the patient suffers from a complication at the time of discharge ,the suffix &quot;d&quot; (for 'disability') is added to the respective grade of complication. This label indicates the need for a follow-up to fully evaluate the complication.
For the evaluation of long-term safety, the patients were evaluated every month after discharge.</description>

    <description>After radical gastrectomy, the gastrointestinal tract was reconstructed by Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy or esophagojejunostomy. The jejunum was divided at approximately 100-120 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and the distal limb of the jejunum was then anastomosed along the proximal gastric greater curvature or esophagus. The jejuno-jejunostomy was performed approximately 100 to 120 cm distal from the gastrojejunal or esophagojejunal anastomosis</description>

        <description>Matsuda Index(Insulin Sensitivity Index) was measured.
The Matsuda index was obtained using the following formula:
Matsuda index = 10000/square root of [(fasting glucose × fasting insulin) × (mean glucose × mean insulin during OGTT)]</description>
        <time_frame>Before operation , 6 months after operation, Until end of study (on average 14.8 months)</time_frame>
        <population>Fifteen patients were enrolled for this study. During the follow-up period, there was one patient, who had poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma which is one of most aggressive gastric cancer, and died due to recurrence four months after surgery. The patient who died of recurrence was excluded from the efficacy evaluation.</population>

            <description>Long limb Roux-en Y reconstruction means that the length of Roux limb and biliopancreatic limb are longer than conventional reconstruction method after gastrectomy. Briefly, the gastrointestinal tract was reconstructed by Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy or esophagojejunostomy after radical gastrectomy. The jejunum was divided at approximately 100-120 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and the distal limb of the jejunum was then anastomosed along the proximal gastric greater curvature or esophagus. The jejuno-jejunostomy was performed approximately 100 to 120 cm distal from the gastrojejunal or esophagojejunal anastomosis.</description>

*Clavien-dindo classification of surgical complications Grade II: Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications. Blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition are also included.
Grade III: Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention Grade IV:Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications)‡ requiring IC/ICU-management Grade V:Death of a patient Suffix'd' : If the patient suffers from a complication at the time of discharge ,the suffix “d” (for ‘disability’) is added to the respective grade of complication.

            <description>Long limb Roux-en Y reconstruction means that the length of Roux limb and biliopancreatic limb are longer than conventional reconstruction method after gastrectomy. Briefly, the gastrointestinal tract was reconstructed by Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy or esophagojejunostomy after radical gastrectomy. The jejunum was divided at approximately 100-120 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and the distal limb of the jejunum was then anastomosed along the proximal gastric greater curvature or esophagus. The jejuno-jejunostomy was performed approximately 100 to 120 cm distal from the gastrojejunal or esophagojejunal anastomosis.</description>

        <title>HOMA-B : Good Response Group</title>
        <description>At the end of the study, the follow-up duration was 12.5 ± 5.5 months (6.0 – 21.7 months). Some patients showed normal FPG level and HbA1c &lt; 6% without any antidiabetic medications. We called this group as &quot;good response group&quot;. We analyzed the change of beta-cell function after operation in good response group. HOMA-B(Homoeostasis model assessment-derived beta-cell function) was measured.
HOMA-B was obtained using the following formula:

Normal FPG level and HbA1c &lt; 6% without any antidiabetic medications were observed in 11 patients (78.6 %). We analyzed the change of albumin level after operation for the evaluation of long-term safety in good responder group.</population>
