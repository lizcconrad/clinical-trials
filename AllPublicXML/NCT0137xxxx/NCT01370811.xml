  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OC (oxybutynin and clonidine) oral solution
      is effective in reducing saliva secretion in patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease with
      excessive salivation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sialorrhea is excessive flow of saliva associated with its unintentional loss from the mouth,
      commonly known as drooling. Sialorrhea may result from any combination of hypersecretion,
      problems swallowing or sensorimotor problems containing saliva in the mouth. It is commonly
      found in people with neurological dysfunction such as Parkinson's Disease, leading to social
      isolation and embarrassment. In general, treatment options are limited because of the
      underlying chronic disease. The objective of the proposed low-dose, new combination drug, OC
      Oral solution is to develop a new treatment option that can be used to titrate saliva
      secretion rates to a level that is low enough to prevent unintentional loss (i.e. drooling)
      but not so low as to cause an uncomfortably dry mouth.
