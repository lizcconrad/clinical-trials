  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this explorative study, targeting subjects with advanced binocular
      glaucomatous visual field loss, is: (i) to identify the perimetric / psychophysical method,
      that is most closely correlated with an individually assessed quality of life (QoL) score,
      using a validated questionnaire (NEI-VFQ 25), (ii) to determine, whether gaze-related
      (exploratory eye movements) or visual field-related (eyes steadily fixating) OR
      attention-related parameters are better for the characterization of the visual capacities
      that are necessary for activities of daily living (ADL), as represented (iia) by a
      standardized visual search task and (iib) by an on-road car driving feasibility study.

      Further this study is intended to introduce and analyse a novel diagnostic method for
      recording and evaluating exploratory eye movements (gaze-related perimetry) in a clinical
      setting. A similar procedure has recently been introduced by Murray et al. However, their
      set-up is based on a video monitor and, therefore, restricted to the central visual field
      (eccentricity &lt; 25°) and limited with regard to the dynamic range of the stimulus luminance.
      Since our new gaze-related perimetry is designed to be implemented in a conventional cupola
      perimeter, it should be widely available as a potent diagnostic tool, for screening purposes,
      or for clinical surveys by general ophthalmologists or clinical research groups.
