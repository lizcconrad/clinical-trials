      This study is a regulatory post-marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients who have received Magnevist at a dose of more
      than 0.2 ml/kg for MR angiography of peripheral vasculature with continuous imaging from the
      abdomen to the lower extremities. The objective of this study is to assess safety, especially
      in relation to renal dysfunction, and efficacy of using Magnevist in clinical practice. A
      total 2,000 patients will be recruited.

        The target population of this study is patients who received Magnevist for MR angiography.
        The study is expected to collect data of 2,000 patients in approximately 150 hospitals in
        Japan.
