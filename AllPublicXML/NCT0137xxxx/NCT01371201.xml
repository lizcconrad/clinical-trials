      The FIRSTMAPPP study is a randomized, double-blind, phase II, international, multicenter
      study which aims to determine the efficacy of Sunitinib on the progression-free survival at
      12 months in subjects with progressive malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treated
      with sunitinib at a starting dose of 37.5 mg daily (continuous dosing).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine the efficacy of Sunitinib on the progression-free survival at 12 months in
      subjects with progressive malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treated with sunitinib
      at a starting dose of 37.5 mg daily (continuous dosing).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine overall survival and progression free survival.

        -  To determine time to progression.

        -  To determine objective response rate at one year.

        -  To determine time to and duration of tumor response.

        -  To assess safety profile including a dedicated cardiovascular management (home-blood
           pressure monitoring, ECG and echocardiography).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      -Identification of predictors of response as well as surrogate markers of overall survival is
      anticipated

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of malignant PPGL, based on imaging or biopsy evidence of metastases in
             liver, bones, lungs and or lymph nodes, combined with at least one of two further
             confirmatory diagnoses: 1. diagnosis of PPGL from histopathological review of resected
             or biopsied tissue performed by a skilled pathologist (centralized review will be
             performed in all cases either before enrolment in case of any doubt or during the
             study); or 2. in patients where tumor tissue is unavailable for formal pathological
             review, from combined biochemical and functional imaging evidence of PPGL (e.g., MIBG
             scintigraphy combined with consistently and highly elevated plasma or urine levels of
             metanephrines).

             underlying malignancy and/or total serum bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN)

          -  Patients with cardiac events within the previous 12 months, such as myocardial

             embolism

          -  Hypertension that cannot be controlled despite medications (&gt;=160/95 mmHg despite

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Previous treatment with the drug under study. Prior systemic treatment with any
