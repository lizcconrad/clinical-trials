      Neuraxial anesthesia affords a less interventional way to desensitization of the lower body
      for surgical procedures. After introduction of neuraxial anesthesia, vasodilatation of body
      part below the anesthetic level is theoretically appeared as the sympathetic nerve efferent
      is blocked. The vasodilatation effect is related to hypotension, hypothermia, shivering and
      the response of volume redistribution. It is believed that vasodilatation leads to better
      regional tissue perfusion and better regional tissue oxygenation. Previous reports of laser
      doppler flowmetry and thermography showed their effectiveness on monitoring blocked level but
      they were not easily available in the operation room. Recently Near-infrared
      spectroscopy(NIRS) demonstrates real-time tissue oxygen saturation(rSO2) which is applied
      generally in non-invasive brain oximeter. We use NIRS in spinal anesthesia to monitor the
      tissue oxygenation change over the upper and lower limbs during the induction of neuraxial
      anesthesia.

      In patients who were planned to receive an operation with intrathecal anesthesia, NIRS (INVOS
      Cerebral Oximeter Model 5100B; Somanetics, Troy, MI, USA) with two adhesive patches was used
      to monitor rSO2. One patch was applied over the biceps brachii muscle,(the body part above
      the anaesthetic level), and the other patch was applied over the medial side of the
      gastrocnemius muscle of the non-surgical leg,(the body part below the anaesthetic level). In
      both extremities, rSO2 was monitored continuously and recorded every minute from before
      intrathecal bupivacaine injection until 15 min after injection. Isobaric bupivacaine 0.5%
      10-15 mg was injected intrathecally and the level of anaesthesia was examined 10 min later by
      loss of cold sensation to alcohol swab by an anaesthetist not involved in the study. the
      changes of rSO2 of upper and lower extrimities were recorded and analysed.
