      1. Hypothesis

           If patients who are sutured with non-absorbable sutures in the Emergency Department (ED)
           are provided with the proper equipment and knowledge on how to remove their own sutures,
           they will be willing and capable of removing their own sutures.

        2. Primary and Secondary Questions

      Primary Question What number of patients in the study group will successfully remove their
      own sutures if they are provided with the equipment and information on how to do so compared
      with a control group who are treated and advised in the usual fashion? (follow up with family
      doctor or local medical clinic for suture removal)

      Secondary Questions

        1. Number of complications related to self removal of sutures as compared to traditional
           treatment. Complications measured were wound infections, dehiscence and prolonged
           bleeding (&gt;30 min)

        2. Number of physician visits related to self removal of sutures as compared to traditional
           treatment.

        3. Patient satisfaction and comfort level related to self removal of sutures as compared
           with traditional treatment.

      Introduction/Background:

      Patients who are sutured with non-absorbable sutures in the Emergency Department are asked to
      follow up with their family doctor or local medical clinic for suture removal. Suture
      removal, especially for simple lacerations is easy to do. Given the proper instructions and
      equipment suture removal could be done by the patient or a family member.

      Objectives:

      Are patients willing and capable of removing their own non-absorbable sutures? How many
      patients can successfully self remove their own sutures if given the proper equipment and
      instructions as compared with patients who are not given equipment and instructions? Would
      patient self removal result in less physician visits related to sutured wounds? What would be
      the complication rate for self removal of sutures be? Specific complications were wound
      infection, dehiscence and prolonged bleeding? Would patients be satisfied and comfortable in
      taking out their own sutures?

      Methods:

      Patients who are sutured with non absorbable sutures in the emergency department will be
      randomly enrolled into either of two groups. One group will receive wound care instructions
      alone. The second group will be given wound care instructions, a suture removal kit and
      instructions regarding self-removal to take home. Both groups will be contacted by telephone
      14 days after suturing and asked questions concerning who removed their sutures, number of
      physician visits, time loss from work related to suture removal and complications related to
      sutures or suture removal. Questions regarding patient satisfaction with respect to self
      removal of sutures will also be asked.
