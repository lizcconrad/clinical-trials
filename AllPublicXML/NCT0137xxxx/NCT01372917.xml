  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective multi-centered cohort study designed to determine the safety and
      efficacy of AlloMax in immediate expander-based breast reconstruction. Specifically, the
      study is designed to determine if sterility of human acellular dermal matrix results in a
      lower incidence of infection and seroma. The study will determine if gamma radiation, as a
      method of terminally sterilizing human acellular dermal matrix, has a negative impact on
      graft incorporation into the host tissue.
