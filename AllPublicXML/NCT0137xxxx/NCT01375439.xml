    <textblock>
      Introduction: Preterm labor (PTL) is an important obstetric intercurrence that affects 5 to
      10% of pregnancies. Among the known factors of PTL etiology are PTL occurrence in previous
      pregnancies, multiple pregnancies, polyhydramnios, vaginal bleeding during pregnancy,
      premature membrane rupture (PMR) and bacterial vaginosis. Despite the advancement achieved in
      Neonatology, morbidity and mortality resulting from high rates of preterm births have
      remained constant in the last few decades. Objective: This study aims at evaluating maternal
      and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with a history of preterm labor in previous
      pregnancies and submitted to active search for vaginal infection. Material and Method: It is
      a prospective-cohort epidemiological study to be conducted in Botucatu/SP. Two study groups
      (G1 and G2) will be formed, and each of them will comprise 140 pregnant women with a history
      of preterm childbirth. G1 will be related to the active search and etiological diagnosis of
      lower genital tract infections, and G2 will be related to non-search for such infections, for
      which the routine care protocol of primary health units in the city of Botucatu will be
      maintained. Care propedeutics for the pregnant women (G1) will include the performance of
      direct examination of vaginal content stained by the Gram method, culture in Diamonds medium,
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of endocervical secretion collected in the primary health
      care services in the city at two moments: prior to the 20th gestational week (M1) and at the
      36th week (M2). Moment M3 will take place after childbirth for evaluation of the perinatal
      outcome.

    <description>This study starts from the assumption that the active search and etiologic treatment of genital infections can reduce adverse pregnancy outcome and, if confirmed, could subsidize health managers in the implementation of actions aimed at introducing, in the health services of varying degrees of complexity , the etiologic diagnosis of lower genital tract infections. It is known that the costs of such a diagnosis are high and could have prevented the routine examination of patients during prenatal care.</description>

Two groups (G1 and G2) will be part of study, each one composed of 140 pregnant women with a history of premature birth, G1 will have the active search and etiologic diagnosis of lower genital tract infections and G2 do not search of these infections, keeping for this group, the protocol of routine care of basic health units in the city of Botucatu. Workup care of pregnant women (G1) will include the completion of direct examination of vaginal contents stained by Gram's method, culture in the medium of Diamonds and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of endocervical secretions, collected by health services in primary care the municipality in two moments: before 20th pregnancy week (M1) and in 36th pregnancy week (M2). The moment M3 will be after the birth, to evaluate the perinatal outcome.</description>
