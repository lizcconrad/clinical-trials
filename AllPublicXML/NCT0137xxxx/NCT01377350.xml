  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of monitoring hemodynamic changes,
      which result from heart failure exacerbations, by recording the respiratory effort, chest
      wall dynamics and quantifying the development of dyspnea by using miniature mechanical
      sensors that are attaches to the chest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary veins congestion and fine changes in alveolar transudative effusion accumulation
      affect lung mechanics (compliance) and the respiratory effort. Moreover, the associated state
      of oxygen de-saturation is compensated by an increase in the respiratory effort. These
      changes in the respiratory effort are reflected in chest wall dynamics and may provide the
      earliest non-invasive sign for lung congestion and deterioration in the heart failure.

      The research system comprises of patches attached to the patients' thorax that include motion
      sensors (Accelerometers) that measure the chest wall dynamics and the mechanics of lung
      inflation and deflation. The signals are acquired by a miniaturized device that amplifies and
      samples the signals, stores and analyzes the data and displays the trends on the screen.

    <description>50 patients hospitalized due to the decompensated HF are considered for entry. 3 patches will be attached to the patients' thorax that include motion sensors. The system will be attached to the patients at the start of treatment. Patient's signals will be recorded during the entire treatment in the hospital, to the point that there is an improvement in their health condition.</description>
