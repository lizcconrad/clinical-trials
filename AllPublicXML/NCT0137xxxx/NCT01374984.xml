      This is a post-marketing study to verify the clinical benefits of VIGIV [CNJ-016, Vaccinia
      Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), sterile solution] in the resolution of complications
      resulting from smallpox vaccination in eligible patients treated with VIGIV.

      This is an open-label Phase 4 study designed to collect additional data to assess the safety
      and efficacy of VIGIV [CNJ-016, Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), sterile
      solution] in the first 100 consented patients treated with VIGIV.

      A plasma sample for the determination of anti-vaccinia antibody level collected 5 days after
      VIGIV administration and 5 days after VIGIV re-dosing as well (if applicable). Samples
      collected Day 5 Â±3 days will still provide valuable information for assessing anti-vaccinia
      antibody levels in these subjects post-VIGIV administration. While plasma samples are
      preferred, serum samples will also be accepted if available. Failure to obtain a Day 5 sample
      does not preclude retrospective enrollment into the VA-005 study to provide observational
      data only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects treated with VIGIV deployed from the US Strategic National Stockpile for any of
        the following conditions:

          -  Eczema vaccinatum.

          -  Progressive vaccinia.

          -  Severe generalized vaccinia.

          -  Vaccinia infections in individuals who have skin conditions such as burns, impetigo,
             varicella-zoster, or poison ivy, or in individuals who have eczematous skin lesions
             because of either the activity or extensiveness of such lesions.

          -  Aberrant infections induced by vaccinia virus that include its accidental implantation
             in eyes (except in cases of isolated keratitis), mouth, or other areas where vaccinia
             infection would constitute a special hazard.

          -  Informed consent voluntarily signed by subject, legal guardian or representative to
             participate in the study. For minors, the informed consent form must be signed by a
             legally acceptable representative and when appropriate, informed consent/assent must
             also be obtained from the minor.
