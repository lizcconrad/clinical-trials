  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether wireless transmission of invasive arterial
      blood pressure signal (by HMW 10 Wireless System) from patient to patient's bedside monitor
      is feasible, safe and as accurate as conventional cable connection.

    <textblock>
      The technology for invasive arterial blood pressure measurement in emergency room, operating
      theater, recovery room and intensive care unit is well established and uses pressure sensor
      connected via cable to patient's bedside monitor. The wireless sensors result in reduction of
      wires attached to the patient and may enhance nursing, treatment and transportation of
      patients in aforementioned setting.

      The HMW 10 Wireless System was developed and incorporates wireless transmission of patient's
      signal. The purpose of the study was to measure the quality of data transmitted through the
      HMW 10 Wireless System, and to demonstrate that the quality of the data meets the
      requirements of European Directive 93/42/EEC (Medical Device Directive - MDD) and EN/IEC
      60601-1 and EN/IEC 60601-2-34.

    <description>The readings of invasive arterial pressure were obtained from 2 identical pressure transducers, connected to a common arterial line via a Y connector. Data was collected from one transducer via a direct cable connection and from the second transducer via wireless transmission of the signal to the patient's bedside monitor using the HMW 10 Wireless System.
A comparison of data received by patient's bedside monitor from the two transducers was done (standard connection vs. wireless connection), as well as a comparison of data collected by the transmitter and data received by the receiver of the HMW 10 Wireless System.</description>
