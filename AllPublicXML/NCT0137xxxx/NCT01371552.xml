  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare a new daily disposable, silicone hydrogel contact
      lens to marketed daily disposable, silicone hydrogel contact lenses.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study involved bilateral wear of three different types of marketed contact
      lenses. Each type of lens was worn for three consecutive days of daily disposable wear.
      Participants had been previously identified as symptomatic lens wearers or asymptomatic lens
      wearers, based upon their responses to a screening questionnaire. Participants wore each lens
      type for as long as they were comfortable during the day, but lenses were removed before
      sleep. After completion of Part 1, participants began Part 2, which included dispensing of
      the investigational study lens for up to one week of bilateral wear, with a single follow-up
      visit at the end of that period.

    <measure>Mean Value of Comfort During the Day</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: Day 2 at 4 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The participant recorded a number from 0 to 100 in response to the question, &quot;How would you rate the comfort of your lenses over the last hour?&quot; in which 0 = very poor and 100 = excellent. Comfort was assessed at 4 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours, and the responses were averaged.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Overall Comfort Given at End of Wear</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The participant recorded a number from 0 to 100 in response to the question, &quot;How would you rate the overall comfort of these lenses?&quot; in which 0 = very poor and 100 = excellent. The end of wear questionnaire was completed at time of lens removal for that day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Overall Quality of Vision at End of Wear</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The participant recorded a number from 0 to 100 in response to the question, &quot;How would you rate the overall quality of vision while wearing these lenses?&quot; in which 0 = very poor and 100 = excellent. The end of wear questionnaire was completed at time of lens removal for that day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Overall Ease of Handling at End of Wear</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The participant recorded a number from 0 to 100 in response to the question, &quot;How would you rate the overall ease of handling these lenses?&quot; in which 0 = very difficult and 100 = very easy. The end of wear questionnaire was completed at time of lens removal for that day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reporting That Their Eyes Rarely or Never Felt Dry at End of Wear</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The participant circled a number from 0 to 4 in response to the question, &quot;Over the entire day while wearing these contact lenses, how often did your eyes feel dry?&quot; in which 0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = frequently, 4 = constantly. The end of wear questionnaire was completed at time of lens removal for that day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Preferring Study Lens Either Strongly or Slightly (of Those With a Preference) vs. Their Habitual Lenses at End of Wear</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The participant circled a number from 1 to 5 in response to the question, &quot;Overall, which lens do you prefer - the lens you wore today or your regular lenses?&quot; in which 1 = strongly prefer my regular lenses, 2 = prefer my regular lenses, 3 = no preference, 4 = prefer test lens, 5 = strongly prefer test lens. The end of wear questionnaire was completed at time of lens removal for that day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Wettability</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: Day 1 at Dispense, Day 1 at 8 hours, Day 3 at 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Lens wettability was assessed by the investigator during slit-lamp examination and graded on a 0-4 scale in 0.25 steps, where 0 = excellent and 4 = severely reduced.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Responding &quot;Yes&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2: Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The participant responded to 11 subjective, performance-related statements on a questionnaire by circling 1 = yes, 2 = no, or 3 = don't know.</description>
