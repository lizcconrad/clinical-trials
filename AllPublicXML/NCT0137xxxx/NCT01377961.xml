  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a growing social health problem world-wide, in particular
      with respect to its contribution to cardiovascular disease. The progressive increase in
      prevalence of DM2 has reached epidemic proportion and is a major cause of morbidity and
      mortality in all populations around the world. Conventional stepwise treatment of DM2
      generally focuses on controlling blood glucose concentration. However, the risk for
      side-effects associated with the use of pharmacological intervention often delays initiation
      of therapy, with the potential implication on worsening morbidity and mortality from
      complications. On the other hand, non-pharmacological intervention in the form of dietary
      restrictions, exercise and weight loss, is safe but often difficult to accomplish. The
      availability of nutrients that affect glucose and lipid metabolism would provide an important
      practical tool to establish early intervention in newly diagnosed DM2 and perhaps even in
      patients who are only &quot;at risk&quot; for DM2. The investigators have recently obtained preliminary
      data on beneficial effects of combined supplementation of lycopene and isoflavones on glucose
      metabolism of normoglycemic volunteers with insulin resistance. This clinical trial will
      explore the role of isoflavones and lycopene dietary supplementation in the improvement of
      glucose metabolism of patients at increased risk or with established but mild DM2. The
      overall hypothesis is that supplementation of laflavon, provided as a new formulation that
      increases bioavailability of the individual components (Laflavon CamMedica contains 7 mg of
      Lycopene and 50 mg of Soy Isoflavones), determines improvement in glucose tolerance and
      insulin resistance of patients with the metabolic syndrome and also reduces HbA1c in patients
      with mild DM2.

    <description>After the screening and OGTT, the treatment group each subject will be in is decided by randomization. Neither subject nor the researchers will be allowed to choose which group a subject is assigned to. A single patient/subject cannot be assigned more than 1 allocation number. Each subject will be assigned randomly (like drawing straws) to receive either on the pills containing the combination of 6mg lycopene and 50mg isoflavones or placebo. Each subject has a 1 in 2 chance of receiving one of these treatments.
The subject are advised to take one capsule of Laflavon/Placebo by mouth daily for 12 weeks.</description>
