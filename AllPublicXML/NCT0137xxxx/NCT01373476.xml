      Objectives of study: To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and safety of Qideng Mingmu
      Capsule in the treatment of patients with diabetic retinopathy (deficiency of Qi-Yin
      syndrome, blood stasis syndrome), to discuss the appropriate dose and period of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of Qideng Mingmu capsule is to nourish qi-yin and promote blood circulation. It
      is used in patients with diabetic retinopathy who are differentiated as deficiency of Qi-Yin
      syndrome and blood stasis syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine(TCM).The manifestation of
      diabetic retinopathy(DR) mainly includes dim and dry eyes,shortness of breathe, fundus
      hemorrhage,etc.The experimental research indicated that the Qideng Mingmu capsule could
      improve the GK rats' quality of life,through reducing vascular endothelial growth
      factor(VEGF) level in vitreous of GK rats and inhibiting the expression of protein kinase
      C(PKC),therefore is capillary protective agent against retinal impairment in GK rat.The
      toxicology test has proved that the clinical dosage of Qideng Mingmu capsule is safe.Both
      acute and long-term toxicity tests has showed no toxicity.
