      This study involves a single dose of 18 mg LY2216684 taken as 1 or 2 tablets by mouth. The
      study will evaluate effect of LY2216684 on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive
      Ortho CyclenÂ®. This study will run approximately 93 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are overtly healthy females, as determined by medical history and physical examination

          -  As it is possible that LY2216684 may cause the oral contraceptive (OC) tablet to be
             less effective than usual, subjects will be required in addition to use double barrier
             methods of contraception from the Screening until 2 months after the post study
             follow-up. Additional barrier methods of contraception may include the following: a
             non-hormonal intrauterine device with spermicide; female condom with spermicide;
             contraceptive sponge with spermicide; diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap with
             spermicide; a male sexual partner who agrees to use a male condom with spermicide; a
             sterile sexual partner; or abstinence (subjects reporting abstinence who become
             sexually active while on the study must agree to use other additional barrier methods
             of contraception). The pregnancy test result must be negative at Screening and at each
             Check-in

          -  Have a body weight of &gt;50 kg

          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population
             or investigator site, or results with acceptable deviations that are judged to be not
             clinically significant by the investigator

          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling as per the protocol

          -  Have normal blood pressure and pulse rate (sitting position) as determined by the
             investigator

          -  Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study
             and are willing to follow study procedures

             board (IRB) governing the site

             from, a clinical trial involving an investigational product other than the
             investigational product used in this study, or are concurrently enrolled in any other
             type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with
             this study

          -  Have known allergies to Ortho Cyclen, LY2216684, or related compounds

          -  Are persons who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other
             study investigating LY2216684 within 6 months prior to Screening

          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study

             gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, or neurological disorders capable of

             constituting a risk when taking the study medication; or of interfering with the
             interpretation of data

          -  Have a history or show evidence of significant active neuropsychiatric disease or have
