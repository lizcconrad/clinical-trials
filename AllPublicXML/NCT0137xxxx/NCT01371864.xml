      Purpose:

      -To evaluate the peri-operative communication between families and the pediatric cardiac
      surgery team.

      Method:

      -In this study the investigators plan to utilize structured interview and survey of
      parents/legal guardians and health care providers of children undergoing cardiac surgery in
      the United States of America.

      Every day clinicians face challenges when attempting to negotiate their way through dialogues
      with families whose children require surgical intervention in the near future. The area of
      clinician-patient communication with pediatric families is under-researched and highlights a
      pressing clinical problem. There are several adult studies that describe the content and
      nature of patient-physician communications at the time of cardiac surgery. However, there are
      no studies that evaluate the communications between nursing, physicians, and pediatric
      patient's families at the time of cardiac surgery. Further knowledge in this area is valuable
      in that a disparity between the these groups can lead to medical error, damage the
      clinician-patient relationship and provide grounds for dissatisfaction, complaints, or claim.
      This research will provide insight into what patient's families value in their communications
      with the medical team and assist the medical community in better meeting our children's
      families needs.

        The study population will be selected from a tertiary care academic children's hospital
        including:

          -  Inpatient population within the pediatric critical care unit, neonatal critical care
             unit, and the cardiac intermediate care unit.

          -  Outpatient population including the pediatric cardiothoracic surgery clinic patients.

          -  Hospital personnel

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary language is English

          -  &gt; 18 years age

          -  Nurse, physician, physician assistant, or parent / legal guardian of a pediatric
             patient who requires cardiothoracic surgery at the North Carolina Children's Hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary language is not English. The interviewers all speak English as their primary
             language. People whose primary language is other than English will only be excluded if
             they do not have the ability to converse in English with the interviewers.

          -  &lt;18 years of age. The parent / legal guardian must be of age to be the primary
             caregiver able to make decisions for their child.

          -  People with an intellectual or mental impairment that prohibits their capacity to make
             medical decisions for their child. Our research aims to investigate the relationship
             between the parent / legal guardians of pediatric cardiac surgery patients who
             interact with the pediatric cardiac surgery multidisciplinary team. These individuals
             must have sufficient mental capacity to be able to provide consent for their child to
             undergo surgery. Individuals with intellectual or mental impairment that prohibits
             their ability to give consent are therefore excluded.
