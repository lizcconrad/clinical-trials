  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombotic event is one of the most serious complications of coronary artery disease, which
      often result in myocardial infarction and even death. Even according to the standard
      guidelines for antiplatelet therapy, there are still 6% to 15% of patients occur thrombotic
      events, in high-risk patients, the proportion is higher, this phenomenon is called
      anti-platelet drug resistance in clinical practice

      The aim of this multicenter prospective, randomized, controlled study is to observed
      policosanol on aspirin or clopidogrel resistance in patients with platelet aggregation after
      Percutaneous Coronary Stent Implantation (PCI) and occurrence of platelet aggregation and
      short-term prognosis to find new ways to the prevention of platelet aggregation .
