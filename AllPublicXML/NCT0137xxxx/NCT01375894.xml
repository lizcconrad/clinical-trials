      The ability to understand the other's perspective and respond accordingly is the most
      important normal process of daily social life and is probably one of the foundations of human
      existence. This capability is reflected, inter alia, as an imitation - an important and
      effective form of learning which is very developed in humans. When we are required to imitate
      a particular movement, speed of response depends on the perspective of the movement.
      Imitative response is implemented faster when the movement is observed from first-person
      perspective, than if the motion is presented from the perspective of a third party.

      While healthy individuals don't find it difficult to imitate, or to understand the other's
      emotion expression, there are psychiatric populations (such as autism and schizophrenia) who
      find it difficult to demonstrate these capabilities (Park, Matthews et al. 2008). Beyond
      these capabilities impairment, schizophrenic patients have difficulty distinguishing between
      their arm movements and those of a foreign hand and find it difficult to leave the boundaries
      of egocentric interpretation of reality and adopt the other's point of view. These behavioral
      disorders arise from defects in the network of mirror neurons (Buccino and Amore 2008;
      Langdon, Coltheart et al. 2010).

      Therefore, the investigator expect that schizophrenic patients will not see a preference for
      movements that will be displayed in first-person perspective from the same movements that
      will be displayed from the perspective of a third party. Consequently, the investigator
      speculate that these subjects will not exhibit differences at imitating the response of which
      will be presented from different perspectives (Jackson, Meltzoff et (al. 2006.
