      The purpose of this study is to determine if engraftment can be achieved safely in patients
      with high-risk hematologic malignancies who undergo non-myeloablative transplant with
      peripheral stem cells from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haploidentical donors with pre and
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide as immunosuppression.

    <textblock>
      It is important to extend the option of nonmyeloablative, hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) for potential therapy of hematologic malignancies to patients who do
      not have an HLA-matched donor. Almost all patients would have a related donor identical for
      one HLA haplotype (haploidentical) and mismatched at HLA-A, B or DR of the unshared
      haplotype. Thus far, nonmyeloablative HSCT from HLA-mismatched donors has been associated
      with a high rate of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In this protocol, we
      will use a combination of immunosuppressive agents including cyclophosphamide administered
      before and after HSCT to facilitate engraftment and to delete highly alloreactive T-cell
      clones presumably involved in GVHD.
