  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dose of fulvestrant to optimally downregulate estrogen receptors (ER) is currently
      subject of debate. Effects of fulvestrant on the ERs may be evaluable by molecular imaging
      using positron emission tomography with the ER-specific FES tracer. In this pilot study we
      will evaluate the effects of the new dose of fulvestrant (500mg i.m.)on the availability of
      ER binding sites in 15 metastatic breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The estrogen receptor (ER) is expressed in approximately 70% of the breast carcinomas. In
      these patients signaling via the ER induces proliferation and cell survival of malignant
      cells. Fulvestrant can inhibit this signaling route by blocking the receptor and decreasing
      ER-expression by increasing its turn-over rate.

      The historical standard dose of fulvestrant was 250mg every 28 days i.m.; however studies
      performing serial biopsies showed that ER-downregulation was suboptimal. Recently the
      standard dose has been set to 500mg i.m. on day 1; 14; 28 and every 28 days thereafter.
      Although slightly more effective than the 250mg dose, still questions remain with respect to
      the required dose to establish maximal downregulation of ER-signaling.

      Immunohistochemistry only provides static information, i.e. the level of ER-expression.
      However, dynamic information evaluating the effects of fulvestrant on occupancy of ERs, may
      also be valuable.

      Whole-body imaging of the availability of ER binding sites using FES-PET may prove valuable
      to evaluate the effects of fulvestrant on the ER non-invasively in individual patients. This
      potentially allows adjustment of dosing in individual patients to aid therapy efficacy.

      In this pilot-study we will evaluate 15 metastatic breast cancer patients. All patients will
      undergo FES-PET/CT at baseline, FES-PET after 1 month, and FES-PET/CT after three months.
      Hormone- and fulvestrant levels will be measured in all patients. Whenever possible, tumor
      biopsies will be performed to correlate to FES-PET results.

    <description>FES-uptake will be calculated for all tumor lesions at baseline, after 1 month and after 3 months.
Incomplete down-regulation/ occupancy of ERs is defined as 1) an absolute SUV&gt; 1.5, and 2) a relative decrease in SUV of &lt;75% during fulvestrant therapy.
