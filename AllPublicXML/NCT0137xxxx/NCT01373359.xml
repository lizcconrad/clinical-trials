  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sublingual misoprostol produces rapid peak concentration and is more effective than oral
      misoprostol for prevention of excessive postpartum bleeding. The study hypothesis was to test
      whether women receiving sublingual misoprostol for prevention of postpartum hemorrhage have
      30 ml less average blood loss than women receiving oxytocin, the standard of care for
      prevention of postpartum hemorrhage. We conducted a Double blind randomized controlled trial
      of .652 consenting, eligible pregnant women admitted to the labor room of the teaching
      hospital at J N Medical College, Belgaum, India. Women participating in the study were
      assigned by computer generated randomization to receive the study medications and placebos
      within one minute after clamping and cutting the umbilical cord. We also looked at the drugs
      effects on postpartum blood loss at or above ≥500 ml (considered hemorrhage), and the percent
      of women experiencing more than a 10% decline in haemoglobin, and reported drug side effects.

    <description>Blood loss was objectively measured using the BRASSS-V DrapeTM, placed under the buttock before the delivery. The calibrated blood collection receptacle was opened after the delivery and drainage of amniotic fluid. Blood collected in the drape was transferred to measuring jar with 10 ml calibrations for accuracy. Blood soaked swabs were weighed in grams, and the known dry weight of the swabs was subtracted; this volume was added to the drape's measured blood volume (assuming 1 gm equivalence with 1 ml).</description>
