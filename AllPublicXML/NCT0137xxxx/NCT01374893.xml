      Background The Activity in GEriatric acute CARe (AGECAR) is a randomized control trial to
      assess the effectiveness of an intrahospital strength and walk program during short hospital
      stays for improving functional capacity of patients aged 75 years or older.

      Methods Patients aged 75 years or older admitted for a short hospital stay (≤14 days) will be
      randomly assigned to either a usual care (control) group or an intervention (training) group.
      Participants allocated in the usual care group will receive normal hospital care and
      participants allocated in the intervention group will perform multiple sessions per day of
      lower limb strength training (standing from a seated position) and walking (10 min bouts)
      while hospitalized. The Primary outcome to be assessed pre and post of the hospital stay will
      be functional capacity, using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and time to walk
      10 meters. Besides length of hospitalization, the secondary outcomes that will also be
      assessed at hospital admission and discharge will be pulmonary ventilation (forced expiratory
      volume in one second, FEV1) and peripheral oxygen saturation. The secondary outcomes that
      will be assessed by telephone interview three months after discharge will be mortality,
      number of falls since discharge, and ability to cope with activities of daily living (ADLs,
      using the Katz ADL score and Barthel ADL index).

      Results Results will help to better understand the potential of regular physical activity
      during a short hospital stay for improving functional capacity in old patients.

      Conclusions The increase in life expectancy has resulted in a large segment of the population
      being over 75 years of age and an increase in hospitalization of this same age group. This
      calls attention to health care systems and public health policymakers to focus on promoting
      methods to improve functional capacity of this population.
