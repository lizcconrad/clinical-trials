      The primary objective of the study is the descriptive analysis of incidence &amp; severity of
      side effects &amp; reasons for discontinuation of the treatment of chronic pain with transdermal
      analgesic Buprenorphine patches.

    <textblock>
      750 patients that are treated with transdermal Buprenorphine patches for chronic pain will be
      included in the study. About 20% of patients are aimed to be patch-naive, ie have received
      their first prescription of transdermal analgesic patches within 1 month before inclusion in
      this observational study. Furthermore the study should not include more than 25% of cancer
      patients that are treated for chronic pain in order to ensure an appropriate mix of patient
      population.
