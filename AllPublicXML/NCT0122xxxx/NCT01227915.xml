      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate, through clinical parameters, the
      comparative efficacy between topical Tobracort ® (tobramycin 0.3% dexamethasone + 1% -
      Chemistry Lab Union) and TOBRADEX ® (tobramycin 0.3% dexamethasone + 1 % - Alcon Lab), using
      the percentage of improvement (sustained response rate) at the end of treatment.

      -  Evaluation of signs and symptoms during treatment, with a record of individual scores
           for each parameter;

        -  Observation and statistical comparison of drug safety, by recording qualitative and
           quantitative parameters related to adverse effects occurring during treatment.
