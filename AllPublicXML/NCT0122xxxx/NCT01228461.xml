  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most prevalent symptoms endorsed by cancer survivors, particularly
      those treated for breast cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma. Despite the tremendous implications such
      work has for effective interventions, little is known about the underlying pathophysiology of
      fatigue, association with medical co-morbidities and factors that may help predict those to
      be at highest risk.

      The proposed research will utilize Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center REACH for Survivorship
      Program together with the investigators Hematologic Malignancies Program. In adolescent and
      young adults (AYA), ages 18 - 39 the investigators will address the following:

      Primary Aims Aim 1: Assess the prevalence and severity of fatigue and its impact on
      functional outcomes Aim 2: Determine host, disease and treatment-related risk factors for
      fatigue

      Secondary Aims Aim 1: Evaluate the association between levels of proinflammatory cytokine
      activity and fatigue Aim 2: Evaluate the association between fatigue and self reported
      fatigue in AYA Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Fatigue is more prevalent and severe among AYA HL patients and survivors, compared to
           general population and will be associated with impaired functional outcome.

        2. Risk factors for fatigue include higher disease stage, B symptoms and elevated
           erythrocyte sedimentation rate at diagnosis, dose density of chemotherapy and higher
           doses and more expanded fields of radiotherapy.

        3. Risk of fatigue is associated with long-term cardiopulmonary and endocrine
           complications.

        4. Levels of specified proinflammatory cytokines are associated with increased fatigue.
