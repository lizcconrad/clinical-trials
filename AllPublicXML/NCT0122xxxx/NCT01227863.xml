      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate, through clinical parameters, the
      effectiveness of your medicine topic Maxinom ® (dexamethasone, neomycin and polymyxin B -
      Union Chemicals), comparing it to the topical medication Maxitrol ® (dexamethasone, neomycin
      and polymyxin B - Alcon ) by the percentage of improvement (sustained response rate) at the
      end of treatment, among the products studied.

      1. Evaluation of isolated signs and symptoms during treatment, with a record of individual
           scores for each parameter and observation

        2. Statistical comparison of drug safety, by recording qualitative and quantitative
           parameters related to adverse effects occurring during treatment.
