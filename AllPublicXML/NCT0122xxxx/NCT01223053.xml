  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transdel Pharmaceuticals is investigating a topical cream formulation consisting of 10%
      ketoprofen for the local treatment of pain associated with mild to moderate acute soft tissue
      injury in this confirmatory Phase 3 trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study examines the use of TDLP-110 (a.k.a. Ketotransdel® or ketoprofen 10%
      cream), as a topical treatment for pain associated with mild to moderate acute soft tissue
      injury of the upper and lower extremities to serve as a confirmatory trial. The first
      completed Phase 3 study showed efficacy and safety of TDLP-110 compared to placebo in
      improving the patient assessment of pain.
