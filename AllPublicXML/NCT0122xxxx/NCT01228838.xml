      This study is a 12-week multicenter randomized, double-blind, controlled evaluation of the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of NGX-1998 for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia
      (PHN). Eligible subjects will have pain from PHN, with average numeric pain rating scale
      (NPRS) scores during screening of 4 to 9 (inclusive). Painful areas of up to 1500 cm2 will be
      treated during a single Test Article application. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive NGX-1998 (10% or 20% w/w) or placebo according to an unequal allocation scheme of
      2:2:1. Subjects will also be stratified by gender.

          -  Diagnosis of PHN with at least six (6) months of pain since shingles vesicle crusting.

          -  Average NPRS scores for PHN-associated pain during Days -14 to -4 of 4 to 9,
             inclusive.

          -  Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated.

          -  If taking chronic pain medications, be on a stable (not PRN) regimen for at least 21
             days prior to Test Article Application Visit and willing to maintain medications at
             same stable dose(s) and schedule throughout the study.

          -  Female subjects with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum beta human

             discomfort.
