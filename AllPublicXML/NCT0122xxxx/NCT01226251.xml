  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the ability of a first prototype (strip) of a new chair side test to
      detect oral malodour. The strip is based on a new enzymatic reaction able to detect amines in
      saliva. Previous studies already showed significant correlations between oral malodor and the
      levels of amines in saliva. The limitation in their use as markers of oral malodour is the
      fact that the detection is usually carried out by complex techniques (High Performance Liquid
      Chromatography(HPLC)and Solid-Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
      (SPME-GC/MS)). The results of the new enzymatic reaction can be evaluated by means of a
      colorimetric scale without necessity of extra apparatus.

      The study will be carried out with volunteers recruited at a multidisciplinary consultation
      for bad breath, organized at the University Hospital Leuven, Belgium.

      The paper strip will be used before the routine evaluation (organoleptic score (OS), the gold
      standard method for the diagnosis of halitosis and the level of volatile sulphur compounds
      (VSC), the most used adjunct tool to diagnose halitosis).

      The results of the new chair side test (strip) will be correlated with the OS and VSC
      measurements (OralChroma™, Halimeter®). The sensitivity, specificity and positive and
      negative predicted values of the new chair side test will be calculated. The cut-off values
      for a yes/no test will be determined. The meaning of color scores will be analyzed to assign
      a meaningful outcome to each score with relation to odor intensity.

    <measure>Organoleptic evaluation (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once (during the first consult to the clinic)</time_frame>
    <description>The OS will be determined by a trained and calibrated judge as described in the literature. Briefly, patients will be asked to count from one to eleven and the judge rated the exhaled air on a 0 to 5 score ( 0 represents absence of odour, 1 is given for barely noticeable odour, 2 for slight malodor, 3 for moderate malodor, 4 for strong malodor and 5 for severe malodor). The judge will also evaluate nasal breath in order to exclude extra-oral causes of halitosis and the odor of a sample of the tongue coating, if present.</description>

    <description>The global concentration of sulphur containing compounds will be measured using a portable breath analyzer (Halimeter®, Interscan cooperation, Chatsworth, US. The maximum level attained (ppb) is determined by direct readings from the analog scale of the monitor.</description>

    <description>Hydrogen sulphide, methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulphide will be measured using a commercially available system (OralChroma™, Abilit Corporation; Osaka City, Japan). This portable gas chromatograph is equipped with an indium oxide semiconductor gas sensor. The concentration values (ppbv) of the three gases will be recorded.</description>
