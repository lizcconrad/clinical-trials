    <textblock>
      Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disorder of respiratory control
      characterized by ventilatory impairment that results in arterial hypoxemia. Although patients
      typically present this disease as newborns and rarely in later infancy, there have been
      reports of patients presenting with CCHS in adulthood.

      The present study reports a unique familial case in which the father (proband) presented
      late-onset CCHS with an expansion mutation of the Phox2B gene that was confirmed by genetic
      analysis. Surprisingly, the proband did not report any manifestation of the disease during
      childhood, and the disease progressed following an insidious course until adulthood. At the
      time of diagnosis, he did not present signs of pulmonary hypertension and right-side heart
      failure. The patient responded well to nocturnal invasive ventilation. In contrast, his son
      presented CCHS as a newborn with the full complement of symptoms while his daughter did not.

      The present report shows that CCHS cases characterized by a mutated Phox2 gene can progress
      without many symptoms and that the treatment approach used here was efficient for controlling
      the course of the disease. Furthermore, this case indicates that incomplete penetrance can
      occur. Genetic screening of family members is mandatory to evaluate the reproductive risk of
      the disease, especially because asymptomatic mutation carriers may be at high risk to develop
      the disease and transmit it to the next generation.

      Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disorder of respiratory control
      characterized by ventilatory impairment that results in arterial hypoxemia. This condition
      worse during sleep and occurs in patients with normal mechanical properties of the lung. It
      is diagnosed in the absence of primary neuromuscular disease, identifiable brainstem lesions,
      and other sleep disturbances or substance use.

      Amiel et al. (2003) identified a mutation in the Phox2B gene associated with CCHS,
      characterized by 5 to 9 alanine expansions within a 20-residue polyalanine region in exon 3
      of the Phox2B gene. Several reports confirmed the findings of Amiel et al., supporting the
      view that this gene is a master switch for the development of the autonomic nervous system
      network linked to respiratory control. Transgenic animals carrying the human Phox2B mutation
      develop a similar phenotype and lack glutamatergic neurons located in the parafacial region
      in the brainstem, which are involved in breathing control.

      Although patients typically present with CCHS as newborns and rarely in later infancy, there
      have been reports of patients presenting with CCHS in adulthood. In cases of late-onset CCHS,
      most patients report having had some symptoms since childhood, and they have parents with a
      history of CCHS. Symptoms of right-side heart failure are generally observed at the time of
      diagnosis, and nocturnal noninvasive ventilation is frequently indicated.

      The present study reports a unique familial case of CCHS in which the father (proband)
      presented late-onset CCHS linked to a Phox2B gene expansion mutation. The presentation,
      course of development and treatment response for this patient was unique His son presented
      CCHS as a newborn, while his daughter did not.

    <description>Overnight supervised polysomnography (Embla System®) was performed in a sleep laboratory, which included capnometry. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed by radial arterial puncture. Ventilatory response to progressive hypercapnia was measured using the Read breathing technique. Briefly, subjects rebreathed into an air tight 5-L bag containing a mixture of 8% carbon dioxide (CO2) and 40% oxygen (O2). The spirometer technology used to monitor ventilation was based on a bi-directional rotating vane principle (flow sensitive). A continuous record of CO2 concentration in the expired gas was obtained by a CO2 analyzer within the circuit. The ventilatory hypercapnic drive was calculated from the slope produced by changes in ventilation (L. min-1) and changes in end-tidal PCO2.</description>
