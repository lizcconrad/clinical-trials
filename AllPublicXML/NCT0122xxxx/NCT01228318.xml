    <textblock>
      With the increasing age of people living with HIV/AIDS, age-induced osteoporosis is likely to
      be compounded by HIV/AIDS and HAART-associated bone loss. Mechanistically, osteoclasts the
      cells responsible for bone resorption form under the influence of the key osteoclastogenic
      cytokine Receptor- Activator of NF-KB (RANKL). The osteoclastogenic and proresorptive
      activities of RANKL are moderated by its physiological decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG).
      Imbalance in the ratio of RANKL to OPG alters osteoclastic bone resorption and lead to
      osteoporosis. Activated T- and B-cells are a major source of RANKL, while normal
      physiological B-cells are a major source of OPG. T-cells regulate the production of OPG by
      B-cells. Thus changes in the immune system induced by HIV/AIDS and/or by HAART could affect
      B-cell and T-cells RANKL and OPG production. Indeed, data from our group shows that in an
      animal model of HIV/AIDS, the HIV-1 Transgenic rat, the development of osteoporosis is
      recapitulated as observed in HIV-infected patients, and B-cell OPG and RANKL production are
      concurrently down regulated and upregulated respectively. Furthermore, preliminary data in
      HIV-infected subjects suggests dramatic acute upswing in bone resorption following HAART
      initiation that peaks at 12 weeks and then declines. Based on these findings, the
      investigators hypothesize HAART associated bone loss is driven by immune reconstitution.
      Because this effect of HAART is dramatic in magnitude but short in duration, the
      investigators propose to apply antiresorptive agent (zoledronic acid, reclast®) to
      specifically spare patients from this dramatic but acute bone damage.

      In a prospective, blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial, treatment naïve HIV-infected
      subjects initiating HAART will be assigned to HAART + zoledronic acid or HAART + placebo.
      Serial assessment of serum levels of bone markers, cellular expression of OPG/RANKL and other
      cytokines, cellular immune activation markers, serum bone regulating hormones, and bone
      mineral density (BMD) by DXA scan will be undertaken at pre-defined time points from baseline
      through week 144 of HAART.

      In the primary analysis, changes in serum CTx level, BMD, and cellular OPG/RANKL expression
      from baseline through week 24 will be quantitated and subsequently compared between treatment
      arms. In addition, the impact of zoledronic acid administration on these covariates will be
      assessed at various study time points. The relationship between OPG/RANKL expression, immune
      activation, serum bone regulating hormonal levels, and bone turnover will be evaluated.
