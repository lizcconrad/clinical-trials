      This study will assess pain intensity for the first 72 hrs after aggravated movement (cough)
      following Laparoscopic Inguinal or Umbilical Herniorrhaphy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal herniorrhaphy is a common surgery; approximately 2,800 per million people in the
      United States (US) undergo the procedure annually.Common surgical methods of herniorrhaphy
      include open and laparoscopic placement of synthetic mesh. Studies have shown that the use of
      synthetic mesh greatly reduces the risk of hernia recurrence regardless of the method used
      for its placement. Furthermore, utilizing the laparoscopic approach for umbilical hernia
      repair, specifically with the use of mesh, may also reduce the risk of infection.

      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at the
      surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery.

      This open-label study will assess pain intensity after surgery in patients who receive the
      CollaRx Bupivacaine implant as well as determine the feasibility of the use of the
      laparoscope for sponge placement in laparoscopic hernia repair.
