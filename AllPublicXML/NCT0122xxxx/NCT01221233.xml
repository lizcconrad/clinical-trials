      Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging (US) is a procedure used to evaluate skeletal muscle size
      and function to inform clinical practice. US has been shown to be a reliable and valid tool
      for measuring changes in trunk muscle (i.e. abdominal and back muscle) size and activity
      during sub-maximal contractions in younger populations. Younger adults with low back pain as
      compared with healthy adults without pain demonstrate smaller back muscle size, lower back
      muscle activity, and greater back muscle asymmetry (differences in right side compared with
      left side).

      No trials are published evaluating muscle adaptations using US in response to clinical
      treatments for low back pain in the older adult population. Increased muscle size and
      improved muscle symmetry have been reported in younger adults with low back pain who
      participate in low back stabilization exercises. These exercises use voluntary contractions
      of the back muscles with prolonged hold times and low loads. Neuromuscular Electrical
      Stimulation (NMES) is a treatment modality that increases muscle activity when voluntary
      activity is impaired and increases muscle size. Most studies assessing muscle size and
      activity in response to NMES have been conducted in the knee muscles (i.e. the quadriceps),
      while the impact of NMES on the back muscles remains relatively unexplored. Given the
      potential to evaluate back muscle size and activity with US, this assessment tool may be used
      to document muscle adaptations to a clinical intervention in older adults with low back pain.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a 6-week clinical trial to determine if NMES plus
      lumbar stabilization exercises is superior to lumbar stabilization exercises for improving
      back muscle size, activity, and side-to-side (i.e. right side versus left side) symmetry in
      older adults with chronic low back pain (i.e. low back pain of greater than 3 months). Muscle
      size, activity, and symmetry will be assessed using US before and after the treatments to
      determine if the treatments positively impact muscle. Secondary clinical measures of success
      will include improvements in physical, psychological, and social function pre- to
      post-treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria: This study will use a sample consisting of 36, English-speaking and
        English-reading, older male and female adults (ages 60-85 years) with chronic low back
        pain, i.e. pain of greater than 3 months duration. During the examination, potential
        participants must have 2/4 of the following for inclusion, based on previous work by Hicks
        et al, which outlined clinical predictors of success with a trunk muscle stabilization
        exercise program:

          1. Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) Physical Activity Sub-Scale score ≥9: The
             FABQ is a measure of an individual's beliefs regarding the impact of physical activity
             and work on his/her low back pain. The FABQ is comprised of two sub-scales: physical
             activity and work. Higher FABQ scores have been shown to predict pain and disability
             in individuals with chronic low back pain.

          2. Aberrant Movement: Aberrant movement may be classified as any one of the following:
             (1) an &quot;instability catch&quot;, defined as deviation from the plane of movement during
             flexion or extension; (2) &quot;thigh climbing&quot;, which is defined as using the hands and
             pushing on the thighs to assist in obtaining an upright trunk position; (3) a &quot;painful
             arc of motion&quot;, when flexing or returning to upright from a flexed spinal position; or
             (4) &quot;reversal of the lumbopelvic rhythm&quot;, where the trunk is first extended and then
             the hips and pelvis extend to bring the body upright from a flexed position.

          3. Posterior-to-Anterior Segmental Hypermobility: The participant will lie on his/her
             stomach and the examiner will apply a posterior-to-anterior (back-to-front) force over
             the spinous processes from S1 to T12 (just below the belt-line to the rib cage). The
             available mobility will be graded hypermobile (too much motion), normal, or hypomobile
             (too little motion).

          4. Positive Prone Instability Test: The participant will lie on his/her stomach with the
             legs off the edge of the table and the feet resting on the floor. The examiner will
             apply a posterior-to-anterior pressure at each spinous process (T12-S1). Any
             provocation of pain will require the participant to lift their legs off the floor
             while the pressure is reapplied to the painful level. If the pain subsides with
             elevation of the legs, this is considered a positive test.

        Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria for participants includes (1) history of low back
        surgery; (2) recent trauma (i.e. motor vehicle accident, fall, etc. ); (3) receipt of
        services for low back pain within the last 6 months; (4) non-ambulatory or severely
        impaired mobility (i.e. use of an assistive device greater than a cane); (5) severe hearing
        or visual impairment; (6) non-mechanical low back pain; (7) neurological disorder; (8)
        presence of an acute illness; (9) diagnosis of scoliosis; (10) symptoms related to the back
        below the knee; (11) presence of a pacemaker; (12) participation in R21 clinical trial
        ongoing at the UD PT Clinic; or (13) the inability to participate in the study for the full
        six weeks for any known reason (i.e. moving away, extended vacation). Potential
        participants will also be excluded if during the evaluation any of the following are found:

          1. score &lt; 24 on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): As scores greater
             than or equal to 24 may identify individuals who are cognitively intact, this
             screening tool will exclude those older adults with questionable reliability (i.e.
             consistency) on the self-report questionnaires secondary to cognitive impairment.

          2. Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire (mOSW) score &lt; 14 percent: This
             questionnaire will exclude those individuals with chronic low back pain who
             demonstrate minimal low back pain-related disability. Individuals with minimal
             disability may not be representative of those seeking outpatient physical therapy
             services for their back pain.

          3. Facial Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) &quot;worst&quot; low back pain rating in last 24 hours of &lt;
             3/10: Pain rating ≥ 3/10 is being used in the hopes of recruiting a group of
             individuals who may be representative of those likely to seek clinical services for
             their low back pain. Also, all FPS-Rs (&quot;current&quot;, &quot;best&quot;, and &quot;worst&quot;) will be used to
             document the impact of treatment on self-reported pain.

          4. Inability to tolerate lying on belly with legs straight: This is a requirement for our
             standardized position for ultrasound.
