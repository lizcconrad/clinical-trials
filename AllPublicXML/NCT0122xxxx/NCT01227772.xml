      Active vaccination with tumor specific antigens and VEGFR1 HLA-A24 epitopes can improve
      survival of patients with advanced Gastric Cancer.

    <textblock>
      Although palliative chemotherapy improved the outcome of patients with advanced Gastric
      Cancer, the prognosis for this group of patients remains poor. Tumor specific antigens and
      angiogenesis pathway are potential targets for immunotherapy. A cocktail of peptide vaccines
      is selected to overcome gastric cancer's heterogeneous and enhance the anti-tumor effect.
      Five HLA-A*2402-binding peptide vaccines derived from tumor specific antigens and VEGFR1 are
      chosen based on the frequencies of their expressions in gastric cancer and the ability to
      induce specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. In preclinical model, both down regulation these
      targets with siRNA and active vaccination resulted in tumor regression. The purpose of the
      study is to evaluate the safety and optimal dosing schedule of a cancer vaccine cocktail,
      OTSGC-A24 targeting novel specific tumor antigens FOXM1, DEPDC1, KIF20A, URLC10 and VEGFR1 in
      advanced gastric cancer patients with HLA-2402 haplotype.

    <description>Dose limiting toxicity will be evaluated during the first 4 weeks of treatment. If in the unlikely event that DLT is observed in 1 of the 3 subjects, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level. If DLT is observed in 2 of the 6 subjects, subsequent cohorts will be treated at 0.5 mg.</description>

    <measure>Optimal dosing schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In each cohort, OTSGC-A24 (~1 mg) will be administered subcutaneously at 3-weekly (cohort 1), 2-weekly (cohort 2) and weekly (cohort 3) interval. Treatment may continue until the subject experiences confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, withdraws consent, or requires treatment with another therapeutic modality.</description>

    <description>Up to 10 patients per cohort will be recruited in the cohort or cohorts with the highest specific CTL induction rate to define the optimal dosing schedule for OTSGC-A24.</description>
