  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational part of this study is using a mobile PET/CT scanner to take images of the
      participants tumor immediately after they are treated with proton radiation. This allows the
      participant to be treated and imaged on the same bed. The information obtained may improve
      the accuracy of treatment and may help to minimize the dose delivered unnecessarily to
      healthy tissue.

      For all participants, right after one regular treatment fraction, NeuroPET or NeuroPET II
      will be wheeled into the patient room. The patient bed will be moved directly into the scan
      position and a PET scan will be acquired in list-mode for 15 to 20 minutes followed by a CT
      scan for ~5 minutes. After undergoing their first PET scan, participants will have the option
      to undergo 1-2 additional scans throughout radiation treatment in the same manner as the
      first scan.
