      The purpose of this study is to determine whether simultaneously using the traditional
      Chinese medicine, Si-Ni-Tang, is more effective in the treatment of septic shock patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Those with hemodynamic instability were the main population of the ICU patients, whether the
      exact etiology leading to the diseases. However, how to maintain adequate hemodynamic status
      in order to keep the patients with well organs perfusion is the main issue of the intensive
      care physicians. The choices of vasoactive drugs in the guidelines or experts' suggestions
      nowadays used are still limited in the western medicine. Si-Ni-Tang, a remedy previously used
      in ancient China and now widely prescribed in Taiwan and China, is used for treating patients
      diagnosed as shock or heart failure. The investigators are eager to know if there existed any
      benefit via adding this drug to treat the septic shock patients. Therefore, the investigators
      designed a prospectively randomized double blind control trial to determine whether
      simultaneously using the traditional Chinese medicine, Si-Ni-Tang, is more effective in the
      treatment of septic shock patients.

    The IRB considered our trial risky. Although there were debates between investigators and IRB,
    we terminated our trial in accordance with the suggestion of IRB.
