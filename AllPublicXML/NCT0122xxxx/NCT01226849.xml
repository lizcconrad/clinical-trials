    <textblock>
      Incorporation of rituximab to conventional chemotherapy (R-CHOP) has revolutionalized the
      frontline treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), one of the commonest subtype of
      lymphoma. Although the majority of patients are cured, there still remains a substantial
      number patients (20-30%) who will relapse despite upfront R-CHOP therapy. Recent studies have
      informed that in the rituximab era, the ability to salvage patients with relapsed DLBCL with
      the conventional salvage regimens like R-ICE or R-DHAP is significantly poorer than expected.
      For a patients who has been exposed to rituximab in the frontline, the response rate of
      conventional salvage chemotherapy is now a mere 51% (Coral Study). This suggests that
      relapses after rituximab exposure are more severe, strongly implying the presence of
      rituximab-resistant disease in additional to the selection of more aggressive subtypes of
      DLBCL which R-CHOP may not have a significant impact on. As R-CHOP is currently the frontline
      standard of care, more has to be done to augment the current available salvage regimens as a
      response rate of 51% is unacceptable.

      Incorporation of agents targeting rituximab-resistance and also the more aggressive subtype
      of DLBCL ( ABC subtype) is prudent in the salvage regimen. Bortezomib, a targeted novel agent
      has potent anti-tumor effects on its own. It has also been show clinically to be able to
      overcome the adverse risk conferred by the ABC subtype of DLBCL. In addition, preclinical
      studies have also demonstrated that bortezomib may enhance the biologic activity of rituximab
      through upregulation of CD20, the target of rituximab.

      The investigators hypothesize that adding bortezomib to salvage regimen of DLBCL will be more
      efficacious. Increasing the response rate will then allow more eligible patients to go on to
      autologous stem cell transplantation. The investigators intend to test the tolerability and
      efficacy of the combination of bortezomib with the R-ICE regimen, and attempt to correlate
      responses with histopathological and gene expression studies of tumor specimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most commonly used regimen for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
      is the R-ICE regime (rituximab, ifosphamide, cisplatin and etoposide). It was previously
      reported to give an overall response rate (RR) of close to 70%, and a complete response rate
      of 53%. As most DLBCL patients are now treated in the frontline with R-CHOP regimen, the
      validity of RRs with R-ICE needs to be reevaluated. Results of the CORAL study, a prospective
      randomized phase III trial comparing R-DHAP vs R-ICE in relapsed DLBCL were recently
      presented. It was shown that there was no difference in RR between R-ICE and R-DHAP. However,
      the RR of patients who had received prior rituximab in the frontline setting was
      significantly lower at 51%, compared with rituximab-na√Øve patients at 83%. This suggests that
      relapses after rituximab exposure are more severe. In addition to the risk of more aggressive
      subtype of DLBCL (activated B-cell [ABC]) that may not be abrogated by rituximab, the
      presence of rituximab-resistant disease is also strongly implicated. As R-CHOP is currently
      the frontline standard of care, more has to be done to augment the current available salvage
      regimens. Incorporation of agents targeting the activated B-cell (ABC)subtype and
      rituximab-resistance is prudent in the salvage regimen. Bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor
      impacts on many cellular processes relevant to the pathogenesis of DLBCL, including
      inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that
      bortezomib displayed significant antitumor activity against various lymphomas, and in
      particular the ABC subtype of DLBCL. It is also capable of enhancing the biologic activity of
      rituximab through upregulation of CD20 in preclinical studies. Demonstration of synergism in
      these 2 agents, in part due to their dependence on overlapping pathways, suggests that they
      should be explored as a combination.

      On this basis, the investigators aim to conduct a pilot study of adding intravenous
      bortezomib to R-ICE as a salvage regime for adult patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL.
