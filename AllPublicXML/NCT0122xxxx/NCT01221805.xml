    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of STA® Liatest® D-Di combined with a
      clinical pretest probability (PTP) to safely exclude pulmonary embolism (PE) or Deep Venous
      Thrombosis (DVT) in a 3 month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be selected from prospective, consecutive ambulatory outpatients
      suspected of having venous thromboembolism.

      These patients will first be evaluated using the Wells score:

        -  patients with low or moderate pretest probability will be considered for D-dimer
           testing, those with D-dimer positive will be considered for an imaging procedure,

        -  patients with high pretest probability will be considered for an imaging procedure.

      Patients with &quot;low or moderate&quot; pretest probability and a negative D-Dimer result will be
      followed for 3 months to evaluate potential development of deep venous thrombosis and/or
      pulmonary embolism.

      These patients will be contacted by phone 3 month after their first visit.

             four (24) hours or more before the D-dimer is measured

             is measured

          5. Patients with previous DVT/PE occurred less than three (3) months from screening.
