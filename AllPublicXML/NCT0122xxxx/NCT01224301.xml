      Purpose of the study. The purpose of the project is to evaluate the feasibility,
      acceptability, and cost effectiveness of providing influenza vaccine in schools to children
      in grades Kindergarten through 6th grade.

      Hypothesis 1: School based influenza vaccination (SIV) will increase the overall rate of
      influenza vaccination in school children.

      Hypothesis 2: Higher intensity parent notification about school based influenza vaccination
      does not increase immunization rates compared to low intensity.

      Hypothesis 3: School based vaccination from the perspective of mass vaccinators is cost
      neutral.

      Background. The ACIP (American Committee on Immunization Practices) has now recommended
      influenza vaccination for all children 6 months to 18 years of age. While many school-aged
      children will be vaccinated in the medical home, the large number of children for whom the
      vaccine is now recommended exceeds the capacity of many primary care settings. Schools have
      been recommended as potential sites for influenza vaccination, yet little is known about the
      feasibility, implementation requirements, costs, or effectiveness of school-based influenza
      vaccination (SIV) programs. This project will implement and rigorously evaluate the
      feasibility, acceptability, billing and reimbursement components, costs, cost-effectiveness,
      and overall effectiveness of an SIV program that targets diverse populations and different
      intensity of interventions.

    <description>Economic analysis of costs and revenues associated with school-based seasonal influenza vaccine delivered by a mass vaccinator. The project is based on a business model for purchasing/acquiring vaccine from vendors and vaccines for children, and recovering payment from insurance. Costs associated with vaccines administered in school are derived from this clinical trial, School Influenza Vaccine vs Standard of Care, and private practice data are from the literature.</description>
