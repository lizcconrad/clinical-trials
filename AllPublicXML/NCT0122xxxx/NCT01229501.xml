    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction, or abnormal functioning of the lining of blood vessels, appears to
      be a key process in the development of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction
      appears to be caused by both sleep disordered breathing and obesity. As endothelial
      dysfunction is among the first clinical marker that predicts future cardiovascular events,
      understanding molecular mechanisms leading to impairment of endothelial function is very
      important. Endothelial function requires the proper functioning of endothelial nitric oxide
      synthase (eNOS). eNOS activity is tightly regulated by caveolin-1, a protein important in the
      formation of cellular structures called caveolae. Low levels of caveolin-1 facilitate optimal
      nitric oxide synthesis in endothelial cells as caveolin-1 helps to spatially organize eNOS in
      close proximity to signaling proteins that are important for eNOS activation. In certain
      diseases however, the balance of caveolin-1 and eNOS can be disrupted resulting in impaired
      nitric oxide synthesis and leading to endothelial dysfunction.

      The investigators therefore seek to characterize levels of caveolin-1, and correlate this
      with the presence or absence of sleep disordered breathing, obesity, and cardiovascular
      disease. The current IRB protocol covers the performance of fat biopsies on subjects who have
      recently completed a sleep study either in the Center for Sleep Medicine or in our sleep
      laboratory and were found to have sleep disordered breathing or no sleep disordered
      breathing, subject with sleep disordered breathing who have been treated successfully with
      continuous positive airway pressure for 3-6 months, and subjects undergoing other studies in
      our lab who are obese or non-obese and subjects who have known cardiovascular disease and
      subjects without known cardiovascular disease.
