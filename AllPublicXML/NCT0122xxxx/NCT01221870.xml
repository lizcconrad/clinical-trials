      The intravenously administered taxane, paclitaxel, is one of the most commonly employed
      agents for the treatment of both localized and advanced breast cancer.

      Tesetaxel is an orally administered taxane that is in development as first- and second-line
      treatment for patients with advanced cancers. This study is being undertaken to determine the
      efficacy and safety of tesetaxel administered as first-line therapy to patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.
