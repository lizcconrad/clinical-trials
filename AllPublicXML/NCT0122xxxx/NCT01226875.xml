    <textblock>
      Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) is a safe, non-invasive treatment for renal calculi. During SWL
      energy is focused on in order to break kidney stones and this energy can be varied in size
      from a narrow (or small) focal zone to a wide (or large) focal zone. This is a
      multi-centered, randomized study comparing the single treatment success rates of narrow and
      wide focal zones during SWL.

      Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is a safe and non-invasive treatment for kidney stones. The SWL
      machine that is currently in use has a unique feature: the focal zone or the energy that the
      SWL energy is focused on in order to break kidney stones can be varied in size from a narrow
      (or small) focal zone to a wide (or large) focal zone. Previous lithotripters have only
      offered one focal size that corresponded to a narrow range. The objective of this study is to
      compare the single-treatment success rates of narrow and wide focal zones for the shock wave
      lithotripsy of renal stones between 5 and 15 mm in greatest diameter, while maintaining a
      constant overall lithotripsy energy level. A wide focal zone may offer some trade-offs when
      compared with the traditional narrow focal zone: since the area being treated is larger, it
      is more likely that the stone will receive adequate energy as it moves with patient breathing
      during treatment, and less energy per cubic inch will be delivered to the kidney around the
      stone (which might lead to a lower degree of renal injury); on the other hand less energy per
      cubic inch will also be delivered to the stone, so that stone fragmentation might be inferior
      to that with a narrow focal zone. Thus, with this study we want to determine whether there is
      a significant difference in both stone fragmentation and in renal injury (as measured by the
      incidence of post-treatment renal hematoma or bruises, and by measuring urinary markers
      indicating the degree of renal cellular damage). Aside from the random choice of focal zone
      size, there will be no change to the standard of care for lithotripsy treatment. We predict
      that the narrow focal shock zone will result in superior stone fragmentation, with higher
      single-treatment stone free and success rates. However, we may identify a slight increased
      incidence in the rate of subcapsular renal hematoma and renal damage, as detected by urinary
      markers.

    <description>Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is the most common treatment modality for kidney stones. It is a safe and non-invasive treatment performed on patients under intravenous sedation (light anesthesia) on an out-patient basis, whereby shock waves are generated by a source external to the patient's body and are then propagated into the body and focused on a kidney stone. The unique quality of SWL is in its exploitation of shock wave focusing. The Storz lithotripter is an electromagnetic lithotripter with a unique design that allows for a dual focus system with the option of either a narrow (6x28 mm) or wide (9x50 mm) focal zone, depending on the clinical situation. This is the first lithotripter on the market to allow for two different focal zones for shock wave targeting.</description>
