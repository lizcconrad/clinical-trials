  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis was that an increase in serum lycopene levels following supplementation with
      capsules containing natural lycopene rich tomato extract would reduce oxidative stress and
      improve endothelial function in healthy men with low intake of fruits and vegetables. A
      randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to assess the changes in serum
      lycopene levels, oxidative stress and endothelial function in response to an 8-week treatment
      with lycopene supplementation.

      The healthy men aged 20-60 years, who frequently smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol, were
      enrolled in this study. Subjects were excluded if they consumed more than 3 servings/day of
      vegetables and fruit, or more than one serving/week of lycopene-rich foods; took antioxidant,
      vitamin, or mineral supplements; had any history of chronic disease; or were taking
      lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications.The subjects were randomly assigned to receive
      placebo, 6mg, or 15mg lycopene capsule per day for 8 weeks. Study substances were suspended
      in soybean oil and given in acid-soluble gelatin capsules. A placebo containing soybean oil
      (100%) was supplied in identical-looking capsules. All the subjects were instructed to
      consume one capsule per day right after any meal of their choice. All participants were
      encouraged to maintain their usual lifestyle and dietary habits.
