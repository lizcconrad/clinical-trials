    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of CetuGEX™ after intravenous administration in patients with EGFR positive,
      locally advanced and/or metastatic solid cancers. The effect of CetuGEX™ on the development
      of anti-drug antibodies and on tumour response will also be evaluated.
