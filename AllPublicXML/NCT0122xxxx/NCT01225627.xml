  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre randomized controlled clinical trial which will enroll COPD patients
      in Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II-IV, hospitalized
      due to acute exacerbation. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion to intervention
      group, which will have care organized by discharge coordinator, and control group which will
      receive care as usual. The primary endpoint of this study is time to hospitalization due to
      COPD worsening. Data will be collected at baseline, at the time of hospital discharge, and at
      following time-points after the hospital discharge: 48 hours, 7-10 days, 30 days, 90 days,
      and 180 days.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of
      discharge coordinator intervention compared to care as usual in patients with COPD.

      The study is being conducted at University Clinic of Pulmonary and Allergic Diseases Golnik,
      Slovenia. Patients with suspicion of acute exacerbation of COPD will be screened at admission
      when they will be informed about study details. After explanations of concerns and questions
      that they might have, a signed informed consent will be collected. During 48 hours, patients
      will be included according to their eligibility. Main inclusion criteria are COPD stage II-IV
      according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines,
      ability to perform phone contacts and availability for home visits. Patients will be excluded
      if in unstable or terminal stage of disease other than COPD, if they will die during
      hospitalization, or if unable to follow the study protocol.

    <description>In intervention group, a discharge coordinator contacts hospitalized patients the day after randomization. During hospitalization, discharge coordinator visits are scheduled according to patients' problems and home-care needs. At 48 hours after hospital discharge, a discharge coordinator calls patients by phone to check the process of adjustment to home environment and to inquire about additional needs patients might have. Thereafter, phone contacts are scheduled according to the patients' needs and 7-10 days after the hospital discharge a home visit is performed by discharge coordinator, respectively.</description>
