  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diaphragmatic dysfunction and alterations of thoracoabdominal motions are common in patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Several studies have described an
      impairment in diaphragmatic mobility of COPD patients compared to age matched control
      subjects and it has been associated with increase in dyspnea, exercise intolerance and
      mortality. COPD patients also experiment a higher activity of the accessory breathing
      muscles, which greatly increases the work of breathing and dyspnea sensation.

      Breathing strategies have been considered an important component of pulmonary rehabilitation
      and refer to a range of techniques, including/which includes the diaphragmatic breathing
      (DB). The principal aim of DB is to improve the participation of the abdominal motion while
      reducing the accessory muscles activity. The role of DB as an adjunctive treatment modality
      in the rehabilitation of COPD patients remains controversial. Despite the conflicting
      results, improvement of the abdominal motion and a reduction of thoracic excursion, during
      voluntarily DB, has been described as a common finding of several studies. The investigators
      hypothesized that a 4-week DBTP could induce higher participation of the diaphragm and this
      modification would relieve respiratory symptoms and improve exercise tolerance and the HRQoL.
      Therefore, in this randomized controlled trial the investigators aimed to test the effects of
      a short-term DBTP on thoracoabdominal motion, pulmonary function, diaphragmatic mobility,
      dyspnea, HRQoL and exercise tolerance in patients with mild to severe COPD.

    <description>The training group will participate in a diaphragmatic breathing program which will consist of three 45-min sessions each week (12 sessions totally). The program training will be individualized and supervised by the same physiotherapist. In each session, the patients will be initially instructed to perform 3 series of 10 maximally inspirations, predominantly with abdominal motion, while reducing upper rib cage motion in a supine position.</description>
