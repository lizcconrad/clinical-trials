  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involve two parts: Part 1 entailed screening 7th and 8th graders from 4 public
      middle schools to identify students who may be showing moderate signs of stress. Students who
      score at the designated cutoff on a depression symptoms measure received a brief check-in to
      determine eligibility for the follow up randomized trial (Part 2). An &quot;indicated&quot; sample of
      120 adolescents in the 7th and 8th grade and their caregivers were randomly assigned to a
      brief, Individual Support Program (ISP) comparison group or a Skills Group Program. Research
      interviews were conducted at multiple timepoints with students and caregivers, and teacher
      questionnaires were used to examine changes in outcome measures. Following completion of the
      intervention, all participants were followed for 12-months.
