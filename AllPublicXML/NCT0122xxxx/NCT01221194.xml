      1. To evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic stockings (Protective Foot Care stockings,
           PFC) in reducing the incidence of diabetic foot pathology among high-risk patients.

        2. To evaluate perceived health-related quality of life as compared to guideline directed
           usual care in patients who use the PFC stockings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will identify a cohort of high-risk diabetic patients and assign them to two treatment
      groups. We plan to enroll patients from three sites: Scott and White Hospital in Temple
      Texas, Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK , and Trinity College Dublin at St James Hospital.. The
      two treatment arms will involve a Standard Therapy Group, and a Stocking Therapy Group. The
      Stocking Therapy group will use the special padded and friction reducing stockings in their
      standard shoes during the course of the study. Patient enrollment will occur over a one-year
      period. All patients will be followed for 30 months. The Standard Therapy Group will receive
      therapeutic shoes, standard insoles, patient education and regular foot evaluations by a
      physician every 10-12 weeks. The Stocking Therapy Group will receive standard therapy as
      described above but use the special stockings instead of their usual hose. The investigator
      at each site will be blinded regarding the treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main clinical outcome is ulceration of the foot to evaluate the effectiveness of a stocking as a prevention tool</measure>
    <time_frame>every 12 weeks for 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>An ulceration will be defined as full thickness loss of epidermis and dermis or involvement of deeper structures. Secondary clinical outcomes will include infection, Charcot Arthropathy, and amputation. An infection will be defined as a patient with three of six clinical signs of infection (erythema, heat, edema, pain, loss of function, purulence) or leukocytosis. Osteomyelitis will be diagnosed when radiographic and clinical signs are consistent with bone infection. This will be confirmed with bone biopsy, culture and histopathology when appropriate.</description>

    <description>A pressure and friction reducing stocking. The novelty of the PFC Sock stems from its innovative double layer structure and technological fibre composition. These simultaneously and significantly reduce both pressure and friction in a format that is practical for everyday wear with therapeutic shoes in high-risk cases.</description>
