  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the carryover effect of an innovative new gait training program on physiological
      and functional gait performance in persons with a traumatic lower extremity amputation. A
      second objective is to clarify the relationship between gait biomechanics (joint and sgment
      kinematics and energy cost.
