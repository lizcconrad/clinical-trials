      The purpose of this study is to compare the feasibility, safety and efficacy of hemodialysis
      with unfractionated heparin compared to hemodialysis with Citrasate in Critically Ill
      Patients.

      Objective : To compare the feasibility, safety and efficacy of Sustained Low Efficiency Daily
      Hemodialysis (SLEDD) using regional anticoagulation with Citrasate® compared to systemic
      anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin in critically ill patients.

      Design : Prospective, randomized, single-center clinical trial Setting : mixed
      medical-surgical 45 bed ICU in a tertiary university hospital Patients : 250 patients with
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) stage III needing renal replacement therapy Interventions :
      Patients are randomized to receive SLEDD using standard dialysate and systemic
      anticoagulation with UF versus SLEDD using Citrasate®-dialysate with no additional UF.

      Measurements and main results :

      Primary end point :

      - The incidence of premature interruptions of the dialysis procedure attributed to hemofilter
      clotting.

      Secondary end points :

        -  The incidence of bleeding episodes as defined by the WHO-criteria

        -  The transfusion requirements

        -  The incidence of technique failure

        -  The incidence of metabolic derangements (metabolic alkalosis, metabolic acidosis,
           hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, hypernatremia, hyponatremia)

        -  The incidence of citrate intoxication

        -  The dialysis efficiency expressed as Kt/V and URR

      Tertiary end points :

      - All cause mortality at day 28 and day 90 after inclusion

    <description>Hemodialysis is performed using standard anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin if no contra-indications for the use of heparin exist. If contra-indications for heparin exist a heparin coated hemofilter (Evodial) will be used. The use of unfractionated heparin or no heparin (with coated hemofilter) is a decision to be taken before every hemodialysis.</description>
