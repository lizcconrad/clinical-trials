  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is a public health problem. In term of frequency and mortality, it represents
      in Martinique the third localization the most frequently diagnosed and the fifth cause of
      death by cancer. Cervical cancer is recognized as viro-inducted. Human papillomavirus (HPV)
      is the etiologic agent, as a necessary but not sufficient cause, in the cancer genesis. It is
      estimated than about 70 to 80% of women have been or will be infected with an HPV in their
      genital life, the risks factors being those of the others sexually transmitted diseases
      (STD). Most of HPV infection are transient, by spontaneous clearance in a few months of the
      virus under episomal form.

      Carcinogen risk is related to viral persistency which inducts the condition of cellular
      transformation.

      Infection persistency and subsequent carcinogen risk depend of the genotype concerned and of
      the host immunitary response.

      HIV infection is known to be associated with an higher prevalency of one or several infection
      with HPV-HR.

      However, no data about HIV/HPV coinfection prevalency are available nowadays in French
      overseas department of South America whereas they are the most affected by HIV.
