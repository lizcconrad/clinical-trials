  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis in
      the world. The treatment of IgA nephropathy with normal renal function and minimal
      proteinuria is unknown. Since angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce
      proteinuria and retard the rate of decline of renal function in chronic proteinuric
      nephropathies, including IgA nephropathy. The investigators conduct a randomized control
      study to evaluate the efficacy of ACE inhibitor in the treatment of early IgA nephropathy.
      Sixty patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and minimal proteinuria are recruited. They
      will be randomized to ramipril for 5 years or no treatment. Blood pressure, proteinuria and
      renal function will be monitored. This study will explore the effects of ACE inhibitor in the
      treatment of early IgA nephropathy, which is a major cause of dialysis-dependent renal
      failure.
