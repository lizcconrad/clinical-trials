        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have a histologically or cytologically-confirmed metastatic or
             locally advanced solid tumor that has failed to respond to standard therapy,
             progressed despite standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist.
             There is no limit on the number of prior treatment regimens.

          -  Participant has a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group(ECOG) Performance Scale

          -  Participant must have adequate organ function (per prespecified laboratory values).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has had major surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal or biological
             therapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, or bevacizumab) prior
             to entering the study.

          -  Participant has known central nervous system metastases or a primary central nervous
             system tumor.

          -  Participant is pregnant or breast feeding, or expecting to conceive or father children
             within the projected duration of the study.
