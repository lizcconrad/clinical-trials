    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective chart review of all patients cared for at Monroe Carell Jr.
      Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt including the following:

        -  patients between 2007-2009 with malignancy, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) or
           hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and a central venous catheter who were under 23
           years of age at time of diagnosis in order to ascertain the associated symptoms,
           management and outcome of all episodes of non-neutropenic fever.

        -  to identify a subset of low-risk patients that can be safely managed without use of
           empiric antibiotics.
