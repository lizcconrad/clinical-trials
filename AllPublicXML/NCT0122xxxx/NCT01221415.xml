  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare ultrasound versus nerve stimulator
      techniques for nerve localization when performing peripheral nerve blocks. Specifically the
      investigators will be performing Popliteal, Femoral, and Interscalene nerve blocks. The
      investigators will be looking for differences in 1) time taken to locate the target nerve and
      inject local anesthetic 2) time from injection of local anesthetic to adequate surgical
      anesthesia 3) effectiveness of block 4) incidence of vascular puncture 5) incidence of
      adverse events 6) patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining informed consent, subjects will be randomized to either the ultrasound or
      nerve stimulator groups as the method for nerve localization prior to peripheral block
      placement.
