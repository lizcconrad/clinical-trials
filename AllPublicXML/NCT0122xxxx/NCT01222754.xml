  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Children who are diagnosed with brain tumors known as high grade gliomas or diffuse
      intrinsic pontine gliomas are generally treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
      However, these tumors are very difficult to cure, and the tumor frequently begins to grow
      again even after treatment or surgery. Researchers are interested in determining whether the
      anticancer drug lenalidomide, which has been used to treat other aggressive types of cancer,
      is a safe and effective additional treatment for children who are scheduled to receive
      radiation therapy to treat high grade gliomas or diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of lenalidomide, in conjunction with radiation
      therapy, as a treatment for children who have been diagnosed with high grade gliomas or
      diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.

      Eligibility:

      - Children and adolescents up to 21 years of age who have been diagnosed with high grade
      gliomas or diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and have not had radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and
           urine tests, and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will have two phases of treatment: a lenalidomide plus radiation phase and
           a lenalidomide-only phase.

        -  During the radiation phase, participants will take lenalidomide daily and have 6 weeks
           of radiation therapy (five treatments per week). After the radiation therapy,
           participants will stop taking lenalidomide for 2 weeks before continuing to the next
           phase.

        -  During the lenalidomide-only phase, participants will take lenalidomide daily for 21
           days, followed by 7 days without lenalidomide (28-day cycle of treatment). Participants
           will have up to 24 cycles of lenalidomide.

        -  Participants will have frequent blood tests during the first cycle of treatment, and
           will have imaging studies or other tests as required by the study researchers.

        -  Treatment will continue until the disease progresses, the participant chooses to leave
           the study, or the researchers end the study....

      Background:

      Brain tumors are the most common solid neoplasm in childhood and the second most common group
      of pediatric cancers.

      Standard therapeutic options for brain tumors consist of surgical resection, radiation
      therapy and chemotherapy; yet overall survival rates for malignant brain tumors remain low.

      Radiation therapy plays a key role in the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas
      (DIPG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG), and thalidomide has been shown in an animal model to be
      a radiosensitizer.

      Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analog with antiangiogenic, cytotoxic and immunomodulatory
      effects, is being evaluated for the treatment of CNS tumors, and has shown tolerability and
      activity in pediatric studies.

      Objectives:

      To determine the tolerability and toxicity profile of oral lenalidomide when administered to
      children with newly diagnosed HGG and DIPG with concurrent radiation at doses up to 116
      mg/m(2)/day.

      To evaluate long-term tolerability of lenalidomide in children with newly-diagnosed HGG and
      DIPG.

      To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for noninvasive monitoring of
      metabolic and biologic changes in malignant brain tumors with therapy.

      To estimate 6 month and 12 month progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in
      this patient population.

      To determine if angiogenic and/or immunomodulatory biomarkers in the blood and urine
      correlate with toxicity and disease response.

      To determine the rate of CNS metastatic disease in patients treated with antiangiogenic
      chemotherapy.

      To determine any correlation of steady state pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide with time to
      progression, number and type of toxicities, and dose limiting toxicities.

      Eligibility:

      Children with newly diagnosed HGG or DIPG, less than 22 years of age, no prior chemotherapy
      or radiation therapy, and performance score greater than or equal to 60%.

      Children with HGG must have an inoperable or incompletely resected tumor.

      Clinical laboratory tests must be within stated limits.

      Design:

      There will be two phases to therapy on this study, the Radiation Phase and the Maintenance
      Phase. The MTD will be determined by tolerability during the Radiation Phase.

      Eligible patients will receive radiation therapy five days per week to a prescription dose of
      54-59.4 Gy, with concurrent administration of lenalidomide daily in a standard Phase I dose
      escalation design.

      At the conclusion of radiation therapy, there will be a two week break followed by
      maintenance dosing of lenalidomide for 21 days of a 28 day course, until unacceptable
      toxicity, disease progression or completion of 24 courses of lenalidomide beyond radiotherapy
      (unless otherwise approved by PI).

      Using a multi-center, standard phase I dose escalation design, the total sample size

      and the study duration are expected to be 18 30 patients and 5-6 years, respectively

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        Histological diagnosis:

          -  Histological confirmation of a high-grade malignant glioma is required. Histologic
             diagnoses include, but are not limited to, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma
             multiforme. Patients with DIPG are exempt from histologic verification if they have
             typical MRI findings of DIPG (i.e. hypo- or isointense on T1-weighted imaging,
             hyperintense on FLAIR or T2-weighted imaging, epicenter in the pons, greater than 50%
             of pons involved) in the face of a typical clinical presentation.

          -  Inoperable tumor or residual disease after resection

        Prior therapy:

        -No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for HGG or DIPG is permitted. Prior
        chemotherapy or radiation therapy for treatment of other malignancies is permitted.

        Age:

        -Patients must be less than 22 years of age at the time of diagnosis.

        Able to swallow capsules whole

        Performance Score:

          -  Patients should have a Karnofsky/Lansky score of greater than or equal to 60. Patients
             who require special assistance due to tumor-related paralysis, but who are out of bed
             during the day will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of calculating the
             performance score. Patients must be able to communicate any symptoms.

        Laboratory Evaluation:

          -  The following laboratory values must be assessed within seven (7) days prior to the
             start of therapy. Laboratory tests should be repeated within 48 hours of beginning
             therapy if there has been a significant clinical change.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,000/mcL

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional upper limit of
                  normal

               -  creatinine below age-adjusted maximum limits below

        OR

          -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)

          -  Age (Years) Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dl):

               -  Less than or equal to 5 years; 0.8

               -  Age greater than 5, but less than or equal to 10 ; 1.0

               -  Age greater than 1, but less than or equal to 15 ; 1.2

               -  Less than 15 years of age; 1.5

        Females only:

          -  urine or serum pregnancy test negative

          -  No overt renal, hepatic, cardiac or pulmonary disease.

        Steroids:

          -  Newly diagnosed patients may need to be on steroids due to surgery or control of
             neurologic symptoms. Patients on steroids postoperatively or for control of
             tumor-related edema are eligible, but attempts to keep patients on the lowest dose
             necessary to control symptoms should be made.

        Patients of childbearing potential:

        -Female Subjects:

        --Definition of female of childbearing potential (FCBP)

        This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1)
        has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally
        postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing
        potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the
        preceding 24 consecutive months).

        --Criteria for female children of childbearing potential (FCCBP)

        This protocol defines FCCBP as females who have:

        ---Achieved menarche and/or breast development in Tanner stage 2 or greater

        ----Onset of fertility typically occurs within 3-12 months after menarche.

        Menarche varies considerably from person to person, and thus no age cut off can be
        attributed. One of the primary tools used to follow a girl s progress through puberty is
        the Tanner staging system, which describes the pattern of development of the secondary sex
        characteristics. Tanner stage 2 corresponds to the beginning of breast development, which
        is the first visible sign of puberty in girls. Breast development is estrogen stimulated,
        and since ovulation cannot occur without estrogen, Tanner stage 2 will be a reliable marker
        for the definition of fertility.

        ---Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy.

        Note: Amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential

        --Criteria for female children not of childbearing potential (FCNCBP)

        This protocol defines FCNCBP as females:

          -  Who have not yet experienced menarche or breast development in Tanner stage 2.

          -  Who have undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy.

        Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
        with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 14 days and again within 24 hours prior
        to starting Course 1 of lenalidomide. Further, they must either commit to continued
        abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control:
        one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least
        28 days before starting lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing.
        Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP, even if they have
        had a successful vasectomy. A FCBP is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a
        hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at
        least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
        consecutive months). All patients must be counseled by a trained counselor every 28 days
        about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.

        -Male Subjects:

          -  Appropriate male subjects (i.e. those who have reached puberty and are sexually
             active) will be counseled regarding birth control methods. They must agree to use a
             latex condom during sexual contact with females of childbearing potential while
             participating in the study and for at least 28 days following discontinuation from the
             study even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

          -  Appropriate male patients will be given a reproductive risks handout and counseled by
             a provider. For sexually active patients, the counseling session, consent and
             counseling checklist will be documented monthly.

        Informed consent:

        All patients or their legal guardians (if the patient is less than18 years old) or durable
        power of attorney (DPA) must sign a document of informed consent indicating their
        understanding of the investigational nature and the risks of this study. When appropriate,
        pediatric patients will be included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal assent.

        Durable Power of Attorney:

        Assignment of DPA to a family member or guardian should be offered to all patients 18 years
        of age.

        Signed informed consent according to institutional guidelines must be obtained.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who have had prior chemotherapy for this tumor.

        Patients with an HGG that was completed resected with good margins.

        Patients with a body surface area (BSA) less than or equal to 0.4 m(2) are excluded because
        the lowest dose of the medication is 5 mg in capsule form.

        Patients with a known coagulation disorder are excluded. Patients with a first-degree
        relative with a history of venous thrombosis before age 50 yrs or an arterial thrombosis
        before age 40 yrs must have the following testing performed prior to enrollment to exclude
        a heritable disorder. Patients with a suspected disorder will be excluded due to the
        potential increased risk of thrombosis.

          -  PT, PTT, Thrombin time, Fibrinogen

          -  Antithrombin

          -  Protein C, Protein S

          -  Factor V Leiden

          -  Prothrombin G20210A gene analysis

          -  Fasting serum homocysteine

          -  Lupus anticoagulant assays

          -  Anticardiolipin level

          -  Fasting serum homocysteine

          -  Anticardiolipin level

          -  LDL, HDL, triglycerides

        Patients who have had a thromboembolic event that is not line-related are excluded.

        Patients with any significant medical illnesses that, in the investigator s opinion, cannot
        be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, would compromise a patient s ability to
        tolerate this therapy or result in inability to assess toxicity. This includes, but is not
        limited to uncontrolled intercurrent illness including ongoing or active infection, cardiac
        disease, renal impairment or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
        compliance with study requirements.

        Patients with a history of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome are
        excluded as this has occurred in patients receiving lenalidomide.

        Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
        composition to lenalidomide (i.e. thalidomide).

        Patients with known hypersensitivity to anhydrous lactose, microcrystalline cellulose,
        croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.

        Pregnant or breast feeding females:

        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide is in a class with the
        potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
        potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother
        with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
        lenalidomide.

        Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
        the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with lenalidomide. In addition, these
        patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
        therapy.

        Patients identified as needing spinal radiation at diagnosis (e.g. spinal metastasis or
        malignant cells identified on CSF cytology) are excluded due to the increased risk of
        myelosuppression.
