  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAD/CAM technology has been introduced to the field of implant dentistry in the beginning of
      1990's (Priest 2005). Since their introduction, the use of CAD/CAM technology in the
      production of dental implant restorations has been rapidly expanding. However, little
      evidence is currently present supporting its clinical viability (Henriksson 2003, Canullo
      2007).

      Therefore, the suggested prospective randomized study includes bone level placed Straumann
      implants restored with transmucosal elements and crowns fabricated using either CAD/CAM
      &quot;Etkon&quot; technology (Zirconia abutment and ceramic crown) or a conventional technique
      (Crossfit titanium abutment and a ceramometal crown).

      The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to examine single-tooth implant
      restorations in the esthetic zone. An esthetic area is defined as any area that is visible in
      the patient's full smile. [3rd ITI consensus conference 2004] The rehabilitations will be
      fabricated using two different techniques. Zirconia CAD/CAM (ZCC) implant restorations
      (tests) will be compared to Titanium conventionally-fabricated (TCF) implant restorations
      (controls) using, reproducible esthetic (objective/subjective) and biologic parameters.

      This in vivo study is a randomized study with two groups of 15 patients with one implant each
      for a total of 30 patients and 30 implants. The implants will be examined for successful
      tissue integration according to the criteria of success (Buser et al. 1990) at every recall
      visit.

      In addition, the following parameters will be evaluated for each restoration:

        -  Esthetic: A. Objective: PES/WES Score (Belser et al. 2009) from 1:1 digital photograph,
           study casts, and spectrophotometric measurements, and B. Subjective: VAS questionnaire
           for patients and VAS questionnaire from experts.

        -  Biologic (mPI, mB, simplified GI, microbial sample, periapical radiograph for DIB, and
           width of keratinized facial mucosa)

      Finally, an evaluation of the mechanical, biologic and technical complications will be
      performed at every recall visit. Mechanical complications would be defined as those
      complications that involve the prosthesis such as abutment screw loosening, fracture of the
      veneer material, fracture of the crown framework, abutment screw fractures, and implant
      fractures. The category of biologic complications will include those complications that
      involve the soft tissues (e.g., fistula, suppuration, bleeding, gingival inflammation, and
      soft tissue dehiscence). Technical complications are defined as those related to restorative
      components and crowns (e.g. crown emergence profile, abutment and crown fit, screw loosening,
      ceramic fracture).

      Introduction

      Long-term prospective studies demonstrate a high success rate of Straumann implants in
      partially or fully edentulous patients both with early and conventional loading (Salvi et al.
      2004, Lambrecht et al. 2003, Cochran et al. 2002, Weber et al. 2000, Buser et al. 1997).
      Before the introduction of CAD/CAM technology to the field of implant dentistry in the
      beginning of 1990's (Priest 2005), the available approach for restoring single dental
      implants was either with stock or cast custom abutments and a ceramo-metal crowns. In spite
      of the satisfactory results that this conventional treatment approach has achieved, several
      disadvantages have been recognized. First, non tooth-colored abutments possess the problem of
      bluish appearance of overlying tissue in cases of thin gingival biotype (Barclay et al. 1996,
      Prestipino and Ingber, 1996). Second, with stock abutments ideal emergence profile can not be
      achieved (Daftary 1997), a disadvantage that was reduced with the use of custom abutments.
      However, custom abutments present other disadvantages including possible imprecision of fit
      due to inaccuracies associated with impression, waxing, investing and casting procedures and
      the negative effect of the gold alloy on the peri-implant mucosal barrier as demonstrated by
      Abrahamsson in 1998 (Abrahamsson et al 1998 ).

      The introduction of CAD/CAM technology to implant dentistry was meant to provide higher
      quality restorations. Since its introduction, the use of this technology in the production of
      implant ceramic frameworks and crowns especially in esthetic regions has been rapidly
      expanding because of the promising esthetic, biologic, and mechanical properties. Alumina as
      well as Zirconia abutments are characterized by good tissue compatibility (Abrahamsson et al.
      1998). In a study by Barclay et al in 1996 it was found that plaque accumulation scores for
      ceramic-coated transmucosal elements were significantly lower than those recorded in titanium
      transmucosal elements (Barclay et al. 1996). These results suggest that the further
      development of a ceramic implant transmucosal collar may assist plaque control at the soft
      tissue-implant interface and may favorably influence the tissues in this region (Barclay et
      al. 1996). Other studies documented no significant differences in plaque accumulation and
      microbial colonization between titanium and ceramic abutment samples (Andersson et al. 2003,
      Rasperini et al. 1998). The bacterial colonization of Zirconia ceramic surfaces was recently
      studied in vitro and in vivo (Rimondini et al. 2002). The authors found that, overall,
      Zirconia ceramic surfaces developed for implant abutments accumulate fewer bacteria than
      commercially pure titanium, and may therefore be considered as a promising material for
      abutment manufacturing (Rimondini et al. 2002). A comparison of the recorded superficial soft
      tissue responses to titanium and ceramic surfaces of transmucosal elements of implants
      revealed no significant differences between both groups (Barclay et al. 1996, Andersson et
      al. 2001). Almost no marginal bone loss was recorded, indicating a stable bone situation both
      at ceramic and titatium abutments on single-tooth implants (Andersson et al. 2001). However,
      it seems to be that the peri-implant soft tissues adjacent to titanium and ceramic surfaces
      may differ in features that are not apparent when routine clinical parameters are used
      (Barclay et al. 1996).

      Because of their specific mechanical properties, all-ceramic restorations demonstrate a lower
      fracture resistance than ceramic restorations supported by metal substructures. The ceramic
      abutments on implants are more sensitive to fracture and to handling procedures than the
      titanium abutments (Andersson et al. 2001). However, advances have been made in the
      fabrication of high-strength all-ceramic abutments for anterior implants (Yildirim et al.
      2003). The hardness of the Zirconium ceramic also allows it to undergo conventional
      prophylaxis with ultrasonic scalers without alteration of its surface quality of abutment
      (Marzouk, 1996). Moreover, Zirconia has a flexural strength and fracture toughness almost
      twice as high as alumina (Glauser et al. 2004, Yildirim et al. 2003).

      Currently very limited number of clinical studies is present supporting the clinical
      viability of CAD/CAM ceramic restorations (Henriksson 2003, Canullo 2007) and no reports were
      found on the performance of CAD/CAM ceramic implant restorations in comparison to
      conventional implant restorations.

      Objective:

      The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to examine single-tooth implant
      abutments and restorations in the esthetic zone. Restorations will be fabricated using two
      different techniques. Zirconia CAD/CAM (ZCC) implant abutments and restorations will be
      compared to conventional, prefabricated Titanium (TCF) implant abutments and
      porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations using reproducible aesthetic (objective/subjective) and
      biologic parameters.

      Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis of this investigation is that ZCC implant abutments/restorations (test group)
      will achieve better biologic and esthetic outcomes when compared with TCF types (control
      group). The null hypothesis is defined as follows: ZCC implant abutments/restorations and TCF
      implant restorations are indistinguishable when biologic and esthetic outcomes are compared.

      Clinical Significance:

      CAD/CAM technology has been involved in the fabrication of dental abutments and restoration
      for the purpose of improving the biologic and esthetic results. This assumption has been
      formulated primarily from subjective interpretations as objective assessments from randomized
      controlled trials are sparse at best. This study will be significant for clinical dentistry
      in that it will create evidence on the clinical long-term performance of Zirconium CAD/CAM
      abutments and ceramic crowns compared to stock titanium abutments and
      porcelain-fused-to-metal restorations using subjective and objective evaluation parameters
      that will be statistically compared.

      Materials and Methods:

      Patients with an indication for an implant supported single tooth restoration in the esthetic
      zone will be included in the study according to the following criteria:

      Subject population Patients will be recruited from the patient pool of the Teaching and
      Faculty Practice at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. A 12-month period will be allowed
      to enroll the patients in this study. The mean treatment outcome will be compared between the
      two randomized patient groups, allowing for detection of the smallest clinically important
      differences between these means (TheSealedEnvelope™- http://www.thesealedenvelope.com/
      power.php).

      Patient entry (informed consent, patient registration, randomization and blinding) An
      informed consent approved by the Harvard Medical School/Harvard School of Dental Medicine
      Committee on Human Studies will be obtained for all subjects to be entered in this study. Its
      conduct will adhere to the principles outlined by the Office for Research Subject Protection
      of the Harvard Medical School / Harvard School of Dental Medicine. Each subject will be
      randomly assigned to one of the two treatment options. A random permuted block approach will
      be used to allocate patients into one of the treatment groups. A sealed envelope containing
      the treatment group (control or test group) will be assigned to each patient. Subsequently
      and according to the assigned treatment, a ZCC restoration (test group) or a TCF ceramo-metal
      (control group) will be fabricated and delivered to the clinician.

      For subjective evaluation the trial design will be on a double blinding level, which means
      that neither patients nor expert clinicians will know which treatment the patients are
      randomized to. This can be achieved by concealing allocation information from patients and by
      using expert clinicians, who are otherwise not involved in the patients' care, to assess
      treatment difficulties and outcomes without knowing their treatment group.

      Treatment groups

      30 patients will be randomly allocated to control or test group presented in Table (1)

      Group (n= 30 patients) Implant Abutment Crown Loading Test group (n=15) ZCC BL Straumann
      Etkon Zirconia Cement-retained Etkon Zirconia 6-8 weeks control group (n=15) TCF BL Straumann
      Crossfit titanium Cement-retained PFM 6-8 weeks

      Evaluation Parameters and time schedule:

      Patients will be evaluated for esthetic (objective and subjective parameters) and biologic
      parameters as well as the success criteria through out the study period. The baseline
      measurements are defined as the measurements taken during the healing period after insertion
      of bone level implant.

      During the healing period, after insertion of a Straumann Bone Level implant following
      standard surgical procedures, patients will use removable provisional prostheses.

      The implants will be examined for successful tissue integration according to the criteria of
      success (Buser et al. 1990) at every recall.

      Criteria of success:

        1. Absence of persistent subjective complaints, such as pain, foreign body sensation and/or
           dysaesthesia

        2. Absence of a recurrent peri-implant infection with suppuration

        3. Absence of mobility

        4. Absence of a continuous radiolucency around the implant

      Esthetic parameters :

      Objective parameters

        -  Standardized intra-oral digital photograph (1:1 magnification) An intra-oral photograph
           will be taken, positioning the plane of the camera body parallel to the vestibular face
           of the teeth adjacent to the single edentulous gap. (Figure 1)

        -  Papilla Height: Distance between the mesial and distal papilla and the zenith of the
           mid-facial gingival margin of the adjacent teeth The distance from the most coronal part
           of the mesial and distal papillae to the zenith of adjacent teeth, will be measured from
           study casts and digital photographs. (Figure 2)

        -  Buccal gingival margin measurement: Distance between the mid-facial gingival margin and
           the incisal edge of adjacent teeth The distance from the zenith of adjacent teeth to the
           most coronal part of the incisal edge, will be measured from study casts and digital
           photographs. This measurement will serve to determine the buccal gingival
           recession/growth when compared with further measurements. It will be recorded as &quot;0&quot; at
           baseline. (Figure 3)

        -  Study cast

        -  Spectrophotometer recording at adjacent teeth. A spectrophotometer (Crystaleye, Olympus,
           Japan) will be used to select and digitally record the shade for each adjacent tooth.
           The sterilizable adapter of the spectrophotometer's intra-oral camera will be positioned
           on the alveolar process over the respective adjacent tooth. Once the resulting video
           image of the tooth is centered in an orthoradial way in the measuring square depicted on
           the computer screen, the spectrophotometric data will be recorded three consecutive
           times for each tooth. This data will be later compared with records obtained from final
           crowns by repeating the spectrophotometer measurement over the control and test group
           restorations. (Figure 4)

        -  Buccal periimplant mucosa margin: Distance between mid-facial gingival margin and
           incisal edge of the implant restoration At implant crown insertion, the distance from
           the zenith of the implant restoration to the most coronal part of the incisal edge will
           be measured from study casts and digital photographs. This measurement will serve to
           determine the buccal gingival recession/growth when compared with further measurements.
           It will be recorded as &quot;0&quot; at the implant crown insertion. (Figure 5)

      Subjective parameters:

        1. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of patient's judgment on:

             -  At baseline: detriment of his/her esthetic appearance and respective expectations

             -  At crown insertion:

                  -  Overall treatment satisfaction

                  -  Accomplishment of initial expectations

             -  At 1, 6 months, 1, 3 and 5 year follow up:

                  -  • Overall treatment satisfaction

                  -  • Impact on self-esteem

                  -  • Functionality

      Biologic parameters

        1. mPI Modified plaque index (Mombelli et al. 1987) for evaluation of oral hygiene
           standard: 0: No detection of plaque; 1: Plaque only recognized by running a probe across
           the smooth marginal surface of the implant; 2: Plaque can be seen by the naked eye; 3:
           Abundance of soft material.

        2. mBI Modified sulcus bleeding index (mBI) (Mombelli et al. 1987): 0: No bleeding when a
           periodontal probe is passed a long the gingival margin adjacent to the implant; 1:
           Isolated bleeding spots visible; 2: Blood forms a confluent red line on margin; 3: Heavy
           or profuse bleeding.

        3. simplified GI Simplified Gingival Index (Apse et al. 1991): 0: Normal mucosa; 1: Minimal
           inflammation with color change and minor edema; 2: Moderate inflammation with redness,
           edema and glazing; 3: Severe inflammation wit redness, edema, ulceration and spontaneous
           bleeding without probing.

        4. Microbiological sample Microbial samples from a tooth in the same sextant as the implant
           and from the implant healing cap prior to its initial removal at the start of the
           restorative procedures will be obtained. Additional samples will be taken at 1month, 6,
           12, 36 and 60 months after the insertion of the restoration. The samples will be
           analysed for P. gingivalis, T. forsythia (B. forsythus) T..denticola, .F. nucleatum, P.
           micra (P. micros) P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, C. rectus, C. gracilis, E. nodatum and
           S. constellatus. (Quirynen et al. 2002, Keller et al. 1998, Conrad et al. 1996). Sample
           analysis will be performed at the Forsyth Institute, Boston, MA, on a contractual basis.
           Samples will be identified only by their number for this purpose. No patient identifying
           data will be revealed. The correlation between the periimplant microflora before and
           after loading within the same subject as well as potential differences in quantity and
           composition of the microflora of ZCC and TCF implant abutments and restorations will be
           analysed.

        5. Standardized periapical radiograph to assess DIB values. Standardized peri-apical long
           cone parallel radiographs of the implant (Harris et al. 2002) will be taken. For
           standardization of radiographs, a film holder will be attached to a custom-made bite
           splint. This same device will be used during the whole study for radiographic records.
           From these radiographs, bone resorption will be measured as distance from the implant
           shoulder to first bone-to-implant contact (DIB). (Figure 6)

      and technical complications will be performed at every recall visit. Mechanical complications
      would be defined as all those complications that involve the prosthesis such as abutment
      screw loosening, fracture of the veneer material, fracture of the crown framework, abutment
      screw fractures, and implant fractures. The category of biologic complications will include
      the complications that involve the soft tissues ex. fistulas, suppuration, bleeding, gingival
      inflammation, and soft tissue dehiscence. Technical complications would be defined as those
      complications that are related to lab procedures and fabricating techniques ex. abutment and
      crown emergence profile, abutment and crown fit.

      Statistical Analysis: After data collection and completion of the investigation, a one-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare the mean values of all objective and
      subjective parameters. Their variance will be broken down into two components: (a) &quot;between
      groups&quot; component (control group vs. test group) at baseline, crown insertion, and each
      follow-up period and (b) &quot;within group&quot; component at baseline, crown insertion, and each
