  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib is the current standard treatment for advanced GIST. Previous studies have shown
      that GIST genotype was associated with treatment outcomes with exon 11 having superior
      outcome compared with exon 9 or WT.10, 11 In patients with exon 9 kit mutation, the response
      rate was higher at when imatinib was given at 800mg daily compared with the standard dose of
      400mg daily. Although the data linking tyrosine kinase mutation status and imatinib response
      in metastatic GISTs is intriguing, more information is needed before mutation testing is
      adopted as part of the routine analysis of high-risk or overtly malignant KIT-expressing
      GISTs.25 Despite the fact that exon 9 mutations are associated with a lower response rate,
      overall survival does not appear to be better with high-dose therapy. The investigators
      propose to conduct a retrospective analysis of mutational analysis on patients with GIST and
      determine the relationship between patient response and imatinib dose.
