  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Performing adduction and abduction resistance exercise will increase hip bone density and
      strength to a greater extent than doing squat and deadlift exercise.

      Aim #1: To determine if doing hip adduction and abduction resistance exercise training for 16
      weeks improves spine bone mineral density and hip bone mineral density and strength as
      determined by finite element modeling.

      Aim #2: To compare the effects of hip adduction and abduction exercise to squat and deadlift
      exercise with respect to potential changes in hip bone mineral density and strength.

      Aim #3: To determine if the addition of adduction and abduction exercise to squat and
      deadlift exercise promotes an &quot;additive&quot; effect with respect to changes in spine bone mineral
      density and hip bone mineral density and bone strength.

      The investigators will carry out a 16-week exercise training study (n=24) consisting of 3
      groups (n=8 per group) of healthy, non-resistance trained adult men and women (age 25-55
      years). Our aim is to determine if hip adduction and abduction resistance exercise is more
      effective than squat and deadlift exercise with respect to changes in the whole bone strength
      and density of the proximal femur and spine.

      Group A will do only hip adduction and abduction exercises. Group B will do only squat and
      deadlift exercise Group C will do a combination of hip adduction and abduction and squat and
      deadlift exercise

      Subjects will be imaged with quantitative computed tomography (QCT) of the proximal femur and
      spine, pre-training and post-training, to determine changes in spinal bone density and
      proximal femoral bone density and strength.

      Serum assays of bone formation (osteocalcin) and bone resorption (serum CTX type I) will be
      performed four times during the study at 4 week intervals.

    <description>The investigators have prioritized the last year of NSBRI funding to test one the capabilities of our device, standing hip adduction/abduction exercise, to strengthen the proximal femoral bone. We believe that if we are able to detect increases in bone density and strength (assessed using quantitative computed tomography of the hip pre- and post-training) in healthy volunteers, this will be solid preliminary evidence to support modification of exercise protocols currently being used to reduce the rate of bone loss on the International Space Station.</description>
