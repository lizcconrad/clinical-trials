  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether electroacupuncture preconditioning would
      provide protection against myocardial Ischemic-Reperfusion injury and systemic inflammation
      in children undergoing CPB for repair of congenital heart defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2-12 years old children undergoing repair of congenital heart defects were included, except
      for those with server pulmonary arterial hypertension, chromosomal defects, airway and
      parenchymal lung disease, immunodeficiency, or blood disorders were excluded. Children were
      equal randomized to EAPC(electroacupuncture preconditioning)or control group.
      Electroacupuncture was administered on the bilateral P6 acupoint after anesthesia induction,
      but prior to surgery in EAPC group. Control patients underwent sham placement of the
      electrode the arm without stimulation. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic
      cross-clamp time was recorded. Myocardial injury was assessed by cardiac heart-type fatty
      acid-binding protein (HFAP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI&gt;0.40 ng/mL). 8-isoprostane ,
      C-reactive protein, cytokines were measured pre- and postoperatively.
