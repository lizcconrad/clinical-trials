      Objective/Rationale:

      The investigators objective is to demonstrate that an intervention program based on motor
      learning principles can be applied to train subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) who suffer
      from freezing to walk in a way that minimizes the occurrence of freezing. Since sufficient
      motor learning capabilities are preserved in PD, the investigators hypothesize that an
      intervention program that targets the time periods just prior to an approaching freezing
      episode can modify the walking strategies so that the episode will now be averted.

      Project Description:

      The freezing burden will be quantified in subjects with PD before and after 6 weeks of
      training. Two types of interventions (20 subjects in each group) will be tested: 1) Open-loop
      group (OLG); 2) Closed-loop group (CLG). Each session of the OLG training includes walking
      courses aimed at provoking freezing episodes. The experimenter will trigger an auditory
      rhythmic stimulation (RAS) in walking conditions likely to invoke freezing (e.g., turning)
      and the subject will learn to synchronize his/her gait with the auditory cues, i.e., to keep
      the walking pace and coordination and, as a result, to avoid freezing. Similar principles
      will apply for the CLG training; however, the RAS will be elicited automatically by a device
      that recognizes an approaching freezing episode.

      Relevance to Diagnosis/Treatment of Parkinson's Disease:

      If even partially successful, the investigators will show, for the first time that freezing
      of gait is amenable to motor learning and that appropriate training with external cueing can
      alleviate these motor blockades. While future studies will be needed to further assess
      long-term efficacy and other important questions about clinical efficacy and the mechanisms
      involved, this study should go a long way towards improving the investigators understanding
      of freezing of gait and its amenability to appropriate therapy.

      Anticipated Outcome:

      The investigators anticipate that after intensive training, the central nervous system (CNS)
      of subjects with PD will be able to anticipate impending freezing episodes based on awareness
      of the environmental conditions (e.g., an approaching turn) and/or based on sub-conscious
      response to a deteriorating gait pattern. As a result, an automated motor response that paces
      and coordinates gait will be internally triggered by the CNS and the approaching freezing
      episode will be averted. The overall freezing burden will therefore decrease in trained
      subjects.

      Overview: This will be a randomized trial to demonstrate the effects of 6-weeks of training
      with open-loop or triggered, closed-loop cueing. PD+ FOG patients will be studied before and
      after 6 weeks of training (total of 18 sessions) and one month later (to begin to assess
      retention). The two intervention groups will receive training sessions designed to enhance
      implicit motor learning and avoidance of FOG. This will be the first study to assess these
      novel paradigms. If the results support the hypotheses, further studies will be needed
      including a placebo-controlled trial. 20 subjects will be included in the feed-forward,
      open-loop group (OLG) and 20 in the feedback, closed-loop group (CLG) (based on power
      analysis to provide 80% power at α=0.05). Participants will be recruited on a rolling
      admission basis (about 2 subjects per week over ~20 weeks) and will be randomly assigned to
      one of the 2 groups. Pre, post and retention effects will be tested without knowledge of
      group assignment. A (repeated measures) mixed models statistical approach will be used to
      evaluate within and across group effects over time, adjusting for baseline values. The study
      will be conducted under the auspices of the Laboratory for Gait and Neurodynamics and the
      Movement Disorders Unit (MDU) at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. At all times during
      training and testing, the subjects will be closely monitored by a research assistant to
      ensure safety.
