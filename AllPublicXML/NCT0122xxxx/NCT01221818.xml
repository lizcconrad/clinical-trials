    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single dose study to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of E6007 in healthy subjects. Six dose groups will be
      evaluated. Subjects will receive either 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, or 600 mg E6007
      or matching placebo tablets. Subjects will undergo screening evaluations, baseline
      evaluations, Day 1 (dosing day), and Days 2-5 evaluations. They will also have a follow-up
      visit on Day 90 and a Day 180 follow-up phone call.
