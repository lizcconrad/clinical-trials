  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The important role of mechanical joint stress for the insert and progress of osteoarthritis
      (OA) is supported by recent studies. The degeneration of joint cartilage is caused either by
      unphysiological load of a healthy joint or physiological load of a damaged joint. The exact
      mechanisms leading from increased weight bearing and overuse to cartilage degeneration are
      mostly unknown.

      The hypothesis of the study is that parameters of oxidative stress in the joint synovial
      space reflect damages possibly leading to OA. These parameters correlate with parameters of
      oxidative stress in the peripheral blood. Aim of the study is the identification of such non-
      invasive obtainable biomarkers which represent the degenerative and regenerative changes in
      joint.

      Patients with clinically manifest OA typically consult the physician at time of irreversible
      cartilage destruction. This is due to the long time clinically silent progress of the
      disease. A biomarker screening profile for joint damage is a valuable tool for the detection
      of over use and joint damaging conditions especially in competitive sports. This would
      provide a method for OA risk assessment for the patient before clinical symptoms occur. For
      this the first step is the identification of biological substances reflecting pathologic
      changes in the joint.

      Since preterm chondrocyte senescence, apoptosis and ageing related changes are key factors in
      OA pathophysiology and each of these factors is closely related to oxidative dysbalance the
      measurement of these factors and correlation with the amount of joint damage is promising.
