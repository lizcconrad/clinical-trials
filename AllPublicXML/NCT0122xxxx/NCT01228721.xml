      PURPOSE. To evaluate the impact of self-acting eyetracking and retest software on the
      reproducibility of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements in glaucoma
      patients and healthy control subjects using Spectralis® SD-OCT.

      METHODS. RNFL thickness was measured in 56 normal and 47 glaucomatous eyes by one operator
      within one session with a brief rest between measurements. Three measurements were taken with
      the eye-tracker and retest function, and three were taken without this function, alternating
      between measurement methods.
