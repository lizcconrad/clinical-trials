  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in vessel growth and wound
      healing. Bevacizumab, a non specific VEGF inhibitor, has been successfully used for the
      treatment of eye diseases associated with neovascularization. The purpose of this randomized
      study is 1) to investigate the effects of intraoperative subtenon injection of bevacizumab on
      the outcomes of trabeculectomy surgery. 2) to measure plasma and aqueous levels of VEGF and
      assess its association with the outcomes of trabeculectomy surgery. Trabeculectomy surgery,
      where a small drainage canal is created at the front of the eye, is the most common glaucoma
      surgery performed worldwide. The goal of the surgery is to control intraocular pressure.
      Failure of this procedure is most commonly caused by excessive scarring of the surgical site.
      If scarring occurs, the drainage canal can close. By adding Bevacizumab at the time of
      surgery, wound healing may be slowed and surgical failure prevented.

      The results of this study will be helpful in the future development of new more effective and
      safe surgical techniques for treatment of glaucoma.

      Patients who have given informed consent are randomized into two groups. One group receives
      standard of care for trabeculectomy surgery and the other group receives standard of care
      plus an injection of Bevacizumab at the surgery site. Both groups have a one time collection
      of ocular fluid and a blood sample taken from a vein in the arm. After surgery, patients are
      seen by their study doctor six times in the following year. At these visits measurements are
      taken of their visual acuity, eye pressure and blood pressure. The doctor does a clinical
      exam and at months six and twelve photographs of the patients' eye are taken.
