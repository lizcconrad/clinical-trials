  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the contrast sensitivity, high and low contrast
      visual acuity (VA), glare meter outcomes, and subject satisfaction with three different
      FDA-approved intraocular lenses (IOLs) designed to improve distance, intermediate, and near
      vision following lens extraction in adults at least 40 years of age.

        <description>A single eye (monocular) in dim light (mesopic) measuring contrast sensitivity; The participant is presented with a sine-wave grating target of a given spatial frequency (cycles/degree of visual angle) where the smaller the number of cycles/degree the wider apart the gradations (vertical lines of grayness). The participant's ability to detect changes in contrast is determined. Higher mean indicates improved contrast sensitivity.</description>

The participant's ability to detect changes in contrast is determined. Higher mean indicates improved contrast sensitivity.</description>

        <title>Binocular Mesopic Contrast Sensitivity Without Glare(1.5, 3 Cycles/Degree)</title>
        <description>In two eyes (binocular) in dim light (mesopic) measuring contrast sensitivity; The participant is presented with a sine-wave grating target of a given spatial frequency (cycles/degree of visual angle) where the smaller the number of cycles/degree the wider apart the gradations (vertical lines of grayness). The participant's ability to detect changes in contrast is determined. Higher mean indicates improved contrast sensitivity.</description>

          <description>In one eye (monocular) in dim light (mesopic) measuring contrast sensitivity; The participant is presented with a sine-wave grating target of a given spatial frequency (cycles/degree of visual angle) where the smaller the number of cycles/degree the wider apart the gradations (vertical lines of grayness). The participant's ability to detect changes in contrast is determined. Higher mean indicates improved contrast sensitivity.</description>
