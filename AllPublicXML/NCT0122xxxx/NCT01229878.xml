    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo controlled pilot study to determine if vitamin D
      supplementation in hemodialysis (HD) patients will improve physical function and cognition.
      HD patients have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, cognitive impairment, and
      physical impairment. Despite standard clinical care with active IV vitamin D during dialysis,
      HD patients still have markedly low levels of nutritional or dietary vitamin D. IV treatment
      with vitamin D during dialysis is aimed at treating HD related bone disease. Recent
      literature shows that oral or nutritional vitamin D has multiple extra-skeletal effects
      including improvement in cognition and physical function. In this study, the investigators
      plan to administer oral vitamin D to vitamin D deficient HD patients already receiving
      standard care with IV vitamin D therapy. Patients will be randomized to receive either
      placebo or 50,000 IU of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) weekly for 6 months. The investigators'
      specific aims are to 1) Assess the benefits of correcting nutritional vitamin D deficiency on
      cognitive and physical function in HD patients receiving routine standard of care, 2) Assess
      the feasibility of recruiting HD patients for this study, and 3) Evaluate the proposed
      regimen for safely and effectively increasing nutritional vitamin D levels with oral
      supplementation. The investigators anticipate that correction of nutritional vitamin D
      deficiency to optimal levels will improve the high prevalence of cognitive impairment and
      physical impairment in this population. These results will be used as evidence to support a
      larger study aimed at treating nutritional vitamin D deficiency in all patients receiving HD.
      These results may also contribute to a change in current guidelines which place little
      emphasis on the monitoring and treatment of nutritional vitamin D levels in HD patients.
      These results are important for the Veteran dialysis population since many of them are
      required to perform high-level cognitive tasks such as management of complex medical regimens
      and physical tasks such as orchestrating independent transportation to and from HD sessions
      and multiple physician appointments.
