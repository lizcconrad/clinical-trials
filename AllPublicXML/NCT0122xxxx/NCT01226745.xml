    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 40, 52, early termination, Week 152, 200, 255</time_frame>
    <description>DLCO was one of the most clinically valuable tests of lung function. The DLCO measure the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. Early termination visit was recorded when the subject was early terminated from the study during the first 2.5 year period, while early termination 2 visit was recorded when the subject was early terminated from the study during the additional 2 year period with delay. The values for the DLCO &quot;% of predicted&quot; was defined as the mean value of 2 test results that were within a 10% variability of each other.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 255</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-lead ECG was recorded after the subject was in supine position for 5 minutes. ECGs were acquired on digital cardiographs. Abnormal findings were analyzed as clinically significant or not clinically significant as per the discretion of the study investigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormal Ophthalmologic Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 255</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination (COE) including best corrected visual acuity (Snellen), manifest refractions, pupil examination, ocular motility, nystagmus, confrontation visual fields, Ishihara color plates, Amsler grid, and tonometry as well as a biomicroscopy slit lamp examination of the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris and lens; and a fundoscopic examination (with dilation) of the vitreous, optic nerve, retinal vessels, macula, and peripheral retina. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Thicknesses of the macular retina and retinal nerve fiber layer at the optic nerve head in each eye was assessed by OCT using the fast macular thickness map scan and the fast retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) scan features, respectively. The abnormalities of the ophthalmologic examination was judged to be clinically significant or not as per the investigators discretion. The ophthalmologic examination was performed for both right eye (RE) and left eye (LE).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Dermatological Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of the treatment, assessed up to Week 255</time_frame>
    <description>A whole body examination, paying particular attention to identify precancerous or cancerous lesions was done by a dermatologist and based on the clinical judgment of the dermatologist the abnormalities were categorized as clinically significant or clinically not significant. Early termination visit was recorded when the subject was early terminated from the study during the first 2.5 year period, while early termination 2 visit was recorded when the subject early terminated from the study during the additional 2 year period with delay shall be defined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Death and TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug administration up to 35 days after the last dose of study drug administration, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were defined as the AEs that occur between first dose of study drug administration and 35 days after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Gadolinium (Gd)-Enhanced Lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 40, 52, 100, 148, early termination, Week 152, 200, early termination 2, Week 255 and end of treatment (5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Gd-enhanced lesions were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at each scheduled assessment visit over the study period. Extension study baseline is defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study. End of treatment (EoT) lesion count is the average number of lesion counts per scan, calculated by dividing the sum of all lesion counts by number of scans during the extension treatment period. Early termination visit was recorded when the subject was early terminated from the study during the first 2.5 year period, while early termination 2 visit was recorded when the subject early terminated from the study during the additional 2 year period with delay. Extension study baseline is defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study.Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects who provided any post baseline efficacy data.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Lesion Volume at the End of the Treatment (EoT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of treatment (5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Brain lesion volume was obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Extension study baseline was defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study. End of treatment (EOT) was defined as the last visit during the treatment period. Change from extension baseline to EOT = last treatment period value in extension study — extension baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Brain Volume Change (PBVC) From Baseline at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at end of treatment (Week 255)</time_frame>
    <description>Brain volume was obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Extension study baseline is defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study. Brain volume changes very little over time. Hence, the PBVC at the end of treatment was calculated by adding up all the PBVC values from the scans performed during the extension treatment period.</description>

        <description>Gd-enhanced lesions were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at each scheduled assessment visit over the study period. Extension study baseline is defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study. End of treatment (EoT) lesion count is the average number of lesion counts per scan, calculated by dividing the sum of all lesion counts by number of scans during the extension treatment period. Early termination visit was recorded when the subject was early terminated from the study during the first 2.5 year period, while early termination 2 visit was recorded when the subject early terminated from the study during the additional 2 year period with delay. Extension study baseline is defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study.Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects who provided any post baseline efficacy data.</description>

          <title>Number of Gadolinium (Gd)-Enhanced Lesions</title>
          <description>Gd-enhanced lesions were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at each scheduled assessment visit over the study period. Extension study baseline is defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study. End of treatment (EoT) lesion count is the average number of lesion counts per scan, calculated by dividing the sum of all lesion counts by number of scans during the extension treatment period. Early termination visit was recorded when the subject was early terminated from the study during the first 2.5 year period, while early termination 2 visit was recorded when the subject early terminated from the study during the additional 2 year period with delay. Extension study baseline is defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study.Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all subjects who provided any post baseline efficacy data.</description>

        <title>Percent Brain Volume Change (PBVC) From Baseline at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>Brain volume was obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Extension study baseline is defined as the measurement most immediately prior to or on the day of the first dose day of extension study. Brain volume changes very little over time. Hence, the PBVC at the end of treatment was calculated by adding up all the PBVC values from the scans performed during the extension treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Diffusing Capacity of Lung for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO)</title>
        <description>DLCO was one of the most clinically valuable tests of lung function. The DLCO measure the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. Early termination visit was recorded when the subject was early terminated from the study during the first 2.5 year period, while early termination 2 visit was recorded when the subject was early terminated from the study during the additional 2 year period with delay. The values for the DLCO “% of predicted” was defined as the mean value of 2 test results that were within a 10% variability of each other.</description>

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Thicknesses of the macular retina and retinal nerve fiber layer at the optic nerve head in each eye was assessed by OCT using the fast macular thickness map scan and the fast retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) scan features, respectively. The abnormalities of the ophthalmologic examination was judged to be clinically significant or not as per the investigators discretion. The ophthalmologic examination was performed for both right eye (RE) and left eye (LE).</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormal Ophthalmologic Examination</title>
          <description>Subjects underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination (COE) including best corrected visual acuity (Snellen), manifest refractions, pupil examination, ocular motility, nystagmus, confrontation visual fields, Ishihara color plates, Amsler grid, and tonometry as well as a biomicroscopy slit lamp examination of the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris and lens; and a fundoscopic examination (with dilation) of the vitreous, optic nerve, retinal vessels, macula, and peripheral retina. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Thicknesses of the macular retina and retinal nerve fiber layer at the optic nerve head in each eye was assessed by OCT using the fast macular thickness map scan and the fast retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) scan features, respectively. The abnormalities of the ophthalmologic examination was judged to be clinically significant or not as per the investigators discretion. The ophthalmologic examination was performed for both right eye (RE) and left eye (LE).</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were defined as the AEs that occur between first dose of study drug administration and 35 days after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
