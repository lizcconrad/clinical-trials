      This study will compare brain and hormone responses to food images (and food) in women who
      undergo: (1) gastric bypass surgery; (2) principally restrictive surgery (laparoscopic
      adjustable gastric banding or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy); or (3) no weight loss
      surgery, with the intent of remaining relatively weight stable (within 10-15 lb of your
      present weight). The investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see how the
      brain responds to pictures of food and to consuming a liquid meal replacement. The
      investigators wish to determine whether the two surgeries have different effects on appetite,
      as observable in the brain, and whether the possible effects on appetite differ from those in
      participants who have a similar body weight but remain relatively weight stable. The
      investigators also will draw blood to determine how &quot;hunger&quot; and &quot;fullness&quot; hormones change
      after eating and to see if there are any differences among the three groups. The study is
      being sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that RYGB-treated patients will exhibit greater reductions (from baseline) in
      BOLD response in areas associated with homeostatic and hedonic eating than will both LAGB/LSG
      and control patients. We also expect that LAGB/LSG patients (as a result of hormonal changes
      occurring with weight loss) will display greater increases in BOLD response to images of
      highly palatable foods than will extremely obese controls.

      We expect that RYGB-treated patients will show larger increases (relative to baseline) in
      postprandial GLP-1 and PYY3-36 than the LAGB/LSG and obese control groups. We will also
      compare changes in ghrelin in the three groups. We predict that patients who undergo RYGB
      will have greater reductions in ghrelin than will control subjects.

      We expect that RYGB-treated patients will demonstrate greater postprandial changes (relative
      to baseline) in brain activity in the homeostatic and hedonic feeding areas (suggesting
      normalization of satiety and of neural processing of food reward) than will patients who
      undergo LAGB/LSG or who do not seek weight loss.
