  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre Phase II clinical trial to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of large defects with 3 different doses
      of the autologous chondrocyte transplantation product co.don chondrosphere® (ACT3D-CS) in
      subjects with cartilage defects of the knee.

      After screening visit patients were booked for arthroscopy and had their cells harvesting
      from healthy cartilage. After the arthroscopy the patients were randomised in one of the
      three dose-groups. The cells are cultivated for 8-10 weeks in vitro to develope 3-dimensional
      spheroids, that are transplanted in an open knee procedure (treatment surgery)into the
      defect. Patients of all dose groups subsequently followed the same rehabilitation program and
      had post-surgery visits. The 12-month-visit is defined as final assessment. Then patients
      have follow-up assessments up to 60 months.
