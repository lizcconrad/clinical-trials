  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week research study in which participants suffering from Social Anxiety Disorder
      (SAD) will receive Sertraline (a medication FDA approved for the treatment of SAD) for the
      first 8 weeks. If a participant remains symptomatic, he/she will enter the second phase of
      the study in which he/she continues taking Sertraline but also randomly receives either
      Seroquel or placebo in conjunction with Sertraline for additional 8 weeks. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the efficacy of adjunctive Seroquel in treating SAD.

      This will be a single-site study aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy
      of quetiapine as compared to placebo in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. This
      will be an 8-week open-label sertraline trial followed by a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group prospective study. Participants will first receive
      sertraline (25-200 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Patients who remain symptomatic - are considered
      refractory - and meet inclusion criteria will be randomized and enter the double-blind phase.
      They will receive either adjunctive quetiapine (25-400 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. The
      primary outcome measures are change in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale(LSAS) and Clinical
      Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The proposed sample size is 80 subjects.
      Patients will be discontinued from the study if needed due to ineffectiveness or excessive
      side effects. Measurements of changes in efficacy and side effects will be carried out every
      weekly visit. Enrollment will occur over 12 months.

          -  Male and female outpatients, age 18-65.

          -  Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), generalized subtype, by DSM-IV criteria.

          -  Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) rating greater than or equal to 50 for both
             phases.

          -  Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D-17) score less than or equal to 16.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women or others not using acceptable means of birth control
             (e.g., IUD, oral contraceptives, barrier devices, condoms and foam, implanted
             progesterone rods stabilized for at least 3 months).

          -  Patients with current or history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or other
             psychotic conditions.

          -  Patients with a history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence within the last

          -  Patients with significant unstable medical illness, including any medical pathology
             considered not well-controlled with conventional treatment, i.e., that may require
             during the study period medication adjustment, ongoing tests or procedures, intensive
             treatment or hospitalization. In addition, baseline laboratory tests will be conducted
             and required to be within normal limits or have no clinical significance for patient
             entry in the study.

          -  Severe personality disorders likely to interfere with study participation or who, in
             the investigator's judgment, pose a current, serious suicidal or homicidal risk.

          -  Ongoing psychotherapy directed toward the treatment of social anxiety disorder.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to sertraline and quetiapine.
