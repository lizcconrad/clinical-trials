      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of the OcuMetrics system to measure
      oxygen on the surface of the eye. Oxygen is important to the health of the cornea. The
      proposed instrument will take advantage of phosphorescent dyes that are sensitive to oxygen
      concentrations to monitor oxygen concentrations on the surface of the eye. This will have
      obvious applications in eye research and contact lens testing.
