  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard therapy for patients who have locally advanced breast cancer is to receive
      chemotherapy before surgical removal of tumor. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).
      Chemotherapy is used to shrink the tumor before surgery, which sometimes may allow for a
      smaller portion of the breast to be removed. Receiving chemotherapy before surgery may
      sometimes also allow for smaller portions of the breast to be removed. Getting chemotherapy
      prior to surgery may also control any hidden metastatic disease and thereby decrease the risk
      of cancer relapse. Pre-surgery chemotherapy is a standard management approach for locally
      advanced breast cancer.

      Different combinations of drugs can be used as part of the pre-surgery chemotherapy. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if using a chemotherapy regimen of TC is effective way
      to manage locally advanced breast cancer (Stage IIA- IIIB) when the TC is given before
      surgery. The investigators also hope this study will help us to better understand how the
      tumor tissue is affected by this combination of chemotherapy drugs.

      The TC drug combination is FDA approved for use in treating breast cancer, and it has been
      shown to be equally effective as other commonly used chemotherapy regimens when used after
      surgery; but, the TC drug combination has not yet been studied in conjunction with NAC for
      use before surgery. The investigators will be studying the combination of TC used before
      surgery as a means of possibly shrinking the tumor.

      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study of cyclophosphamide and docetaxel/taxotere
      (TC) every 3 weeks in Her2 (-) subjects with locally advanced breast cancer. It is designed
      to assess (1) the clinical and pathologic response rates to this regimen, as well as its
      tolerability in this subject population, and (2) the expression of Tiam1 in tumor-associated
      fibroblasts pre and post treatment.

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study is the complete response rate for evaluable participants on neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and docetaxel. A clinical complete response (cCR) is defined as resolution of all palpable masses.</description>

    <measure>Change in mean Tiam1 expression levels before and after therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistic plots and confidence intervals will summarize the observed changes in Tiam1 expression levels before and after therapy. Although primarily descriptive, changes in mean levels pre and post therapy will be tested using the paired t-test or Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. Other secondary exploratory analyses will investigate associations between the observed changes in Tiam1 expression and the observed clinical response rate. Regression models will be used to investigate these associations.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women 18 years of age or older

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the breast, with T2 (T&gt;2.0 cm) N0 or more
             advanced disease.

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Disease must be clinically or radio-graphically measurable or evaluable.

          -  Incisional or core needle biopsy, yielding sufficient tissue for histologic
             confirmation of adenocarcinoma, hormone receptor analysis and Her2 testing; and Tiam-1
             expression.

          -  Subjects may have received no prior chemotherapy for breast cancer. Subjects may have
             received up to 3 months of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, provided they have been
             re-staged and are still eligible for this study, and have been off hormonal therapy at

             than 1.5 mg/dl; Serum ALT: less than 2.5 x institutional upper normal limit;
