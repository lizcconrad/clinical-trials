  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As studies continue to debate the effects of quality of life on survival, increased attention
      is being focused on investigating complementary alternative therapies to boost overall total
      health in cancer patients . Art therapy is an interesting growing field, which has shown
      promise to positively influence quality of life in the pediatric and adult oncology
      population alike. As there is a paucity of well controlled complete studies in this field,
      the investigators propose to study the impact of art therapy sessions in women with breast
      cancer with quantitative and qualitative analysis of emotional health and physical symptoms.

      The results of the investigators study will have widespread applicability to oncology
      programs that wish to offer/implement such sessions to their palliative and non-palliative
      outpatients in an effort to address the important concept of whole person care.

    <description>For participants who will be part of the art therapy intervention, the art therapy group will be a closed group for eight women with breast cancer who are in treatment and recently have had surgery. The group will meet once a week for two hours over a period of 8 weeks, and will focus on exploring the expressive capabilities of art making in a supportive group. This group will be held in the conference room at the Cedars Breast Clinic. Each week will revolve around a theme that pertains to the experience of women living with breast cancer, and will be guided by the women's needs in the group. A broad range of art materials will be made available and various art techniques explored. No art experience is necessary. The intervention group will also need to fill out simple questionnaires before the art therapy groups starts and after the group finishes</description>
