  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to learn about how Pristiq is currently being used in
      general practice and how psychiatrists and primary care physicians currently perceive Pristiq
      in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and adherence compared to other treatments for major
      depressive disorder (MDD).

      It is retrospective patient chart study among psychiatrists and primary care physicians
      (PCPs) treating patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). Physicians will be
      asked general medical questions in order to quantify their prescribing behavior and their
      perception of treatment performance. A retrospective patient chart review will then be
      performed and patient data will be collected to document patient characteristics and actual
      treatment outcomes. Upon qualification, specific instructions for chart review will be
      provided. Once the identified charts are pulled, the physicians are instructed to continue
      with the on-line survey. In total, there will be approximately 450 psychiatrists and 450
      primary care physicians participating in this trial.
