        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced DTC (papillary, follicular, Hurthle
             cell);

          2. Absence of sensitivity to therapeutic radioiodine;

          3. Measurable disease, defined as at least one non-bony lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least one dimension as confirmed with spiral CT scan

          4. Life expectancy &gt;3 months; ECOG performance status (PS) 0, 1, or 2; Karnofsky
             performance status of ≥60%;

          5. Subjects with a normal/acceptable hematological profile

          6. Subjects with adequate renal function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of any of the following:

               -  Radiotherapy or chemotherapy &lt;4 weeks prior to baseline visit; (Concurrent and/or
                  prior therapy with octreotide will be allowed, provided tumor progression on this
                  therapy has been demonstrated; Concurrent and/or prior therapy with
                  biphosphonates will be allowed)

               -  Radiotherapy to ≥25% of bone marrow;

          2. Major surgery &lt;4 weeks prior to baseline visit;

          3. Any other ongoing investigational agents within 4 weeks before dosing;

          4. Subjects who suffered from an acute cardiac event within the last 12 months, including
             myocardial infarction, cardiac arrythmia, admission for unstable angina, cardiac
             angioplasty, or stenting;

          5. QTc prolongation (defined as QTc interval ≥500 msecs) or other significant ECG
             abnormalities (e.g. frequent ventricular ectopy, evidence of ongoing myocardial
             ischemia);

          6. Subjects with active vascular disease, either myocardial or peripheral;

          7. Subjects with proliferative and/or vascular retinopathy;

          8. Subjects with known active liver disease (alcoholic, drug/toxin induced, genetic, or
             autoimmune) other than related to tumor metastases;

          9. Subjects with known CNS metastatic disease (Exception: Subjects with treated CNS
             metastases stable by radiographic examinations &gt;6 months after definitive therapy
             administered, are eligible);

         10. Subjects testing positive to one of the following viruses: HIV, HBV or HCV;

         11. Any of the following conditions:

               -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture;

               -  History of abdominal fistula, gastro-intestinal perforation, active
                  diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess or gastro-intestinal tract bleeding
                  within 6 months of dosing;

               -  Any history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 6 months of dosing;

               -  Current use of therapeutic warfarin (Note: Low molecular weight heparin and
                  prophylactic low-dose warfarin [INR&lt;1.2 X ULN] are permitted);

               -  History of bleeding disorder, including subjects with hemophilia, disseminated
                  intravascular coagulation (DIC), or any other abnormality of coagulation
                  potentially predisposing subjects to bleeding;

               -  Poorly controlled depression or anxiety disorder, or recent (within the previous
                  6 months) suicidal ideation;

         12. Subjects with an ongoing requirement for immunosuppressive treatment, including the
             use of glucocorticoids or cyclosporin, or with a history of chronic use of any such
             medication within the last 4 weeks before dosing;

         13. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
