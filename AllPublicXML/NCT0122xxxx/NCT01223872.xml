      This two-part research study will compare childhood cancer survivors receiving specialized
      follow-up care in the REACH for Survivorship clinic to patients receiving routine follow-up
      care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge gained by attending a multispecialty Survivorship Clinic which will be measured by comparison of self report with medical record data in both cross-sectional and longitudinal approach.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to data from patient interviews, a review of medical records will include general patient demographic data as well as data regarding cancer diagnosis, treatment and ongoing follow-up care.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterizing how the initial consultation in a specialized clinic impacts childhood cancer survivors' knowledge of their cancer diagnosis, treatment, and risk of late effects by comparing patient's understanding among 3 sampled timepoints.</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-clinic and a post-clinic interviews at 1 and 3 months.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>An analysis of differences in relative levels of recommended screening for late effects that childhood cancer survivors have received based on the type of their long-term follow-up care comparing medical records against Survivorship Care Plan.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scored responses will allow for quantitative analysis of differences within and between the cohorts of patients</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>A qualitative evaluation of program feedback will serve to improve the care provided in the REACH for Survivorship clinic</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
