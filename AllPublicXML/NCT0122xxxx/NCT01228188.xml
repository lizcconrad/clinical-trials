  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surgical treatment of
      FTMH using an inverted ILM repositioning to improve anatomical and functional outcomes in
      patients with a macular hole.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the anatomical closure rate of macular hole is around 90% using pars plana
      vitrectomy with ILM peeling. Improvement of visual acuity is around 80% including stage II to
      IV. With macular hole greater than 400 μm there is higher risk of surgical failure and visual
      acuity is usually less than 0.2. Large macular holes are more likely to have flat-open type
      closure, which is anatomical success but has limited improvement in visual acuity. Inverted
      ILM repositioning will form a scaffold for glial cells, which allows their migration and
      proliferation. This process will close the macular hole and secure it from re-opening, and
      will reduce the risk of flat-open type of closure.

      The aim of this study is to estimate the efficiency and safety of inverted ILM repositioning
      in the treatment of macular hole with a minimum diameter exceeding 400 μm and compare results
      with the currently used methods of surgical large macular holes treatment.

    <intervention_name>Inverted ILM Repositioning</intervention_name>
    <description>Three port pars plana vitrectomy is performed by one surgeon (JR). Induction of PVD is initiated by active suction with the vitrectomy probe over the ONH and continued peripherally. First a 0.6-1.0mm piece of ILM surrounding the macular hole is removed. Then significant margin of ILM in macular hole circumference is released while staying connected at the base to the macularrhexis border. Excess of ILM is trimmed. Perfluorocarbon is administrated, stabilizing ILM flap and facilitating the flap repositioning. Trypan Blue is used to stain the ILM. ILM flap is pressed down over the macular hole. The procedure is ended by SF6 gas tamponade. Even in absence of cataract formation, a combined procedure is performed because of exact peripheral vitreous shaving and prevention of cataract formation.</description>
