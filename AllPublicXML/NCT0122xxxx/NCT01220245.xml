  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this multicentre Randomized Clinical Trial, the heparin-bonded endoluminal bypass will be
      compared to the surgical venous femoro-popliteal bypass, based on the non-inferiority
      principle for the patency. Besides equal patency, an improved quality of life is expected.
      Recruitment will take the first two years and patients will be followed during five years.
      Patients with an indication for surgical bypass, classified category 3-6 with a &gt;50% stenosis
      or occlusion of the SFA over &gt;/=10 cm in length will be included. At least one crural artery
      should be patent without significant lesions.
