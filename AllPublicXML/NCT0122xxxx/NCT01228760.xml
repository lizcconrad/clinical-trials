  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this dose escalation study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)
      and the recommended Phase 2 dose of ASG-5ME in subjects with castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two components. The first aims to establish a safe dose of ASG-5ME. Once
      identified, the safety and preliminary estimate of antitumor activity of ASG-5ME will be
      tested in additional subjects with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who are either
      chemotherapy naïve or chemotherapy exposed in expanded cohorts.
