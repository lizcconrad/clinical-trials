      This study has 2 purposes:

      The first purpose of the study is to test a new family of Boston Scientific Implantable
      Cardioverter Defibrillators (&quot;ICDs&quot;) and cardiac resynchronization therapy ICDs (&quot;CRT-Ds&quot;)
      and show how well these new devices work in patients. This new family is called the INCEPTA
      ICD and the INCEPTA CRT-D.

      The second purpose of the study is to collect data from a feature that monitors breathing. It
      is called the Respiratory Rate Trend (RRT). These data will help to better understand how
      changes in breathing relate to changes in clinical conditions.

      Study Purpose

      Study purpose I:

      To evaluate and document appropriate clinical performance of the INCEPTA (DR and VR)
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system and the INCEPTA cardiac resynchronization
      therapy ICD (CRT-D) system and associated application software.

      Study purpose II:

      Demonstrate the clinical relevance of chronic ambulatory daily median Respiratory Rate Trend
      (RRT) in HF patients

      Study Device

        -  INCEPTA (DR and VR) implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system (Models F160,
           F161, F162, F163)

        -  INCEPTA cardiac resynchronization therapy ICD (CRT-D) system (Models P162, P163, P165)

      Indication ICD / CRT-D Indication according to standard clinical practice

      Study Objectives

      The study has two primary objectives, linked to the respective study purposes:

      For purpose I:

      The objective is to collect data on the clinical performance of the INCEPTA ICD and CRT-D
      devices during standard clinical use at implant, pre-discharge and at a 1-month post-implant.
      Clinical performance included analysis of pacing thresholds, pacing impedance, sensing
      thresholds, number of successfully converted VT/VF episodes, induced episodes detection
      times, spontaneous episodes, wanded telemetry, adverse events (AEs) and product experiences.

      For purpose II:

      The objective is to show that daily median respiratory rate increases more in patients who
      experience an HF-event (Group 1) than in patients who do not experience an HF-event (Group
      2).

      This is a prospective, multi-centre, field following study.

      Up to 35 study centers in the International geography will enrol 120 patients.

    <time_frame>Results were captured from implant time window to the first event for patients with HFE, up to an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the change in respiratory rate trend over time was made between patients who experienced a protocol-defined HF event (HFE) (Group1: Patients with a HFE) and patients who did not experience a protocol-defined heart failure event (Group 2: Patients without a HFE). Only patients with at least 3 valid daily respiratory rate values (60%) out of each 5-day window were evaluated. The objective was to show that daily median respiratory rate increases more in patients who experience a HFE (Group 1) than in patients who do not experience an HFE (Group 2). A comparison between patients who experience a HFE (Group 1) and patients who do not experience a HFE (Group 2). Two average daily median respiratory rates were done per patient: 60 to 56 days before an index time and 11 to 7 days before the same index time; the difference between these two averaged daily median respiratory rates was done. Index time=day of the first HFE (Group 1) and day of 6-month visit (Group 2).</description>

        <title>Evaluate the Daily Median Respiratory Rate Trend in Patients Who Experience a HF-event Compared to Patients Who do Not Experience a HF-event.</title>
        <description>A comparison of the change in respiratory rate trend over time was made between patients who experienced a protocol-defined HF event (HFE) (Group1: Patients with a HFE) and patients who did not experience a protocol-defined heart failure event (Group 2: Patients without a HFE). Only patients with at least 3 valid daily respiratory rate values (60%) out of each 5-day window were evaluated. The objective was to show that daily median respiratory rate increases more in patients who experience a HFE (Group 1) than in patients who do not experience an HFE (Group 2). A comparison between patients who experience a HFE (Group 1) and patients who do not experience a HFE (Group 2). Two average daily median respiratory rates were done per patient: 60 to 56 days before an index time and 11 to 7 days before the same index time; the difference between these two averaged daily median respiratory rates was done. Index time=day of the first HFE (Group 1) and day of 6-month visit (Group 2).</description>
        <time_frame>Results were captured from implant time window to the first event for patients with HFE, up to an average of 9 months</time_frame>
        <population>HF events were reported and adjudicated to classify patients into group 1 or 2. Group 1=17 HFEs in 13 patients. For patients with multiple HFEs,only the first with sufficient data was used. 8/13 with a HFE had data for the endpoint analysis.Group 2=95 patients with 9 month follow-up. 90/95 had data eligible for inclusion in the endpoint analysis.</population>
