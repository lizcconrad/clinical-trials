    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the PneumRx Lung Volume Reduction
      Coil (LVRC) in a population of patients with emphysema. The PneumRx, Inc. LVRC is a used as a
      less invasive alternative to lung volume reduction surgery. The PneumRx LVRC is designed as
      an alternative to lung volume reduction surgery, potentially achieving the desired reduction
      in lung volume limiting the risks associated with major surgery, such as illness or death.
      This device is deployed through a bronchoscope and requires no incision.
