    <textblock>
      Infants born between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation, known as 'late preterm', are more likely
      to be admitted to a special care nursery, and more likely to suffer respiratory complications
      than infants born at term. The use of antenatal corticosteroids has been shown to improve
      lung function in very premature infants, but has not been evaluated in those likely to
      deliver in the late preterm period.

      This research study will attempt to answer the following primary research question: Do
      steroids, compared to no steroids, decrease babies' need for oxygen support when given to
      pregnant women at least 12 to 24 hours before they deliver at 34 weeks to 36 weeks gestation?
      The research study will also collect information on whether steroids improve the chances that
      the baby will not get sick from other causes.

      Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids (ALPS): A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial:

      The rate of preterm birth has steadily increased in the United States over the past 10 years.
      This increase is driven in part by the rising rate of late preterm birth, defined as those
      births occurring between 34 and 36 weeks. Late preterm infants experience a higher rate of
      readmission than their term counterparts, and these infants are more likely to suffer
      complications such as respiratory distress, kernicterus, feeding difficulties, and
      hypoglycemia. Late preterm infants also have a higher mortality for all causes when compared
      to term infants. The use of antenatal corticosteroids has been shown to be beneficial in
      women at risk for preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks but has not been evaluated in those
      likely to deliver in the late preterm period. If shown to reduce the need for respiratory
      support and thus to decrease the rate of special care nursery admissions and improve
      short-term outcomes, the public health and economic impact will be considerate.This protocol
      describes a randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate whether antenatal corticosteroids
      can decrease the rate of neonatal respiratory support, thus decreasing the rate of neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) admissions and improving short-term outcomes in the late preterm
      infant.

      Two follow-up studies will be conducted concurrently. The first follow-up study will examine
      if the positive effects of betamethasone on lung function will persist in children at 6 years
      of age of mothers randomized to betamethasone with an expected late preterm delivery.
      Neonatal respiratory morbidity is associated with an increased risk of adverse childhood
      respiratory disease. Thus it is quite plausible that the effect of betamethasone, in reducing
      neonatal morbidity, particularly TTN, will translate into improved respiratory morbidity in
      early childhood.The primary outcome is childhood respiratory disease defined by a composite
      outcome of abnormal pulmonary function test (PFT) measured by spirometry, physician diagnosis
      of asthma, or other respiratory illnesses with medication.

      The second follow-up study will examine whether late preterm antenatal betamethasone
      treatment is associated with long-term neurocognitive functioning, and whether there are any
      long-term consequences of what is believed to be transient neonatal hypoglycemia. Cognitive
      function will be measured by the Differential Ability Scales 2nd Edition (DAS-II) core
      components of the general conceptual ability (GCA) that includes verbal ability, non-verbal
      reasoning ability and spatial ability. The primary outcome is defined as a GCA score of &lt;85
      (1 standard deviation below the mean) at 6 years of age or greater.

        Singleton Pregnancy. A twin pregnancy reduced to singleton (either spontaneously or
        therapeutically) before 14,0 weeks by project gestational age is acceptable

        Gestational age at randomization between 34,0weeks and 36,5 weeks confirmed by study
        criteria

        High probability of delivery in the late preterm period (any one of the following):

          -  Membrane rupture as defined by the occurrence of any two of the following: pooling of
             fluid in the vaginal vault, positive Nitrazine test, ferning of vaginal fluid,
             positive AmniSure test; or any one of the following: indigo carmine pooling in the
             vagina after amnioinfustion, visible leakage of amniotic fluid from the cervix

        or

          -  Preterm labor with intact membranes. Preterm labor is defined as at least 6 regular
             uterine contractions in an observation period of no more than 60 minutes and at least
             one of the following: cervix greater than or equal to 3cm dilated or at least 75%
             effaced

        or

          -  Planned delivery by induction of labor or cesarean section in no less than 24 hours
             and no more than 7 days, as deemed necessary by the provider. An induction must be
             scheduled to start by 36,5 weeks at the latest, whereas a cesarean delivery must be
             scheduled by 36,6 weeks at the latest. Therefore the latest gestational age for
             randomization is 36,4 weeks for a planned induction. The planned delivery may be for
             any indication, such as the following: prior myomectomy, prior classical cesarean,
             intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), oligohydramnios, preeclampsia, nonreassuring
             fetal heart rate tracing warranting delivery, abruption, placenta previa

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior antenatal corticosteroid course during the pregnancy because of potential
             contamination of the placebo group

          2. Candidate for stress dose corticosteroids because of chronic steroid therapy to
             prevent suppression of adrenal gland, because of potential contamination of the
             placebo group

          3. Twin gestation reduced to a singleton gestation at or after 14 weeks 0 days by project
             gestational age either spontaneously or therapeutically

          5. Maternal contraindication to betamethasone: hypersensitivity reaction to any
             components of the medication, idiopathic thromboycytopenic purpura, systemal fungal
             infection in case of exacerbation by betamethasone, use of amphotericin B due to the
             possibility of heart failure with concomitant betamethasone

          6. Pre-gestational diabetes - exclude if the patient was on medication (insulin,
             glyburide) prior to pregnancy

          7. Delivery expected within 12 hours of randomization, because of insufficient time of
             corticosteroids to confer benefit, including any of the following:

             A. Rupture of Membranes (ROM) does not satisfy protocol criteria - exclude if the
             patient being evaluated for Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (pPROM), does not
             have preterm labor or planned delivery and does not satisfy the spontaneous membrane
             rupture criteria (any 2 of: positive Nitrazine test, pooling of fluid in the vaginal
             vault test or ferning of vaginal fluid; or indigo carmine pooling in the vagina after
             amnioinfusion; or visible leakage of amniotic fluid from the cervix) B. Rupture of the
             membranes in the presence of more than 6 contractions per hour or cervical dilation of
             3 cm or more, unless oxytocin was withheld for at least 12 hours (other induction
             agents allowed) C. Chorioamnionitis - exclude if patient is diagnosed with
             chorioamnionitis D. Cervical dilation ≥ 8 cm E. Evidence of non-reassuring fetal
             status requiring immediate delivery

          8. Participation in another interventional study that influences neonatal morbidity and
             mortality

          9. Participation in this trial in a previous pregnancy

         10. Delivery at a non-network hospital

         11. At 36, 0 weeks to 36, 5 weeks and quota for 36 weeks already met. To ensure there is
             an adequate proportion of women presenting at 34 to 35 weeks of gestation, enrollment
             will be restricted so that no more than 50% of the women in the trial present at 36
             weeks.

         12. No ultrasound &lt; 20 weeks for unsure last menstrual period (LMP). If the patient has an
             unsure LMP but she had no dating ultrasound before 20 weeks by ultrasound parameters,
             she is excluded.

         13. No ultrasound &lt; 24 weeks for sure LMP. If the patient has an sure LMP but she had no
             dating ultrasound before 24 weeks by ultrasound parameters, she is excluded

         14. Multifetal gestation. Exclude if current multifetal gestation or a single gestation
             resulting from a reduction of a multiple of higher order than twins
