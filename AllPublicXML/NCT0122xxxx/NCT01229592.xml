  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, several new methods for treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections
      (CRBSI) such as antibiotic or antiseptic lock-therapy have been developed with variable
      success [1-10].

      Long-term tunnelled central venous catheters provide a reliable access for administration of
      chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition or haemodialysis. However, they are not free of
      complications such as bacteremia. The need to preserve these intra-vascular devices as long
      as is possible in patients in whom conventional treatment was failed makes emerge antibiotic
      lock-technique.

      Ethanol lock-therapy was demonstrate her utility in this cases. But no study has yet been
      published using the ethanol lock-therapy as a prophylactic therapy in catheter related
      infections, neither her application in short-term CVCs.

      Objectives: To investigate the value of a ethanol-lock solution in the prophylaxis of
      non-tunnelled short-term CVC related infections in a heart post-surgical intensive care unit
      (HPSICU).

      Methods: An academic, prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial is proposed.
      Patients at HPSICU who have a CVC more than 48 h will be randomized in two arms (ethanol-lock
      or control group with conventional measurements such as anticoagulants). In the follow-up
      period, we will register all necessary data to evaluate the end-points of study (CBRSI rate,
      catheter colonization rate, hospital stay, antimicrobial consume and adverse events due to
      ethanol).
