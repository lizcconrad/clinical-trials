  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 5-year, two-site randomized clinical trial, we propose to test the efficacy of the
      CATCH-IT primary care/Internet based depression prevention intervention against Attention
      Monitoring Psychoeducation (AMPE) in preventing the onset of depressive episodes in an
      intermediate to high risk group of adolescents aged 13-17. We plan to (a) identify high risk
      adolescents based on elevated scores on the PHQ-A, a screening measure of depressive
      symptoms; (b) recruit 400 (200 per site) of these at-risk adolescents to be randomized into
      either the CATCH-IT or the AMPE group; (c) assess outcomes at 2, 8, 12, 18, and 24 months
      post intake on measures of depressive symptoms, depressive diagnoses, other mental disorders,
      and on measures of role impairment in education, quality of life, attainment of educational
      milestones, and family functioning; and (d) conduct exploratory analyses to examine the
      effectiveness of this intervention program, moderators of protection, and potential ethnic
      and cultural differences in intervention response.

    <description>The CATCH-IT 2-R intervention has a motivational (3 PCP motivational interviews at time 0, 1.5 months and 12 months and 3 coaching phone calls at 2 and 4 weeks and 18 months) and an Internet component (with separate adolescent [14 modules] and parent [5 modules] programs). This revised and expanded intervention will include a comprehensive approach to reducing modifiable risk factors and enhancing resiliency factors associated with increased or decreased risk of depression, respectively, proposed by Spence and Reinecke.148 The revised CATCH-IT &quot;Tracker&quot; will monitor time in study and deploy elements of the intervention based on time since enrollment, including computer and human elements (e.g. calls, doctor visits).</description>

    <description>The AMPE components are similar to those employed in previous primary care based quality improvement/Chronic Care Model Interventions (patient education [psycho-education described below], provider training [described in Case Finding and Recruitment], active monitoring and referral [case management, discussed under assessments], physician and nurse education and routine contact with PCP [study design rationale]). This Internet site will focus on assisting parents and adolescents in early identification of need for treatment and will also target stigma and negative attitudes toward treatment of mental disorders we have previously identified as barriers to seeking and adhering to treatment.</description>
