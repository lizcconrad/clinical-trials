  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation, including physical training, has become accepted treatment following
      myocardial infarction, coronary stent implantation and coronary bypass operation. Besides
      modifying patients' risk profile for future coronary problems, the focus is on improving
      exercise capacity. The ability to be able to perform at a higher maximal level is a strong
      predictor for outcome (new cardiovascular events and mortality). The main purpose of this
      study is to evaluate whether aerobic interval training outweighs more classical moderate
      endurance training in improving exercise capacity. During interval training, patients perform
      exercise at high intensity, but for only a couple of minutes and then recover at a lower
      intensity. Such intervals are repeated. Preliminary evidence from smaller studies suggests
      that this type of training leads to a larger increase in exercise capacity, compared to the
      more traditional endurance training at moderate intensity.

      In addition, mechanisms that might explain how this improvement is achieved, as well as
      safety and impact on quality of life will be studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with CAD (post-PCI, post-MI, post-CABG) and a left ventricular ejection
             fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40%

          -  the presence of CAD is defined as prior angiographically documented stenotic lesion(s)
             of &gt; 75%, or documented myocardial infarction (biochemical, ECG, echocardiographic
             documentation).

          -  patients are on optimal medical treatment and stable with regard to symptoms and
             pharmacotherapy for at least 4 weeks

          -  in practice, patients will have been hospitalized at least 4 weeks prior to
             participation in the training programme because of PCI, MI or CABG

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  significant intercurrent illness last 6 weeks

          -  known severe ventricular arrhythmia with functional or prognostic significance

          -  significant myocardial ischemia, hemodynamic deterioration or exercise-induced
             arrhythmia at baseline testing

          -  recent CABG (&lt; 30 days)

          -  other heart disease that limits exercise tolerance (valve disease with significant
             hemodynamic consequences, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy etc.)

          -  co-morbidity that may significantly influence one-year prognosis

          -  functional or mental disability that may limit exercise

          -  a habit of regular vigorous exercise or participation in a programme of exercise
             training less than 3 months before inclusion

          -  acute or chronic inflammatory diseases or malignancy, the use of anti-inflammatory
             drugs or immune suppression

          -  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;25ml/min/1.73m2

          -  hemoglobin &lt; 10g/dl

          -  severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  participation in another clinical trial
