  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCLC is the most aggressive and lethal form of lung cancer, typically very sensitive to
      cytotoxic therapy when first diagnosed, but associated with a high incidence of tumour
      relapse and a very poor life expectancy. Combination chemotherapy based on cisplatin or
      carboplatin and etoposide represents the most widely used regimen. Despite of the high
      response rate, approximately 80% of patients with limited disease and nearly all patients
      with extended disease develop disease relapse or progression. Topotecan is, at present, the
      only approved second line treatment in Europe.

      The search of a new therapeutic agent that could alter the natural history of SCLC would be
      an important goal to be reached. LBH589 (Panobinostat) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor available for intravenous and oral administration. LBH589 could be classified as
      PAN-DAC inhibitor targeting both histone and non histone proteins and as such it could be
      suitable for combination with cytotoxics. Three phase I dose escalation studies with both the
      intravenous and the oral formulation of LBH589, examining various dose schedules of
      administration have been conducted in advanced solid tumours and haematological malignancies.

      Single agent activity was observed in phase I in patients with haematological cancer. In
      solid tumours one response (Hormone-refractory Prostatic Cancer) and some prolonged
      stabilizations have been observed with intravenous formulation. Phase II studies are now in
      progress.
