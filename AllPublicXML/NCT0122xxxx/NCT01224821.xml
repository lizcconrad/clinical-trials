  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study RIT-II-001 is a phase II, multicenter study of the safety, tumor and organ dosimetry,
      dosimetry methods, and efficacy of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody for the treatment of patients
      with low-grade or transformed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The primary objective
      of this study is to demonstrate that each site could accurately conduct the whole body
      dosimetry required for the safe and effective dosing of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody.
      Additional objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, dosimetry, and safety of
      Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody.

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Therapeutic Doses (TD) (Total Body Dose)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to 142 months in Study 104731 or were followed in the long-term follow-up study (Study 104526) for up to 136.3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on their platelet count and body weight. Participants received different TDs of TST. For obese participants (weighing more than 137% of their calculated lean body weight), the calculation to determine the administered activity (mCi) was performed using the maximum effective mass (i.e., the minimum of the participant's mass and 137% of their calculated lean body weight). The administered activity (mCi) for participants with a Baseline platelet count of 100001-149999 cells/millimeter cubed (mm^3) was reduced to a 65 cGy total body dose, after any adjustment for obesity.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants (par.) received radioimmunotherapy of tositumomab (TST) and Iodine I 131 TST in 2 phases (Ph.): Ph. 1, dosimetric dose; Ph. 2, therapeutic dose. Par. were evaluated until disease progression, they died, or they were on study for 2 years. Par. completing 2 years of study could enter a long-term follow-up study (BEX104526; NCT00240591).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>TST and Iodine I 131 TST</title>
          <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of unlabeled tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5 milliCurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 TST IV. Serial whole body sodium iodide probe scintillation counts and whole body conjugate view gamma camera scans obtained approximately 1 hour after DD administration and then daily for the next 7 days were used to determine the radioactive clearance (RC) and the dose of iodine I 131 TST required to deliver a 75 centigray (cGy) therapeutic dose (TD). The TD was administered 7-14 days after the DD and consisted of TST 450 mg and an activity of Iodine 131 calculated to deliver 75 cGy or 65 cGy of total body irradiation, depending on platelet count, and 35 mg TST. Participants who had completed at least 6 months of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in Study BEX104526 were followed for up to 10 years.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Therapeutic Doses (TD) (Total Body Dose)</title>
        <description>Based on their platelet count and body weight. Participants received different TDs of TST. For obese participants (weighing more than 137% of their calculated lean body weight), the calculation to determine the administered activity (mCi) was performed using the maximum effective mass (i.e., the minimum of the participant’s mass and 137% of their calculated lean body weight). The administered activity (mCi) for participants with a Baseline platelet count of 100001–149999 cells/millimeter cubed (mm^3) was reduced to a 65 cGy total body dose, after any adjustment for obesity.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to 142 months in Study 104731 or were followed in the long-term follow-up study (Study 104526) for up to 136.3 months</time_frame>

Serial whole body sodium iodide probe scintillation counts and whole body conjugate view gamma camera scans obtained approximately 1 hour after DD administration and then daily for the next 7 days were used to determine the radioactive clearance (RC) and the dose of iodine I 131 TST required to deliver a 75 centigray (cGy) therapeutic dose (TD). The TD was administered 7-14 days after the DD and consisted of TST 450 mg and an activity of Iodine 131 calculated to deliver 75 cGy or 65 cGy of total body irradiation, depending on platelet count, and 35 mg TST. Participants who had completed at least 6 months of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in Study BEX104526 were followed for up to 10 years.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Therapeutic Doses (TD) (Total Body Dose)</title>
          <description>Based on their platelet count and body weight. Participants received different TDs of TST. For obese participants (weighing more than 137% of their calculated lean body weight), the calculation to determine the administered activity (mCi) was performed using the maximum effective mass (i.e., the minimum of the participant’s mass and 137% of their calculated lean body weight). The administered activity (mCi) for participants with a Baseline platelet count of 100001–149999 cells/millimeter cubed (mm^3) was reduced to a 65 cGy total body dose, after any adjustment for obesity.</description>

        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented response until disease progression. Disease progression is defined as a &gt;=25% increase from the nadir value of the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions or the appearance of any new lesion. Individual lesions must be &gt;2 cm in diameter by radiographic evaluation or &gt;1 cm in diameter by physical examination.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to 142 months in Study 104731 or were followed in the long-term follow-up study (Study 104526) for up to 136.3 months</time_frame>

Serial whole body sodium iodide probe scintillation counts and whole body conjugate view gamma camera scans obtained approximately 1 hour after DD administration and then daily for the next 7 days were used to determine the radioactive clearance (RC) and the dose of iodine I 131 TST required to deliver a 75 centigray (cGy) therapeutic dose (TD). The TD was administered 7-14 days after the DD and consisted of TST 450 mg and an activity of Iodine 131 calculated to deliver 75 cGy or 65 cGy of total body irradiation, depending on platelet count, and 35 mg TST. Participants who had completed at least 6 months of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in Study BEX104526 were followed for up to 10 years.</description>

            <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of unlabeled tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5 milliCurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 TST IV. Serial whole body sodium iodide probe scintillation counts and whole body conjugate view gamma camera scans obtained approximately 1 hour after DD administration and then daily for the next 7 days were used to determine the radioactive clearance (RC) and the dose of iodine I 131 TST required to deliver a 75 centigray (cGy) therapeutic dose (TD). The TD was administered 7-14 days after the DD and consisted of TST 450 mg and an activity of Iodine 131 calculated to deliver 75 cGy or 65 cGy of total body irradiation, depending on platelet count, and 35 mg TST. Participants who had completed at least 6 months of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in Study BEX104526 were followed for up to 10 years.</description>
