    <textblock>
      tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that utilizes low amplitude direct currents
      applied via scalp electrodes to modulate the level of cortical excitability.Several studies
      have demonstrated that tDCS applied over the sensory-motor cortex has been able to decrease
      pain sensation and to increase pain threshold in healthy subjects and in chronic pain
      patients. The aim of this study was to test whether daily sessions of anodal tDCS repeated
      for 5 consecutive days may be effective in reducing pain in a large number of chronic pain
      patients. The cathode is usually applied over the right forhead above the eye. The aim of the
      study is to test whether daily sessions of tDCS repeated for 5 consecutive days will
      influence on ophthalmologic parametrs.

      Patients will recieve tDCS in a 5-day period of treatment. The participants will go through
      full ophtalmologic examination before and after the treatmnet In addition to the
      ophtalmologic examination Pain will be measured using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and
      the short form McGill questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Disability will be measured using the ( Pain
      Disability Index (PDI) of Life-54 scale (MSQoL-54). Depressive symptoms and anxiety will also
      be evaluated using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale and the
      State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Cognitive function will be mesured using minimental
      test.
