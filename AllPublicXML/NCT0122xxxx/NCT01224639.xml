  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine
      Candidate (TDV) (previously DENVax) in healthy adults when given as either a subcutaneous
      (SC) or intradermal (ID) injection at two dose levels (low and high). The vaccine will be
      given as two doses 90 days apart. Safety assessments include injection site evaluation and
      adverse events. The immune response generated after vaccination will be assessed up to 9
      months after the first vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, placebo-controlled, randomized study assessing the safety and
      tolerability of two dose levels (low and high) of TDV administered subcutaneously or
      intradermally in two doses separated by an interval of 90 days. Initial dosing of low dose
      cohort will be performed and Day 21 safety assessed prior to administration of second dose to
      low dose cohort on Day 90 and initial dosing of high dose cohort. Day 21 safety for the high
      dose cohort will be assessed prior to administration of second dose for this cohort. Safety
      (local injection site reactions and solicited and unsolicited adverse events) will be
      assessed through Day 120 post-first (1 month after the second dose). Immunogenicity will be
      assessed at specified time points up to Day 120 post-prime (1 month after the second dose)
      and again on Days 180 and 270 (6 and 9 months post-first).

    <description>Solicited local reactions were reported using a participant diary. Pain was categorized as Mild (aware of pain but it does not interfere with daily activity and no pain medication is taken); Moderate (aware of pain; there is interference with daily activity or it requires use of pain medication); Severe (aware of pain and it prevents daily activity), redness was categorized as Mild (greater than [&gt;] 15 millimeter [mm]); Moderate as (15-30 mm); Severe (&gt;30 mm), swelling was categorized as Mild (&lt;15 mm); Moderate (15-30 mm); Severe (&gt;30 mm), and itching was categorized as Mild (slight itching at injection site); Moderate (moderate itching at injection extremity); Severe (itching over entire body).</description>

    <description>Seroconversion was defined as a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) titer resulting in 50% reduction in plaques (PRNT[50]) &gt;=10 (if the pre-vaccination PRNT[50] value was &lt;10, indicated as a value of 5 in the immunogenicity data collection sheet) OR a PRNT(50) value that was &gt;=4-fold the pre-vaccination titer value (if the pre-vaccination PRNT[50] value was &gt;=10). Seroconversion was assessed for the four dengue serotypes: TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4. The 95% CIs for percentages are the exact CIs (%) based upon the binomial distribution. Percentages are based on the number of participants in the FAS with non-missing MN assay samples at each visit.</description>

Seroconversion is defined as post-vaccination PRNT(50) titer &gt;=10 where pre-vaccination PRNT 50 titer &lt;10, or post-vaccination PRNT(50) Titer &gt;=4-fold the pre-vaccination PRNT(50) titer value where pre-vaccination PRNT(50) titer &gt;=10.

TDV is a tetravalent dengue vaccine comprised of 4 recombinant, live attenuated dengue virus strains: TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4. High dose contains TDV-1: 2*10^4 PFU, TDV-2: 5*10^4 PFU, TDV-3: 1*10^5 PFU, and TDV-4: 3*10^5 PFU, total virus per dose: 4.7*10^5 PFU.</description>

          <title>Geometric Mean Neutralizing Antibody Titers (GMTs) of All Four Dengue Serotypes After First Vaccination</title>
          <description>GMT was assessed for the four dengue serotypes: Dengue TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4. GMTs and 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CIs) were calculated by taking the anti-logs of the means and 95% CI of the log transformed titers.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study vaccine and for whom valid pre- and post-dosing blood samples were received. Here 'n' is number of participants with non-missing microneutralization (MN) Assay samples.</population>

        <title>Rate of Seroconversion to Each of Four Dengue Serotypes After the First Vaccination</title>
        <description>Seroconversion was defined as a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) titer resulting in 50% reduction in plaques (PRNT[50]) &gt;=10 (if the pre-vaccination PRNT[50] value was &lt;10, indicated as a value of 5 in the immunogenicity data collection sheet) OR a PRNT(50) value that was &gt;=4-fold the pre-vaccination titer value (if the pre-vaccination PRNT[50] value was &gt;=10). Seroconversion was assessed for the four dengue serotypes: TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4. The 95% CIs for percentages are the exact CIs (%) based upon the binomial distribution. Percentages are based on the number of participants in the FAS with non-missing MN assay samples at each visit.</description>

        <title>Rate of Seroconversion to Each of Four Dengue Serotypes After the Second Vaccination</title>
        <description>Seroconversion was defined as a PRNT titer resulting in 50% reduction in plaques (PRNT[50]) &gt;=10 (if the pre-vaccination PRNT[50] value was &lt;10, indicated as a value of 5 in the immunogenicity data collection sheet) OR a PRNT(50) value that was &gt;=4-fold the pre-vaccination titer value (if the pre-vaccination PRNT[50] value was &gt;=10). Seroconversion was assessed for the four dengue serotypes: TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4. The 95% CIs for percentages are the exact CIs (%) based upon the binomial distribution. Percentages are based on the number of participants in the FAS with non-missing MN assay samples at each visit (n).</description>

        <description>Immune response was considered durable if the participant had detectable neutralizing antibodies (seroconversion) to all 4 dengue serotypes at 90 and 180 days after the second dose (i.e. Days 180 and 270, respectively). Seroconversion is defined as post-vaccination PRNT(50) titer &gt;=10 where pre-vaccination PRNT 50 titer &lt;10, or post-vaccination PRNT(50) Titer &gt;=4-fold the pre-vaccination PRNT(50) titer value where pre-vaccination PRNT(50) titer &gt;=10. Percentage of participants with seroconversion on Days 180 and 270 are based on the number of participants in the FAS with non-missing MN assay samples at each visit. The 95% CIs for percentages are the exact CIs (%) based upon the binomial distribution.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Durability of Immune Response</title>
          <description>Immune response was considered durable if the participant had detectable neutralizing antibodies (seroconversion) to all 4 dengue serotypes at 90 and 180 days after the second dose (i.e. Days 180 and 270, respectively). Seroconversion is defined as post-vaccination PRNT(50) titer &gt;=10 where pre-vaccination PRNT 50 titer &lt;10, or post-vaccination PRNT(50) Titer &gt;=4-fold the pre-vaccination PRNT(50) titer value where pre-vaccination PRNT(50) titer &gt;=10. Percentage of participants with seroconversion on Days 180 and 270 are based on the number of participants in the FAS with non-missing MN assay samples at each visit. The 95% CIs for percentages are the exact CIs (%) based upon the binomial distribution.</description>
          <population>The FAS included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study vaccine and for whom valid pre- and post-dosing blood samples were received.</population>

TDV is a tetravalent dengue vaccine comprised of 4 recombinant, live attenuated dengue virus strains: TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4. High dose contains TDV-1: 2*10^4 PFU, TDV-2: 5*10^4 PFU, TDV-3: 1*10^5 PFU, and TDV-4: 3*10^5 PFU, total virus per dose: 4.7*10^5 PFU.</description>
