    <textblock>
      In colorectal surgery, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended. The standard use
      of antibiotics for colorectal surgery is three doses.

      It has been reported that the surgical site infection rates of laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery are lower than open colorectal surgery. However, the evidence of proper application
      of antibiotic for laparoscopic colorectal surgery is still not enough.

      The investigators are researching the efficacy and safety of one dose prophylactic antibiotic
      in laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

      In colorectal surgery, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended. The standard use
      of antibiotics for colorectal surgery is three doses.

      One randomized controlled study reported that surgical site infection rates of three doses
      prophylactic antibiotics are lower than those of one dose in colorectal surgery (4.3 versus
      14.2%). But, surgical site infection rates between one dose and three doses were not
      different in laparoscopic subgroup of this study (11 versus 11%)

      It has been reported that the surgical site infection rates of laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery are lower than open colorectal surgery. However, the evidence of proper application
      of antibiotic for laparoscopic colorectal surgery is still not enough.
