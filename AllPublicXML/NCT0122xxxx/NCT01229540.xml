        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  T2DM was diagnosed according to the World Health Organization Expert Consultation
             Report 1999 and consisted of one of the following: fasting blood glucose (FBG) ≥7.0
             mmol/L (≥126 mg/dL), blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL) 2 hours after an oral
             glucose tolerance test (OGTT); or a random blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL).

          -  DR was clinically graded in accordance with the International Clinical Diabetic
             Retinopathy guidelines based on fundus fluorescence angiography.

          -  All participants with PDR underwent a comprehensive dilated fundus examination to
             detect DR by indirect ophthalmoscopy and were diagnosed by fundus fluorescence
             angiography.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if they had acute complications of diabetes mellitus, type 1
             diabetes mellitus, other types of diabetes, serious cardiovascular, hepatic, nephritic
             or other complications, other serious primary diseases or mental illness.
