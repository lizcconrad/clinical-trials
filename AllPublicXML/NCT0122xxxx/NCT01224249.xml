  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate, whether higher intake of selenium rich food
      items such as fish and shellfish, is associated with higher selenium blood levels.

      The secondary aim is to investigate the uptake of selenium from fish and shellfish and the
      incorporation of selenium from those foods into proteins in the human body. Furthermore, the
      impact of the natural variation in the genes that are responsible for the accumulation of
      selenium in the proteins will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selenium is an essential trace element that is incorporated into proteins in the human body
      and it hereby plays a major role in several important cellular processes. Previous studies
      have indicated that the selenium status of the Danish population is below the levels required
      to optimize the suggested protective effects of selenium towards major diseases including
      cancer. In Denmark, important natural sources of selenium are fish and shellfish.
