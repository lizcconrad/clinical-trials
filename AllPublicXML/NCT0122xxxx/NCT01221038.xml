      Background:

      Heat stroke is defined as a condition where the body temperature raises to dangerous level
      that may cause harm to body tissues and lead to multi-system clinical and pathological
      manifestations that might lead to death. Among heat stroke survivors a defect in
      thermoregulation develops as a consequence. In the IDF, every soldier who had a heat stroke,
      or is suspected to have had a heat stroke, must pass a heat intolerance test in the Unit of
      Military Physiology, after a rest period of 4-6 from the incident, which is the approximate
      period for thermoregulation to recuperate from the injury after a heat stroke. Until the heat
      intolerance test, the soldier must not train to avoid a repeat incident of heat stroke. The
      soldiers' ability to return to active duty is based on the results of the exam. The heat
      tolerance test and its criteria have been developed in the Physiology Unit throughout years
      of experience, and have been proved and adopted by several labs in Europe and in the United
      States. The criteria generally include baseline temperature and heart rate, and are based
      upon the physiological response of healthy men (soldiers) in the physical effort involved in
      the test.In recent years there is a growing trend in the IDF to integrate female soldiers in
      combat divisions. As a result, these females are exposed to physical efforts in various
      climate conditions as a part of their training, or a part of their active duty missions in
      the division. Therefore, the probability of an incidence of heat injuries increases among
      these soldiers.Research results indicate differences in the efficiency of thermoregulation
      mechanisms between men and women:

      It has been found that in women the threshold for sweating and vasodilatation is higher than
      in males. Additionally, although in women the mechanism for sweating is slower, and occurs at
      a later period, it is found that the relative part of sweating that evaporates is higher, so
      that women evaporate sweat more efficiently (to make up for the lower sweat quantities
      compared to men). Reduced efficiency of the thermoregulation mechanisms in women is also
      attributed to the differences in mass, body composition (fat and muscle mass), and physical
      fitness between the genders. In addition, the physiological changes that occur during the
      different phases of the menstrual cycle can affect core temperature at rest and
      thermoregulation. Different reports in literature indicate a decreased thermoregulation
      capacity in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle compared to the follicular phase.
      Apparently, thermoregulation capabilities in exercise are linked to progesterone blood
      levels, which are influenced by contraceptive pills and with the phase of the menstrual
      cycle.

      There are two factors that can cause incorrect diagnosis of the level of heat tolerance in
      females when the specific test is interpreted based on set criteria for men. These criteria
      are:

        1. The physiological differences between men and women

        2. The differences in women based on menstrual cycle and using contraceptive pills.

      Thus, there is a need to characterize and establish the normal values in a heat tolerance
      test for young females compared to males, and also to correspond to current menstrual cycle
      phase and use of contraceptive pills.

      Methods:

      on the first day of the research, the participants will undergo anthropometric examinations
      (measuring height, weight, BMI, fat content, maximum oxygen consumption). In addition, the
      participants will undergo a heat tolerance test protocol. The heat tolerance test will be
      conducted twice in every participant - once in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle,
      and a second time in the luteal phase of the cycle. During the protocol, the following
      information will be collected from each participant: heart rate, core temperature, skin
      temperature in three locations (chest, arm, and leg), oxygen consumption and liquid balance.

      The results of the examination will be compared to results of male participants who have
      previously undergone the heat tolerance test in the Unit of Military Physiology.

      Contribution to IDF:

      the research will allow administrating heat tolerance tests accurately and reliably to female
      soldiers that have been affected by heat injuries or are suspected to be heat intolerant.
