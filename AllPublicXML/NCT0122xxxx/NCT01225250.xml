  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy, safety, and ease of cartilaginous
      grafting using polydioxanone (PDS) plates in comparison to non-plated cartilaginous grafts as
      performed through an endonasal rhinoplasty approach in patients requiring a caudal septal
      extension (CSE) graft.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Live assessment of satisfaction with the grafts</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post operative</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be determined by a live assessment of satisfaction with the grafts at 12 months using a four-point categorical satisfaction scale (unsatisfied, satisfied, very satisfied, highly satisfied).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Tip Projection</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months Post opeartive</time_frame>
    <description>Tip projection will be measured as a ratio between a fixed distance established by the anterior most point of the intertragal notch to the anterior most portion of the cornea and a variable distance established by the distance between the anterior most point of the intertragal notch to the nasal tip using measurements recorded from Adobe Photoshop evaluation of standardized photography at 12 months postoperatively as compared to baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-treating blinded evaluator satisfaction assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post operative</time_frame>
    <description>A non-treating blinded evaluator will assess satisfaction with a four-point categorical satisfaction scale (unsatisfied, satisfied, very satisfied, highly satisfied) of subject's grafts using photographs from baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months and will consist of a blinded evaluation in which the physician is aware of the type of graft, but unaware of plating status or the specific grafting site.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of use</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Ease of use will be determined by the treating investigator using a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to demonstrate technical ease with a score of 0 mm being easy and a scale of 100 mm being extremely difficult.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be determined by rate of infection, rejection, and extrusion of the graft at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>During surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Intraoperative duration of the grafting procedure will be measured by an assistant using a stopwatch to record the time it takes to harvest, shape, and satisfactorily secure the graft.</description>

    <intervention_name>Polydioxanone (PDS) plates</intervention_name>
    <description>0.5 mm PDS Flexible Plate made of poly-p-dioxanone, an aliphatic polyester which is manufactured by polymerization of the monomer p-dioxanone. Polydioxanone is a resorbable material degraded by hydrolysis and has been successfully used for bone discontinuities and septal reconstruction.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Caudal septal extension graft performed through endonasal rhinoplasty</intervention_name>
    <description>The caudal septal extension (CSE) graft is a common method used to alter tip projection, alar-columellar relationship, and nasolabial angle.5 However, it can be difficult to stabilize and straighten the CSE graft, especially when performed through an endonasal approach. Use of a polydioxanone plate would provide a scaffolding for the CSE graft and could allow for a technically easier and more predictable surgical procedure.</description>
