    <textblock>
      Phase I study to evaluate the excretion of radioactivity, the metabolic profile,
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability following a single oral administration of
      [14C]AZD2423 in healthy male volunteers aged 50 to 65 years (inclusive).The purpose of this
      study is to investigate how and how quickly AZD 2423 or its break down products are excreted
      by analysing blood, faeces and urine samples collected during the study.
