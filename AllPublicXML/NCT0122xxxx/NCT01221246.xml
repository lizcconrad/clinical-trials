  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether the investigational drug GM602, is
      effective and safe in the treatment of ischemic stroke (strokes caused by a blood clot
      blocking the flow of blood through one, or more of the blood vessels supplying the brain)
      when administered up to 18 hours after symptoms begin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a serious and life threatening disease. About 85% of all strokes are ischemic,
      caused by a blood clot or plaque that blocks a blood vessel in the brain. The thrombolytic
      drug tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only early treatment for acute ischemic stroke
      approved by the FDA. Treatment with tPA must be administered within three hours of the stroke
      onset. Furthermore, tPA treatment carries a recognized risk of bleeding in the brain. GM602
      is an investigational drug that may act as a neuroprotectant in patients who have had a
      stroke. It is thought to stop cell death and reduce inflammation in the injured area of the
      brain. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GM602 administered
      intravenously to patients in three consecutive daily doses of 320 mg/dose or 480 mg/dose, the
      initial dose administered within 18 hours after onset of acute ischemic stroke in the Middle
      Cerebral artery region.
