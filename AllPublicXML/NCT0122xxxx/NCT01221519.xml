             a single treatment or in combination with one other oral anti-diabetic (ie, DPPIV
             inhibitor or SU) for at least 2 months prior to screening. Doses of anti-diabetic
             treatment should have been stable for at least 1 month prior to screening.

          -  Treatment with at least 1000mg of Metformin for 2 months and being stable on the
             Metformin Therapy for 1 month

             Investigator, within 2 weeks prior to the first administration of AZD1656

          -  Participation in another clinical study during the 30 days prior to screening or
             intake of another investigational drug within 30 days (or at least 5 x t1/2 of the
             drug) prior to the first administration of AZD1656.

          -  History of, or ongoing, ischemic heart disease or heart failure. Stroke, transitory
             ischemic attack, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease within the last 6 months.

             urinalysis results.

          -  Positive test for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibodies to human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Hepatitis C virus.
