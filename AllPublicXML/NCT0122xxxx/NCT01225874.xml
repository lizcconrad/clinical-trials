      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood or bone marrow from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This trial is studying biomarkers to classify young patients with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and remission induction therapy in young patients with
      B-precursor ALL.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To provide the clinical and laboratory data necessary for placing each patient with ALL
           onto the proper therapeutic trial. (Classification)

        -  To provide an administrative base to capture classification data for correlative studies
           in ALL treatment protocols and series of historical protocols. (Classification)

        -  To provide appropriate induction regimens for patients who may then enter risk specific,
           post-induction therapeutic trials. (Induction therapy)

        -  To determine the correlation between event-free survival (EFS) and the following
           measures of minimal-residual disease (MRD)/early response (ER): 1) the rate of
           peripheral blast count disappearance and the absolute blast count on day 8 as determined
           morphologically, by flow cytometry, and using molecular techniques; 2) Marrow morphology
           on day 8, and; 3) MRD as determined by flow cytometry and molecular techniques on bone
           marrow and peripheral blood samples on day 29. (Induction therapy)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Classification study: Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples are collected and may be
           analyzed for B- and T-lineage antigen screening; cytochemical stains; cytogenetics
           (karyotype); immunophenotype screening for MLL, E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1; immunophenotype
           detection of minimal-residual disease (MRD); FCM ploidy (DNA index); trisomies 4 and 10
           (FISH); molecular testing for BCR/ABL, MLL rearrangements, E2A-PBX1, and TEL-AML1;
           molecular detection of MRD - Tγ, Tδ, or IgH; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell
           bank; special T-ALL reference laboratory studies (role of tumor suppressor genes in
           T-ALL and drug sensitivity profiles in T-ALL); special study for mature B-ALL
           [t(18;14)(a24;q32)] by FISH; and hematopathology consultation concerning morphology and
           cytochemistry. The immunophenotype results are used to assign patients to a treatment
           protocol, to assign patients to post-induction (day 28) risk group and treatment for
           patients with B-precursor (non-T, non-B) ALL, and to use as reference laboratory MRD
           results.

        -  Induction therapy study: Patients are entered on stratum 3 (three drugs) for NCI
           consensus standard-risk disease (age &lt; 10 years and WBC &lt; 50,000/mm³) or stratum 4 (four
           drugs) induction therapy for NCI consensus high-risk disease (age ≥ 10 years and/or WBC
           ≥ 50,000/mm³ or CNS3 disease or testicular disease).

             -  Stratum 3: Patients receive oral dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-28;
                vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; pegaspargase intramuscularly (IM)
                on day 4, 5, or 6; cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; and methotrexate IT on
                day 8 (some patients also receive methotrexate IT on days 15 and 22).

             -  Stratum 4: Patients receive oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-28; vincristine
                sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; IM SC-PEG E. coli asparaginase IM on days 2,
                5, 8, 12, 15, and 19; daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-20 minutes on days 8,
                15, and 22; and methotrexate IT on days 1 and 8 (some patients also receive
                methotrexate IT on days 15 and 22).

      Based on day 29 bone marrow results, patients may start consolidation therapy, undergo
      retesting in a week, or receive 2 additional weeks of therapy. Additional therapy comprises
      oral prednisone thrice daily for 14 days; vincristine sulfate IV and daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 15-20 minutes on days 29 and 36; and IM pegaspargase on day 29, 30, or
      31. After successful remission induction, patients are assigned to COG-P9904, COG-P9905, or
      COG-P9906 based on the classification study.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration on day 8 to determine the prognostic significance of
      early remission in the context of this therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 4 years and
      annually thereafter.
