          -  Presence of at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, or nasal symptoms)
             of at least moderate severity.

          -  Presence of at least one constitutional symptom (myalgia [aches and pains],
             headache,feverishness, or fatigue) of at least moderate severity.

          -  Onset of symptoms no more than 36 hours before presentation for screening.

          -  Clinical evidence of worsening of any chronic medical condition (temporally associated
             with the onset of symptoms of influenza) which, in the investigator's opinion,
             indicates that such finding(s) could represent complications of influenza.

          -  Current clinical evidence, including clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with
             otitis media,bronchitis, sinusitis and/or pneumonia, or active bacterial infection of

             previous exposure to peramivir.

          -  Participation in a study of any investigational drug or device within the last 30
             days.

          -  Presence of any pre-existing illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             place the subject at an unreasonably increased risk through participation in this
             study.

          -  Presence of any pre-existing illness that in the opinion of the investigator would
             make the subject unable to comply with the protocol.
