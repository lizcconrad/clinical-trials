    <textblock>
      In this double blinded study patients with resynchronization pacemaker- AICD were assigned to
      Omega3 and placebo randomly, results indicated that Omega3 had no more effect than placebo in
      mortality, BNP level and 6 minutes walk test.

      Introduction: Widely used as lipid lowering agents, Omega 3 fatty acids have been
      demonstrated to possess the potential to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients
      suffering from chronic heart conditions. In this double -blinded randomized
      placebo-controlled clinical trial, we aim to investigate the possible beneficial effects of
      Omega-3 supplements on echocardiographic parameters and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)
      plasma levels in patients suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF).

      Methods and Materials: 100 patients with class II and III CHF, who had tri-chamber pacemaker
      and automated defibrillator( CRT-AICD) were initially recruited among which 70 subjects
      consented to participate. Subjects were randomly assigned and matched to two treatment
      groups. 42 patients were allocated to a two gram/day dosing of omega-3 capsule while 28
      subjects were allocated to the placebo group. Demographic features and BNP plasma levels,
      6-minute walk test and echocardiographic parameters of patients were recorded at baseline and
      at 6 months after implementation of treatment protocols. Data were further gathered and
      analyzed to evaluate the beneficial effects of omega-3 supplements compared to placebo.

      Conclusion: Beneficial effects of Omega-3 supplementation on CHF patients were not as
      dramatic as initially presumed
