    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized prospective trial with 6-month follow up. A non-inferiority
      hypothesis is tested. A new developed treatment and education programme for type 1 diabetic
      patients (PRIMAS) will be tested compared to an established treatment and education programme
      (German DTTP). Primary outcome variable is glycemic control at 6-month follow up. Secondary
      outcome variables are: diabetes knowledge, diabetes related distress, depressive symptoms,
      diabetes self-efficacy, self-care behavior, attitudes towards diabetes and insulin treatment,
      hypoglycemia awareness.

      Both programmes consists of 12 lessons with a length of 90 minutes. Eligible type 1 diabetic
      patients in a diabetologist practice are pooled and randomised either to the new developed
      PRIMAS programme or to an established education programme for type 1 diabetic patients (DTTP
      - Treatment and education programme for intensified insulin treatment) as an active
      comparator.

    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between baseline A1c and A1c at 6 month follow up. Equivalent effect on glycemic control measured by A1c (non-inferiority). In case of-non-inferiority test of superiority.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>To assess knowledge among insulin-treated diabetes patients, participants completed a new developed 11-item diabetes knowledge score. Each item had to be answered by selecting the correct answer from multiple choices. The numbers of correct answers are summed up; thus, the range of the diabetes knowledge score is between 0 and 11.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypoglycaemia Awareness Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>The hypoglycemia awareness questionnaire provides a score indicating the severity of hypoglycaemia unawareness. This scale ranges from 0 (maximum hypoglycaemia awareness) to 7 (minimum hypoglycaemia awareness), where a score of 4 suggests reduced hypoglycaemia awareness.</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Empowerment Score (DES)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Empowerment was measured by a German version of the Diabetes Empowerment Scale, a measure of diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) measure is a self-report measure of diabetes self-management assessing several aspects of the diabetes regimen.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Diabetes related distress was assessed by a German version of the Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS). The DDS is a 17-item self-report scale for the assessment of emotional burdens in diabetes treatment in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CES-D Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms were assessed using the German version of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), an instrument for measuring number and severity of depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Month Follow up</time_frame>
    <description>A German version of the Diabetes Self-efficacy Scale was used to assess diabetes specific self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction / Problem Areas in Dealing With Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Month Follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with current diabetes treatment was assessed by a diabetes satisfaction questionnaire developed by Kulzer et al. This questionnaire uncovers problems in dealing with diabetes, also. A high score indicates dissatisfaction with insulin therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the Diabetes Education Course</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month Follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients satisfaction with the diabetes education programs was assessed using a self-constructed 12-item scale on specific questions regarding contents and performance of the training. Response mode was a scale ranging from 4 (apply very strong) to 0 (apply not at all). Additionally, patients were asked to give an overall grade for their course ranging from 1 (very good) to 6 (unsatisfactory).</description>

        <title>Diabetes Knowledge</title>
        <description>To assess knowledge among insulin-treated diabetes patients, participants completed a new developed 11-item diabetes knowledge score. Each item had to be answered by selecting the correct answer from multiple choices. The numbers of correct answers are summed up; thus, the range of the diabetes knowledge score is between 0 and 11.</description>
