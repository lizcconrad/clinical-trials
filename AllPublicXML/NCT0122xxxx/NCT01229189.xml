  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is wide spread in South Asian population and is contributing to burden
      of disease in this region including Pakistan. The relative importance of vitamin D
      deficiency, mutation in its receptor and maternal and child health has not been established
      in Pakistan and population based studies are required to explore and avert the maternal and
      Neonatal complications and consequences of Vitamin D deficiency

      The trial will evaluate the effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation to pregnant women and
      their Infants. It will be a double blind placebo controlled trial, which will be conducted in
      a rural district of Pakistan.

      The investigators are proposing a community based introduction of vitamin D supplementation
      and we intend to understand the complex relationship between vitamin D, the growth factors
      and maternal and infant anthropometric variables and hope to unravel the reasons of vitamin D
      deficiency in our population.

      The investigators expect that if vitamin D is supplemented to pregnant women and their
      newborn infants it will inevitably replenish the micronutrient stores and aid to resolve the
      maternal and neonatal morbidity due to Vitamin D deficiency.
