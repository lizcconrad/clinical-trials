  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are developing a computer-based neuropsychological assessment tool to help
      primary care physicians detect neurological and psychiatric disorders. To confirm the tool's
      efficacy, the investigators will first test the prototype against established tests. The
      investigators propose to collect preliminary data on a limited group of subjects and
      age-matched controls. Collecting data on a limited group of subjects provides early insight
      into how well the tool detects disease, how well patients understand the instructions and
      enjoy performing the tasks, and if particular trials or stimuli are too difficult or too easy
      for all subjects. With this information, the investigators can make adjustments to the tool
      if needed and collect additional data on revised versions of the tool. The data will be used
      to establish the validity, reliability and sensitivity of the tool to generate consistent and
      accurate scores. The investigators will initially focus on a limited age range (age
      fifty-five to seventy-five) and limited set of diseases (early dementias or mild cognitive
      impairment) to reduce variability within the patient and control groups and to gain more
      statistical power with a smaller group of subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject with mild impairment from who has already undergone or will soon undergo a
             full neuropsychological evaluation.

          -  Subjects with Clinical Dementia Rating Scale CDR of 0.5-1.0 and Mini-Mental Score
             20-26 (or MOCA equivalent, borderline/mild dementia) will be eligible for this group.

          -  Normal controls without exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects whose impairment is severe enough to limit their ability to perform the
             computer-based tasks and/or to provide consent.

          -  Subjects with history of learning disabilities or mental illness including major
             depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and addiction are excluded because
             these problems can affect cognitive performance.
