    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, dose escalating, multicenter, phase I study measuring the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmakokinetics of PankoMab-GEX™ after intravenous administration
      in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid cancers refractory to standard
      treatment. The effect of PankoMab-GEX™ on the development of antibodies and tumor response
      will also be evaluated.

          2. Histologically-confirmed TA-MUC1 positive measurable or non-measurable solid tumors
             according to RECIST criteria who failed standard therapy and for whom no further
             standard therapy is available (TA-MUC1 positivity assessed by PankoMab-GEX™ staining
             in immunohistology of the tumor).

          3. Failure of standard therapy or non-availabilty of standard therapy

               -  Patients must have received at least 1 standard chemotherapy during the course of
                  the tumor disease

               -  All therapies must be completed 6 weeks (therapeutic monoclonal antibodies) or 4
                  weeks (all other anti-cancer agents) before start of study treatment and patients
                  must have recovered from all prior therapy toxicities to at least CTCAE grade 1

          4. Performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1 and estimated life
             expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          5. Adequate organ function as assessed by the following laboratory parameters within 14
             days prior to study drug application:

               -  Bone marrow function: hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L; white blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 3.0 x
                  10^9/L; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5x 10^9/L; platelet count ≥ 100 x
                  10^9/L

               -  Hepatic: aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) ≤
                  2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (≤ 5 x ULN if hepatic metastases present);
                  bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN; alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5.0 times upper limit of normal
                  (ULN)

               -  Renal: Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 80 ml/min using the MDRD formula
                  according to Levey 2005: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (ml/min/1.73 m²) = 186
                  x (serum creatinine /0,95)^-1.154 x (age)^-0.203 x (0.742 females) x (1.21 in
