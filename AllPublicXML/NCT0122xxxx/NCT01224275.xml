      In the RCT the midwife is randomized.There are a multicenter study. Before the study started
      the midwives received education about the study. Then they randomized with simple
      randomization per site(clinics). The midwives also have follow up meeting with the research
      team during the recruting period. The parents are informed about the study at the booking
      appointment, after that they can choose if they want to participate in the study and are
      allocated to either intervention or control, based on the woman's date of birth. The main aim
      is to investigate parents' satisfaction of antenatal group based care. The RCT is based on
      three questionnaires which both women and their partners receive, the first at baseline
      before they receive different models of care, and the second questionnaire distributed four
      to six months after birth and the last one year after birth. Descriptive and inferential
      statistics will be used in the analysis.A power calculation is made and the study schould
      have a total number of 350 partners.
