    <textblock>
      This study aims to test a dietary intervention for diabetes in a medical practice setting,
      with the aim of developing a model for diabetes care that can be used widely. The
      investigators hypothesize that a low-fat vegan diet will be effective for management of
      diabetes and will be feasible in a practice-based setting.

      Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that the nutrition intervention (low fat, low-GI vegan
      diet) improves glycemic control, body weight, plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure,
      and indices of renal function in a within-group analysis.

      Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the nutrition intervention (low fat, low-GI vegan
      diet) is more effective than standard nutrition care for improving glycemic control, body
      weight, plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and indices of renal function in
      individuals with type 2 diabetes

      Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that a low-fat vegan diet is sustainable among
      individuals with type 2 diabetes for a 20-week period, with weekly classes, and in a
      follow-up period of one year with limited professional support.

      Specific Aim 4 tests the hypothesis that a low-fat vegan diet has an acceptability that is
      comparable to that of standard nutrition care among individuals with type 2 diabetes.

      Specific Aim 5 tests the hypothesis that the effects of the dietary interventions on A1c and
      body weight are reduced in individuals with the A1 allele of the Taq1A and Taq1B polymorphism
