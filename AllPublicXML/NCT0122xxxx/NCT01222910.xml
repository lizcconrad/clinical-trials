      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence study comparing valacyclovir
      hydrochloride tablets 1 gram manufactured by OHM Laboratories Inc. NJ 08901 with VALTREX®
      caplets 1 gram manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 in healthy,
      adult, male, human subjects under fasting condition.

    <textblock>
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a single oral dose of valacyclovir
      hydrochloride 1 gram of either test or reference investigational product was administered
      during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature
      under low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel. Both test and
      reference products were administered to all the study subjects, one in each period (except
      subject numbers 04, 21 and 27 who dropped out from the study).

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.
