  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to measure efficacy of our new protocol by monitoring
      the results of our routine respiratory cultures at the end of the new standard treatment, and
      during routine visits for 1 year from initiation of therapy for Staphylococcus aureus. The
      secondary objective will include determining the clinical course (pulmonary exacerbations,
      antibiotic use, hospitalizations, pulmonary function tests) of patients who underwent the
      protocol.
