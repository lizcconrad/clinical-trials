  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which
      unregulated activation of the complement system leads to significant ischemic morbidities
      with shortened lifespan. Life-threatening thromboembolism (TE) is the most feared
      complication of PNH, accounting for up to 45% of patient deaths. It is estimated that 40% of
      PNH patients experience a clinically evident TE and 60% of patients without clinically
      diagnosed TE demonstrate TE by high-sensitivity MRI, indicating the ongoing thrombotic risk
      in most patients with PNH. Much of these data come from PNH patients from European descent.
      To understand the impact of TE in patients with PNH from non-European regions, we performed
      this study to evaluate the clinical characteristics of Korean patients with PNH.
