  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, 6 month trial, of immediate release methylphenidate (MPH-IR) for
      children with ADHD aimed at assessing whether the observable behavioral changes seen during
      treatment are associated with potentially more stable underlying modifications in brain
      functioning (resting-state functional connectivity). Additionally, we will also be looking at
      treatment effects on neuropsychological processes and reading skills. This information will
      contribute to the first Brazilian study assessing the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of
      ADHD. Children with ADHD will be compared to a sample of sex and age-matched sample of
      typically developing children.

    <description>The scheme provides for initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day, with an average dose of 1mg/kg/day. The increases will be made considering the presentation of the drug (10mg), which allows increments of 5mg or 10mg, which will be made in clinical review, as the clinical symptoms, including increasing the dose until there is more room for improvement or there is presence of significant adverse effects, all the patients with indication of treatment will be assessed before the use of medication, 15 days, 30 days, 3 and 6 months after the start,</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study will include 20 boys aged 8 to 10 years old, regularly enrolled in local schools
        and directed to the research through advertisement in the media, contact with schools or
        directly referred to the Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Program (ProDAH/HCPA) by primary
        care services for assessment and treatment. Only children with a primary diagnosis of ADHD
        or with the comorbidity ADHD + reading disorder or ADHD + ODD will be included. Only
        drug-naïve subjects will be apt to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children who fit into one or more of the following conditions will not be considered
        eligible to take part in the study: (1) they are outside the age range specified; (2) they
        are not regularly enrolled and attending school; (3) they have a history of prior or
        current treatment with psychoactive drugs or psychotherapy; (4) they are mentally retarded
        (Overall IQ&lt;80); (5) they have a main diagnosis differing from ADHD, including children
        with other psychiatric or neurological diagnoses
