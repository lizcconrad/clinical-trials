  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite careful monitoring of patients with diabetes, it is so far difficult to predict the
      occurrence of cardiac events in the evolution. As shown by various studies conducted in
      patients with diabetes, cardiac involvement can be detected by abnormalities of diastolic or
      systolic functions using non-invasive investigations such as echocardiography. For 4 years,
      the evaluation technique of myocardial deformations by two-dimensional speckle tracking
      strain by echocardiography is the subject of high hopes in the earlier detection of still
      asymptomatic cardiomyopathies. In the present study, the investigators hypothesized that this
      technique would improve the detection of myocardial contraction abnormalities in patients
      with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and would establish their association with
      micro-angiopathy, frequently encountered in these patients.

      This is a single center case-control study based on routine care, designed to recruit
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus free from any other myocardiopathy. The inclusion will
      take place over a period of 24 months. No monitoring of patients (no follow-up) is provided
      under this protocol. The analysis will focus on the combination of the left ventricle
      myocardial deformations alteration revealed by the echocardiographic 2D strain analysis (&lt;
      18% in absolute value), with the existence of micro-angiopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus
      patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction ( ≥ 60%).

      Two hundred subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus will be recruited: 100 subjects with
      impaired left ventricular myocardial deformation by 2D strain analysis (&lt; 18% in absolute
      value), constituting the 'cases' group and 100 subjects without alteration in myocardial
      deformation (global strain ≥ 18%).
