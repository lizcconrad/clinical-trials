  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether therapy with pazopanib is effective and safe in Asian
      women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer whose cancer has
      not progressed on first-line chemotherapy.

      This study is an extension study to the VEG110655 study. The parent study, VEG110655, was
      designed to evaluate whether pazopanib 800 mg daily for 52 weeks will prolong progression
      free survival (PFS) in women diagnosed with ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal
      cancer. These women will have obtained stable disease, a complete remission, or a partial
      remission after debulking surgery and at least five cycles of chemotherapy (taxane/platinum).
      This extension study will evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes of pazopanib monotherapy and
      placebo in an Asian population with the same indication as the parent study.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until evidence of progressive disease or death, whichever occurred first (average of 15.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time interval between randomization and evidence of progressive disease (PD), as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, or death, whichever occurred first. A visit-based analysis approach to determine participants' dates of progression was applied in the analysis method. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants who were alive and had not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the date associated with the last visit with adequate assessment.</description>

    <measure>PFS by Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per GCIG criteria or death due to any cause (average of 15.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS by GCIG criteria is defined as the time from the randomization date to the earliest date of disease progression (PD) per GCIG criteria or death due to any cause. Per GCIG criteria, an objective progression is defined as the earliest event of either tumor progression based on RECIST v1.0 or confirmed CA-125 progression. A participant is counted as &quot;Progressed per RECIST&quot; if the radiological PD per RECIST occurred prior to or on the same day as CA-125 progression. A participant is counted as &quot;Progressed per CA-125&quot; if the radiological PD occurred after CA-125 progression. Per RECIST, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants who were alive and had not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the date associated with the last visit with adequate assessment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Dose Reduction or Any Dose Interruption</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)</time_frame>
    <description>Dose interruptions or reductions may have been required following potential drug-related toxicities. As a general rule, if dose reduction of investigational product (IP) was necessary, the dose should have been reduced stepwise by 200 mg at each step, and the participant should have been monitored for 10 to 14 days. If toxicity recurred or worsened during this monitoring time, the IP could have been interrupted and/or the dose of IP further decreased, with continued monitoring for an additional 10 to 14 days, and so on. The cut off for these data was October 12, 2012.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Non-serious Adverse Event (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalizaton or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. See the non-serious AE/SAE module for a list of specific events.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. On-therapy AEs were those reported from the first day that randomized study drug was received to 28 days after the last dose of randomized study drug, and within 28 days of dose interruption. Relatedness was assessed by the Investigator.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Blood Pressure Shifts From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Diatolic blood pressure (DBP) are measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A participant could have been counted in more than one shift category. Participants who experienced shifts in both SBP and DBP are represented under each individual parameter. A worst-case on-therapy shift is defined as the worst shift that occurred at any time during the treatment period.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Shift From Baseline in Bazett's Corrected QT Interval (QTc)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)</time_frame>
    <description>12-lead ECGs were obtained at the scheduled visits. A worst-case on-therapy shift is defined as the worst shift that occurred at any time during the treatment period. The QTc is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. In general, the faster the heart rate the shorter the QTc. If a QTc &gt;=500 milliseconds (msec) was noted on a scheduled or unscheduled electrocardiogram (ECG), then two additional ECGs should have been obtained within 5 minutes to confirm the abnormality. The average QTc was determined from the three ECG tracings by manual evaluation and was used to determine continued eligibility.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case On-therapy Hematology Parameter Grade Shifts From Baseline Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 1 until the end of the treatment period (up to Study Week 108)</time_frame>
    <description>Grade shifts from Baseline were assessed as any grade increase (AGI), increase to Grade (G) 3 (ITG3), and increase to Grade 4 (ITG4). Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (NCI-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events), version 4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. The CTCAE displays Grades (G) 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each toxicity based on the following general guideline: G1, mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated; G2, moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL); G3, severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL; G4, Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.; G5, death related to AE.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the time interval between randomization and evidence of progressive disease (PD), as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, or death, whichever occurred first. A visit-based analysis approach to determine participants’ dates of progression was applied in the analysis method. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants who were alive and had not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the date associated with the last visit with adequate assessment.</description>

        <description>PFS by GCIG criteria is defined as the time from the randomization date to the earliest date of disease progression (PD) per GCIG criteria or death due to any cause. Per GCIG criteria, an objective progression is defined as the earliest event of either tumor progression based on RECIST v1.0 or confirmed CA-125 progression. A participant is counted as &quot;Progressed per RECIST&quot; if the radiological PD per RECIST occurred prior to or on the same day as CA-125 progression. A participant is counted as &quot;Progressed per CA-125&quot; if the radiological PD occurred after CA-125 progression. Per RECIST, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Participants who were alive and had not progressed at the time of analysis were censored at the date associated with the last visit with adequate assessment.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalizaton or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.

        <title>Number of Participants With AEs Leading to Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment, Dose Interruption, and Dose Reduction</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Dose interruptions or reductions may have been required following potential drug-related toxicities. As a general rule, if dose reduction of investigational product (IP) was necessary, the dose should have been reduced stepwise by 200 mg at each step, and the participant should have been monitored for 10 to 14 days. If toxicity recurred or worsened during this monitoring time, the IP could have been interrupted and/or the dose of IP further decreased, with continued monitoring for an additional 10 to 14 days, and so on.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With AEs Leading to Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment, Dose Interruption, and Dose Reduction</title>
          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Dose interruptions or reductions may have been required following potential drug-related toxicities. As a general rule, if dose reduction of investigational product (IP) was necessary, the dose should have been reduced stepwise by 200 mg at each step, and the participant should have been monitored for 10 to 14 days. If toxicity recurred or worsened during this monitoring time, the IP could have been interrupted and/or the dose of IP further decreased, with continued monitoring for an additional 10 to 14 days, and so on.</description>

        <description>12-lead ECGs were obtained at the scheduled visits. A worst-case on-therapy shift is defined as the worst shift that occurred at any time during the treatment period. The QTc is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. In general, the faster the heart rate the shorter the QTc. If a QTc &gt;=500 milliseconds (msec) was noted on a scheduled or unscheduled electrocardiogram (ECG), then two additional ECGs should have been obtained within 5 minutes to confirm the abnormality. The average QTc was determined from the three ECG tracings by manual evaluation and was used to determine continued eligibility.</description>

        <description>Grade shifts from Baseline were assessed as any grade increase (AGI), increase to Grade (G) 3 (ITG3), and increase to Grade 4 (ITG4). Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria (NCI-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events), version 4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the toxicity. The CTCAE displays Grades (G) 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each toxicity based on the following general guideline: G1, mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated; G2, moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL); G3, severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL; G4, Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.; G5, death related to AE.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Shifts From Baseline Grades of 0, 1, and 2</title>
        <description>The ECOG performance status scales and criteria are used by doctors and researchers to assess how a participant's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the participant, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. Grade 0, fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction. Grade 1, restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work. Grade 2, ambulatory and capable of all selfcare, but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours. Grade 3, capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours. Grade 4, completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair. Grade 5, dead.</description>
