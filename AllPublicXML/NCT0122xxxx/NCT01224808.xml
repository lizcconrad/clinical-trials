    <textblock>
      The aim of the Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) therapy is to treat and prevent bleeding episodes
      due to abnormal platelet adhesion and abnormal blood coagulation as a result of low or
      abnormal Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and/or Factor VIII (FVIII) levels. The long-term
      efficacy and safety of a VWF/FVIII concentrate, Biostate, will be investigated in children,
      adolescents, and adults with VWD in whom treatment with a VWF product is required for
      prophylactic therapy, haemostatic control during surgery, or control of a non-surgical,
      spontaneous, or traumatic bleeding event.
