  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is considered standard of care for prostate cancer.
      However, changes in the patients metabolism are usually seen as a result of hormone therapy.
      These changes include increased fat mass, decreased lean mass, weight gain, high blood
      cholesterol, increased incidence of diabetes, and possibly increased incidence of cardiac
      events such as heart attack. The researchers of this trial would like to learn if these
      change in body mass are affected by the presence of brown fat in the body. Brown fat is made
      up of fat cells that are stored in the body and generate heat to control body temperature.
      Levels of brown fat are at the highest in newborn babies and decrease over time into
      adulthood. The researchers of this trial would like to learn more about these changes in
      metabolism during prostate cancer treatment by studying the changes in brown fat during the
      first 12 months of hormone therapy.

      -  Participants will be asked to come into the clinic for additional visits before they
           begin hormone therapy. The following procedures will be performed: Cold-activated PET/CT
           scan; body composition DXA scan; blood tests, questionnaires and abdominal fat biopsy.

        -  During hormone therapy, the participant will return to the clinical once after 3 months,
           and again after 6 months, to draw blood for laboratory tests.

        -  After 12 months of hormone therapy, the participant will return to teh clinic to repeat
           the following procedures: Cold-activated PET/CT scan; body composition DXA scan; blood
           tests; questionnaires and abdominal fat biopsy.
