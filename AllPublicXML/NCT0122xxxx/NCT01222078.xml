  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to assess the safety and tolerability of re-dosing at 6 months with
      otelixizumab (given as an 8-day series of intravenous infusions) in adult subjects with newly
      diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase IIa, open-label, multi-centre study is to assess the
      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of re-dosing at 6 months with an 8 consecutive day
      series of otelixizumab intravenous (IV) infusions in 8 adult subjects with newly diagnosed
      type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Although it is hoped that the Î² cell preserving effect of
      otelixizumab will be long-lasting, it is possible that the effect may decline over time and
      thus T1DM subjects may require re-treatment. Six months is the minimum time expected between
      treatments.

      After baseline assessments, eligible subjects will receive 8 consecutive days of otelixizumab
      infusions, each given over a 30 minute period. Prophylaxis for cytokine release syndrome AEs
      will be given. At Month 6, following a review of any new medical conditions, concomitant
      medications, lymphocyte count, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) viral load and other re-dosing
      eligibility criteria, subjects will be re-treated with the same dosing regimen. Subjects will
      be followed for 24 months in this study.

    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE include adverse events that result in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Study was early terminated and participant withdrew on study Day 164.</description>

          <title>Otelixizumab</title>
          <description>Participant received a single dose of otelixizumab intravenous (IV) infusions each given over a 30 minute period on 8 consecutive days in order: 0.1 milligrams (mg), 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.5 mg, 0.5 mg thus total dose 3.1 mg. Participant received prophylactic oral ibuprofen 400-800 mg 2 hours before start of infusion (SOI), 2 hours after SOI, 6 hours after SOI and at bedtime. Participant received 5-10 mg oral levocetirizine 1 hour prior to each infusion. Participant was about to receive same study drug dosing after 6 months, though not received.</description>

        <description>Antibodies to otelixizumab were planned to be measured at Baseline and at specified post-Baseline visits using a validated immunoassay. If a positive result was detected, the samples were analyzed further in a neutralizing antibody assay to determine if the antibodies were neutralizing. The 12 and 24 month samples were only be taken if a participant had a positive result for antibodies at the last tested time point (Month 9) or if the Month 9 test results were not available.</description>
