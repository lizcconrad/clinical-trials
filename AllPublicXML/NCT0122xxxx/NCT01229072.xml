  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Heparin form a complex with a plasma protein, antithrombin III (ATIII), which is an
      endogenous anticoagulant. This complex inhibits the formation of thrombin and accelerates its
      destruction. Moreover, heparin and other proteases ATIII inactivate the clotting cascade,
      especially the anti-activated factor X. The end result of these actions is the inhibition of
      biochemical training and synthesis of certain clotting factors that activators of critical
      functions in the genesis of a blood clot. Patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) who use
      the treatment of hemodialysis need a system of anticoagulation with the direct thrombin
      inhibitor and / or heparinóides to prevent thrombosis.

      Based on clinical studies, to control the level of plasma heparin in patients with CRF is
      essential. Evidence of clotting as APTT, TP, ACT and proof of the activity of anti-factor Xa
      should be used as a substrate of protection for those patients on hemodialysis.
