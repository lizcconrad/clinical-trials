  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the most important risk factor of COPD, but only a fourth of smokers had COPD in
      their life. There are also healthy smokers without evidence of COPD. Investigators
      hypothesize that innate immunity may affect this difference between COPD patients and healthy
      smokers, because TLR4 is the receptor of LPS, which is the one of important substance in
      cigarette. Investigators will measure TLR2 and TLR4 expression in lung tissue of patients
      whose lung will be resected. Investigators will compare the level of expression between COPD
      patients and healthy smokers.
