    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of
      linifanib, and identify tolerable dose of linifanib (ABT-869) in combination with carboplatin
      and paclitaxel in Japanese subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Secondary objective is to obtain a preliminary efficacy of anti-tumor activity in
      the subjects as first-line treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  The subject must be 20 and older years of age.

          -  The subject must have cytologically or histologically confirmed non-squamous NSCLC.
             Subjects may have a mixed histology but must be predominantly non-squamous to be
             eligible.

          -  The subject must have advanced or metastatic (Stage IV [According to American Joint
             Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual, 7th edition]) disease that is not amenable
             to surgical resection or radiation with curative intent.

          -  The subject must have not received prior chemotherapy for NSCLC.

          -  The subject has measurable disease, defined as at least 1 unidimensionally measurable
             lesion on a CT scan as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) Version 1.1.

          -  The subject has an Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 0-1.

          -  The subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The subject has hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or to other drugs formulated with
             polyethoxylated castor oil (Cremophor).

          -  The subject has received any anti-cancer therapy for treatment of NSCLC including
             investigational agents, immunotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine/herbal remedies,
             hormonal, &quot;targeted&quot; agents (i.e., erlotinib, imatinib), biologic therapy or cytotoxic
             chemotherapy (i.e., alkylating agents, microtubule inhibitors, antimetabolites).

          -  The subject has a history of another active cancer within the past 5 years except
             cervical cancer in situ, in situ carcinoma of the bladder, squamous cell or basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin.

          -  The subject has active ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease or any
             other conditions that interfere with absorption.

          -  The subject has a medical condition, which in the opinion of the study investigator
             places them at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.

          -  The subject is pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  The subject has NSCLC with a predominant squamous cell histology.
