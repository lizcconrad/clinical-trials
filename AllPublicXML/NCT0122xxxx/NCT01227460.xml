  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo controlled
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of sitagliptin in suppressing glucagon release in
      subjects with type 1 diabetes over a 16 week treatment period. The hypothesis of this study
      is that sitagliptin (Januvia™) will decrease post-prandial glucagon release and may result in
      improved glucose control in adult patients with type 1 diabetes. There is only one small,
      pilot study of sitagliptin in patients with type 1 diabetes which significantly reduced total
      daily insulin dose and A1c values while improving mean blood glucose (MBG) and time spent in
      euglycemic range (1). In the pilot study, GLP-1 and glucagon levels were not assessed. The
      purpose of this trial is to determine if sitagliptin can suppress the paradoxical rise of
      glucagon, and thus can decrease A1c.

      This study will enroll a maximum of 140 patients (with an expected 10% dropout rate) with A1c
      values between 7.5-10% who will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either the study drug or
      placebo. 100 of these patients will wear a continuous glucose monitor. Subjects may be using
      insulin via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections
      (MDI). The clinic visits will be conducted at screening, -1 week, baseline/randomization, 4
      weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks in addition to telephone visits (Appendix 1 and 2). At home,
      starting at week 0 (randomization/baseline), subjects will take 100 mg/day of sitagliptin or
      placebo and continue for the study duration. Laboratory analysis will be performed at various
      time points assessing glucagon, A1c, C-peptide, glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1),
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and insulin levels.
