    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of
      Risperidone formulations after administration of single doses to normal, healthy subjects
      under fasted conditions.

    <textblock>
      A single dose two way crossover bioequivalence study in 44 normal healthy males and females
      was utilized to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of Risperidone ODT (orally
      dissolving tablet) formulations. The test product was a 1 mg ODT tablet formulation of
      Risperidone manufactured by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. The reference product was commercially
      available Risperidone 1 mg ODT tablets (Risperdal®), Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, LP. Each
      single oral dose (1 mg) will be administered orally as a 1 mg tablet. Blood samples were
      collected at intervals over a 72-hour period after medication administration. There was a
      washout period of 14 days between the two periods of the study.
