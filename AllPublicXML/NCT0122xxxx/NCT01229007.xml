      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a Von Willebrand
      Factor/Factor VIII (VWF/FVIII), Biostate, and to investigate the pharmacokinetics of Biostate
      in children with haemophilia A.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects between 0 and &lt;12 years of age.

          -  Diagnosed with severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C &lt;1%), and pre-treated for a minimum of 20
             to 50 exposure days.

          -  Have evidence of vaccination against hepatitis A and B (or presence of antibodies
             against hepatitis A and B due to either a previous infection or prior immunisation),
             as documented in the medical notes at enrolment.

          -  The subject and/or legal guardian understand(s) the nature of the study and has/have
             given written informed consent to participate in the study and is/are willing to
             comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For all subjects at Day 1: Are actively bleeding.

          -  Have received an infusion of any FVIII product, cryoprecipitate, whole blood, plasma
             or desmopressin acetate in the 4 days prior to their dosing within the PK component.

          -  Have a known history of, or who are suspected of having FVIII inhibitors.

          -  Have received aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 7
             days of administration of the IMP.

          -  Have an impaired liver function ie, bilirubin &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
             and/or aspartate/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) &gt;2.5 x ULN (referring to limits of
             the laboratory that performs the determination) at Screening.

          -  Are human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-1/-2 antibody positive with a viral load of
             &gt;200/µL.

          -  Suffer from an acute or chronic medical condition, other than haemophilia A, which
             may, in the opinion of the Investigator, affect the conduct of the study.

          -  Suffering from von Willebrand disease (VWD) with von Willebrand factor: ristocetin
             cofactor (VWF:RCo) level &lt;50 IU/dL at Screening.

          -  Have a known or suspected hypersensitivity or previous evidence of severe side effects
             to a plasma-derived FVIII product or to human albumin.

          -  Have participated in a clinical study or used an investigational compound in another
             study (eg, a new chemical entity not registered for clinical use) in the 3 months
             preceding the first day of IMP administration, or are planning to enter such a study
             during the study period.

          -  Unwillingness and/or inability to comply with the study requirements.
