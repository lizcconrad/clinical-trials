  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation study of oral ARQ 736 administered to
      subjects with advanced solid tumors harboring the mutation. The study is designed to explore
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ARQ 736 and to define a
      recommended Phase 2 dose of ARQ 736.

      Treatment will be initiated at a dose level of 450 mg twice daily (900 mg/daily). All
      cycles/cohorts of therapy will consist of the oral administration of ARQ 736 twice or four
      times a day, one hour prior to or two hours after the meal for 28 days continuously. Tumor
      assessments (CT scan or MRI) will be performed at Baseline, and every two cycles (every eight
      weeks) thereafter or as otherwise clinically indicated. For early assessment of evidence of
      biological activity of the tumor PET scan may be performed at Baseline and four weeks from
      the administration of the first dose of ARQ 736 (approximately Cycle 2 Day1).

    <description>Subjects in this study will receive ARQ 736 orally at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. Dosing will begin at 900 mg/day (first cohort) and escalate until the recommended Phase 2 dose or maximum tolerated dose is determined. Cycles will be repeated in four-week (28-day) intervals until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose adjustment will be permitted.</description>

             solid tumors

          -  Failure to respond to at least one prior systemic therapy (including previous
             treatment with BRAF inhibitors) or to whom standard or curative therapy does not exist

          -  Life expectancy of greater than three months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≤2
