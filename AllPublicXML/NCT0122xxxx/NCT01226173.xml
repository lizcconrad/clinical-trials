      The purpose of the study is to screen blood donors for the presence of NS1 antigen of the
      dengue virus at the American Red Cross in Puerto Rico region (and Monroe County, Florida)
      using the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag enzyme immunoassay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue is an endemic disease that is increasingly more common in tropical climates and the
      dengue epidemic in Puerto Rico (May 2009) presents a risk to the blood supply in Puerto Rico.
      Also, on July 13th 2010 federal officials reported an outbreak of dengue fever in Florida
      after a survey of Key West residents found that at least 5% had been infected or exposed to
      the virus. Therefore this IND study is being carried out to identify blood donors carrying
      the dengue virus using the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag (Bio-Rad, France). Prospective testing is
      being performed on blood donors who have read an information sheet regarding the use of
      donated blood samples in research. Testing will occur at the American Red Cross, Charlotte,
      NC NTL site.

      EDTA plasma samples contained in plasma preparation tubes (PPTs) that have been frozen within
      24 hours of collection and following centrifugation (under the same centrifugation conditions
      as used for PPTs used for nucleic acid testing, NAT) will be the primary samples for
      prospective testing.

        The initiation of the dengue NS1 Ag IND study began on March 8th, 2010 with a study
        population of donations collected by the American Red Cross in Puerto Rico and the study
        population was expanded to Monroe County blood collections of the Community Blood Centers
        of Florida, Inc in August 2010. Testing of collections may be further expanded to include
        other non-ARC sites in Puerto Rico, or to sites in the continental US with documented local
        dengue virus transmission. Testing may also include retrospective testing of a repository
        of samples retained from Puerto Rico during the 2009 epidemic season.Testing will be
        performed from donors who have read information sheets specific to this study (Dengue
        Research Study Donor Information).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The Puerto Rico Region and Monroe County, Florida will maintain a log of all blood donors
        enrolled by collection date documenting the time of collection, centrifugation and
        freezing; only centrifuged and frozen PPTs will be sent to the Charlotte NTL for NS1 Ag
        testing. Samples frozen when received at the Charlotte NTL will be tested. Samples that
        arrive thawed will be tested if the time unfrozen is 24 hours or less. When necessary,
        alternate PPTs (surplus samples used for NAT) will be used for dengue NS1 Ag testing; a log
        will be kept by the Charlotte NTL documenting the sample identification numbers of thawed
        samples, approximate time unfrozen and the samples that require an alternate PPT for dengue
        NS1 Ag testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Samples that are deemed unacceptable for testing include those held for excessive storage
        times when thawed (in excess of 24 hours unfrozen or otherwise as determined by the
        Principal Investigator) or that are cracked or otherwise damaged. Samples having inadequate
        volume for initial and repeat testing in duplicate will not be tested as determined by the
        Charlotte NTL; a log will be kept of samples unacceptable for testing and the reason that
        the samples are unsuitable for testing.
