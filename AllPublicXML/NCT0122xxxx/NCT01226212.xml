  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to use a nutritional change in the diet to improve gut
      health in older people. Ageing can result in major changes in the composition and activities
      of the bacteria in your gut, leading to a higher incidence of gastrointestinal infections,
      decreased intestinal motility and impaired bowel function as people get older. This can
      result in constipation or diarrhoea, increased levels of inflammation and reduced immune
      response to infection. Therefore, individuals aged 65 or over could benefit from safe and
      effective interventions that maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria as well as restoring
      the immune response. Bacteria in the gut are known to promote health. Eating foods containing
      beneficial bacteria for example (probiotics) or food which contain substrates for the
      bacteria to grow on (prebiotics) can improve the balance of gut bacteria. The investigators
      will use a synbiotic with known anti-inflammatory properties, comprising a probiotic
      Bifidobacterium longum strain and inulin (Synergy 1), The synbiotic has been previously shown
      to be beneficial in reducing inflammation and to increase levels of beneficial bacteria in
      the gut in two studies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The investigators would
      now for these reasons, like to determine the effects of our Synbiotic on the gut bacteria and
      immune function of older individuals in a double-blinded, crossover, placebo controlled,
      randomised investigation involving 40 volunteers for three months. The trial is designed so
      that participants will be assigned to receive the Synbiotic preparation or the placebo for
      the first four weeks, this will be followed by four weeks without treatment, and then they
      will switch to the opposite preparation for another four weeks.
