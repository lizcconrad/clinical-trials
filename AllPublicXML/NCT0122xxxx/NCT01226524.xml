  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder manifested as isolated low platelet
      count which results in a tendency for bleeding. Around 10% of childhood ITP does not reach
      resolution within 1 year thus becoming chronic ITP. Therapeutic modalities at present are
      aimed to achieve symptomatic relief, do not change the natural course of the disorder and are
      associated with potential side effects and increase cost. Thus, identifying a new therapy
      that would decrease the bleeding symptoms, without causing significant adverse effects, could
      be very beneficial. Preliminary reports demonstrate a beneficial role for Traditional Chinese
      medicine (TCM) in the treatment of ITP.

      Working hypothesis and aims: The use of TCM will improve the status of children with chronic
      ITP and thus will reduce the need to use conventional medications. The investigators aim to
      study whether in children with chronic ITP, supplementation with TCM, improves the bleeding
      symptoms and ITP-related quality of life (QOL) compared to the period prior to the
      intervention? Methods: The study includes three periods: 1st observation period (1 month),
      TMC period (3 months) and 2nd observation period (2 months). During all study periods the
      following data will be collected: bleeding symptoms, bleeding score, platelet count, need for
      conventional therapy, side effects of therapy and ITP-related QOL.
