      The aim was to verify the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of alpha interferon
      product-2A - Blausiegel, taking as the comparator drug product Roferon ® A (interferon
      alpha-2A - Roche Laboratory).

      The Interferons (IFNs) are a group of cytokines produced by vertebrates in response to
      various stimuli, including the presence of foreign nucleic acids in the body, bacteria, tumor
      cells and viral antigens. These proteins have significant shares immunomodulatory,
      antiproliferative and antiviral drugs, the first line of defense of the body. Once produced,
      the IFNs block viral replication, maximize the lytic activity of natural killer cells,
      increase the expression of MHC class I in cells infected by viruses and induce the
      development of Th1 cells The production of interferon alpha-2A is now held by biotechnology
      with the establishment of a chain of DNA producer of interferon alpha-2a in the chain of
      original DNA of a bacterium, allowing the bacteria produce this drug on an industrial scale.
      In the process of synthesis, the 165 amino acids that are part of this molecule can change in
      your order with no reduction in activity or changes in the properties.

      Due to this fact, the biological and medicinal considered, especially those in manufacturing
      by genetic engineering, need to prove their clinical activity so that they can be marketed.
      In the case of interferon, the consequences of the use of a product without activity compared
      to treat patients with Hepatitis C can lead to serious health complications from them. It is
      therefore necessary to prove its clinical activity and pharmacokinetics before its clinical
      efficacy. The sponsor of this study aims to end the renewal of registration of interferon
      alpha-2A with the Ministry of Health So this study to evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and
      Pharmacodynamics of interferon alpha-2a may allow in the future this medicine can be used by
      a year in patients with hepatitis C, without risk to their health, besides those already
      known and inherent in the treatment of any interferon.
