  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis was that an active distraction is more effective than a passive distraction in
      conjunction with procedural pain in children. The specific aim in this study was to test how
      an active distraction, serious gaming and a passive distraction, the use of lollipops
      influence pain, distress and anxiety in children during wound care.

    <time_frame>Primary outcome, i.e. pain intensity during the wound dressing, is recorded after one wound dressing, an average time on 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome and calculation of sample size is based on self-reported pain scores. Data will be collected in conjunction with the children's first visit to the specialized wound care nurse after the trauma. Pain intensity as primary outcome is recorded at one occasion; pain intensity during the procedure is recorded after the wound care.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Children aged five to twelve were recruited from the pediatric day care unit at the Queen
        Silvia Children's hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Included children had wounds that differed
        in size and location but were too extensive to be handled in a primary care setting. The
        wound dressing procedures were standardized and the pain experiences were expected to be
        similar in all included children.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children with longstanding wounds, care-related pressure wounds, and wounds in body areas
        with decreased sensitivity were excluded from this study.Children with cognitive
        impairments were excluded from the study, as were children or parents who did not have a
        good command of Swedish.
