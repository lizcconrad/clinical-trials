    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the revised
      Living Well With COPD programme (LWWCOPD for Pulmonary Rehabilitation) when used to deliver
      the education component of pulmonary rehabilitation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited guidance on what should be included in the education component of pulmonary
      rehabilitation. International guidelines for COPD and pulmonary rehabilitation suggest
      numerous topics but do not provide specific information relating to the principal topics and
      how these should be delivered (BTS 2001, NICE 2004, ATS/ERS 2006). Recently this research
      team conducted focus groups of patients with COPD and established from their perspective the
      important education topics that should be covered in pulmonary rehabilitation, along with
      information on how these should be delivered (Wilson, O'Neill et al. 2008).

      The Living Well with COPD (LWWCOPD) programme mostly includes these topics (Bourbeau, Julien
      et al. 2003). LWWCOPD, which is based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory, has been shown to
      significantly reduce healthcare utilisation and improve quality of life (Bourbeau, Julien et
      al. 2003, Bandura 1986). With modification and reformatting, the LWWCOPD programme could be
      delivered within the structure of pulmonary rehabilitation.

      Although the LWWCOPD programme has been previously validated, it is important that the
      revised version is assessed for feasibility within the context of pulmonary rehabilitation.
      The practicality of delivering the programme and its acceptance by healthcare providers and
      patients should be assessed. Therefore, this study will involve a process evaluation to
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of using the revised LWWCOPD programme (LWWCOPD for
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation) to deliver the education component of pulmonary rehabilitation in
      Northern Ireland.

    <description>The &quot;Understanding your COPD&quot; questionnaire will be used to assess knowledge, understanding and self-efficacy (pre- and post- pulmonary rehabilitation) and satisfaction with the education sessions (post- pulmonary rehabilitation only). This questionnaire is a self administered questionnaire which takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. It has been developed and assessed for reliability and responsiveness by our research team (Earley, O'Neill et al. 2008).</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire (BCKQ) will be used to assess knowledge pre- and post- pulmonary rehabilitation (White, Walker et al. 2006). The BCKQ is self-administered and takes 15 minutes to complete. It has been shown to be valid, reliable and responsive in patients with COPD (White, Walker et al 2006).</description>

    <measure>Global questions</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will answer three global questions post- pulmonary rehabilitation to assess their perception of the change in their knowledge levels since before the pulmonary rehabilitation programme. The global questions take 1 minute to complete.</description>

    <description>As part of clinical care participants will attend a 6 week pulmonary rehabilitation programme consisting of supervised exercise and education sessions. The exercise component will be consistent with the usual pulmonary rehabilitation programme delivered at that site (BTS 2001, NICE 2004). The education sessions will be delivered using the revised LWWCOPD programme (1/week, approx. 30-45min). All health professionals will be provided with the health professionals' manual and supplementary posters for their respective education session. All participants will be provided with the revised LWWCOPD information booklet and an action plan for recognising and managing exacerbations.</description>
