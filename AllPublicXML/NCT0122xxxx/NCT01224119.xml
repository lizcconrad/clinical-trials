      The current research study evaluates an investigational medical device called Amplex B2A(TM)
      Peptide Enhanced Ceramic Granules (&quot;Amplex&quot;) for use in foot and ankle fusion. Amplex is a
      synthetic bone graft material. The most frequently used graft material is bone collected from
      the patient (autograft). Autograft involves a secondary incision with the risks of infection
      and lasting pain.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if Amplex is a safe and effective alternative to
      autograft.
