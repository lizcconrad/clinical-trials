  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The US prevalence of childhood-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes, both predictors of
      cardiovascular risk, have increased to epidemic proportions in recent decades. Children with
      mental illness, especially those treated with antipsychotic medications, are at additional
      risk for obesity (adiposity) and related risk conditions. A variety of noninvasive techniques
      to assess cardiometabolic risk have begun to be applied in children, including body
      composition measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), carotid intima media
      thickness (CIMT) measured by ultrasound, and hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) measured by
      1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). These measures allow for the early, noninvasive
      study of adiposity-related metabolic risk. The overall aim of this two-study research plan is
      to characterize the level of measurable risk using these sensitive markers in treated and
      untreated children with mental health disorders, and to evaluate the magnitude of change in
      risk that can be observed using these biomarkers in children receiving a well established
      behavioral weight-loss intervention.

      This project will utilize sensitive, early biomarkers of disease risk, including whole body
      adiposity with DEXA, HTGC and CIMT, directly relevant to diabetes and cardiovascular disease
      risk. The primary goals of this study are to deliver an evidence-based weight loss
      intervention to the population of youth who are overweight or obese as a result of
      antipsychotic treatment, to characterize metabolic risk associated with weight using
      sensitive biomarkers, and to evaluate the magnitude of change observed in these biomarkers in
      children receiving an established behavioral weight-loss intervention. This study will
      completed in two phases.

      Study Phase 1, Aim 1: To test the feasibility of delivering an existing family-based
      behavioral weight loss program in families of psychiatrically ill youth who are overweight or
      obese.

      Study Phase 2, Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of 16 weeks of the behavioral weight loss
      intervention on DEXA-measured whole body adiposity in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated
      children.

      Study Phase 2, Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of 16 weeks of the behavioral weight loss
      intervention on HTGC in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children.

      Study Phase 2, Aim 3: To evaluate the effect of 16 weeks of the behavioral weight loss
      intervention on carotid CIMT in overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated children.

    <description>This intervention is a family-based, behavioral weight loss program that has been employed in studies with overweight and obese children, as well as with children who have diabetes. For the proposed study, the program has been modified to fit the needs of disruptive and behaviorally disturbed youth and their families. The modified program includes 16 weeks of weekly visits with a study interventionist, and supplemental phone contacts as needed. Phone contacts will only replace in-person visits if absolutely necessary to achieve the visit.</description>
