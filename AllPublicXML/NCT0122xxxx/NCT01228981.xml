      The purpose of this study is to characterize type 2 diabetic patients with initial
      alterations of diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on 3 different phenotypes previously
      identified and different patterns of progression in order to correlate this data with genetic
      information.

      This study aims to to characterize type 2 diabetic patients with initial alterations of
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on three different phenotypes previously identified and
      different patterns of progression [Lobo, 2004] in order to correlate this data with genetic
      information (based on a list of candidate genes previously identified as being involved in
      DR).

      The results of this study will be used exclusively for scientific purposes.
