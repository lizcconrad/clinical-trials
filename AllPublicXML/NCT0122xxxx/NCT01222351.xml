  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to establish and validate biomarkers associated with the
      risk and progression of late onset Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and
      cognitive decline. The investigators will use baseline and longitudinal measurements of
      plasma amyloid beta-40 and amyloid beta-42 to investigate the risk of developing mild
      cognitive impairment and late onset Alzheimer's disease, as well as the rates of cognitive
      decline and Alzheimer's disease progression. Participants will be selected on the basis of
      change in plasma amyloid beta levels over prior assessment intervals. The purpose of the
      study is to examine whether brain amyloid plaque load, which will be measured with positron
      emission tomography and x-ray computed tomography brain imaging using Florbetaben from Bayer,
      varies as a function of change in plasma levels of amyloid beta. The driving hypothesis of
      the study is that high plasma levels of amyloid beta are an antecedent indicator of increased
      risk of cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and incident late onset Alzheimer's
      disease, and that declining plasma levels of amyloid beta are associated with the onset of
      cognitive decline. Further, high plasma levels of amyloid beta are related to increased
      levels of amyloid beta in the brain as measured by positron emission tomography positivity,
      and the specific pattern of positron emission tomography positivity and a decline in plasma
      amyloid beta over time are associated with the onset of cognitive decline associated with
      late onset Alzheimer's disease.

      This project is a sub-study of the Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project, which
      is a multidisciplinary, epidemiological study of Alzheimer's disease and related
      neurodegenerative disorders. We will obtain positron emission tomography scans and
      simultaneous x-ray computed tomography scans using Florbetaben from Bayer on a selection of
      ongoing participants who will be selected on the basis of change in plasma levels of amyloid
      beta over time. Approximately 200 participants will receive scans beginning in 2009 and in
      the 2010-2012 assessment wave and then again in a 2014-2015 assessment wave. Our intention is
      to examine whether uptake of Florbetaben in the brain varies as a function of previous
      history of change in plasma levels of amyloid beta in order to validate plasma amyloid beta
      as a viable biomarker for late onset Alzheimer's disease.

    <description>Positron emission tomography (PET) and x-ray computed tomography (CT) brain imaging using Florbetaben is considered an in vivo measure of brain amyloid plaque load. We will obtain PET/CT scans on a selection of participants who will be selected on the basis of change in plasma levels of amyloid beta to validate amyloid beta as a viable biomarker for late onset Alzheimer's disease. Participants will receive scans in a 2010-2012 assessment wave, and then again in a 2014-2015 assessment wave to determine whether increased uptake in the brain correlates with declining levels of plasma amyloid beta</description>
