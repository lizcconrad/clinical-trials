    <measure>The Difference in the Change (Pre and End-treatment) of Standard Uptake Value (SUV) Between Pathological Non-responders and Responders (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months (1 scan prior to chemotherapy and 2 scans prior to surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The quantitative measures of standard uptake value (SULpeak and SULmax, prone and supine position) from PET were obtained. SUV = (Tracer activity in tissue)/(Injected radiotracer dose/patient weight or lean body mass) with unit microcuries/g/(millicuries/kg) (no unit after simplification). The SUV was averaged over the tumor regions. These averages were computed for each patient at each time point. All patients were were planned to be scanned three times: prior to treatment, during treatment and at the end of treatment. The change of SUV was calculated as the end of treatment value minus the pre-treatment value. Then the difference in the change between the responders and non-responders were estimated using Wilcoxon rank sum test. The pseudomedians and nonparametric confidence intervals for the difference (change of non-responders minus the change of responders) were reported for parameters SULpeak and SULmax measured for different positions. Pathological response were measured at the</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects must have histologically proven breast cancer

          -  Subjects are being considered for preoperative chemotherapy

          -  Subjects must be â‰¥ 18 years old. Sensor Sub-Study Only

          -  Palpable subcutaneous or known disease with one surface &lt;1cm below surface of skin.

          -  A subset of patients who have a mass located on any surface of the breast that is
             accessible for Lucerno sensor placement will have additional testing.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Children will be excluded from this study.

             used to identify and exclude subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. A urine
             pregnancy test/or serum beta HCG will also be performed for women of child bearing
             potential).

          -  Patients who are acutely ill who are deemed by their treating physician as not
             suitable candidates for this study.

          -  Intraluminal lesions will be excluded from the sensor sub-study.

          -  Non biopsy proven malignancy will be excluded from this study.

          -  Palpable subcutaneous or known disease with one surface &gt;1cm below surface of skin
             will be excluded from the sensor sub-study.

          -  Draining or exposed malignant tumor will be excluded from the sensor sub-study.

        <title>The Difference in the Change (Pre and End-treatment) of Standard Uptake Value (SUV) Between Pathological Non-responders and Responders (pCR)</title>
        <description>The quantitative measures of standard uptake value (SULpeak and SULmax, prone and supine position) from PET were obtained. SUV = (Tracer activity in tissue)/(Injected radiotracer dose/patient weight or lean body mass) with unit microcuries/g/(millicuries/kg) (no unit after simplification). The SUV was averaged over the tumor regions. These averages were computed for each patient at each time point. All patients were were planned to be scanned three times: prior to treatment, during treatment and at the end of treatment. The change of SUV was calculated as the end of treatment value minus the pre-treatment value. Then the difference in the change between the responders and non-responders were estimated using Wilcoxon rank sum test. The pseudomedians and nonparametric confidence intervals for the difference (change of non-responders minus the change of responders) were reported for parameters SULpeak and SULmax measured for different positions.
