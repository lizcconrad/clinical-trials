  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out which way of giving high-dose radiation works best
      for treatment of cancer that has spread to bone, the spine, soft tissue, or lymph nodes. This
      study will look at the effects, good and/or bad, of giving 27 Gy in three fractions (3 days)
      or 24 Gy in one fraction (1 day) using image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      (IG-IMRT). IG-IMRT is radiation that is given directly to the cancer site and reduces the
      exposure to normal tissue. Currently there are no studies that compare the effects of giving
      radiation in either hypofractionated doses (higher total doses of radiation spread out over
      several treatment days) or a single-fraction dose (entire radiation dose given in one
      treatment session).

      The patient may be asked to participate in an additional part of this study where we will get
      a a (DW/DCE) MRI before treatment start and within one hour after radiation treatment. If the
      patient is asked to take part in this portion of the study, all they will need to do is get
      up to 3 MRIs with standard contrast injection. The purpose of this is to see if as a result
      of the treatment there are changes in the blood flow going to the cancer which could suggest
      that the treatment may be successful.

      In addition some patients can present new lesions and may be asked if they would like to have
      these new lesions treated on the protocol. If they are given this option, this will not
      extend their follow up period. The follow up of the new lesions will match with the prior
      follow up dates.

Pts will be considered for this scan based on compliance to scan schedule &amp; MRI availability for performing the scan within one hour of the planned IGRT. 24 MSKCC pts (12 per treatment arm) will be accrued for the blood collection (optional) up to 4 hours prior, 50-90 minutes after, &amp; approximately 24 hours [MCPG2.3]after treatment for single fraction pts. For pts partaking in both sub-studies, the post-treatment blood collection may be done in a 50-120 minute window to account for scheduling conflicts with the research MRI.</description>
