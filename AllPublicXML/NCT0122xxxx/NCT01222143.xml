  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II open-label study that is evaluating the toxicity and efficacy of
      nilotinib combined with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine (NOVE-HiDAC)
      chemotherapy for patients with poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There are two parts to
      the study. The first part (Phase I) will determine the maximum dose of nilotinib that can
      safely be given when combined with NOVE-HiDAC. This dose will then be used in combination
      with the NOVE-HiDAC regimen in the second part of the study (Phase II), which will evaluate
      the antileukemic activity of the treatment. The patients who achieve complete remission from
      the induction therapy (1 cycle) will then receive consolidation therapy combined with
      nilotinib (maximum of 2 cycles).

      The patient population for this study will have AML and will fall into a poor risk category.
      This means they have persistent leukemia after induction therapy, they relapse within two
      years of achieving complete remission with induction therapy, or they have certain poor risk
      features at diagnosis. The AML cells will also be positive for c-kit (a stem cell factor
      receptor), which is involved in cancer cell growth. Nilotinib is a drug that blocks the
      effects of c-kit. Using this drug in combination with chemotherapy may improve ability of the
      chemotherapy drugs to kill leukemia cells. This may then increase the chances of the leukemia
      going into complete remission.

               2. Relapse within two years of achieving complete remission with such induction
                  therapy. Any consolidation therapy is acceptable, including stem cell

          -  Positivity for c-kit (CD117) in at least 30% of blasts as measured by flow cytometry.
             For relapsed patients, this will be assessed at the time of relapse. For primary
             induction failures the initial diagnostic sample may be used.

          -  Age 18-65.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt; 3 (see Appendix I).

          -  Patients must have the following laboratory values within normal limits (WNL) at the
             local institution lab or corrected to WNL with supplements prior to first dose of
             study medication.

               1. Potassium (WNL)

               2. Magnesium (WNL)

          -  No chemotherapy within the previous four weeks, other than hydroxyurea to control
             counts. Hydroxyurea may be continued up to Day 4 of treatment with nilotinib. If
             hydroxyurea is used, it must be stopped at least 48 hours prior to starting
             chemotherapy.

                  are not within normal ranges, electrolytes should be corrected and then the
                  patient re-screened for QTc
