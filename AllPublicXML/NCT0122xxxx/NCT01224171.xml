  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease is designed to
      establish the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab for the induction of clinical response and
      remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After completing the study, patients were eligible to enroll in a long term safety study with
      continued access to vedolizumab (study C13008; NCT00790933) if study drug was well tolerated,
      and no major surgical intervention for Crohn's disease occurred or was required.

      Participants who did not enroll in Study C13008 were to complete the Final Safety visit (16
      weeks after the last dose of study drug) for a maximum time on study of 22 weeks.

    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score ≤ 150 points.
The CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's disease and consists of eight factors, each summed after adjustment with a weighting factor. The components of the CDAI are:
Number of liquid or soft stools each day for 7 days;
Abdominal pain (graded from 0-3 on severity) each day for 7 days;
General well-being, subjectively assessed from 0 (well) to 4 (terrible) each day for 7 days;
Presence of complications;
Taking Lomotil or opiates for diarrhea;
Presence of an abdominal mass (0 as none, 2 as questionable, 5 as definite);
Hematocrit of &lt; 0.47 in men and &lt; 0.42 in women;
Percentage deviation from standard weight.
The total score ranges from 0 to approximately 600 and with higher scores indicating greater disease activity.
All participants who prematurely discontinued for any reason were considered as not achieving clinical remission.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first study drug administration to Week 22, through the 14 March 2012 database lock date. At the time of this database lock, 7 patients had completed Week 10 or early termination assessments but not Week 22 assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product, which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was an important medical event based upon appropriate medical judgment that may have jeopardized the patient and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or any diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
Relationship to study drug administration was determined by the investigator responding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug?</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease took part in the study at 107 sites worldwide from 24 November 2010 to 12 April 2012. Approximately 75% of participants were to have previously failed tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) antagonist therapy and approximately 25% were to have been naïve to TNFα antagonist therapy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either 300 mg vedolizumab or placebo. Randomization to treatment assignment was stratified by the presence or absence of previous failure of TNFα antagonist therapy or naïve to TNFα antagonist therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids and concomitant use of immunomodulators.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Baseline Disease Activity – Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI)</title>
          <description>Baseline disease activity represents the baseline CDAI score. The CDAI is a numerical calculation derived from the sum of products from a list of 8 disease variables: number of liquid stools, extent of abdominal pain, general well-being, occurrence of extraintestinal symptoms, need for antidiarrheal drugs, presence of abdominal masses, hematocrit, and body weight. CDAI scores range from 0 to ~600 points with lower scores indicating disease remission and higher scores indicating disease worsening.</description>

        <description>Clinical remission is defined as a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score ≤ 150 points.
The CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's disease and consists of eight factors, each summed after adjustment with a weighting factor. The components of the CDAI are:
Number of liquid or soft stools each day for 7 days;
Abdominal pain (graded from 0-3 on severity) each day for 7 days;
General well-being, subjectively assessed from 0 (well) to 4 (terrible) each day for 7 days;
Presence of complications;
Taking Lomotil or opiates for diarrhea;
Presence of an abdominal mass (0 as none, 2 as questionable, 5 as definite);
Hematocrit of &lt; 0.47 in men and &lt; 0.42 in women;
Percentage deviation from standard weight.
The total score ranges from 0 to approximately 600 and with higher scores indicating greater disease activity.
All participants who prematurely discontinued for any reason were considered as not achieving clinical remission.</description>

        <description>Sustained clinical remission is defined as a CDAI score ≤ 150 points at both Week 6 and Week 10. The CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's disease and consists of eight factors, each summed after adjustment with a weighting factor. The components of the CDAI are:
Number of liquid or soft stools each day for 7 days;
Abdominal pain (graded from 0-3 on severity) each day for 7 days;
General well-being, subjectively assessed from 0 (well) to 4 (terrible) each day for 7 days;
Presence of complications;
Taking Lomotil or opiates for diarrhea;
Presence of an abdominal mass (0 as none, 2 as questionable, 5 as definite);
Hematocrit of &lt; 0.47 in men and &lt; 0.42 in women;
Percentage deviation from standard weight.
The total score ranges from 0 to approximately 600 and with higher scores indicating greater disease activity.
All participants who prematurely discontinued for any reason were considered as not achieving sustained clinical remission.</description>
