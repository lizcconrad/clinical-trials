    <textblock>
      Multicentric randomised trial. Patients with a high risk of developing colorectal Peritoneal
      Carcinomatosis (PC) after resection of their primary will be informed, will sign the consent
      and will be pre-registered. All patients will receive the current standard adjuvant treatment
      : 6 months of systemic chemotherapy (currently the Folfox-4 regimen which could be modified
      if the standard is modified). Then a work-up is done to exclude recurrence. The likelihood of
      a recurrence is low but if this occurs, the patient will not be randomised and will be
      treated with the best known treatment. If the work-up is negative, patients will be
      randomised to surveillance alone (control group) or exploratory laparotomy + HIPEC
      (experimental group).
