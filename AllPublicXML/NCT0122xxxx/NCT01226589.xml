      Adverse drug events can occur commonly due to medication errors during the transition of care
      in a health care facility. Medication reconciliation is the process of comparing medications
      and providing an accurate medication list as a resource for prescribers, which is currently
      only being done upon inpatient admission at the CCI. The purpose of this study is to see if
      pharmacist medication reconciliation at discharge reduces unintentional medication
      discrepancies for inpatient discharges.
