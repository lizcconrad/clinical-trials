  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that a majority of pregnancies that end in miscarriage are due to a
      chromosome abnormality usually involving a duplicated or missing chromosome. Often this
      happens by chance and is not likely to occur in future pregnancies. For many women, a
      miscarriage can be a traumatic experience and can cause feelings of loss and grief. The
      option of genetic testing, such as karyotyping, may offer an explanation for the miscarriage
      and may help some women find closure in their loss. However, no literature exists on a
      women's experience with genetic testing following a miscarriage. This assumption that the
      knowledge that can be gained from karyotyping may be a positive experience for a woman
      following a miscarriage should be studied and the results published. This study will address
      whether routine karyotyping should be offered following a miscarriage for the purpose of
      benefiting the patient's experience.
