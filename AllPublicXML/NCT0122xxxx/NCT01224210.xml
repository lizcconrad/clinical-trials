  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open Label, Multicenter, pilot clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of
      an oral selective Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (ambrisentan) in patients with
      portopulmonary hypertension.

      Preliminary evidence suggests that ambrisentan is safe and effective in patients with
      portopulmonary hypertension. The goal of therapy for these patients is to improve symptoms of
      dyspnea and to improve pulmonary hemodynamics to a mean pulmonary artery pressure &lt;35 mm Hg
      in order to make patients eligible for liver transplantation. Therefore, the primary
      endpoints for this study will include 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) and pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR).

      Eligible subjects will receive 5 mg ambrisentan once-daily for the first 4 weeks. After the
      initial 4-week period, investigators will increase study drug dose to 10 mg once daily (both
      5 mg and 10 mg doses are FDA approved). If 10 mg is not tolerated in the opinion of
      investigator, then the investigator may decrease the dose back to 5 mg once daily. Primary
      outcome is a change in both the 6MWD and in PVR from baseline to Week 24. Subjects will be
      monitored with liver function tests (LFT) every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks, then every 4
      weeks thereafter. These safety laboratory tests may be performed at a local phlebotomy
      laboratory or at the Investigator clinic. In addition, the Investigator will assess each
      subject for safety and efficacy at Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24. Following Week 24, subjects
      will be assessed for safety and efficacy every 12 weeks. Patients will be followed for a
      total of 1 year. After 1 year, if the Investigator feels that continuing the treatment will
      be beneficial to the patients, they will be provided with ambrisentan by Gilead
      Pharmaceuticals, free of charge.

After the initial 4 weeks the dose will be increased to 10mg (available doses are 5, and 10 mg) based on tolerance safety. Subjects will remain on 10mg until they complete the study. Dose adjustments may be made based on side effects.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects need to fulfill all of the following 4 criteria:

          1. Evidence of portal hypertension (by hemodynamic measurement, or by Doppler flow of
             portal circulation, or by clinical evidence of portal hypertension such as esophageal
             or gastric varices, as evidenced by prior upper endoscopy).

          2. Evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension by right heart catheterization (all three
             criteria need to be present) Right heart catheterization may have been performed up to
             30 days prior to screening

               -  Mean PAP (pulmonary artery pressure) &gt;25 mm Hg, and

               -  PVR (pulmonary vascular resistance) &gt;240 dynes/s/cm5, and

               -  TPG (transpulmonary gradient = meanPAP -PAWP) &gt;12 mm Hg

          3. Baseline AST, ALT &lt; 5 times the upper limit of normal, total Bili &lt; 3.0 mg/dl, and
             mild liver impairment with Child -Pugh class A or B
