      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known
      whether carboplatin and paclitaxel are more effective when given with or without cediranib
      maleate in treating patients with cervical cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving carboplatin and paclitaxel
      together with cediranib maleate to see how well it works compared with giving carboplatin and
      paclitaxel together with a placebo in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical
      cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To provide preliminary evidence regarding whether the addition of cediranib maleate to a
           combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel will increase the progression-free survival by
           50% from 4 to 6 months in patients with metastatic or recurrent, undetectable cervical
           carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To provide estimates of differences in response, survival, toxicity, quality of life,
           and pharmacodynamic end-points between the study arms.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
           on day 1. Patients also receive oral placebo once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy as in Arm I. Patients also
           receive oral cediranib maleate once daily.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response, partial response, or
      stable disease following completion of therapy receive cediranib maleate or placebo until
      evidence of progression or toxicity.

      Blood samples may be collected periodically for evaluation of the VEGFR signaling inhibitor
      cediranib maleate and identification of suitable biomarkers that predict cediranib maleate
      response. Quality-of-life is assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CX24 cervix subscale
      questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study and follow up.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months for 3 years, every
      6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
