  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study comparing intravesical injection of
      BOTOX to placebo. Study subjects will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to one of the following
      treatment groups:

      Group 1 n=20 BOTOX® 200U Group 2 n=20 Placebo BOTOX® (saline) At Visit 2 (Treatment, Day 0),
      subjects will receive one injection cycle of BOTOX (200U) or placebo (saline). The study
      duration is approximately 284 days and consists of a Screening Visit (Day -7 to -14), a
      Treatment/Randomization Visit (Visit 2, Day 0), and Follow-up Visits at 7, 30, 90, 180, and
      270 Days. Telephone Follow-ups will be made 3 days following the injection cycle.

      Subjects demonstrating an insufficient response to treatment may receive an open-label
      injection cycle of BOTOX (200U) at Day 90. Subjects receiving this injection will re-commence
      Follow-up Visits and be followed for an additional 270 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male outpatients of any race, between 40 and 90 years of age.

          2. Clinical signs and symptoms of frequency (&gt;=8 micturitions/day) and urgency (&gt;=2
             episodes/day).

          3. Urodynamic history consistent with OAB that developed in conjunction with BPO and that
             persists for at least 3 months post TURP or PVP, RRP or other obstruction relieving
             procedure.

          4. OAB inadequately controlled with anticholinergic medications, as per Investigator
             opinion.

          5. Qmax &gt;12mL/s with a voided volume of &gt;125mL.

          6. IPSS &gt;12, with IPSS QoL &gt;3 at study Visit 1.

          7. Willing to use clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) to empty the bladder or is
             willing to have an indwelling catheter, if necessary following study treatment.

          8. Able to understand the requirements of the study, including completing questionnaires
             and signing Informed Consent/HIPAA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of interstitial cystitis, uninvestigated hematuria, bladder outlet
             obstruction due to vesical neck contracture, mullerian duct cysts, urethral
             obstruction due to stricture/valves/sclerosis of urethral tumor, radiation cystitis,
             genitourinary tuberculosis, bladder calculi, or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.

          2. Known history of clinically significant cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular
             disease, or arrhythmia.

          3. History of spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, or other neurological disease
             which may be contributing to OAB.

          4. Known history of hydronephrosis.

          5. Current indwelling catheter, or removal of chronic catheter &lt;1 month prior to study
             entry.

             patient bladder diary during the screening period]

         10. Medical condition that may increase their risk of exposure to botulinum toxin
             including diagnosed Myasthenia Gravis, Eaton-Lambert Syndrome, Amyotrophic Lateral
             Sclerosis or any other disease that might interfere with neuromuscular function.

         11. Allergy or sensitivity to any component of BOTOX® (Section 5.2).

         13. Evidence of recent alcohol/drug abuse.

         14. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have a significant condition that
