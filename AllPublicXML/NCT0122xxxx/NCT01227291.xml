      The aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerance and effect on unmedicated subjects with
      elevated IOP. An unmedicated subject is considered a person without any IOP/glaucoma
      treatment at least one month before recruitment.

    <description>Local Tolerance and ocular surface(cornea and conjunctival) on the area of administration 24 hours after last administration of multiple dose during 7 days of administration. It will be performed using a slit lamp which will be performed before, during and after the administration at established times. Adverse events will be registered and the determination of subjective tolerance will use the visual analogical scale (VAS) in cases where a subjects refers them.</description>
