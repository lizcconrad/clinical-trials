  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical use of genetic testing is expanding and, as a result, the number of variants
      identified in patients is growing. Knowledge of the clinical impact of these variants
      improves over time. However, the combination of more testing and the rapid evolution of
      genetic knowledge make it impossible for clinicians to fully account for the latest
      implications of their patients' genetic profiles as patient care decisions are made. This
      proposed study plans to enhance and evaluate IT infrastructure developed to provide timely
      genetic variant updates and patient search functionality to clinicians to assist in
      optimizing patient care.

      A. Specific Aims

      Aim 1: To assess the usability of successive versions of our EHR genetic display screens and
      variant-based patient search functionality.

      Formal usability studies will be conducted with each new release of the GeneInsight Clinic
      (GIC) application in order to maximize its effectiveness and efficiency, and user
      satisfaction. Results from these studies will be used along with functional and technical
      requirements in designing enhancements to each successive version of the software.

      Hypothesis: The usability of GeneInsight Clinic and the application's effectiveness,
      efficiency, and user satisfaction will improve with each successive version.

      Aim 2. To assess the decision-making process associated with issuing alerts relating to new
      knowledge on germline variants.

      Changes to cardiomyopathy and hearing loss variant level information will be placed in a
      queue for evaluation. A board-certified clinical laboratory geneticist will determine which
      changes should be released as an &quot;alert&quot; resulting in an update to the GIC and a notification
      to the clinician. This decision-making process will be evaluated.

      Hypothesis: Evaluation of decision-making regarding release of genetic variant update alerts
      will identify patient and physician characteristics, and levels of significance of genetic
      variant updates that influence alerting decisions.

      Aim 3. To measure the impact on efficiency of new genetic knowledge being incorporated into
      clinical care as a result of improved genetic IT infrastructure support.

      Currently, clinicians learn of germline genetic variant updates when they choose to call the
      genetic laboratories to check for any possible new information on genetic tests of interest.
      With the GIC alerting system, treating clinicians will proactively receive genetic variant
      updates relevant to their patients. For cancer genotyping tests, once an associated variant
      is determined to have clinical significance, treating oncologists are interested in
      identifying all their patients with this variant to evaluate whether the patient's care plan
      should be modified. With the GIC patient search functionality, treating clinicians will be
      able to identify all their patients with the genetic variant of interest.

      Hypothesis: The availability of the GIC tool will greatly reduce the time delay associated
      with distributing updated variant information to treating clinicians and will reduce the
      number of calls the Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (LMM) receives requesting variant
      updates. The efficiency of identifying all patients with clinically significant variants will
      be improved through use of the PGE tool.

      Aim 4: To evaluate the satisfaction of treating clinicians, perceived impact on clinical
      care, and net effect on clinician workload associated with deploying genetic infrastructure.

      Hypothesis: The introduction and subsequent revisions of the PGE tool will result in improved
      satisfaction, a perceived reduction in clinician workload, and a perceived improvement in
      clinical care.

    <description>Phone and email logging procedures will be implemented before study onset to establish a solid baseline. Laboratory staff will log each time they receive a phone call or email requesting updated information on a genetic variant. These logs will be maintained throughout the study period even once the GIC tool becomes available.
System auditing processes will capture data on when genetic variants are updated, when alerts are sent, and clinician accesses to online screens.
Centralized system data will be evaluated to track usage of the GIC patient search functions, using a flagging approach.</description>

    <measure>Perception of Impact of Variant Update Significance Level Alerting on Clinician Workload</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuous Across 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Surveys will be constructed that ask treating clinicians about their experience with using the GIC and its perceived impact on workload. The surveys will be distributed both pre and post implementation of the GIC system to provide comparative data. Interviews will also be conducted, transcribed, coded for themes, and open-ended comments will be classified to reflect issues relating to clinician experience with the GIC. Call logs and centralized system audit information which can track time spent using the tool will be used to determine time and effort required to get updated information.</description>

    <description>GeneInsight Clinic (GIC) is a clinical interface tool that provides genetics IT support infrastructure designed to address key genetic data and knowledge management issues.
The GIC enables the delivery of patient specific alerts when new information is learned about a variant after it has been reported to a treating clinician. The prototype for this study shows multiple tests, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy test updates, hearing loss test updates and broad spectrum genotyping test updates. Our intention is to build this functionality in a scalable manner that will ultimately accommodate whole genome sequencing.</description>
