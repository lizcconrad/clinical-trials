  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation (TCEMS) is well established intervention for
      rehabilitation of clinically stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

      The investigators have conceived this study to test whether TCEMS is feasible and tolerated
      by patients experiencing severe physical and psychical challenge of acutely exacerbated COPD.

    <description>On the first hospitalization day patients received lower extremity TCEMS. We used GymnaUniphy device (GymnaUniphy N.V., 2004, 3740 Bilzen, Belgium) with four surface patch electrodes applied over each lower extremity quadriceps muscle. Patients were in the supine position and were advised to relax during sessions. A prespecified program for lower extremity strength training in sessions of 25 minutes, twice a day (first training in the morning, second in the afternoon, with minimal time difference of 6 hours) was performed six days per week during the hospitalization.</description>
