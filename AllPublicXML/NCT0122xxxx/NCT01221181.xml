      This is an open label, non-blinded, proof of concept efficacy and safety study of eculizumab
      in patients with biopsy proven DDD or C3 nephropathy. The trial will consist of adult
      patients with these diseases who have &gt; 1 gram of proteinuria or a decreased glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR), both predictors of a poor long-term outcome in many glomerular
      diseases. They will be treated with eculizumab for one year. The goals will be to determine
      whether treatment leads to an improvement in kidney function, defined by remissions of
      proteinuria and improvements in estimated GFR (measured by serum creatinine), and to
      improvement in histologic parameters, including percentage of non-affected glomeruli,
      interstitial fibrosis, intensity of C3 staining of immunofluorescence, and amount of electron
      dense deposits by electron microscopy.

      All enrolled subjects will receive eculizumab treatment for one year. There will be 29 study
      visits over 53 weeks. The goal is to determine whether this treatment will improve kidney
      function, as evidenced by less protein in the urine and improved lab results.

      An EXTENSION TREATMENT PHASE has been added. After completing the study, patients are
      followed with labs every four weeks as per standard of care. If labs suggest a relapse, they
      will be allowed to continue on therapy at the previous dosage until this drug receives FDA
      approval for this indication. Treatment intervals and dosage are identical to the original
      study.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in adult
      patients with dense deposit disease and C3 nephropathy.

      Dense deposit disease (DDD), also called membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type
      II, is a rare form of glomerulonephritis named because of the characteristic appearance of
      electron-dense material in the glomerular basement membrane observed on kidney biopsy. The
      principle immune defect in DDD is excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway,
      with deposition of complement components in the glomerular basement membrane. Hence, by
      immunofluorescence microscopy, there is heavy C3 deposited along the basement membrane. Some
      patients have been found to have deficiencies of Factor H or Factor I, inhibitors of C3
      activation. Others have a C3 nephritic factor, an antibody that activates the alternative
      complement cascade. It has recently been recognized that C3 nephropathy, a rare glomerular
      disease with mesangial cell proliferation and C3 deposition by immunofluorescence microscopy,
      is associated with similar over-activation of the alternative complete cascade.

      While DDD affects mostly children and young adults, in the series of 32 patients from
      Columbia with DDD whose biopsies were read from 1977-2007, 18 patients (56%) were older than
      16 years of age at the time of diagnosis, and about 40% of patients were over 30 years old.
      The age division is important for two reasons. First, in the Columbia series, children
      appeared to have better clinical outcomes than adults. While 25.9% of all patients had a
      complete remission, there was a significant distinction between adults, of whom only 7.1%
      achieved complete remission, and children, of whom 46.1% achieved complete remission. Of the
      remaining patients who did not achieve remission, 42.9% of adults, compared to only 7.7% of
      children, progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD) over a mean follow-up of over 5 years.
      Second, as there are no large clinical trials to guide specific interventions for DDD and the
      role of immunomodulatory therapies still remains controversial, many nephrologists (including
      those at our center) advocate using immunomodulatory therapy only in selected adult patients.

      Immunomodulatory therapies not specifically targeted to DDD, such as corticosteroids,
      cyclophosphamide, and calcineurin inhibitors, have either been unsuccessful or not studied in
      a meaningful number of patients to warrant routine use. However, as the principal defect
      underlying DDD is excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway, with deposition
      of complement components in the glomerular basement membrane, a therapy that directly targets
      the alternative complement pathway may prove particularly beneficial for this disease.

      Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to C5. The drug
      is FDA-approved for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (in which mutations
      of complement regulatory proteins on hematopoietic cells lead to alternative complement
      pathway-mediated hemolysis). It is currently being studied for use in atypical hemolytic
      uremic syndrome, a rare disease marked by diffuse microthromboses related to activation of
      the alternate complement system. Eculizumab prevents cleavage of C5, thereby precluding
      formation of C5a, which has been implicated in glomerular inflammation in animal models of
      DDD. Moreover, by inhibiting the activation of C5, it prevents formation of the membrane
      attack complex C5-9. Speculatively, this drug could provide effective, targeted therapy for
      patients with DDD.

      Eculizumab was studied unsuccessfully in the past in patients with membranous nephropathy, a
      disease in which the alternate complement pathway is not over-activated. Despite the negative
      findings of this study, experience with the medication was gained at Columbia University
      Medical Center; in fact, we were one of the largest recruiting sites for this placebo
      controlled randomized blinded trial.

      The primary end point is complete remission, defined as remission of proteinuria to &lt;500
      mg/day with normal renal function. Partial remission, a secondary endpoint, will be defined
      as reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to &lt;2 g/day with stable renal function (i.e.
      no more than a 20% increase in serum creatinine). Other secondary endpoints will be based on
      histologic parameters from renal biopsies performed after 1 year of therapy and compared to
      pre-treatment (baseline) biopsies; these include change in intensity of C3 staining on
      immunofluorescence, change in percentage of non-affected glomeruli, change in percentage of
      interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and changes in electron dense deposits by electron
      microscopy. No response will be defined as failure to meet criteria for either complete or
      partial remission, including patients with unremitting proteinuria, progressive chronic
      kidney disease, or progression to ESRD.

Patients will be observed for 60 minutes after the first 5 infusions, then 30 minutes after all subsequent infusions. Patients will not be allowed to take other immunomodulatory therapies during the study period but will continue on their other non-immunomodulatory therapies (e.g. ACE inhibitors, -statins, aspirin) without modifications unless clinically indicated. All patients, if unvaccinated, will be given N. meningitidis vaccine at least two weeks prior to first eculizumab exposure. All female patients of childbearing potential will be asked to use adequate contraception methods during treatment and up to 5 months following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment.</description>
