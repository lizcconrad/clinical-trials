  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, observer-blind phase IIa study with intraindividual
      comparison of treated versus untreated to assess the wound healing efficacy of Tyrosur® Gel
      after experimental impairment of the skin using an abrasive wound healing model.

      In the investigation two small, superficial, abrasive wounds will be induced on the right
      forearm and one on the left forearm of each subject using a sterile surgical hand brush.
      These wounds will then be treated with the investigational products. The wound healing will
      be clinically assessed and photographs will be taken for documentation.
