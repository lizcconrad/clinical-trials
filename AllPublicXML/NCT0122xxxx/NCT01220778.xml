      Background: It is now generally accepted that an active lifestyle is beneficial for
      cognition, but can these benefits be transmitted for the active pregnant woman to her unborn
      child? This has been demonstrated in rats where the pups born of mothers who exercised during
      pregnancy had increased hippocampal neurogenesis and better memory and learning capabilities.
      Human studies tend to confirm this by looking at behavioral results, ie. better orientation
      and state regulation skills in newborns. The aim of the present study is to verify this on
      the electrophysiological level and to determine the effects of an active lifestyle during
      pregnancy on the newborn's brain development.

      Methods: 60 pregnant women will be included in a randomized controlled trial. The exercise
      group will be asked to exercise a minimum of 20 minutes, 3 times per week, at a minimal
      intensity of 55% of their maximal aerobic capacity. The control group will not be given
      exercise counselling. Newborns' brain activity will be recorded using electroencephalography
      (EEG) 10 days post partum. The primary outcome measure will be the amplitude and latency of
      the mismatch negativity (MMN), a component of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) that
      can be used to investigate the auditory sensory memory.
