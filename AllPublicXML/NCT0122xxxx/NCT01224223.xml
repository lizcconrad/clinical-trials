    <textblock>
      Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have been studied for their ability to suppress T
      cell responses in vivo and in vitro. As a result, MDSC can regulate cellular responses to
      chronic inflammatory conditions such as cancer, leading to the induction of tolerance and,
      ultimately, tumor escape from immune surveillance.
