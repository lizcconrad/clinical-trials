  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAVE 2 trial is a phase I, open label, 12-month trial of intravitreal ranibizumab 2.0 mg
      in patients with ischemic CRVO who have been either previously treated with ranibizumab or
      treatment naïve.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most devastating complication of ischemic CRVO is the development of anterior segment
      neovascularization and the resulting morbidity from neovascular glaucoma. This complication
      appears to be directly correlated with intraocular VEGF levels. Currently there is no proven
      treatment to decrease the formation of rubeosis. Current management of the disease consists
      of pan-retinal photocoagulation once significant anterior segment neovascularization becomes
      manifest. This treatment destroys peripheral retina (with peripheral retinal field) and
      presumably works by eventually lowering ocular VEGF levels which causes secondary regression
      of rubeosis.

      As ranibizumab blocks VEGF, this treatment when delivered intraocularly may prevent
      neo-vascular glaucoma while preserving peripheral visual fields in this patient population.

      A higher dose of ranibizumab may allow for both a longer duration of treatment effect and
      potentially more efficacy leading to better outcomes for patients that are somewhat treatment
      resistant and need continual therapy. Nonclinical and early clinical data indicate that
      higher doses of ranibizumab up to and including 2.0 mg are safe and tolerated by patients.

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             other findings giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use an investigational drug, might affect interpretation of the
             results of the study, or render the subject at high risk from treatment complications

        Other

          -  History of allergy to fluorescein, not amenable to treatment

          -  Inability to obtain fundus photographs or fluorescein angiograms of sufficient quality
