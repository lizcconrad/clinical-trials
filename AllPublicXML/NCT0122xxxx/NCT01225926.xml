      The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare uncorrected distance visual acuity
      measurement in pseudophakic subjects with bilateral implantation of an AcrySof IQ Toric
      Intraocular Lens (IOL) versus bilateral implantation of an AcrySof IQ IOL.

    <description>Uncorrected visual acuity (i.e., visual acuity measured without spectacles or other visual corrective devices) was assessed using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts at 100% contrast and measured in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR). Each eye was assessed, and both eyes contributed to the mean. LogMAR 0.00 is equivalent of 20/20 and LogMAR 1.0 is equivalent of 20/200. A more negative logMAR value would indicate a greater improvement in visual acuity.</description>
