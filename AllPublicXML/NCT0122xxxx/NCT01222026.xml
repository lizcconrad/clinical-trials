  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with osteopenia and osteoporosis are treated
      with strontium ranelate/Ca+Vitamin-D or placebo/Ca+Vitamin D after successful surgical
      treatment of pHPT.

      Strontium ranelate/Ca + Vitamin-D helps to regain bone mass in patients with osteopenia or
      osteoporosis after successful parathyroidectomy for pHPT and results in higher gain of BMD
      than placebo treated patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The chronic excessive hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) has significant impact on
      bone remodeling. In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) bone turnover is increased, resulting
      in a higher resorption of bone and thus loss of bone density.

      After successful surgical treatment of pHPT bone metabolism switches from catabolic state to
      anabolic state again. However studies show that especially postmenopausal women regain
      significantly less BMD but these women suffer from osteopenia and osteoporosis most often and
      would need to regain as much bone mass as possible to prevent fractures. The optimal state
      would be to reach normal BMD again. Although this state is hardly reachable especially these
      patients may benefit from a treatment acting anti-resorptive and rising bone formation. The
      only drug combining these qualities known so far is Strontium ranelate.

      Therefore the hypothesis is that Strontium ranelate/Ca + Vitamin-D helps to regain bone mass
      in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis after successful parathyroidectomy for pHPT and
      results in higher gain of BMD than placebo treated patients.
