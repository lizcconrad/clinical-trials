  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we evaluate the role of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and MR spectroscopy
      (MRS), two advanced imaging techniques in magnetic resonance (MR) in grading and detection of
      microscopic infiltrating tumour in gliomas. These parameters are of utmost importance in
      optimal choice and planning of treatment.

      Patients treated with gliomatous brain tumours are included voluntarily. They undergo one
      imaging session on a 3T MR scanner prior to treatment.

      DKI data are quantitively analyzed in order to estimate specific parameters in normal
      appearing white matter, grey matter, tumor and peritumoral edema. MRS data are analyzed
      quantitatively and qualitatively with peak integration, ratio calculation and classification
      algorithms. Histological confirmation is obtained at subsequent surgery.

      Information from this study can be of significant importance in avoiding brain biopsies.
      Furthermore, information on microscopic tumour spread can be used during neurosurgery or in
      radiotherapy planning. An important advantage of these advanced MR techniques is the
      non-invasivity and the lack of ionizing radiation, two important issues in this relatively
      young patient population.
