      The purpose of this program of research is to determine whether curcumin, a natural health
      product, can prevent acute kidney injury and other complications after elective AAA repair.
      If proven safe and effective, curcumin is an inexpensive intervention which can be readily
      applied to almost 50,000 AAA repairs performed worldwide each year. New knowledge about this
      intervention may also guide its use in other surgical and medical settings to prevent
      complications to the kidneys, heart and other organs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a ballooning of the abdominal aorta, the major blood
      vessel of the body. AAA occurs in up to 2% of adults. Surgeons will plan an AAA repair when
      the aneurysm grows bigger than 5.5cm, because the AAA might burst without repair. Over 47,000
      AAA repairs are performed each year. Despite the benefits of AAA repair there are risks, and
      the kidneys can be severely injured. We will test whether the natural health product curcumin
      has an effect on biomarkers of inflammation, kidney injury and heart injury from AAA repair.
      Curcumin appears to fight oxidation and inflammation, which are ways that the body can be
      injured by surgery. We will study 600 patients who have elective AAA repair. The patients
      will receive either curcumin or a matching placebo. We will recruit the 600 patients from 10
      centres in Ontario. This study will help us determine whether curcumin exerts any biological
      effect on biomarkers and whether it is well tolerated. If there is evidence of beneficial
      effects in this 600 patient trial, this will justify a future larger trial to assess the
      effects of curcumin on outcomes most important to patients, families and their healthcare
      providers.
