  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of AKR963 compared to placebo and active
      comparator in lowering fasting triglyceride levels in patients with very high fasting
      triglyceride levels ≥ 500 and ≤ 1500 mg/dL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increases in triglyceride concentrations have been correlated with increased risk for
      pancreatitis as well as for coronary heart disease (Ginsberg 2001, 2002). The incidence rates
      for major coronary events in the Munster Heart Study increased from 4.4% among Subjects with
      baseline TG concentrations under 200 mg/dL to 9.3% among Subjects with TG concentrations in
      the 200-399 mg/dL range, and up to 13.2% in Subjects with TG levels ranging from 400-799
      mg/dL (Assmann 1996).
