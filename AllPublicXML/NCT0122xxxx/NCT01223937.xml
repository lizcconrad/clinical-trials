    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Nocturnal Voids Averaged Over a 3-Month Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline); Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3 (3-month treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the during-treatment visits (Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3) as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void. Change from baseline values for Week 1, and Months 1, 2 and 3 are reported below.
Comparison of the mean number of nocturnal voids at baseline and over a 3-month treatment period (obtained by longitudinal analysis of Week 1, and Months 1, 2 and 3) are reported in the statistical analysis. This was the first co-primary endpoint. The trial was to be declared positive only if the 25 μg desmopressin group had a statistically significant positive effect as compared to placebo on both co-primary endpoints.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adjusted Probability of Participants Achieving a &gt;33% Reduction From Baseline in Number of Nocturnal Voids for All During-Treatment Visits up to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline); Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3 (3-month treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>Probability of participants achieving 33% responder status during 3 months of treatment employed a longitudinal analysis assessing nocturnal void information captured in the 3-day diary. A 33% responder was defined as a participant with a decrease of at least 33% in the mean number of nocturnal voids relative to baseline. The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the during treatment visits (Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3) as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void.
This was the second co-primary endpoint. The trial was to be declared positive only if the 25 μg desmopressin group had a statistically significant positive effect as compared to placebo on both co-primary endpoints.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Nocturnal Voids at Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the during-treatment visits (Month 3 for this outcome) as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void.
Secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Probability of Participants Achieving a &gt;33% Reduction From Baseline in Number of Nocturnal Voids at Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Probability of participants achieving 33% responder status at Month 3 employed a longitudinal analysis assessing nocturnal void information captured in the 3-day diary. A 33% responder was defined as a participant with a decrease of at least 33% in the mean number of nocturnal voids relative to baseline. The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the Month 3 visit as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Time to First Nocturnal Void at Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first void was defined as the time from going to bed with the intention of sleeping until first nocturnal void or until waking in the morning in cases where there was no nocturnal void. The time to first void was derived from the sleep and voiding diary. The mean time to first void was calculated as the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the Month 3 visit.
The secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nocturnal Urine Volume at Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The nocturnal urine volume was derived from the 3-day urine volume diary. The nocturnal urine volume included the volume of the first morning void. Mean urine volumes were calculated as the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the Month 3 visit.
The secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 24-Hour Urine Volume at Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Twenty-four hour urine volume was derived from the 3-day urine volume diary. Mean urine volumes were calculated as the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to the Month 3 visit.
The secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Summary of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was any adverse event occurring after start of treatment and within the time of residual drug effect, i.e., within 1 day of the last dose of desmopressin. An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was any AE assessed by the Investigator as possibly/probably related to study drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimum Post-Treatment Serum Sodium Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serum sodium levels were monitored since hyponatremia is a potential serious adverse event associated with daily doses of desmopressin. The serum sodium level must have been within the normal reference range at the Screening Visit for the participant to be eligible for enrollment. A participant was to be withdrawn from the trial if the serum sodium level was &lt;=125 mmol/L at any time.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Nocturnal Voids Averaged Over a 3-Month Period</title>
        <description>The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the during-treatment visits (Week 1, Months 1, 2, 3) as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void. Change from baseline values for Week 1, and Months 1, 2 and 3 are reported below.
Comparison of the mean number of nocturnal voids at baseline and over a 3-month treatment period (obtained by longitudinal analysis of Week 1, and Months 1, 2 and 3) are reported in the statistical analysis. This was the first co-primary endpoint. The trial was to be declared positive only if the 25 μg desmopressin group had a statistically significant positive effect as compared to placebo on both co-primary endpoints.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Probability of Participants Achieving a &gt;33% Reduction From Baseline in Number of Nocturnal Voids at Month 3</title>
        <description>Probability of participants achieving 33% responder status at Month 3 employed a longitudinal analysis assessing nocturnal void information captured in the 3-day diary. A 33% responder was defined as a participant with a decrease of at least 33% in the mean number of nocturnal voids relative to baseline. The number of nocturnal voids was the average over 3 consecutive 24-hour periods prior to Day 1 and prior to the Month 3 visit as recorded in participant diaries. The first morning void was not counted as a nocturnal void.
The secondary efficacy outcomes (#3-7) used a hierarchical step-down approach in the order listed.</description>
