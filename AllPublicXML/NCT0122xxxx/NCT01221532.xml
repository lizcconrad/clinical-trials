  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize 700 non-psychiatric, non-obstetric, non-surgical patients
      aged 55 years and older at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) to usual care (ten days of
      prescription medication, discharge summary sent to primary care provider (PCP), and
      outpatient appt made for patient, and patient's nurse reviews discharge plan,) or usual care
      plus a peridischarge intervention (a visit with specialized in-hospital discharge nurse,
      development of personalized discharge plan, two phone calls from a nurse
      practitioner(NP)/physician assistant (PA) after discharge and availability of additional
      calls back from NP/PA, upon patient request, to help answer questions and assist patient's
      transition to outpatient care, and communication with primary care/subspecialty providers).
      The usual care and usual care plus intervention groups will be assessed for differences in
      mortality and rates of rehospitalization and emergency department use 30, 90 and 180 days
      following discharge from the hospital.

      The discharge process from the hospital to home is frequently marked by poor quality and high
      risk of adverse events and readmissions. It has been hypothesized that better coordinated
      care, personalized patient education, and follow-up calls to identify potential sources of
      adverse events, such as medical complications and medication errors can reduce
      rehospitalization and emergency room visits following discharge from the hospital. Although
      these interventions have been shown to reduce combined hospital readmissions and emergency
      department visits in English-speaking patients, none has focused on elderly patients in a
      diverse urban public hospital setting that includes non-English-speakers, who might benefit
      more than other populations from enhanced services during and after discharge from the
      hospital. Further, these labor-intensive interventions are costly to implement, and it is
      unknown whether opportunity cost of providing additional services in a limited-resource
      environment such as San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) outweighs the unknown clinical
      benefits.

a visit with in-hospital registered nurse, who provides additional patient education, assesses patient's needs post-hospitalization, communicates with the medical team, and develops a personalized discharge plan;
two phone calls from a nurse practitioner(NP)/physician assistant (PA) after discharge, in which adherence to medications, treatment plan, and access to outpatient care, and other issues identified during the hospitalization will be explored;
the provision of a phone support line, on which an NP/PA will call patients back within 24 hours to answer questions and assist transition to outpatient care.</description>
