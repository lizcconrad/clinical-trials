      The loratadine-pseudoephedrine combination has proven to be more effective than the use of
      these individual components. This prospective, randomized, double-blind and paralel study, in

    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of treatment in each drug group will be evaluate by global improvement of
      signs (nasal mucous edema, ocular hyperemia, nasal secretion) and symptoms (itching eye,
      tearing,itching nose, itching on the palate) of perennial allergic rhinitis, after 4 weeks of
      treatment. Symptoms as rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, itching nose, sneezing and itching eye
      were considered as secondary efficacy endpoint, along with the questionnaire of quality of
      life SF-36. Safety evaluation data will include report of all adverse events (including type,
      frequency, instensity, seriousness, severity and action taken related to investigational
      product) reported by patients, parents or legal responsible, ou observed by Investigator.
