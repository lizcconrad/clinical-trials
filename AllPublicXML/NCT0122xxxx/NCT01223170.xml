  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) are leading
      causes of death and represent 30% of all global deaths and 48% of the deaths in Europe.
      Moreover, the current trends predict increase in deaths caused by Cardiovascular Diseases
      over the next years. Secondary preventive efforts can decrease mortality risk as well as
      improve health among Cardiovascular Disease patients.

      This study suggests an innovative approach in supporting the self-management of
      Cardiovascular Disease patients after rehabilitation. The implied Randomized Controlled Trial
      has two arms and aims to investigate the effectiveness of tailoring in an Information and
      Communication Technology (ICT) based intervention. The tailoring will be based on concepts
      derived from health psychology theories, and will contribute in their further development.
      More specifically:

        -  Aim 1: To assess the needs of CVD rehabilitation patients that can potentially be met
           through the use of ICT.

        -  Aim 2: To assess the effects of a tailored Internet-based intervention on maintenance of
           self-management behaviors after a rehabilitation stay. Hypothesis: The intervention
           group (tailored) will have higher adherence a) to the Internet-based intervention, and
           b) to self-management.

        -  Aim 3: To assess the effect of mobile technology with activity sensors on physical
           activity. Hypothesis: There will be a relationship between the data collected from
           activity sensors and the self-reported physical activity levels.

      A parallel group, cluster randomized controlled trial. The study population is adult
      participants of a cardiac rehabilitation programme in Norway with home Internet access and
      mobile phone, who in monthly clusters are randomized to the control or the intervention
      condition. Participants have access to a website with information regarding cardiac
      rehabilitation, an online discussion forum and an online activity calendar. Those randomized
      to the intervention condition, receive in addition tailored content based on models of health
      behaviour, through the website and mobile text messages. The objective is to assess the
      effect of the intervention on maintenance of self-management behaviours after the
      rehabilitation stay. Main outcome is the level of physical activity one month, three months
      and one year after the end of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. The randomization of
      clusters is based on a true random number online service, and participants, investigators and
      outcome assessor are blinded to the condition of the clusters.

      The study suggests a theory-based intervention that combines models of health behaviour in an
      innovative way, in order to tailor the delivered content. The users have been actively
      involved in its design, and because of the use of Open-Source software, the intervention can
      easily and at low-cost be reproduced and expanded by others. Challenges are the recruitment
      in the elderly population and the possible underrepresentation of women in the study sample
