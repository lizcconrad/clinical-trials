  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the efficacy of Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and
      Therapy (TARGET) vs. the best validated psychotherapy for adults with posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD), Prolonged Exposure (PE). Male military personnel and veterans suffering with
      PTSD and problems with anger after returning from military service in Afghanistan (Operation
      Emerging Freedom, OEF) and/or Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF) will be participants. The
      goal is to determine if a present-centered psychotherapy that teaches skills for emotion
      regulation and does not require re-telling of traumatic memories is as efficacious as the
      trauma memory-focused PE psychotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is based on a theoretical and clinical model that involves a series of associated
      risks that are set in motion by exposure to military-related traumatic stressors in Iraq or
      Afghanistan. Trauma exposure places personnel at risk for PTSD, which in turn increases their
      risk of problems with anger and hostility, emotion dysregulation and experiential avoidance,
      and ultimately with alcohol abuse and aggression. The two types of treatments being compared,
      TARGET (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy) and PE (Prolonged
      Exposure), are both designed to directly reduce PTSD severity by reducing emotion
      dysregulation (TARGET) and experiential avoidance (PE), and therefore are hypothesized to
      reduce the risk and severity of alcohol abuse and aggression- and thereby to reduce
      associated legal and societal costs.
