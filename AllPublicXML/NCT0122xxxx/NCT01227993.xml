      Background:

        -  Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a disease in which fluid accumulates under the
           retina and can cause distorted vision. CSC often resolves on its own without treatment,
           but in chronic CSC the fluid persists and can lead to permanent visual loss. Chronic CSC
           may be partly caused by hormones called androgens.

        -  Finasteride is a drug that can modulate the effects of androgens; currently it is
           marketed as a treatment for male pattern baldness and benign prostate enlargement. The
           results of a previous brief study suggest that finasteride is safe and may help reduce
           the effects of chronic CSC. However, more long-term data are needed to evaluate whether
           finasteride is a safe and effective treatment for chronic CSC.

      Objectives:

      - To collect more data on the safety and effectiveness of finasteride as a treatment for
      chronic central serous chorioretinopathy.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals who previously participated in NCT00837252 (NIH protocol 09-EI-0075), Pilot
      Study for the Evaluation of Finasteride in the Treatment of Chronic Central Serous
      Chorioretinopathy, and demonstrated clinical improvement on finasteride treatment.

      Design:

        -  The study requires 11 visits to the NEI outpatient clinic over 5 years, with visits
           occurring every 6 months. Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical
           examination, eye examination, and blood and urine tests.

        -  At each visit, participants will receive a supply of finasteride pills to take every day
           and will need to bring any leftover finasteride pills to the following visit.

        -  Participants will have eye examinations to test vision, eye pressure, eye movements, and
           retinal thickness. Additional eye examinations will evaluate the retina's sensitivity to
           light and study the blood vessels and flow of blood in the eyes.

        -  Blood and urine samples will be taken throughout the study.

        -  After the end of the study, participants may be able to speak to their doctor about
           continuing finasteride treatments with a prescription.

      Objective: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a choroidal disorder characterized by an
      accumulation of serous fluid under the retina. Although acute CSC tends to spontaneously
      resolve on its own with minimal sequelae, chronic CSC tends to persist and lead to
      irreversible visual loss. The pathogenesis of CSC is complex; however, systemic androgens may
      be involved. A recent study NCT00837252 (NIH protocol 09-EI-0075), &quot;Pilot Study for the
      Evaluation of Finasteride in the Treatment of Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy,&quot;
      suggested that finasteride, an androgen modulating medication that is widely used in the
      treatment of various other conditions, may be efficacious as a treatment for chronic CSC. The
      objective of this study is to continue evaluation of participants in the completed
      NCT00837252 (NIH protocol 09-EI-0075) who clinically responded to treatment with finasteride.

      Study Population: Up to five participants previously enrolled in NCT00837252 (NIH protocol
      09-EI-0075) who demonstrated clinical improvement on finasteride treatment.

      Design: This is a 5-year pilot extension study to allow participants who demonstrated
      clinical improvement with finasteride for chronic CSC to continue receiving finasteride as an
      off-label treatment. Study visits will occur every six months over the 5-year duration.
      Participants will receive finasteride when they have serous fluid present, unless deemed
      chronic non-responders (defined as serous fluid unchanged as compared to baseline or serous
      fluid stabilized with no further improvement while on finasteride treatment).

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome will be the change in best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) at two years compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures include the annual
      changes in BCVA, changes in subretinal fluid volume as measured on optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) (a 30% reduction in subretinal fluid from baseline is considered a
      &quot;treatment success&quot; by NEI standards), changes in leakage as observed on fluorescein
      angiography (FA), changes in plaque size as observed on indocyanine green angiography (ICG),
      changes in fundus autofluorescence patterns as observed on fundus autofluorescence (FAF)
      imaging, changes in microperimetry patterns, changes in serum levels of testosterone and
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT), as well as changes in urine levels of cortisol.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participant previously participated in NCT00837252 (NIH protocol 09-EI-0075), Pilot Study
        for the Evaluation of Finasteride in the Treatment of Chronic Central Serous
        Chorioretinopathy, and demonstrated clinical improvement, as indicated by a reduction in
        subretinal fluid as measured on OCT.

        Participant has subretinal fluid present in the macula that has a volume of at least 0.1
        microliter causing visual change (such as reduced acuity, metamorphopsia or microperimetry
        deficits) and warrants treatment.

        Participant must understand and sign the protocol's informed consent document.

        Participant agrees to take the appropriate precautions to ensure that persons who are
        pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential do not handle the finasteride tablets. [All
        of the NCT00837252 (NIH protocol 09-EI-0075) participants were male given the male
        predilection of this disease.]

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participant has abnormal liver function testing (LFT) as defined by elevated alanine
        aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels that are greater than
        twice the respective upper limits of normal (ULN) (i.e., ALT greater than 82 U/L and/or AST
        greater than 68 U/L). If a participant has ALT or AST levels greater than twice the ULN,
        the participant can be enrolled only if cleared by hepatology.

        <title>Change in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye at Two Years Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.</description>
