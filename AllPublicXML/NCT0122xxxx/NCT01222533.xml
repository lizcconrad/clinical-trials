  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is compare the effect of different doses of tiotropium delivered by
      the HandiHaler and Respimat device on lung function. Additionally, the study will investigate
      the pharmacokinetic profile of these different doses. Studying the pharmacokinetic profile
      shows what happens to the medication in the body over a period of hours and provides
      information on potential effects of the medication.

          <description>Total number of patients randomised and treated in the study. This was a randomised 5-period crossover trial. 154 patients were randomised to one of 15 sequences and treated. The trial was blinded within the 4 Respimat treatments, but open for the HandiHaler treatment. Each of the 5 treatment regimens was taken for 4 weeks without washouts between treatment periods.</description>

        <title>SVPB Pairs</title>
        <description>The outcome measure describes the number of patients with a Supraventricular Premature Beat (SVPB) pair evaluated over the entire 6.5 h Holter monitoring period. Pairs were defined as 2 consecutive premature beats in a row. The arrhythmia variables were pre-specified for day 29 and analysed post-hoc for day 26. The lines &quot;Day 29 1st h&quot; and &quot;Day 26 1st h&quot; are related to the interval 0 h to 1 h, i.e. the first hour after dosing.</description>
