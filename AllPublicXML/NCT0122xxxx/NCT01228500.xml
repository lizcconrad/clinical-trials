      The primary aim of this study proposal is to test an innovative form of fetal bovine dermis
      bioscaffold in combination with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to enhance wound
      healing in diabetic foot ulcers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult Type 1 or 2 diabetic patients that present with foot ulcers.

          -  Ulcer size of at least 3 centimeters (cm) in diameter at its widest dimension.

          -  Ulcer depth: Full thickness (absence of all epithelial layers or deeper)

          -  Adequate perfusion (at least one palpable pedal pulse or pedal bypass graft)

          -  All ulcer durations will be eligible

          -  Patients currently receiving NPWT for a diabetic foot ulcer

          -  Patients must be appropriate NPWT candidates and be willing and able to sleep,
             ambulate, and rest with the NPWT unit in place.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active foot infections

          -  Presence of any serious disease including end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis
             or renal transplantation or active malignant disease requiring treatment which
             seriously compromises the patient's ability to complete this study

          -  Patients who are pregnant

          -  Allergies to any material contained within the NPWT or bioscaffold

          -  Any condition that would exclude NPWT use including but not limited to active
             bleeding, presence of malignancy in the wound or inability to follow any of the NPWT
             safety guidelines
