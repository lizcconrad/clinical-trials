      The purpose of this study is to find if adding oral pain relievers as DYPIRON and TRAMADOL in
      addition to the local anesthesia injection, can help reducing the pain intensity in patients
      who diagnosed as Suffering from peritonsillar abscess (PTA)and treated by incision and
      drainage .

      Control group: the patient will get local anesthesia injection with Lidocain. After 5
      minutes- the DR will preform the incision and drainage of the abscess.

      Then the patient will be asked by the vas score, the the pain intensity that he feels.

      Intervention group:the patient will get dypiron 4 ml and tramadol 50 mg. after 40 minutes,the
      patient will get local anesthesia injection with Lidocain. After 5 minutes- the DR will
      preform the incision and drainage of the abscess.then the patient will be asked by the vas
      score, the the pain intensity that he feels.
