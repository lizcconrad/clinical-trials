      The aim of the study is to use the antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects of lipoic acid to
      improve the quality of life of patients with asthma.

      The investigators will administrate 600 mg lipoic acid orally on a daily basis during two
      months concurrent with the patient anti-asthmatic therapy and evaluate the effects on
      resulting pulmonary function, inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and health-related
      quality of life previous to the initial of the treatment and at 60 days of the supplementary
      therapy.

    <textblock>
      Asthma is an inflammatory disease of high prevalence around the world. During development of
      asthma the presence of oxidative stress has been related to susceptibility and severity of
      the disease, thus making the use of antioxidant adjuvant therapy with lipoic acid (LA) an
      interesting treatment option. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of LA as
      an adjuvant treatment on functional, antioxidant, inflammatory, quality and control
      parameters of asthma in human subjects. The trial design is a randomized, double blind,
      placebo controlled parallel study.

      Adult patients (&gt;18 years) with history of mild intermittent to moderate asthma according to
      the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines were enrolled. It was required a positive
      skin prick test (&gt;3 mm) for at least two regional allergens. Patients were randomly assigned
      to receive lipoic acid or placebo for 60 days. Participants had an intermediate visit to the
      attending physician one month after initial of treatment to monitor adverse events and to
      undergo laboratory tests.

        1. Introduction. Asthma is an inflammatory disease of high prevalence around the world.
           During development of asthma the presence of oxidative stress has been related to
           susceptibility and severity of the disease, thus making the use of antioxidant adjuvant
           therapy with lipoic acid (LA) an interesting treatment option.

        2. Study design. A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled parallel study

        3. Methods. Participants and interventions: 55 patients with mild to moderate asthma from
           Hospital Civil &quot;Juan I. Menchaca&quot; in Guadalajara, Jalisco, MÃ©xico were included and
           randomized in block of 10 to receive; LA (600 mg/day) or placebo for eight weeks from
           January to October of 2011.

        4. Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of LA as an adjuvant treatment on functional,
           antioxidant, inflammatory, quality and control parameters of asthma in human subjects.
           Primary outcome: change on Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), secondary
           outcomes were levels of Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), glutathione (GSH),
           glutathione disulfide (GSSG), protein carbonyls, differential count of sputum cells,
           interleukin-4 (IL-4) and scores of quality of life and control of asthma questionnaires.

    <measure>Induced Sputum Carbonylated Proteins at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Proteins can become modified by a large number of reactions involving reactive oxygen species. Among these, carbonylation is an irreversible and unrepairable oxidative reaction. The main protein modifications originated from oxidative stress comprise direct oxidation of aminoacids with a thiol group, such as cysteine, oxidative glycation, and carbonylation. Oxidative protein carbonylation induce protein degradation in a nonspecific manner. Chemically, oxidative carbonylation preferentially occurs at proline, threonine, lysine, and arginine, presumably through a metal-catalyzed activation of hydrogen peroxide to a reactive intermediate. Carbonylation usually refers to a process that forms reactive ketones or aldehydes that can be reacted by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to form hydrazones. Direct oxidation of side chains of lysine, arginine, proline, and threonine residues, among other aminoacids, produces DNPH detectable protein products</description>

The Asthma Control Testâ¢ (ACTâ¢) is a five question health survey used to measure asthma control in individuals 12 years of age and older. The survey measures the elements of asthma control as defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). ACT is an efficient, reliable, and valid method of measuring asthma control, with or without, lung functioning measures such as spirometry. Each item includes 5 response options corresponding to a 5-point Likert-type rating scale. In scoring the ACT survey, responses for each of the 5 items are summed to yield a score ranging from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma).</description>

    <measure>Measurement of Quality of Life With the AQLQ (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire) at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) was developed to measure the functional problems (physical, emotional, social and occupational) that are most troublesome to adults (17-70 years) with asthma.
There are 32 questions in the AQLQ and they are in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli). The activity domain contains 5 'patient-specific' questions. This allows patients to select 5 activities in which they are most limited and these activities will be assessed at each follow-up. Patients are asked to think about how they have been during the previous two weeks and to respond to each of the 32 questions on a 7-point scale (7 = not impaired at all - 1 = severely impaired). The overall AQLQ score is the mean of all 32 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains (http://www.qoltech.co.uk/aqlq.html).</description>

        <title>Induced Sputum Carbonylated Proteins at Baseline</title>
        <description>Proteins can become modified by a large number of reactions involving reactive oxygen species. Among these, carbonylation is an irreversible and unrepairable oxidative reaction. The main protein modifications originated from oxidative stress comprise direct oxidation of aminoacids with a thiol group, such as cysteine, oxidative glycation, and carbonylation. Oxidative protein carbonylation induce protein degradation in a nonspecific manner. Chemically, oxidative carbonylation preferentially occurs at proline, threonine, lysine, and arginine, presumably through a metal-catalyzed activation of hydrogen peroxide to a reactive intermediate. Carbonylation usually refers to a process that forms reactive ketones or aldehydes that can be reacted by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to form hydrazones. Direct oxidation of side chains of lysine, arginine, proline, and threonine residues, among other aminoacids, produces DNPH detectable protein products</description>

        <description>Assessment of Quality of life scores with the ACT (Asthma Control Test). The ACT is a way to determine if the asthma symptoms are well controlled. The Asthma Control Testâ¢ (ACTâ¢) is a five question health survey used to measure asthma control in individuals 12 years of age and older. The survey measures the elements of asthma control as defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). ACT is an efficient, reliable, and valid method of measuring asthma control, with or without, lung functioning measures such as spirometry. Each item includes 5 response options corresponding to a 5-point Likert-type rating scale. In scoring the ACT survey, responses for each of the 5 items are summed to yield a score ranging from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma).</description>

        <title>Measurement of Quality of Life With the AQLQ (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire) at Baseline</title>
        <description>The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) was developed to measure the functional problems (physical, emotional, social and occupational) that are most troublesome to adults (17-70 years) with asthma.
There are 32 questions in the AQLQ and they are in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli). The activity domain contains 5 âpatient-specificâ questions. This allows patients to select 5 activities in which they are most limited and these activities will be assessed at each follow-up. Patients are asked to think about how they have been during the previous two weeks and to respond to each of the 32 questions on a 7-point scale (7 = not impaired at all - 1 = severely impaired). The overall AQLQ score is the mean of all 32 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains (http://www.qoltech.co.uk/aqlq.html).</description>
