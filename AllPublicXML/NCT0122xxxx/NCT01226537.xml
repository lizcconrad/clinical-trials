  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) and its vascular complications are the one of the most prevalent
      diseases in the state of Qatar. It is a multifactorial disease associated with the
      development of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and severe vascular
      dysfunction. The complications of diabetes are caused by either insulin deficiency (type 1
      DM) or insulin resistance (type II DM).Unfortunately, effective and sustainable prevention
      programs of diabetes are limited, and treatment options for type II DM are restricted.
      Current therapy is based upon control of blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides,
      primarily through insulin replacement in type I diabetes or oral hypoglycemic agents and/or
      insulin replacement in type II diabetes. New therapies able to prevent vascular complications
      of diabetes are needed to decrease the occurrence of end organ damage and improve the quality
      of life of the people. Safe and effective nutritional supplements that could be given along
      with the regular treatment of the patients that might reduce the need for insulin replacement
      therapy provide tighter glucose control and protect against oxidative stress and the vascular
      pathology associated with diabetes mellitus are the need of the hour. Our hypothesis is that
      supplementation of Taurine in the diets of diabetic patients might reduce the dose or need
      for insulin replacement therapy and protect them against oxidative stress that is responsible
      for the complications of diabetes mellitus.
