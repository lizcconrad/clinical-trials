      This observational, multicenter study will assess the efficacy and safety of Herceptin
      (trastuzumab) in routine clinical practice in patients with HER2-positive advanced
      adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-esophageal junction. Data from patients will be
      collected for approximately 12 months.
