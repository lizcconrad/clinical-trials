    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase III study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability and
      health outcomes of retigabine Immediate Release (IR) as adjunctive therapy to each of the
      following monotherapy Antiepileptic Drug (AED) treatments: carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine,
      lamotrigine, levetiracetam, or valproic acid in adult subjects with partial-onset seizures
      (POS) using a flexible dosing regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, flexible dose study of retigabine immediate release
      (IR). The study will enroll male and female outpatients (≥ 18 years of age) with
      partial-onset seizures (POS) who are inadequately controlled on their current monotherapy
      Antiepileptic Drug (AED). Following a Screening Period of up to 2 weeks, subjects will enter
      an 8-week Baseline Phase to determine baseline seizure frequency. At the end of the Baseline
      Phase, subjects who meet or exceed the minimum seizure frequency of 4 partial seizures per 56
      days, will enter the Treatment Period (4 weeks Titration, 16 weeks Flexible Dose Evaluation
      Phase). All subjects will receive retigabine IR starting at 150 mg/day and will be titrated
      to 600 mg/day by Week 4. From Week 5 onwards, subjects' doses will be maintained between 300
      to 1200 mg/day using a flexible dosing regimen to optimise response and tolerability. The
      maximum duration of the study is approximately 33 weeks (inclusive of a 3 week
      Taper/Follow-up Phase).

    <measure>Number of Participants With a &gt;=50% Reduction in Partial-onset Seizure (POS) Frequency From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through Week 20 (Day 140)/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants experiencing a &gt;=50% reduction from Baseline (BL) in POS frequency during the Treatment Phase (TP) (i.e., Titration Phase and Flexible Dose Evaluation [FDE] Phase) was measured. A POS has its onset in a limited area on one side of the brain. POSs may remain limited or may spread to involve both sides of the brain. For both the Baseline Phase and the TP, seizure frequency was calculated as a 28-day rate using the following formula: 28 x {[(number of countable partial seizures in Phase) + (10 x number of days with innumerable seizures in Phase) + (number of occurrences of status epilepticus in Phase)] / number of applicable days in the Phase}, where all days in the Phase are considered applicable (including days with 0 seizures), except for days on which the participant failed to complete the Seizure Diary. &gt;= 50% reduction from BL is calculated as 100 x (28-day partial seizure rate [PSR] for the TP - 28-day PSR for the BL Phase) / 28-day PSR for the BL Phase.</description>

    <measure>Functional Status Diary (FSD): Percent Change From Baseline in Epilepsy-related Worry</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 20/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked the following question daily: &quot;How would you rate your epilepsy-related worry over the last 24 hours?&quot; The original possible responses were 0-10, with 0=&quot;No worry&quot; and 10=&quot;Worst worry imaginable.&quot; However, in the summarization, &quot;1&quot; was added to each participant's daily response, changing the possible values to 1-11, so that there would be no possibility of the percent change from Baseline being undefined. Baseline and Treatment Phase averages were calculated for each participant. The denominators for these by-phase averages were the number of non-missing days for each variable and phase. The by-phase averages were used as follows in the calculation of percent change from Baseline for each participant: 100 x Treatment Phase average - Baseline Phase average) / Baseline Phase average. A negative percent change from Baseline indicates a reduction from Baseline.</description>

          <title>RTG Flexible Dose Plus C/O</title>
          <description>Along with concurrent carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine (C/O), participants initiated treatment with retigabine (RTG) immediate release (IR) at 150 milligrams per day (mg/day) (50 mg thrice a day [TID]) and titrated to 600 mg/day (200 mg/day TID) over a 4-week Titration Phase. This was followed by a 16-week Flexible Dose Evaluation Phase, during which the dose could be increased or decreased on a weekly basis between 50 and 150 mg/day, depending on efficacy and tolerability, with the total dose staying between 300 and 1200 mg/day. Participants who were unable to tolerate a minimum dose of 300 mg/day were discontinued from the study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a &gt;=50% Reduction in Partial-onset Seizure (POS) Frequency From Baseline</title>
        <description>The number of participants experiencing a &gt;=50% reduction from Baseline (BL) in POS frequency during the Treatment Phase (TP) (i.e., Titration Phase and Flexible Dose Evaluation [FDE] Phase) was measured. A POS has its onset in a limited area on one side of the brain. POSs may remain limited or may spread to involve both sides of the brain. For both the Baseline Phase and the TP, seizure frequency was calculated as a 28-day rate using the following formula: 28 x {[(number of countable partial seizures in Phase) + (10 x number of days with innumerable seizures in Phase) + (number of occurrences of status epilepticus in Phase)] / number of applicable days in the Phase}, where all days in the Phase are considered applicable (including days with 0 seizures), except for days on which the participant failed to complete the Seizure Diary. &gt;= 50% reduction from BL is calculated as 100 x (28-day partial seizure rate [PSR] for the TP - 28-day PSR for the BL Phase) / 28-day PSR for the BL Phase.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With a &gt;=50% Reduction in Partial-onset Seizure (POS) Frequency From Baseline</title>
          <description>The number of participants experiencing a &gt;=50% reduction from Baseline (BL) in POS frequency during the Treatment Phase (TP) (i.e., Titration Phase and Flexible Dose Evaluation [FDE] Phase) was measured. A POS has its onset in a limited area on one side of the brain. POSs may remain limited or may spread to involve both sides of the brain. For both the Baseline Phase and the TP, seizure frequency was calculated as a 28-day rate using the following formula: 28 x {[(number of countable partial seizures in Phase) + (10 x number of days with innumerable seizures in Phase) + (number of occurrences of status epilepticus in Phase)] / number of applicable days in the Phase}, where all days in the Phase are considered applicable (including days with 0 seizures), except for days on which the participant failed to complete the Seizure Diary. &gt;= 50% reduction from BL is calculated as 100 x (28-day partial seizure rate [PSR] for the TP - 28-day PSR for the BL Phase) / 28-day PSR for the BL Phase.</description>

        <description>The number of participants experiencing a &gt;=25%, &gt;=75%, and 100% reduction from Baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency during the Treatment Phase (TP) (i.e., Titration Phase and Flexible Dose Evaluation [FDE] Phase) was measured. A partial-onset seizure is a seizure that has its onset in a limited area on one side of the brain. Partial-onset seizures may remain limited or may spread to involve both sides of the brain.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked the following question daily: &quot;How would you rate the extent to which epilepsy limited your ability to do what you needed to do over the last 24 hours?&quot; The original possible responses were 0-10, with 0=&quot;Not at all limited&quot; and 10=&quot;Unable to do anything I needed to.&quot; However, in the summarization, &quot;1&quot; was added to each participant's daily response, changing the possible values to 1-11, so that there would be no possibility of the percent change from Baseline being undefined. Baseline and Treatment Phase averages were calculated for each participant. The denominators for these by-phase averages were the number of non-missing days for each variable and phase. The by-phase averages were used as follows in the calculation of percent change from Baseline for each participant: 100 x Treatment Phase average – Baseline Phase average) / Baseline Phase average. A negative percent change from Baseline indicates a reduction from Baseline.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 health survey is a self-administered, generic, 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Positive changes from Baseline indicate improvement.</description>

          <description>The SF-36v2 health survey is a self-administered, generic, 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Positive changes from Baseline indicate improvement.</description>

Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health).The physical component summary (PCS) score is a summary score representing overall physical health, which is derived from the 8 domains. As with the domains, PCS scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores represent better health. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Positive changes from Baseline indicate improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the SF-36v2 Mental Component Summary Score at Week 20/Early Withdrawal</title>
          <description>The SF-36 v2 Health Survey is a self-administered, generic, 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health).The mental component summary (MCS) score is a summary score representing overall mental health, which is derived from the 8 domains. As with the domains, MCS scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores represent better health. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline score minus the Baseline score. Positive changes from Baseline indicate improvement.</description>
