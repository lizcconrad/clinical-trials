  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacodynamics of single and multiple oral doses (SD, MD) of ertugliflozin (PF-04971729,
      MK-8835) in Japanese healthy participants. The secondary objective is to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single doses of ertugliflozin
      in Western healthy participants as compared to Japanese healthy participants.
