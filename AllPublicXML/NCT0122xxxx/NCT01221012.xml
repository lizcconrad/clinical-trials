  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current protective clothing of any kind, especially the nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC)
      protective garments, amplify thermal stress because of the inherent properties of the
      clothing material. High insulation coefficient and low water vapor permeability of the
      protective cloth limit the ability of sweat to readily evaporate, which consequently result
      with a significant elevation of body temperature and with excessive body fluid loss (because
      of inefficient sweating) that might result with significant dehydration.

      Combat soldiers require to perform intense physical activities under hostile environmental
      conditions, including in contaminated areas that need the use of protective garments. The
      ability to fulfill a mission derives from the soldier's professionalism and from his
      physiological limits. It is well established that wearing protective garments affect
      tolerance time (TT) and performance.

      To operate in contaminated areas suitable protective garments should be worn. The inherent
      characteristics of the current protective garments limit, however, the effective working
      periods with such an ensemble, which is further aggravated in hot climate. Thus, in an
      attempt to increase TT and enhance work effectiveness, improved protective garments, which
      result with a lessened heat-stress, are under different stages of development.

      The relative influence of air permeability properties, garment weight and garment
      construction on heat stress and physiological strain will be investigated.

      The results will be quantified in terms of body temperatures, heart rate, fluid balance,
      subjective sensation and the maximum wear time (if necessary extrapolated).
