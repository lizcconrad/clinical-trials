  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of regional contribution of different areas of the lung to its integrated function
      is often required, such as prior to lung resection in the presence of tumor or emphysema.
      This assessment is derived from the proportion of zonal radionuclear perfusion or
      ventilation. The investigators hypothesized that lung VRI may provide an alternative approach
      to assess regional lung function.

      Patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe COPD by lung function studies and clinical
      evaluation presented in stable clinical condition and were evaluated by lung sound recordings
      and quantitative V/Q lung scintigraphy. Regional signals (percentage of lung sounds) for left
      and right lungs were compared with the corresponding regional count percentages of each
      radionuclide scan, by V/Q scan regions of interest.
