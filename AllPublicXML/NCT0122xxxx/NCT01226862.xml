      The goal of this study is to promote the development and economic sustainability of
      telemedicine for acute stroke treatment. The study's objectives are 1) to determine if the
      use of telemedicine consultations for stroke patients will improve their care per guidelines
      compared to stroke patients treated by control hospitals; and 2) to determine if the care per
      guidelines provided via telemedicine consultations for stroke patients will be similar or
      equivalent to care per guidelines provided to stroke patients treated at hub hospitals.

      The Advancing Telestroke Care study will establish treatment and outcomes in three distinct
      study cohorts: hub telemedicine hospital, spoke telemedicine hospital and non-telemedicine
      control hospital.
