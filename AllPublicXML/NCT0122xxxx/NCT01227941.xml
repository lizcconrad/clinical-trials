    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether MK-4827 can be safely administered in combination with
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and if so, will obtain an estimate of the benefit of the
      combination in patients with ovarian cancer as compared to historical data with single agent
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The first part of the study (Part A) is designed to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and evaluate the safety of MK-4827, when
      administered in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Part B is designed to
      assess preliminary clinical activity of MK-4827, when administered in combination with
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin to participants with ovarian cancer. It is hypothesized that
      MK-4827 can be administered, in conjunction with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, with
      acceptable tolerability and that MK-4827, administered in conjunction with pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin, will demonstrate a tumor response rate equal or superior to that of
      historical data for pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone.

    <description>Initial evaluation of a 16-day dosing schedule: A loading dose of MK-4827 will be administered orally on Days 1-2 of the cycle and a maintenance dose daily on Days 3-16. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg/m^2 will be administered intravenously on Day 3 of each cycle. The maintenance dose of MK-4827 will be escalated, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. If the maintenance dose is escalated above the loading dose, the loading dose will be escalated to a level equal to the maintenance dose, for the subsequent cycle. Other dosing schedules of MK-4827 may be explored, including 7-, 10-, 21- and 28-day schedules.</description>
