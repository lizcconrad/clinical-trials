  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics/ Pharmacodynamics
      (PK/PD) profile of three doses of MOD-4023 on a weekly regime and one dose on an
      every-other-week regime administered for a period of 4 weeks in Growth Hormone Deficient
      Adult (GHDA) patients who previously were on a stable r-hGH treatment. An additional
      extension period of 16 weeks once-weekly administration of MOD-4023 aims to confirm the dose
      selection for future trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase II, randomized, open-label, parallel, 4 active treatment arms study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK/PD profile of MOD-4023 in pre-treated, normalized,
      GHD adults.

      The study is conducted in 2 stages. Stage I is a 4-week treatment period with 4 different
      dose levels/dosing regimens.

      Stage II is a 16-week treatment-extension period in which all the patients will start with
      the same dose (derived from stage I) and will be dose titrated to maintain IGF-1 levels
      within the normal range.
