  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will assess the efficacy and safety of Avastin (bevacizumab) plus
      Xeloda (capecitabine) in combination with standard technique radiotherapy of the pelvic
      region in the neo-adjuvant setting in patients with locally advanced primary rectal cancer.
      Patients will receive 4 courses of Avastin at a dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously (iv) every 2
      weeks and for 38 days Xeloda at dose of 825 mg/kg twice daily orally, plus radiation therapy.
      After surgery, adjuvant treatment with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and, at the discretion of
      the investigator, with Avastin 5 mg/kg iv every 2 weeks for at least 6 months will be given.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 8 weeks following completion of neoadjuvant treatment</time_frame>
    <description>pCR was defined as the absence of viable tumor cells, as determined by standard histologic procedure, in the tumor specimen (including regional lymph nodes) obtained at surgery. In order to minimize evaluation bias, tumor specimens were analyzed by both a central and local pathologist. The number of participants with pathological tumor stage 0 (pT0) and regional lymph nodes stage 0 (pN0) at surgery was determined. pCR was defined as the number of participants with pT0 and pN0 at surgery divided by the total number of participants with pathological tumor stage data collected.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (BL) and end of neoadjuvant treatment (within 6 weeks after the completion of study treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The frequencies of clinical tumor stage T (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or X), regional lymph nodes stage N (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4), and distant metastasis clinical stage M (0, 1, or X) at baseline and at the end of NAT were assessed. The frequencies of pathological tumor stage T and regional lymph nodes stage N at surgery were evaluated. The clinical tumor and lymph node status was assessed by clinical examination, endosonography, and/or rectosigmoidoscopy, and pelvic and abdomen computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Response to treatment had to be assessed within 6 weeks after end of treatment by using the same techniques performed at baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR)</title>
        <description>pCR was defined as the absence of viable tumor cells, as determined by standard histologic procedure, in the tumor specimen (including regional lymph nodes) obtained at surgery. In order to minimize evaluation bias, tumor specimens were analyzed by both a central and local pathologist. The number of participants with pathological tumor stage 0 (pT0) and regional lymph nodes stage 0 (pN0) at surgery was determined. pCR was defined as the number of participants with pT0 and pN0 at surgery divided by the total number of participants with pathological tumor stage data collected.</description>

The frequencies of pathological tumor stage T and regional lymph nodes stage N at surgery were evaluated. The clinical tumor and lymph node status was assessed by clinical examination, endosonography, and/or rectosigmoidoscopy, and pelvic and abdomen computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Response to treatment had to be assessed within 6 weeks after end of treatment by using the same techniques performed at baseline.</description>

After surgery, participants received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 and leucovorin 100 mg/m^2 IV (over 2 hours) followed by 5-FU 400 mg/m^2 IV bolus and then 5-FU 600 mg/m^2 IV (over 22 hours) on Days 1 and 2 every 2 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Response of CR at the End of Neoadjuvant Treatment</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants with an overall response of CR was evaluated as the proportion of participants with CR for the target and non-target lesions plus absence of new lesions at the end of NAT according to RECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker levels.</description>
