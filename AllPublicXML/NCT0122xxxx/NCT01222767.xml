             located in a non-irradiated area and adequately measured less than four weeks before
             study entry. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as

             formula) ≥ 30 ml/min.

         12. Adequate hepatic function:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit or normality (ULN), unless due to Gilbert's
                  syndrome.

                  ULN in case of hepatic metastases), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤
                  5 x ULN in case of extensive bone involvement).

               -  Albumin ≥ 25 g/l.

         13. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within normal limits (LVEF of at least 50%).

             entry. Both women and men must agree to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception throughout the treatment period and for three months after
             discontinuation of treatment. Acceptable methods of contraception include complete
             abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD), oral contraceptive, subdermal implant and
             double barrier (condom with a contraceptive sponge or contraceptive suppository).

             radiotherapy involving the whole pelvis or over 50% of the spine, provided that acute
             effects of radiation treatment have resolved. Hormonal therapy and palliative
             radiation therapy (i.e., for control of pain from bone metastases) must be
             discontinued before study entry.

          5. Patients with a prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer and in situ
             cervix carcinoma) who have had any evidence of disease within the last five years or
             whose prior malignancy treatment contraindicates the current protocol therapy.

                       hypertrophy; bundle branch block; partial blocks; signs of ischemia or
                       necrosis, and Wolff Parkinson White patterns.

               -  Uncontrolled (i.e., requiring relevant changes in medication within the last
                  month or hospital admission within the last three months) endocrine diseases
                  (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, adrenal disorder).

          8. Any other major illness that, in the Investigator's judgment, will substantially
             increase the risk associated with the patient's participation in the study. The
             Investigator should feel free to consult the Study Coordinator or the Sponsor(s) in
             case of uncertainty in this regard.

          9. Limitation of the patient's ability to comply with the treatment or to follow-up at a
             participating center. Patients enrolled into this trial must be treated and followed
             at a participating center.

         10. Treatment with any investigational product within 30 days prior to inclusion in the
             study.
