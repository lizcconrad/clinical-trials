      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of Naltrexone (NTX)
      and counseling on highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) medication adherence in a
      cohort of HIV-infected patients who report heavy drinking, or meet criteria for alcohol abuse
      and/or dependence, and inadequate (&lt; 95%) HAART adherence. All patients will receive a
      behavioral intervention, termed Medical Management/Medication Coaching or MM/MC. MM/MC
      incorporates the behavioral platform Medical Management (MM) from the National Institute on
      Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)-funded COMBINE Study to reduce heavy alcohol use with
      Medication Coaching (MC), a manualized treatment designed to improve HAART medication
      adherence in HIV-infected patients with substance use disorders.

          3. Have medical conditions that would preclude completing or be of harm during the course
             of the study.

          4. Have laboratory or clinical evidence of significant liver dysfunction (alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 5 times the
             upper limit of the normal range) or cirrhosis with a Child-Pugh classification greater
             than A or B.

          5. Have a known contraindication to NTX therapy (e.g. requiring opioid medication for
             pain).

          6. Be pregnant, nursing or unable to use an effective method of birth control (women).
