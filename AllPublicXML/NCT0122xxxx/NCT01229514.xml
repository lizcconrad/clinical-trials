  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthetic medications have been shown to cause neuronal cell death in the brains of
      infant rodents. Ethanol and general anesthetics both act on NMDA and GABA receptors,and
      appear to have similar mechanisms of toxicity in the immature rodent brain. Functional MRI
      (fMRI) is a technique developed for mapping brain activation and has been utilized to examine
      how the brains of children with a history of early exposure to ethanol function differently
      from children without such a history. This study will utilize fMRI to look for specific
      changes in brain activation patterns in children with a history of early exposure to general
      anesthesia, as compared to children without such exposure.
