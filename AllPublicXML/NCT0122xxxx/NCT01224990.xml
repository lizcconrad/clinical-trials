      The aim of the study is to assess the value of whole body diffusion weighted MR imaging
      (WB-DWI) as a non-invasive method. On one hand for pretreatment lesion detection and
      post-therapeutic tumor recurrence but also for early therapy monitoring with the intention to
      early identify patients with a poor tumor response. Our research group demonstrated that this
      technique is accurate in patients with head and neck cancer it could differentiate between
      viable tumor tissue and inflammatory or necrotic tissue at variable time points after
      completion of radiotherapy. In the literature it is stated that DWI can also predict the
      response to chemotherapeutic therapy. This is only true for focal MRI images (eg only in
      liver). This study aims to determine whether the whole body technique can efficiently be used
      because the distribution of metastases is systemic. The study includes two phases: In a first
      phase, a baseline study will be conducted; all possible injury types will be gathered to
      determine the variability in signal characteristics to finally determine appropriate
      thresholds to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. This should allow us later
      on to perform prospective studies. In a second phase, different applications such as:

        -  pretherapeutic staging

        -  Detection of post-therapy recurrence

        -  Early evaluation of systemic cytotoxic therapy.

      The results of the DW-MRI will be compared with those of PET, CT and conventional MRI which
      are now routinely performed for the diagnosis of colorectal tumors. The scans will be
      performed in a group of patients on a 3 Tesla MR system. This system is fully approved by the
      European and American standards and the patients will not be exposed to radiation or contrast
      agents. In principle, all patients treated for gastrointestinal cancer were included after
      informed consent from the patient. This study is important to investigate whether DWI is
      accurate in the pre-therapeutic injury detection and staging of gastrointestinal tumors
      compared with PET / CT and DWI. In addition it is important to predict the outcome after
      therapy.

    <description>These studies will be performed on a 3Tesla (T) MR system (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems). A major advantage of 3T compared to 1.5 T is the improved signal to noise ratio that allows whole-body studies to be faster and without application of external antennas, which greatly improves patient comfort.</description>
