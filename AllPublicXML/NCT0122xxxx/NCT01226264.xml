  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine cervical cancer is the second most common female malignancy. Therapy monitoring is
      essential to detect early recurrence. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is an
      emerging MRI imaging technique which has a potential value for the detection of primary and
      recurrent disease and for the assessment of response to therapy. The purpose of this project
      is to evaluate the predictive value of DWI during and after therapy in the prediction of
      recurrence of cervical uterine cancer. It will be considered whether DWI is able to provide
      early information about the response to therapy. This could enable the identification of
      less- or non-responsive tumors and in this way therapy can be adapted as soon as possible.
      Hence the investigators could offer the patient a more efficient treatment scheme and a
      reduction in toxicity related to the treatment could be established.

    <description>The purpose of this project is to evaluate the predictive value of DWI during and after therapy in the prediction of recurrence of cervical uterine cancer. It will be considered whether DWI is able to provide early information about the response to therapy.Several studies and a significant experience of our research groups have shown an advantage of DWI for early detection of cancer and evaluation of therapeutic effects [7-10]. This has not yet been demonstrated in patients with cervical uterine cancer. This study aims to expand the scope of the use of DWI.</description>

    <description>Nowadays, a large amount of possible treatment schemes for cervical uterine cancer are available but there is an increased need for early and non-invasive treatment follow-up. This could enable the identification of less- or non-responsive tumors and in this way therapy can be adapted as soon as possible. Hence we could offer the patient a more efficient treatment scheme and a reduction in toxicity related to the treatment could be established.</description>

    <description>An MRI examination (including diffusion-weighted sequences) belongs to the standard protocol for patients with cervical uterine cancer. The additional burden is therefore restricted to an extra MRI scan during and/or early after therapy.
MRI is a technique based on magnetic fields and do not require the use of ionizing radiation. Because of the strong magnetic field, a few precautions should be taken. This means that all metal and magnetized objects must be removed from the patient before entering the MRI room. Patients with a pacemaker, a cardiac defibrillator or other implanted conductor/prosthesis are for this reason not eligible for the study.
During the examination, an intravenous and vaginal contrast medium will be administered. In most cases, patients do not experience any discomfort and the use of these contrast agents is part of the clinical routine.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with cervical uterine cancer are, on a voluntary basis, enrolled in
             the study. These are patients who either underwent curative chemoradiation (mainly
             patients with advanced stage cancer) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (predominantly in
             patients with early stage cancer) before undergoing surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known contra-indications for MRI (cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants,
             claustrophobic patients) will be excluded from this study. And so are patients with
             contra-indications to Gadolinium-based contrast agents and patients with a known
             restricted renal function (GFR &lt; 30 ml/min).
