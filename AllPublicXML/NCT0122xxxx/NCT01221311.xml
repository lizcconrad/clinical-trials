  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for benign bile duct strictures involves placement of multiple
      plastic stents under endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance to progressively dilate or stretch
      it open. This approach necessitates multiple procedures which may extend over one year before
      the stricture is adequately dilated. The investigators propose a study comparing the standard
      approach of plastic stenting with the use of newer, fully coated metallic stents which are
      self-expandable, thereby permitting successful dilation of benign bile duct strictures with
      fewer procedures.

  <detailed_description>

      Randomization, as detailed below, is stratified by etiology of the stricture: chronic
      pancreatitis and postoperative (such as post-liver transplant).

    <description>Early clinical success will be defined as fluoroscopic resolution at the time all stent(s) are removed. If there is a persistent stricture after 12 months of stent therapy in either group, the patient will be classified as a clinical failure. We will compare early clinical success rates in each group.</description>

    <description>Among patients randomized to the covered, self-expandable metallic stent (cSEMS) group, the endoscopist will deploy a cSEMS of sufficient length to traverse the papilla.

    <description>Patients randomized to the plastic stent (PS) group will be treated using a standard algorithm. Specifically, the stricture will be dilated using a passage dilator and/or dilation balloon catheter, and multiple (as many as technically feasible) PS will be deployed depending on the baseline characteristics of the stricture as well as the diameter of the proximal and distal bile duct (standard of care). The endoscopist will sequentially dilate and upsize the cumulative stent diameter on ensuing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), until the stricture has been obliterated using clinical and fluoroscopic criteria (details below).</description>

        <title>Early Clinical Success</title>
        <description>Early clinical success will be defined as fluoroscopic resolution at the time all stent(s) are removed. If there is a persistent stricture after 12 months of stent therapy in either group, the patient will be classified as a clinical failure. We will compare early clinical success rates in each group.</description>

            <description>Among patients randomized to the covered, self-expandable metallic stent (cSEMS) group, the endoscopist will deploy a cSEMS of sufficient length to traverse the papilla. Dilation will not be performed unless the cSEMS deployment catheter cannot be advanced over a guidewire beyond the stricture. A biliary sphincterotomy may be performed at the discretion of the treating endoscopist.

Specifically, the stricture will be dilated using a passage dilator and/or dilation balloon catheter, and multiple (as many as technically feasible) PS will be deployed depending on the baseline characteristics of the stricture as well as the diameter of the proximal and distal bile duct (standard of care). The endoscopist will sequentially dilate and upsize the cumulative stent diameter on ensuing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), until the stricture has been obliterated using clinical and fluoroscopic criteria (details below).
