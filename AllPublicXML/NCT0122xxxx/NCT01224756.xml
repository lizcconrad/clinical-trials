  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of tinoridine hydrochloride (HCL), three
      times daily (TID), in the treatment of pain and inflammation in patients with acute
      tonsillitis and/or acute pharyngitis of nonbacterial origin versus placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillitis and pharyngitis are the most common upper respiratory tract infections. The signs
      and symptoms are sore throat, difficulty with swallowing and/or inflamed tonsils and/or
      pharynx. In most cases these infections are viral in origin.

      Tinoridine is a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug with a different mechanism of action than
      common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act by inhibiting the
      cyclooxygenase enzyme and thereby inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins.

      The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of tinoridine in the treatment of pain
      and inflammation in patients with acute tonsillitis and/or acute pharyngitis of nonbacterial
      origin versus placebo.

    <measure>Pain &amp; Inflammatory Signs &amp; Symptoms of Acute Tonsillitis and/or Acute Pharyngitis (Sore Throat) in participants receiving tinoridine.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5.</time_frame>
    <description>The change between pain and inflammatory signs and symptoms of sore throat on day 5, and sore throat at baseline. The rating scale assesses the disappearance and improvement of pain and inflammatory signs and symptoms as a whole on a 4 point scale (0=poor with no improvement; 1=fair with improvement on day 5; 2=good with improvement on day 3 and disappearance on day 5; and 3=excellent with disappearance on day 3) with a total score range from 0 to 12. Higher scores indicate less pain and inflammatory signs and symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5.</time_frame>
    <description>The change between pain and inflammatory signs and symptoms of painful swallowing on day 5, and painful swallowing at baseline. The rating scale assesses the disappearance and improvement of pain and inflammatory signs and symptoms as a whole on a 4 point scale (0=poor with no improvement; 1=fair with improvement on day 5; 2=good with improvement on day 3 and disappearance on day 5; and 3=excellent with disappearance on day 3) with a total score range from 0 to 12.

    <description>The change between pain and inflammatory signs and symptoms of inflamed pharynx and/or tonsils on day 5, and inflamed pharynx and/or tonsils at baseline. The rating scale assesses the disappearance and improvement of pain and inflammatory signs and symptoms as a whole on a 4 point scale (0=poor with no improvement; 1=fair with improvement on day 5; 2=good with improvement on day 3 and disappearance on day 5; and 3=excellent with disappearance on day 3) with a total score range from 0 to 12.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pain Intensity Measured on a 4-Point Categorical Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5.</time_frame>
    <description>The change between pain intensity measured on a 4-point categorical scale on day 5 and pain intensity at baseline. The rating scale assesses a pain score on a 4 point scale (0=no pain; 1=mild pain; 2=moderate pain; and 3=severe pain) with a total score range from 0 to 12. Higher scores indicate greater pain intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Visual Analogue Scale for Pain Intensity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5.</time_frame>
    <description>The change between pain intensity measured on day 5 and pain intensity at baseline. Subjects marked visual scales (in millimeters) that represented no pain to unbearable pain. Lowest Value: 0 mm. Highest Value: 100 mm. The farther to the left a subject marks, the less intense pain they feel; the farther to the right, the more pain intensity they feel. Higher numbers indicate greater pain intensity.</description>
