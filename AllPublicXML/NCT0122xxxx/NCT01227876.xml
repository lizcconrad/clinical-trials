  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is the primary objective of this investigation to compare the clinical efficacy of the drug
      test - Ster ® (prednisolone 1% ophthalmic suspension - Union Chemicals) in the comparator -
      Fort ® Pred (prednisolone 1% ophthalmic suspension - Allergan) in the control of
      postoperative inflammation in cataract surgery by phacoemulsification through periodic
      measurement of efficiency scores (number of cells in the anterior chamber, the presence of
      fibrin in the anterior chamber, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema and Descemet folds).

      The secondary objective is to compare the safety data observed during the study period, ie
      will be assessed the frequency and intensity of adverse reactions and compared statistically
      between groups.

    <description>We will evaluate the clinical parameters of number of cells in the anterior chamber, the presence of fibrin in the anterior chamber, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema and Descemet folds.The treatment will last for 28 days following the conduct of routine postoperative cataract. There will be a total of 04 returns after surgery and with them 07, 14, 21 and 28 days. On each return, will register the change of parameters of efficacy and safety.</description>
