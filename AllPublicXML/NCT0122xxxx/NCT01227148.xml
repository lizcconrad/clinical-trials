      To compare the differences of urinary nitrogen excretion, nitrogen balance and clinical
      outcomes between tightly insulin therapy and conventional insulin therapy in the ICU.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical illness is associated with increased circulating concentrations of proinflammatory
      cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 which may be
      important mediators of insulin resistance and results in hyperglycemia. Altered glucose
      metabolism was caused by release of counter regulatory hormones such as glucagons;
      epinephrine and cortisol oppose the normal action of insulin, leading to an increase in
      skeletal muscle proteolysis. It did not know whether tightly glucose control had beneficial
      effect in urinary nitrogen excretion and nitrogen balance.

    <description>A continuous insulin infusion (50 IU of Actrapid HM) in 49.5 ml of 0.9 percent sodium chloride with the use of a pump was started when blood glucose level exceeded 140 mg/dl to maintain a blood glucose level of between 120 and 140 mg per deciliter. The dose of insulin was adjusted according to whole-blood glucose levels, measured at one-four-hour interval in arterial blood or arterial catheter was not available. The insulin dose was adjusted by a neuro-fuzzy method</description>
