  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial of neoadjuvant treatment utilizing
      chemotherapy formulations with favorable toxicity profiles: weekly doxorubicin, PPX and
      capecitabine. It is expected this combination will at least maintain the efficacy of a
      traditional chemotherapy regimen but will be associated with less toxicity, particularly
      nausea, vomiting and alopecia. In order to accomplish this the investigators have designed a
      chemotherapy regimen whose components (or administration schedule) are associated with
      minimal or no alopecia and are also considered to have low emetogenic potential.

      In an attempt to improve the efficacy of the regimen the investigators plan to study an
      alternate schedule of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate administration (metronomic
      chemotherapy) which appears to inhibit angiogenesis and therefore enhance the activity of
      conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy administered concurrently.

      In this trial the investigators aim to determine the clinical and pathologic response rate of
      12 weeks of doxorubicin followed by 4 cycles of PPX and capecitabine. Metronomic chemotherapy
      with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate will be administered during the 24 weeks of
      chemotherapy.
