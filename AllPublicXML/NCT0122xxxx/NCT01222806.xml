      Background:

      - Cocaine addiction is often difficult to treat, particularly because exposure to others
      using cocaine or to pictures of cocaine may evoke cocaine craving and lead a person to resume
      cocaine use after having quit. Breaking this link with cocaine craving might improve
      treatment for cocaine addiction. Research suggests that repetitive pulses of transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the skull can change nerve cell firing in the brain.
      rTMS was recently approved as a treatment for depression, and is being studied as a way to
      reduce drug craving. However, because only a few small studies have looked at the effects of
      rTMS on cocaine craving, more research is needed on whether it is effective in reducing
      cocaine craving and use in individuals who currently use cocaine on a regular basis.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation can lower craving for cocaine when
      given in connection with cocaine-related images.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have used cocaine for at least 2 years and
      currently using at least 3 times per week.

      Design:

        -  This study involves an initial screening visit, two brain imaging sessions, five rTMS
           sessions, and two follow-up visits.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, urine
           samples, questions about drug use history and previous efforts to quit, and tests for
           breath alcohol and nicotine levels.

        -  Participants will have two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan sessions: one baseline
           scanning session before starting their rTMS sessions and a second scanning session after
           their last rTMS session . Part of each scanning session involves functional MRI (fMRI)
           scans. During the fMRI scans, participants will look at pictures related to cocaine use
           and pictures that are not related to cocaine use. Participants will also perform a
           simple decision task during the scans.

        -  Participants will have five rTMS sessions, one per day for 5 days in a row. Each session
           will last 1 to 2 hours. Participants will have either real or sham (simulated) rTMS
           while looking at pictures that may or may not be related to cocaine use, and will also
           perform a simple decision task that is the same as the one given during the MRI scans.
           The decision as to whether participants get real or sham rTMS will be made by chance.
           Neither the participants nor the investigators will know which type the participants are
           getting. - Participants will have two follow-up visits one and two weeks after their
           last rTMS session. At each visit they will be checked for cocaine and other substance
           use and for possible side-effects from rTMS.

      Primary objective: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) provides a
      non-invasive means of altering brain neural activity. This pilot study will test whether 5
      days of rTMS reduces cue-induced cocaine craving and cocaine use in cocaine users.

      Hypothesis: We predict that active rTMS will significantly lower craving for cocaine compared
      with sham rTMS.

      Study population: Thirty healthy adult cocaine users (for at least 2 years, currently
      averaging at least 3 times weekly) with no other major psychiatric disorders except nicotine
      dependence (DSM IV criteria) will be recruited from the community.

      Design: Following a baseline phase to evaluate subject characteristics, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive 5 days of active or sham rTMS treatment. rTMS at 1 Hz and
      strength 120% of the motor threshold will be applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) using an H-coil (HADD version) contained in a helmet, beginning 1 second before
      presentation of a cocaine-associated visual cue and lasting for 30 seconds. Brain site
      localization will use a computerized navigation system based on structural MRI scans obtained
      before the first session. Each treatment session (lasting around 31 minutes) will consist of
      54 trials (cue presentations): 36 with cocaine-associated cues and 9 each with
      non-drug-associated positive or neutral cues. No rTMS will be administered with the
      non-cocaine-associated cues. Subjects return for follow-up assessments one and two weeks
      after the final rTMS session.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be cocaine craving assessed by 100-mm
      visual analog scales before and after every TMS treatment and at one- and two week follow-up.
      Secondary outcome measures will be the 14-item Cocaine Craving Questionnaire, self-reported
      cocaine use, and urine drug testing at each rTMS session and follow-up visit, and changes in
      regional brain responses to cocaine-associated visual cues assessed by fMRI done before and
      after the 5 rTMS sessions.

      Benefits: There is no direct benefit to individual subjects. The future benefit to society
      may be development of better methods for treatment of cocaine addiction.

      Risks: The primary risks from rTMS are transient headache, scalp discomfort, decreased
      spatial recognition memory, and hearing loss (minimized by wearing ear plugs). Seizures are
      very rare when rTMS is administered within accepted safety guidelines and individuals at
      increased risk of seizures are excluded. The risk of inducing a manic episode is minimized by
      excluding individuals with a history of non-drug-induced mania/hypomania.

        i) Eighteen to sixty-five years of age

        ii) Cocaine user for at least 2 years, currently averaging at least 3 times weekly, with
        period of continuous abstinence no longer than one month within the past year

        sterilized. Female patients of childbearing potential must use either: (1) contraceptive
        pill or IUD or depot hormonal preparation (ring, injection, implant); and/or (2) a barrier
        method of contraception such as diaphragm, sponge with spermicide, or condom.

        Contraceptive measures will be reviewed with female subjects at each visit prior to the
        rTMS treatment.

        vii) Self-report experiencing cocaine craving when exposed to cocaine-associated cues

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        i) Personal or first-degree family history of any clinically defined neurological disorder,
        including organic brain disease, epilepsy, stroke, brain lesions, or multiple sclerosis; or

        seizure threshold).

        v) Increased intracranial pressure (lowers seizure threshold)

        vi) Lifetime history of major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mania,
        or hypomania

        vii) History of myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy,
