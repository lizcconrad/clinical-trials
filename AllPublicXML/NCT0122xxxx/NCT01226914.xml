      Primary Objectives

        -  To compare the amount of post-operative wound drainage between the group of patients in
           which EVICEL™ spray is utilized (Arm A), and the group of patients in which an EVICEL™
           placebo is utilized (Arm B).

        -  To compare the length of time to drain removal between Arm A and Arm B. Secondary
           objectives

        -  To compare the incident or rates of seroma, hematoma, and post-operative edema between
           the two groups.

        -  To compare the reported pain experienced in each group at selected time points using a
           standard numerical rating scale (NRS).

        -  To compare the length of hospital stay between the two groups of patients.
