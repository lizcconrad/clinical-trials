  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and associated with reduced quality of
      life for patients and enormous economic costs for society. Although effective treatments are
      available, a substantial number of patients fail to respond, and the time between disorder
      onset and treatment is typically long. The development of prevention programs therefore
      appears promising. The current project aims to prevent depression and anxiety by targeting
      excessive levels of worry and rumination, two important risk factors for emotional disorders.
      Participants will be selected on the basis of a high score on two validated questionnaires on
      worry and rumination. They will be randomly assigned to a rumination-focused
      cognitive-behavioral training delivered in a group format, a rumination-focused
      cognitive-behavioral training delivered via internet, or a no-training control condition. It
      is expected that both versions of the rumination-focused training will reduce symptoms of
      depression and anxiety, will reduce the incidence of major depressive episodes and
      generalized anxiety disorder, and will reduce symptom levels of other emotional disorders.

This group training is based on research showing that dysfunctional forms of rumination are characterized by an abstract evaluative style of processing, whereas functional forms of of processing are more concrete and process-focused. The training uses psycho-education, functional analysis, group discussion, experiential exercises and behavioral experiments to facilitate the shift from dysfunctional ruminative thinking to a more helpful concrete thinking style.</description>
