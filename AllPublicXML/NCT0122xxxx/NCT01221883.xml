  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a pervasive and frequent disorder. Early psychological treatment - but not
      pharmacology - effectively prevent PTSD.

      Current pharmacological studies did not include treatment given immediately after trauma
      exposure.

      However, a recent study of opiates suggests that their early administration may reduce the
      likelihood of developing PTSD - possibly by mitigating early post-traumatic distress (UCR) -
      within an adequate window of time.

      Benzodiazepines are often used to reduce anxiety and agitation during stressful situations -
      including traumatic event.

      These compounds may increase the likelihood of developing PTSD when administered few days
      after the traumatic event - but their effect as an immediate intervention has not been
      studied - despite their frequent and uninformed use at this stage.

      This work will evaluate the effect of diazepam - a BZ compound - on PTSD symptom trajectory
      following traumatic event in a randomized controlled design.

      Following the studies of opiates it is hoped that diazepam, administered within hours of the
      traumatic event, and before the first night sleep (a memory consolidating condition) will
      reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. However, an adverse effect cannot be excluded, and
      thus the investigators posit a bidirectional hypothesis.

      The importance of this work is that it will provide the necessary evidence to sanction a
      frequently practiced use of benzodiazepines.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients that have experienced an acute event that meets the DSM-IV A.1 PTSD
             criterion: &quot;the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or
             events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the
             physical integrity of self or others;&quot;

          -  Outpatients that also meet DSM-IV A.2. PTSD criterion: &quot;the person's response involved
             intense fear, helplessness, or horror;&quot; and

          -  Outpatients that have a heart rate upon ED presentation &gt;80 BPM

          -  Outpatients that hadn't fallen asleep for a night after traumatic event before ED
             arrival;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physical injury that requires hospitalization, interferes with a patient's ability to
             cooperate with screening or give informed consent, or otherwise contraindicates
             participation;

          -  Traumatic event reflecting ongoing victimization (e.g., domestic violence) to which
             the patient is likely to be re-exposed during the study period;

          -  Head injury with loss of consciousness or amnesia;

          -  Medical condition that contraindicates the administration of diazepam :

               -  hepatic insufficiency, severe

               -  hypersensitivity to diazepam

               -  myasthenia gravis

               -  narrow-angle glaucoma, acute

               -  respiratory insufficiency, severe

               -  sleep apnea syndrome

          -  Current use of medication that may involve potentially dangerous interactions with
             diazepam, including opioids, barbitals and another benzodiazepines; when used in
             combination, these drugs have additive CNS and respiratory depressant effects

          -  Women who are currently pregnant or nursing.

          -  Those at immediate risk of harming self or others; those who have a clinically
             significant medical illness or other significant psychiatric illness;
