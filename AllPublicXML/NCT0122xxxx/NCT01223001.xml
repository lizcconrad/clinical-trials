      The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg by mouth
      daily with placebo in the prevention of depression associated with mild/moderate traumatic
      brain injury and to enhance cognitive function.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg by mouth
      daily with placebo in the prevention of depression associated with mild/moderate traumatic
      brain injury and to enhance cognitive function. Research exploring the use of selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of post-traumatic depression generally
      validates this approach (Horsfield et al., 2002). However, the literature suggests that
      serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine may be more effective in the
      treatment of depression.
