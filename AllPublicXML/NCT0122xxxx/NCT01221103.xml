  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study design is based on the fact that the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of single-agent ofatumumab and bendamustine have been previously determined. The choice
      of the doses for the combination is based on the investigators unpublished clinical
      experience, as well as inferred from extensive experimental data on the use of other
      monoclonal antibodies in combination chemotherapy in lymphoma patients. The starting dose of
      the 2 main component drugs is the MTD of each drug as single agent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 60 years.

          2. ECOG Performance Status 0-1.

          3. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          4. Histological diagnosis of MCL (morphology, CD5+/CD20+ /CD23-, t(11:14) and/or cyclin
             D1 overexpression).

          5. Disease requiring treatment (patients with bone marrow only disease, who are
             candidates for a watch-and-wait approach, will be excluded)

          6. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function, unless the abnormality is related to
             the tumor and is unlikely to affect the safety of bendamustine and ofatumumab use.
             Adequate marrow and organ function will be assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to screening:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/µl

               -  Platelet count ≥ 75000/µl

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the ULN

               -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 4 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          7. PT-INR/PTT &lt; 1.5 x ULN [Patients who are being therapeutically anticoagulated with
             agent such as coumadin or heparin will be allowed to participate provided that no
             prior evidence of underlying abnormality in these parameters exists]

          8. Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment for mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL)

          2. Chronic or current infectious disease requiring systemic antibiotics, antifungal, or
             antiviral treatment such as, but not limited to, chronic renal infection, chronic
             chest infection with bronchiectasis, tuberculosis and active Hepatitis C.

          3. Other past or current malignancy. Subjects who have been free of malignancy for at
             least 5 years, or have a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer, or
             successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.

          4. Clinically significant cardiac disease including unstable angina, acute myocardial
             infarction within 6 months prior to Visit 1, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia

             dose of other glucocorticoid) for &lt;7 days for exacerbations other than CLL (e.g.,
             asthma)

          7. Known HIV positive

          8. Subjects who have current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of

             addition, if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive and HBsAb negative, a HB DNA test
             will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded. Note: If HBcAb
             positive and HBsAb positive, which is indicative of a past infection, the subject can
             be included.

             case reflexively perform a HC RIBA immunoblot assay on the same sample to confirm the
             result.

         11. Treatment with any known non-marketed drug substance or experimental therapy within 5
             terminal half lives or 4 weeks prior to Visit 1, whichever is longer or currently

             the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.

         17. Any condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the patient and their
             compliance in the study.
