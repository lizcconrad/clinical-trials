  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for effective weight control methods for obese children. Environmental
      strategies such as reducing the size of dishware and serving utensils, storing food out of
      view and reducing food consumption while watching television may reduce food intake without
      requiring conscious, cognitive self-control. The investigators propose to test these methods
      when added to a current state-of-the-art behavioral program.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:Inclusion criteria: 8-15 year old obese children (BMI &amp;#8805; 95th
        percentile on the 2000 CDC BMI reference) on the date of randomization. Our standard
        Stanford Pediatric Weight Control Program eligibility criteria will apply: both child and
        parent/guardian must want to join, both child and at least one parent/guardian must agree
        to attend sessions, and must agree to not miss more than 2 consecutive sessions. As we
        interested in testing generalizable strategies for weight control in diverse populations,
        the eligibility criteria are designed to be liberal, to maximize the generalizability of
        the results, but also maintain the internal validity of the test of the intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:Exclusions: To enhance internal validity, children will not be eligible
        if they:

          1. have been diagnosed with a medical condition affecting growth (a genetic or metabolic
             disease/syndrome associated obesity, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes taking
             medication, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, Chronic renal diseases, uncorrected
             structural heart disease, heart failure, heart transplant, anorexia nervosa or bulimia
             nervosa or binge eating disorder [present or past], AIDS or HIV infection, pregnancy);

          2. are taking medications affecting growth (systemic corticosteroids more than 2 weeks in
             the past year, insulin, oral hypoglycemics, thyroid hormone, growth hormone);

          3. have a condition limiting their participation in the interventions (e.g., unable to
             participate in routine physical education classes at school, requiring oxygen
             supplementation for exertion, developmental or physical disability preventing
             participation in interventions, children or parents/guardians who cannot medically
             participate in mild dietary restrictions and/or increased physical activity for any
             reason);

          4. have a condition limiting participation in the assessments (child or primary caregiver
             not able to read surveys in English or Spanish, child two or more grade levels delayed
             in school for reading and writing in his/her native language);

          5. are unable to read, understand or complete informed consent in English or Spanish;

          6. plan to move from the San Francisco Bay Area within the next 18 months.
