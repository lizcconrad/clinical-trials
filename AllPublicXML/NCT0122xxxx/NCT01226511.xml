    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if duloxetine [30-120 milligrams (mg)] given once a
      day by mouth for 10 weeks to children and adolescents, is better than placebo when treating
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 10-Week Endpoint in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) Severity Score Evaluated for Symptoms Identified on the Generalized Anxiety Subsection of the PARS Symptom Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PARS severity score for GAD was assessed for all symptoms identified in the generalized anxiety section of the PARS symptom checklist. PARS severity score for GAD was derived by summing 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, 7); each item ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (extreme severity/impairment/interference). PARS severity scores for GAD ranged from 0 (none) to 25 (extreme severity), with a score of 15 indicating moderate illness severity. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach adjusted for baseline, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment, treatment*visit, age category*visit, and baseline*visit.</description>

    <measure>Response Rate at Endpoint for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Using Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) Severity Score for GAD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was defined as the percentage of participants having a 50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the PARS severity score for GAD. PARS severity score for GAD was assessed for all symptoms identified in the generalized anxiety section of the PARS symptom checklist. PARS severity score for GAD was derived by summing 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, 7); each item ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (extreme severity/impairment/interference). PARS severity scores for GAD ranged from 0 (none) to 25 (extreme severity), with a score of 15 indicating moderate illness severity.</description>

    <description>PARS severity total score was assessed for all symptoms identified on the PARS symptom checklist. PARS severity total score was derived by summing 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, 7); each item ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (extreme severity/impairment/interference). PARS severity total scores ranged from 0 (none) to 25 (extreme severity), with a score of 15 indicating moderate illness severity.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 10-Week Endpoint on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S scale evaluated the severity of illness at the time of assessment. Scores ranged from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill). Higher scores indicated a greater severity of illness. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, baseline, age category, treatment*visit, baseline*visit, and age category*visit.</description>

    <measure>Remission Rate at Endpoint for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Using Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Remission rate was defined as the percentage of participants having a CGI-S score â‰¤2 at endpoint. The CGI-S scale evaluated the severity of illness at the time of assessment. Scores ranged from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill). Higher scores indicated a greater severity of illness.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 10-Week Endpoint in the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGAS was a clinician-rated assessment of general functioning. CGAS raw scores ranged from 1 (greatest impairment) to 100 (superior functioning). Lower scores indicated a lower level of functioning and greater impairment. Least squares (LS) mean from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, baseline, and age category.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS captured occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation: a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions: wish to be dead, and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation.

Duloxetine was provided in 30-mg capsules.
Participants who received higher doses of duloxetine at the end of treatment period participation received gradually lower doses of duloxetine over the 2-week recommended tapering period, and participants who received the lowest dose of duloxetine or placebo at the end of treatment period participation received placebo over the 2-week recommended tapering period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 10-Week Endpoint in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) Severity Score Evaluated for Symptoms Identified on the Generalized Anxiety Subsection of the PARS Symptom Checklist</title>
        <description>PARS severity score for GAD was assessed for all symptoms identified in the generalized anxiety section of the PARS symptom checklist. PARS severity score for GAD was derived by summing 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, 7); each item ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (extreme severity/impairment/interference). PARS severity scores for GAD ranged from 0 (none) to 25 (extreme severity), with a score of 15 indicating moderate illness severity. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach adjusted for baseline, pooled investigator, age category, visit, treatment, treatment*visit, age category*visit, and baseline*visit.</description>

        <title>Response Rate at Endpoint for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Using Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) Severity Score for GAD</title>
        <description>Response rate was defined as the percentage of participants having a 50% improvement from baseline to endpoint on the PARS severity score for GAD. PARS severity score for GAD was assessed for all symptoms identified in the generalized anxiety section of the PARS symptom checklist. PARS severity score for GAD was derived by summing 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, 7); each item ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (extreme severity/impairment/interference). PARS severity scores for GAD ranged from 0 (none) to 25 (extreme severity), with a score of 15 indicating moderate illness severity.</description>

        <population>Randomized participants with a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline PARS severity score for GAD [last observation carried forward (LOCF)] during the acute treatment period, excluding 9 participants from 1 site with major quality issues.</population>

        <description>PARS severity total score was assessed for all symptoms identified on the PARS symptom checklist. PARS severity total score was derived by summing 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, 7); each item ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (extreme severity/impairment/interference).

        <description>PARS severity score for GAD was assessed for all symptoms identified in the generalized anxiety section of the PARS symptom checklist. PARS severity score for GAD was derived by summing 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, 7); each item ranged from 0 (none) to 5 (extreme severity/impairment/interference). PARS severity scores for GAD ranged from 0 (none) to 25 (extreme severity), with a score of 15 indicating moderate illness severity. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach adjusted for pooled investigator, visit, baseline, age category, baseline*visit, and age category*visit within reporting groups.</description>
