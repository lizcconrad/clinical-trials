  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and preliminarily evaluate an intervention to assist young-middle
      adult rural breast cancer survivors to overcome functional impairments related to their
      cancer treatment. Younger breast cancer survivors (below age 60) have ongoing family, social
      and vocational responsibilities and recreational interests and are at increased risk of
      developing long-term difficulties performing these valued activities (participation
      restrictions). Rural cancer survivors are medically underserved and due to distance and
      geographic isolation face significant barriers to accessing traditional rehabilitation
      services. Alternative rehabilitation approaches are sorely needed for this population. Based
      on previous research with cancer and other medical populations a working draft of a treatment
      manual using a telephone-delivered Behavioral Activation and Problem Solving (BA/PS)
      intervention has been designed. Prior to testing the intervention in a randomized clinical
      trial, additional work must be completed. The specific aims of this study are to a. refine
      the BA/PS treatment manual, b. develop and apply treatment integrity measures for the BA/PS
      manual, c. assess participation restrictions and associated outcomes, d. preliminarily assess
      the immediate and maintenance effects of BA/PS, and e. examine mediators and moderators of
      BA/PS effects based on our &quot;Self Regulation&quot; model of functional recovery. 188 young-middle
      adult breast cancer survivors will be screened for participation restrictions following
      cancer treatment and 40 survivors with participation restrictions will receive BA/PS
      delivered by phone. BA/PS participants will be assessed for treatment effectiveness and
      interviewed regarding their experiences during treatment to provide information for refining
      the manual. The long-term objective of this line of research is to develop effective and
      feasible treatments for the medical and psychosocial consequences of cancer and its treatment
      in medically underserved cancer survivors (e.g., rural populations).

    <description>The Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (MOS SF-36) consists of eight scales (physical functioning, role limitations - physical, role limitations - emotional, vitality, well being, social functioning, bodily pain, and general health) and two standardized component summary scores (physical and mental). The physical and mental factors account for 80-85% of the variance in the scales. We will use the Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score as the primary outcome measure.</description>
