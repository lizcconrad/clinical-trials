      All patients who participate in this study will receive pazopanib. Pazopanib is an oral drug
      (pill) that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of advanced kidney cancer. In this study, the investigators plan to learn more
      about the way this drug works by using special scans (MRIs and Ultrasounds) to help evaluate
      how this drug is working on this disease. Approximately 20 people with advanced kidney cancer
      will be enrolled on this study.

      Overall objectives PRIMARY: - Assessment of early changes in DCE-MRI and ultrasound measures
      of tumor perfusion in the setting of pazopanib therapy for patients with metastatic clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma SECONDARY: - Correlation of baseline DCE-MRI and ultrasound
      parameters and clinical outcome - Correlation of early (48 +/- 24 hr after treatment) changes
      in DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters and clinical outcome - Correlation of baseline (and
      changes) in DCE-MRI and ultrasound parameters with VHL status in tumors and histocytometric
      analysis of endothelial cell activation in archival nephrectomy specimens - Provide an
      insight in the respective predictive values of DCE-MRI and US for pazopanib treatment
