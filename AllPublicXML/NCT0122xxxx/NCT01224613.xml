      The purpose of this study is to compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of
      self-administered intradermal influenza vaccine (Intanza)to nurse-administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized at visit one to either receive self-administered or
      nurse-administered intradermal influenza vaccine (Intanza). A blood sample will be taken
      prior to vaccination and 21 days post-vaccination. Participants will record information in a
      memory aid for 7 days including daily temperatures, solicited, unsolicited and general
      reactions. They will be called on study Day 8 to collect this information. Participants will
      return 21-24 days later for follow-up serology and review of adverse events.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>That the immunogenicity of self-administered intradermal 2010/11 seasonal influenza vaccine (Intanza) is non-inferior to that of nurse administered intradermal 2010/11 seasonal influenza vaccine. Specifically, that ratio of increase in geometric mean titres between day 0 and day 21 post-vaccination are greater than 2/3 (i.e. GMT (IDS)/GMT (IDN) &gt; 0.65).</description>

    <measure>Reactogenicity</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The reactogenicity of self-administered intradermal 2010/11 seasonal influenza vaccine (Intanza) is not significantly greater than that of nurse administered intradermal 2010/11 seasonal influenza vaccine.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observational</measure>
    <time_frame>at vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>85% or more of healthy adults can self-administer Intanza successfully; that is, they are willing to self-administer vaccine and successfully administer it, as judged by observation by a trained nurse.</description>

          -  Able to read, understand, and sign informed consent

          -  Able to be contacted by telephone for follow-up of adverse events

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of experimental vaccines within the month prior to study entry, or expected use of
             experimental or licensed vaccines or blood/blood products during the duration of the
             study.

          -  Receipt of immunoglobulin or other blood product within 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  Receipt of other licensed vaccines within the preceding 4 weeks

          -  History of a severe reaction following influenza vaccination

          -  Use of cytotoxic therapy or biologic modifiers in the previous 2 years.

          -  Plans to receive cytotoxic therapy during the study period.

          -  Concurrent acute moderate to severe illness. (Vaccination will be deferred until
             recovery. Subjects with mild illnesses with fever ≤37.8ºC orally may be enrolled).

             hospitalization in the last year.

          -  Receipt of any high-dose daily systemic corticosteroids (inhaled steroids are
             acceptable) within two weeks of study entry. High dose is defined as a dose of 20 mg
             of prednisone daily or its equivalent. Topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Failure to give written, informed consent

          -  History of febrile illness (&gt;37.8ºC orally) within the past 72 hours (immunization may
