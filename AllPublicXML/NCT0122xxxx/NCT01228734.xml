  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the progression free survival (PFS) time with
      FOLFOX-4 plus cetuximab is longer than that with FOLFOX-4 alone as first-line treatment for
      mCRC in Chinese subjects with RAS wild-type tumors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 246 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the duration (in months) from randomization until the first progressive disease (PD) observation as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, or death due to any cause when death occurred within 90 days of randomization or the last tumor assessment, whichever was later. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions, taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started (including baseline), or appearance of one or more new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 277 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time (in months) from randomization to death. For subjects who were still alive at the analysis data cut-off date or who lost to follow-up, survival was censored at the last recorded date that the subject was known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 246 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Best ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.0 as determined by the IRC. CR: defined as disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR: defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 277 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TTF was defined as time from randomization to date of the first occurrence of radiologically confirmed PD as determined by IRC, Clinical PD according to the Investigator's assessment (if radiological confirmation of PD by IRC was unavailable), discontinuation of treatment due to progression or adverse event, start of new anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death within 90 days of last tumor assessment or randomization. Subjects without event were censored on the date of last tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Curative Surgery of Liver Metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 209 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects who underwent liver metastatic surgery after start of treatment and the outcome of surgery with respect to residual tumor after surgery (R0, R1, R2, not evaluable) were summarized. In case of resection of more than one metastasis, the worst outcome of surgery defined the overall status of a subject. R0 = No residual tumor after resection (all lesions resected completely); R1 = Metastases not resected completely with microscopic residual lesions; and R2 = Metastases not resected completely with macroscopic residual lesions.</description>

    <description>All eligible subjects will receive cetuximab in combination with FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy regimen. FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy regimen consists of a combination of oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA).

      <recruitment_details>The study was planned to enroll subjects with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild-type (wt) tumors.Following modification of approved EU indication of cetuximab,a decision made to amend study population from subjects with KRAS wt tumors to those with RAS wt tumors. All efficacy/safety analysis based on subjects with RAS wt tumor.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>First/last subject (informed consent): 09 September 2010/11 May 2015. Clinical data cut-off: 25 January 2016. A total of 553 subjects were enrolled in the trial. 504 subjects were randomized in the study, of which 397 were with RAS wt tumors. Participant Flow is presented for the subjects with RAS wt tumors.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Cetuximab + FOLFOX4</title>
          <description>Subjects received cetuximab in combination with FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy regimen. FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy regimen consists of a combination of oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid (FA). Cetuximab was always administered every 7 days with an initial dose of 400 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) at 5 milligram per minute (mg/min) and 250 mg/m^2 at 10 mg/min for subsequent infusions, followed by oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 infused over 120 minutes at least 1 hour later. Following completion of the oxaliplatin infusion or simultaneously with oxaliplatin, FA was administered at a dose of 200 mg/m^2 infused over 120 minutes, on Day 1, Day 2, and every 2 weeks and then 5- FU was administered as a bolus of 400 mg/m^2/day intravenously over 2-4 minutes followed by 600 mg/m^2/day infused over 22 hours, on Day 1, Day 2, and every 2 weeks. All subjects received treatment until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
