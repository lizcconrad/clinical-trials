    <textblock>
      This study enrolled participants with documented exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in
      order to evaluate whether ranolazine, when taken prior to exercise, can improve blood flow to
      the heart (myocardial perfusion), as assessed by exercise-induced myocardial perfusion defect
      size (PDS) and total perfusion deficit (TPD), using gated single photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).

      This was a 2-period crossover study. The last dose of each period must have been taken 3-4
      hours prior to conduct of the exercise SPECT MPI. After the research exercise SPECT MPI was
      performed at the end of Period 1, participants discontinued the treatment they were
      randomized to for that period and began the other treatment in Period 2.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise-induced Perfusion Defect Size (PDS) Following Ranolazine and Placebo Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 33 days</time_frame>
    <description>PDS is the amount (percent) of the myocardium with decreased blood flow. A lower percentage means more of the myocardium is receiving blood flow. Measurements were obtained by gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging following exercise at the end of the ranolazine and placebo treatment periods.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise-induced Total Perfusion Deficit (TPD) Following Ranolazine and Placebo Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 33 days</time_frame>
    <description>TPD is a score that measures the overall impact of a region of decreased myocardial blood flow, incorporating both the amount and severity of the decreased flow. TPD is measured on a scale of 0-100, with higher scores being worse and lower scores being better. Measurements were obtained by SPECT imaging following exercise at the end of the ranolazine and placebo treatment periods.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perfusion Defect Severity at Baseline, End of Period 1, and End of Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 33 days</time_frame>
    <description>Perfusion defect severity was assessed for each participant as the percentage of the 17 myocardium segments with a relative perfusion defect score of 3 or 4 on a 0-4 scale. Segment scores are: 0 = normal perfusion; 1 = mild reduction in counts-not definitely abnormal; 2 = moderate reduction in counts-definitely abnormal; 3 = severe reduction in counts; 4 = absent uptake (lower scores correspond to less severity and higher scores correspond to increased severity). A lower percentage means fewer segments have severely reduced blood flow. Measurements were obtained by SPECT imaging following exercise at baseline and at the end of Periods 1 and 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise-induced Reversible Perfusion Defect Size (PDS) at Baseline, End of Period 1, and End of Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 33 days</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise-induced reversible PDS was derived as the exercise PDS at baseline and at the end of Periods 1 and 2 minus the resting PDS at baseline. A lower percentage means more of the myocardium is receiving blood flow. Measurements were obtained by SPECT imaging at baseline both at rest and following exercise and following exercise at the end of Periods 1 and 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise-induced Reversible Total Perfusion Deficit (TPD) at Baseline, End of Period 1, and End of Period 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 33 days</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise-induced reversible TPD was derived as the exercise TPD at baseline and at the end of Periods 1 and 2 minus the resting TPD at baseline. TPD is measured on a scale of 0-100, with higher scores being worse and lower scores being better. Measurements were obtained by SPECT imaging at baseline both at rest and following exercise and following exercise at the end of Periods 1 and 2.</description>

        <title>Perfusion Defect Severity at Baseline, End of Period 1, and End of Period 2</title>
        <description>Perfusion defect severity was assessed for each participant as the percentage of the 17 myocardium segments with a relative perfusion defect score of 3 or 4 on a 0-4 scale. Segment scores are: 0 = normal perfusion; 1 = mild reduction in counts-not definitely abnormal; 2 = moderate reduction in counts-definitely abnormal; 3 = severe reduction in counts; 4 = absent uptake (lower scores correspond to less severity and higher scores correspond to increased severity). A lower percentage means fewer segments have severely reduced blood flow. Measurements were obtained by SPECT imaging following exercise at baseline and at the end of Periods 1 and 2.</description>

        <title>Exercise-induced Reversible Perfusion Defect Size (PDS) at Baseline, End of Period 1, and End of Period 2</title>
        <description>Exercise-induced reversible PDS was derived as the exercise PDS at baseline and at the end of Periods 1 and 2 minus the resting PDS at baseline. A lower percentage means more of the myocardium is receiving blood flow. Measurements were obtained by SPECT imaging at baseline both at rest and following exercise and following exercise at the end of Periods 1 and 2.</description>
