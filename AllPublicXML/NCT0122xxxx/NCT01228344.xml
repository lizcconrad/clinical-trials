  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the pediatric and adult patients (U.S. and foreign
      residents) diagnosed with malaria and treated with artemether-lumefantrine with regard to
      their demographics, including evaluation of their malaria immune status, treatment
      effectiveness, prior and concomitant medication use, and the occurrence of adverse events in
      association with artemether-lumefantrine treatment, based on the information collected in the
      CDC Malaria Case Surveillance Report Form.
