  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that carvedilol, at less then therapeutic doses for cardiac
      effect, will reduce symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This initial proof of concept trial design is intended to explore multiple variables. Fist,
      it is intended to determine if carvedilol has any statistically significant effect over
      placebo on the various overall symptoms, symptom clusters, or individual symptoms of post
      traumatic stress disorder. Next, the flexible dosing trial design is aimed to detect the
      therapeutic dose, or dosing range for carvedilol when used in the treatment of PTSD

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DTS is a 17-item self report measure to assess the 17 DMS-IV symptoms of PTSD. Respondants are asked to identify the trauma that is most disturbing to them and to rate, in the past week, how much trouble they hav had with each symptom. The DTS can be used to make a preliminatry determination about whether the symptoms meet DSM criteria for PTSD, or scores can be calculated for each of the 3 PTSD symptom clusters.
The DTS will be assessed at each study visit (visit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). The primary efficacy outcome will be change from baseline (visit 2) to week 5 (visit 7).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS was developed at the National Center for PTSD and has become the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is a user-friendly structured interview for screening, differential diagnosis, comfirming PTSD diagnosis or identifying Acute Stress Disorder.
The CAPS will be assessed at the screening visit and again at week 5 (vist 7). Change scores (from screening to week 5) will be secondary efficacy measures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a 7-item patient rated questionnaire that evaluates severity of sleep onset and maintenance difficulties, satisfaction with current sleep pattern interference with daily functioning, appearance of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and the degree of concern caused by insomnia.
Secondary outcome measures using the ISI will be determined using change scores from baseline to week 5 (visit 7)</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to carvedilol will be administered doses ranging from 6.25 to 15.625 mg/day using a flexible-dosing model. After a 1 week titration, investigators my increase daily dose by 6.25 mg/day at weeks 1 and 2 for a maximum dose of 15.625 mg/day. Weeks 3-4 will patients will remain on a stable, tolerable dose. At week 5 patients will have a 1 week taper.</description>
