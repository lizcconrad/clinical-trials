    <description>Efficacy is the primary response variable for this study and therefore will be evaluated at each visit from facial injection through 24-months post baseline injection visit as described below:
Measurement of recurrence and duration of herpes labialis lesions
Onset and stop dates for recurrent episodes of herpes labialis will be recorded and transcripted from the information recorded on the subject's diary and collected at each scheduled visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of Lesion Size</measure>
    <time_frame>During outbreak</time_frame>
    <description>Upon recurrence of herpes labialis subject will return to site for measurement of lesion(s). Lesion will be measured in millimeters across the maximal lesion length.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>During outbreak</time_frame>
    <description>Each day of a recurrence of herpes labialis, the subject will document his/her pain level in the diary according to the Visual Analog Scale for pain (VAS) by placing a straight line intersecting the pain line. The scale will be 10 cm long and the distance from start to mark will be measured in millimeters</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>During outbreak</time_frame>
    <description>Each day of a recurrence of herpes labialis, the subject will document his/her pain level in the diary according to a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe).</description>

    <description>Botox® is supplied in a 100 U vial and will be reconstituted with 3.3 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP to yield a solution of 3 U per 0.1 mL. Study treatment will consist of an injection of Botox® (onabotulinumtoxinA) (3 U/ 0.1 mL) into the orbicularis oris muscle (8 U, .27 mL in the upper and/or lower lip, depending on the site of recurrence) using a 30G needle.</description>
