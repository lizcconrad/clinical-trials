  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgenic alopecia, the common form of hair loss is a highly heritable disorder of
      considerable social significance affecting around 40% of adult men and women. A variety of
      genetic and environmental factors are likely to play a role in androgenetic alopecia. Genetic
      variants in the human androgen receptor gene (AR) have been reported to be associated with
      AGA in Caucasians. Other genes involved with hair loss also have been found. One of them
      being a gene on chromosome 3 (3q26). A recent genome-wide association study in 296
      individuals with male-pattern baldness and 347 controls had carried out and five SNPs on
      chromosome 20p11 were found to be highly significant association for AGA (rs2180439 combined
      P = 2.7 x 10(-15)). No interaction was detected with the X-chromosomal androgen receptor
      locus, suggesting that the 20p11 locus has a role in a yet-to-be-identified
      androgen-independent pathway.

      The total number of evaluated patients with androgenic alopecia will be at least 300. All
      patients will be further grouped as good responders or poor responders to conventional
      medications, such as topical minoxidil and systemic finasteride. Candidate genes potentially
      involved in gout and its treatment response will be selected from the published literatures;
      specifically, two resources of candidate genes will be selected: (i) genes which are known to
      directly link with androgenic alopecia, and (ii) genes are potentially implicated in
      particular pathways of androgen/estrogen receptors, metabolism and downstream signals, and
      genes involved in anti-oxidants or hair growth. The SNP genotyping will be performed by
      MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry. Data analysis will be performed by comparing SNPs allele
      frequency between good responder and poor responder to conventional medications of patients
      with androgenic alopecia and further comparing to the allele frequency of SNPs in healthy
      controls. A functional study will also be done to prove the genetic association.
