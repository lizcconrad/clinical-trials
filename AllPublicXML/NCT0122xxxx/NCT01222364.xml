    <textblock>
      This study tested the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to vary the
      timing that doctors clamp the umbilical cord after birth in extremely low birthweight
      infants. The study also tested whether delaying cord clamping by 30-35 seconds and holding
      the newborn approximately 10 inches below the birth canal would result in increased
      hematocrit at 4 hours of age.

      This study tested the hypothesis that delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in extremely
      low birthweight (ELBW) infants would result in additional blood transfusion from the placenta
      to the baby, increasing the infant's blood volume and blood pressure. Higher blood pressure
      may improve blood flow to the brain that may reduce potential the risk of hypoxic ischemic
      encephalopathy (HIE) and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The additional placental flow
      may also increase the amount of stem cells and cytokines flowing to the baby, improving
      immune status and reducing the risk of infection, while at the same time reducing the need
      for blood transfusions in the neonatal period.

      This was a pilot study to test the feasibility of having obstetricians delay cord clamping
      for 30-45 seconds, and to confirm whether the procedure significantly increases the baby's
      hematocrit during the first 4 hours of life.
