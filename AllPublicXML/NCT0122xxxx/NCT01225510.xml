  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a protein in the body which destabilizes blood vessels and is
      important in stimulating tumor blood vessels. There is evidence suggesting that Ang-2 may be
      important for the growth and progression of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). PF- 04856884
      (CVX-060) is a compound which binds Ang-2 and prevents its activity. The hypothesis is that
      PF-04856884 will be safe and effective in patients with recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM).
