  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When given to men with recurrent prostate cancer, the investigators hypothesize that POMx is
      effective in slowing the rise of PSA as measured by PSA doubling time in men following
      initial therapy for prostate cancer. Further, the investigators believe that POMx will be
      shown to be safe and well tolerated.

      The study will be an 18-month, prospective, multi-center, double-blind, dose finding study
      with subjects who have undergone definitive treatment (surgery, cryotherapy, radiation
      therapy or brachytherapy) for primary prostate tumor and have had documented rising PSA on a
      minimum of 3 time points each at least 1 month apart, higher than the reference value noted
      within 1 year of study entry.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Subject has undergone definitive treatment (surgery, surgery with radiation therapy,
             cryotherapy, radiation therapy or brachytherapy) for the primary prostate tumor.

          -  Subject with a rising PSA post-prostatectomy may consider radiation as an alternative.
             If subject declines radiation, he may be considered eligible in this setting.

          -  Subject has a rising PSA on a minimum of 3 time points each at least 1 month apart,
             higher than the reference value noted within 1 year of study entry and defined as:

          -  Absolute level of PSA &gt;0.4 ng/mL following surgery.

          -  Absolute level of PSA &gt;1.5 ng/mL following radiation or cryotherapy.

          -  Absolute level of PSA &gt;0.4 ng/mL for subjects treated with multiple treatment
             modalities (e.g., surgery + radiation, radiation + cryotherapy, etc.).

          -  Absolute level of PSA &gt; nadir + 2 following neoadjuvant hormonal therapy along with
             external beam radiation.

          -  Interim PSA values during the immediate pre-study interval may demonstrate a
             &quot;fluctuation&quot; including a decline; however, the study baseline PSA must have shown a
             rise within the pre-study 1 year period.

          -  Study baseline PSAs must be determined within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  First postoperative PSA permitted if detectable.

          -  Subject is &gt;18 years or age.

          -  Subject has life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

          -  Subject has ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Subject has testosterone level of &gt;150 ng/mL at screening.

          -  Subjects has normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  creatinine &gt; 2.5 upper limit of normal

          -  testosterone level &gt;150 ng/mL

          -  Subject agrees to abstain from other commercially available pomegranate products while
             participating in this study.

          -  Subject's use of other dietary/herbal supplements (e.g. saw palmetto, selenium, etc)
             has been stable for at least 2 months prior to screening and the subject agrees not to
             stop or change the dose while participating in the study.

          -  Subject has signed a written informed consent document and agrees to comply with
             requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has received any therapies that modulate testosterone levels (e.g., androgen
             ablative/anti-androgen therapy, herbal therapies containing estrogen) for a minimum of
             1 year prior to study.

          -  Subject has had prior or concomitant treatment with experimental drugs, high dose
             steroids, or any other cancer treatment within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the
             study product.

          -  Subject has consumed more than two 8 ounce glasses of pomegranate juice per week over
             the past 2 months.

          -  Subject has a known allergy to pomegranate juice or ellagic acid.

          -  Subject has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.
