  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized controlled study, using stable isotope methodology, is proposed to
      determine whether an oral nutrition support regimen, containing pressurized whey protein and
      glucose, is more effective at normalizing the metabolic response to surgery than a standard
      peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) support regimen, containing amino acids and glucose, in
      colorectal surgical patients studied before and after surgery. The effectiveness of the
      nutrition support regimens will be determined by: whole body protein balance, synthesis rates
      of hepatic secretory proteins, resting energy expenditure and substrate utilization, as well
      as circulating metabolites concentrations.

    <description>Ten (10) subjects will be randomly assigned to receive an oral nutrition regimen comprised of 50% of their REE as dextrose and 20% of their REE as pressurized whey protein. Subjects will undergo a six-hour stable isotope infusion protocol one day before surgery (to obtain baseline data) and on the first post-operative day. During both infusion protocols, subjects will be asked to carry out their assigned oral nutrition regimen. To minimize fasting during the perioperative period all subjects will receive peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) at the time of surgical incision until the first postoperative day.</description>
