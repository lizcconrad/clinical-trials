      The study is being conducted to evaluate whether African potato, an herbal medicine, can be
      used together with anti-HIV medicines without affecting the amounts of the anti-HIV medicines
      in the blood. African potato is an African herbal medicine widely used in Africa,
      particularly sub-Saharan Africa. Although it has not been proven, it is believed to help
      boost the immune system. Similar studies have been done on herbal medicines especially those
      that are used in developing countries. In some cases, the herbal treatments can affect the
      blood levels of other medicines when the medicines are used together. This study will measure
      the effect of African potato on lopinavir/ritonavir (KaletraÂ®), a common anti-HIV medicine.
      Lopinavir/ritonavir is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
      information obtained from this study will tell us if African potato and anti-HIV treatments
      can be used together to treat HIV infected patients in Africa and other resource poor
      regions.

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic drug interaction study to evaluate the effects of African potato(hypoxis obtusa) on the PK of lopinavir/ritonavir.</measure>
    <time_frame>35 days</time_frame>
    <description>The study is to evaluate the effects of African Potato (hypoxis obtusa) on the steady state PK of lopinavir/ritonavir by measurement of the PK parameters of LPV/r in presence and absence of AP in healthy volunteers. The baseline PK of LPV/r will be established after 14 days of taking LPV/r at a dose of 400/100 mg twice daily. This will be followed by a 7 day course of LPV/r and hypoxoside (15 mg/kg/day) together. PK analysis of LPV/r will be repeated following the 7 days of co-administration. Each subject will act as their own control.</description>
