      The purpose of this trial is to show proof of concept that by blocking the Transforming
      Growth Factor-beta signaling pathway in patients with Glioblastoma, there will be clinical
      benefit.

      Phase 1b: To determine the safe and tolerable dose of LY2157299 in combination with
      radiochemotherapy with temozolomide for Phase 2 in patients with glioma eligible to receive
      radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (e.g. newly diagnosed malignant glioma World Health
      Organization Grade III and IV).

      Phase 2a: To confirm the tolerability and evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of LY2157299 in
      combination with standard radiochemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
