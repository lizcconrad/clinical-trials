      The aims is to evaluate the efficacy and comparative isolation of the association Mometasone
      furoate + Salicylic Acid and the substance isolated Mometasone furoate produced by the
      Laboratory Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. in patients of both sexes, patients with plaque
      psoriasis grade mild to moderate.

      The specific objective is to evaluate through analytical propedeutics medical improvement in
      clinical signs and symptoms related to plaque psoriasis. The study will be conducted with 40
      patients who will deal with two symmetrical lesions of his body being identified by the
      clinician that a party should be treated in a double-blind only with mometasone furoate cream
      containing 0.1% and another with the combination of furoate of mometasone 0.1% + Salicylic
      Acid 5%. The group of patients to be treated must be adults of both sexes, aged 18-70 years
      with good mental and physical health to sign the Informed Consent and who are clinically
      assessed by dermatologists in the study as having mild plaque psoriasis and moderate. The
      association made a proposal of effectiveness was developed and is produced by the Laboratory
      Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., as well as its isolated version of the pilot (mometasone
      furoate 0.1%). This study should be characterized as Phase II multicenter not.
