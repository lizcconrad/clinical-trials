  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is condition in which progressive autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing
      beta-cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency. At the time of clinical presentation, it is
      estimated that 50-80% of beta-cell function has been lost. Good glycaemic control from
      diagnosis has been shown to preserve beta-cell function. The recent identification of
      immuno-interventions able to reduce autoimmune destruction and preserve beta-cell function
      has lead to an increased urgency to develop such tools.

      With mixed-meal stimulated serum C-peptide being a gold standard, there are currently no
      tests that are suited for use in clinical practice to detect and monitor residual beta cell
      function. There is a therefore a need for a test that is sufficiently sensitive to assess
      beta cell function reserve in Type 1 diabetes for clinical practice purposes, which will be
      simple, reproducible and suitable for use even in the non-observed setting.

      Using mixed meal stimulation of plasma C-peptide (stable by-product in insulin secretion that
      reliably reflects insulin production) response as a reference, we propose to compare mixed
      meal stimulated urinary C-peptide as potential candidate for this application. This is a
      pilot investigation in which a sample of 30 participants will be recruited.

      It is anticipated that the current project will identify a simple method for analysing beta
      cell reserve in Type 1 diabetes. This will then be applied to screening clinic populations of
      recently diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes. The aim will be to identify subjects who
      may be suitable for early intensified insulin regimes (e.g. insulin pump therapy) and novel
      immuno-intervention strategies designed to preserve residual beta cell function and improve
      long-term outcomes. Currently such immunointervention has been reserved for subjects within 3
      months of diagnosis only, excluding a significant number of subjects who may potentially
      benefit.
