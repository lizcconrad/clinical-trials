  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis for this study is that, in nicotine-dependent tobacco smokers,
      baclofen will be superior to placebo for smoking abstinence measures.

      The secondary hypothesis is that subjects assigned to the baclofen groups will exhibit higher
      rates of medication compliance (i.e. take the medication as directed for the trial period)
      than those in the placebo group.

      The tertiary hypothesis is that baclofen will lead to significant reductions in tobacco
      withdrawal and craving ratings as compared to placebo.

      This study will test a new medication strategy designed to help smokers quit. It will
      evaluate Baclofen, a drug currently approved and available in Canada as a myorelaxant. Forty
      five nicotine-dependent smokers will enroll in this study. Fifteen will receive placebo
      (inactive pill), fifteen will receive baclofen 30 mg/day, and fifteen will receive baclofen
      60 mg/day. Once enrolled, subjects will visit CAMH on a weekly basis for assessment of
      smoking behaviour, a brief health check (vitals, BP and AE screening), delivery of brief
      individual smoking cessation counselling, and collection of breath, blood and urine samples
      (as scheduled) to a) measure levels of nicotine and its metabolites, b) conduct pregnancy and
      tox testing. The medication phase of this study lasts 12 weeks. Two follow-up visits will be
      scheduled at week 13 and at six months after trial completion.
