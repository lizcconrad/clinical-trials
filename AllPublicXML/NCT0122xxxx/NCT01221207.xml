  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1. To compare the effectiveness of total contact casts (TCC), removable cast walkers
      (RCW) and instant total contact casts (ITCC) to heal diabetic foot ulcers in a 20 week
      randomized clinical trial of 225 patients in community care in three university medical
      center diabetes clinics.

      Aim 2. To compare the frequency of complications such as soft tissue and bone infections,
      iatrogenic wounds, falls and fall related injuries, and amputations among patients treated
      with TCC, ITCC and RCW to heal diabetic foot ulcers.

      Aim 3. To compare patient compliance and level of activity among TCC, ITCC, RCW treatment
      groups. Using computerized activity monitors which time-stamp each step, we will evaluate
      both degree and magnitude of activity between groups.

      Aim 4. To evaluate the cost of diabetic foot ulcer-related treatment and complications during
      the course of therapy.

    <textblock>
      This is an investigator blinded randomized, controlled clinical trial with three parallel
      treatment groups of 75 adult outpatients with diabetes mellitus and a foot ulcer. The study
      will be conducted at five university affiliated medical centers in Arizona and Texas. The
      study participants and nurse coordinator will not be blinded to the treatment after
      randomization. Investigators will be blinded to treatment group assignment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound Evaluation and Healing: The lower extremity evaluation will include length, width, depth, and area of the ulcer before and after debridement.</measure>
    <time_frame>every 10 days, then every 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate wounds at each clinical visit to ensure the absence of infection. At each study visit a research CRC will take photographs of the wound which will be planimetrically measured and assessed by a clinician unaware of specific study allocation. An ulcer will be considered &quot;healed&quot; when it is fully epithelialized with no drainage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Complications: At each visit the study nurse will interview patients and determine if they have experienced any adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>every 10 days, then every 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This includes exacerbation of existing condition or event. Infection of soft tissue or bone, amputation, need for incision and drainage, iatrogenic ulcer formation, deterioration of the ulcer being treated, hospital admission, surgery of the foot or amputation of the foot or leg will be considered as an adverse event.</description>
