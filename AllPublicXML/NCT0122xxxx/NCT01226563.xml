  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the IK-5001 device for
      the prevention of ventricular remodeling and congestive heart failure when administered to
      subjects who had successful percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement after ST
      segment elevation MI (STEMI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a significant problem, and carries substantial mortality. According to
      studies, left ventricular (LV) remodeling contributes independently to heart failure
      progression. Prevention and reversal of LV remodeling are correlated with decreased risk of
      death and heart failure events. IK-5001 is an implantable device to be used in subjects with
      recent myocardial infarction (MI). The IK-5001 device has been shown to directly halt the
      remodeling process that occurs following acute MI. IK-5001 replaces the damaged extracellular
      matrix (ECM) that has degraded during infarction, supports the damaged myocardial tissue,
      prevents local dyskinesis, and decreases wall stress. Because of its minimal interaction with
      the myocardium, its mechanism of action, its lack of specific pharmacologic activity and its
      elimination behavior, IK-5001 is a medical device in concurrence with the Global
      Harmonization Task Force's harmonized definition for medical devices.

             AND at least 1 of the following 2 criteria:

               -  MI ≥ 20% by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography scan (SPECT) or cardiac

          7. Inadequate imaging windows (defined as the inability to visualize the endocardial
             border of at least 16 of the 17 segments in both the apical four chambers and apical
             two chamber views without foreshortening) or arrhythmia that would preclude adequate
             3D imaging on transthoracic echocardiography at the local baseline echo assessment

          8. Non-ambulatory prior to the index MI

          9. The subject has participated in another trial of an investigational agent within 30

         10. Subject has received resorbable stent as part of PCI.

         11. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of child-bearing potential will have a
