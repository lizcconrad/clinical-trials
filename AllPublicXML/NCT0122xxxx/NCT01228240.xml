      Background: Metformin is usually using for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Different pharmaceutical types of metformin are available. As a clinical trial, we compared
      the efficacy and complications of metformin produced by &quot;Pars Mino pharmaceutical company,
      Iran&quot; with &quot;Apotex pharmaceutical company, Canada&quot;, in type 2 diabetic patients.

      Method: 18 eligible women with type 2 diabetes were given metformin &quot;Pars Mino&quot; or &quot;Apotex&quot;
      (500 mg twice a day) each for 6 weeks period in a randomized, double blind, crossover study.
      After 2 weeks washout period another 6 weeks period with another Brand of metformin was
      prescribed. FBS, HbA1C, lipid profile (Cholesterol, TG, HDL, and LDL), weight, and BMI were
      assessed before and after each treatment phase. The results were compared with each other by
      paired sample T-test, Independent sample T-test.
