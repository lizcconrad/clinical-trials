  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open study. A total of 500 elderly
      patients aged over 75 years with renal insufficiency stage 5 will be included in the study
      after signed informed consent. Patients will be randomized 1/1 in two arms : 250 patients in
      the &quot;exclusive nephrology follow-up&quot; arm will continue their usual follow-up; 250 patients in
      the &quot;geriatric follow-up&quot; arm will have both their usual nephrology follow-up and a geriatric
      follow-up.

      The aim of the study is to determine if a systematized gerontologist evaluation delay the
      occurrence of a composite primary endpoint : death, dementia, depression and severe
      dependency. The hypothesis is that the functional and vital prognosis of a patient with renal
      insufficiency depends not only on common and classical factors but also on cognitive and
      psychological functions and dependence, particularly in elderly patients.

    <description>250 patients will be included and randomized in the &quot;exclusive nephrology follow-up&quot; arm will continue their usual nephrology follow-up with consultations every 6 months during 3 years for dialysis patients or with consultations every 6 months before dialysis, 3 months after starting dialysis and every 6 months for a total duration of 3 years for non-dialysis patients. In addition to their nephrology consultations, patients will benefit from a geriatric evaluation with MMS, GDS and ADL scoring.</description>

About geriatric evaluation Patients randomized in this arm will also have more complete tests to evaluate cognitive functions (memory, language and movements), psychological functions (depression and anxiety) and dependency in activities of daily living. Other tests will allow evaluate vision, audition, mobility and nutritional status.</description>
