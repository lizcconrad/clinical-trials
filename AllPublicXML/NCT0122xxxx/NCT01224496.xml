      The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on
      anaemic and cytopenic haematological disorders including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
      aplastic anaemia (AA), myelofibrosis (MF) and thalassemia intermedia who do not have or did
      not respond to available treatment options.

    <description>The following parameters will be monitored serially
symptoms : ie reflection of any subjective symptoms that may be due to the treatment
Serial biochemistry ( urea, electrolyte, creatinine, liver function test ) will be done at baseline, one week into the study and then every 7-8 weekly till end of the 6 months. This will monitor for any organ toxicity</description>

    <description>Patients must have a marrow study to confirm diagnosis of MDS, AA or MF. MDS is classified according to the WHO criteria and scored according to IPSS. The AA group is further classified into AA, SAA or VSAA . MF is defined by the Italian criteria and risk stratified by the Lilles Scoring system. Diagnosis of thal intermedia and major is based on previously done Hb electrophoresis and severity of disease is assessed by degree of anaemia.and frequency of blood transfusions
TCM diagnosis: Syndrome differentiation according to TCM theory will be assessed as a baseline by experienced TCM collaborators and classified into one of the few defined syndromes as follows
Yin deficiency of spleen and kidney
Yang deficiency of spleen and kidney
Deficiency of both Yin and Yang
Stagnation of dampness and poison in the blood
Excessive heat and poison</description>

    <description>Definition of each TCM syndrome is based on TCM theory. Formulation composition is based on each defined TCM syndrome with addition or removal of herbs as indicated by the patient's manifestation</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of MDS, AA, MF or thal based on currently recognized diagnostic criteria.

          2. Explored or undergone established therapies eg haemopoietic stem cell transplant,
             immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, growth factors, thalidomide, hypomethylating
             agent or androgens, and (a) are deemed not suitable, or (b) refuse or (c) have failed
             therapy

          3. A preceding follow up period (without or with treatment) of 2-4 months as baseline
             (depending on the severity of cytopenia) before being enrolled into this study

          4. Understand the trial nature of this treatment, agree to be compliant to medication, do
             not self medicate and have signed informed consent

          5. Agreeable to regular blood tests and follow up marrow study as listed in schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy of shorter than one year

          2. Significant organ failure including the following

          3. Renal impairment with Cr above 200umol/L

          4. Liver impairment with serum bilirubin &gt; 2x upper limits or transaminase &gt;3x upper
             limits

          5. Escalation of treatment of introduction of new agents including growth factors,
             thalidomide, hypomethylating agents, immunosuppressive therapy or androgens once
             started on treatment with TCM is not allowed. Continuation of current therapy at same
             or lower doses is allowed
