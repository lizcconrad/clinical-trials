    <measure>Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI scale assesses 12 domains (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavior, and appetite and eating changes). The symptoms were rated on the basis of questions administered to the study partner. If a preliminary question for each domain was answered as 'Yes', each domain was rated on a 4-point frequency scale and on a 3-point severity scale. If the preliminary question was answered as 'No', the frequency, severity, and distress scales were set to zero. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. For each of the 12 domains, a sub-scale score is calculated as frequency*severity and ranges from 0 to 12. The NPI total score is then calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale scores. The NPI total scores ranges from 0 to 144 with higher scores indicating greater behavioral impairment. The caregiver distress score is not included in the NPI total score.</description>

    <description>The NPI scale assesses 12 domains (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavior, and appetite and eating changes). The symptoms were rated on the basis of questions administered to the study partner. For each domain, the study partner also rated his/her own 'emotional or psychological' distress caused by the participant's behavior on a 6-point scale. The study partner NPI-D total score was calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. The caregiver distress (NPI-D) total score is calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. The NPI-D total scores ranges from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating greater distress.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dependence Scale (DS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated administration (first 6 items) of the DS was used in this study. The DS is a brief study partner-completed measure which assesses the degree of support required by a subject with AD. Since the goal of treatment was to delay or arrest the processes leading to increased dependence, the DS represented a meaningful endpoint for clinical studies in AD. The dependence score was derived by summing the first 6 items of the DS. Item 1 and 2 ranged from 0 - 2 and item 3 - 6 ranged from 0 - 1. The total score was calculated by summing the score from each of the 6 items. So the total score could range from 0 - 8, with higher scores indicating greater dependence.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) (Abbreviated) (RUD-Lite) - Primary Caregiver</measure>
    <time_frame>104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated administration of the RUD (RUD-Lite) was used. The RUD-Lite is a comprehensive tool for addressing the magnitude and nature of study partner/caregiver effort in cases of dementia. Since a significant portion of care in Alzheimer's related-dementia was performed informally by the participant's friends or family, it was desirable to measure the extent of this care for use in economic evaluations of disease. The total time spent by the primary caregiver providing support on activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and supervising, respectively, was calculated in two components. Total number of days spent during the past month on each of ADL, IADL, and supervising; and: time per day during the past month on each of ADL, IADL and supervising. The total Primary Caregiver Time per month could range from 0 - 720. This was calculated by multiplying the number of days per month (30) by the number of hours per day (24).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB)</title>
        <description>The NTB evaluated cognitive domains that are known to be affected early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cognitive tests included in the NTB were: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test – Immediate recall, Detection, Identification, Go-No-Go Task, One Back Task, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Category Fluency Test, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test – delayed recall and recognition. For each of the eight NTB components, an individual z-score was derived based on the primary raw score of each test. Based on the individual z-scores, a composite z-score was derived using the formula: (z1-z2-z3-z4+z5+z6+z7+z8)/8. Positive change indicating an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <description>FAQ is a 10-item, caregiver-based questionnaire and was administered to the study partner who was asked to rate the participant’s ability to perform a variety of activities ranging from shopping, doing the laundry, simple financial transactions, comprehension of current events, some recreational or avocational activities, and reading. FAQ total score was calculated by adding the scores from each of the 10 items. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. FAQ Total Score is the sum of 10 items, ranging from 0 (best possible outcome) to 100 (worst possible outcome).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB)</title>
        <description>Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a global clinical staging instrument that was administrated by a trained rater to assess a participant’s level of impairment in six domains including: Memory, Orientation, Judgement and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care, based on the CDR interview. The CDR included discussions with the participant and study partner using a structured format. A CDR-SOB score was derived based on individual scores from the six domains. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. The total CDR-SB score is calculated as the sum of the six clinical ratings. The CDR-SOB score range for each domain is 0 to 3. The CDR-SOB total score ranges from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater dementia. If any individual item is missing, then the CDR-SB is set to missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The NPI scale assesses 12 domains (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavior, and appetite and eating changes). The symptoms were rated on the basis of questions administered to the study partner. If a preliminary question for each domain was answered as ‘Yes’, each domain was rated on a 4-point frequency scale and on a 3-point severity scale. If the preliminary question was answered as ‘No’, the frequency, severity, and distress scales were set to zero. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. For each of the 12 domains, a sub-scale score is calculated as frequency*severity and ranges from 0 to 12. The NPI total score is then calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale scores. The NPI total scores ranges from 0 to 144 with higher scores indicating greater behavioral impairment. The caregiver distress score is not included in the NPI total score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in NPI Distress Score (NPI-D)</title>
        <description>The NPI scale assesses 12 domains (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavior, and appetite and eating changes). The symptoms were rated on the basis of questions administered to the study partner. For each domain, the study partner also rated his/her own ‘emotional or psychological’ distress caused by the participant’s behavior on a 6-point scale. The study partner NPI-D total score was calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. The caregiver distress (NPI-D) total score is calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. The NPI-D total scores ranges from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating greater distress.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in NPI Distress Score (NPI-D)</title>
          <description>The NPI scale assesses 12 domains (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavior, and appetite and eating changes). The symptoms were rated on the basis of questions administered to the study partner. For each domain, the study partner also rated his/her own ‘emotional or psychological’ distress caused by the participant’s behavior on a 6-point scale. The study partner NPI-D total score was calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. A negative change indicated an improvement from baseline. The caregiver distress (NPI-D) total score is calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. The NPI-D total scores ranges from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating greater distress.</description>

        <description>The MMSE is a brief, structured examination of cognitive function consisting of the 11 item: Orientation-What, Orientation-Where, Registration-Objects, Attention and Calculation, Recall, Language-Naming, Language-Repetition, Language-Comprehension, Language-Reading, Language-Writing, and Language- Drawing. MMSE total score was the sum of the 11 item scores and it ranges from 0 to 30 with higher score indicating greater cognitive functioning. If any individual item is missing, then the MMSE total score is set to missing. A positive change indicating an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) Total Score</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog is a global cognitive measure. For the following 13 items, the participants were rated: Word Recall, Commands, Construction Praxis, Delayed Word Recall Task, Naming Task, Ideational Praxis, Orientation, Word Recognition Task, Remembering Test Instructions, Spoken Language Ability, Word-Finding Difficulty in Spontaneous Speech, Comprehension, and Number Cancellation. The ADAS-cog is a structured scale that evaluates memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language and constructional praxis. The total score was the sum of the scores from the 13 individual items. This study used a modified 85 point scale with a scoring range of 0 to 85 (13 items). Higher scores of the 13 individual items indicated greater cognitive impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dependence Scale (DS) Score</title>
        <description>An abbreviated administration (first 6 items) of the DS was used in this study. The DS is a brief study partner-completed measure which assesses the degree of support required by a subject with AD. Since the goal of treatment was to delay or arrest the processes leading to increased dependence, the DS represented a meaningful endpoint for clinical studies in AD. The dependence score was derived by summing the first 6 items of the DS. Item 1 and 2 ranged from 0 – 2 and item 3 – 6 ranged from 0 – 1. The total score was calculated by summing the score from each of the 6 items. So the total score could range from 0 – 8, with higher scores indicating greater dependence.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) (Abbreviated) (RUD-Lite) - Primary Caregiver</title>
        <description>An abbreviated administration of the RUD (RUD-Lite) was used. The RUD-Lite is a comprehensive tool for addressing the magnitude and nature of study partner/caregiver effort in cases of dementia. Since a significant portion of care in Alzheimer’s related-dementia was performed informally by the participant’s friends or family, it was desirable to measure the extent of this care for use in economic evaluations of disease. The total time spent by the primary caregiver providing support on activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and supervising, respectively, was calculated in two components. Total number of days spent during the past month on each of ADL, IADL, and supervising; and: time per day during the past month on each of ADL, IADL and supervising. The total Primary Caregiver Time per month could range from 0 – 720. This was calculated by multiplying the number of days per month (30) by the number of hours per day (24).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in RUD (Abbreviated) (RUD-Lite) - Other Caregivers</title>
        <description>An abbreviated administration of the RUD (RUD-Lite) was used. The RUD-Lite is a comprehensive tool for addressing the magnitude and nature of study partner/caregiver effort in cases of dementia. Since a significant portion of care in Alzheimer’s related-dementia was performed informally by the participant’s friends or family, it was desirable to measure the extent of this care for use in economic evaluations of disease. The total time spent by the other caregivers providing support on ADL, IADL and supervising, respectively, was calculated in two components. Total number of days spent during the past month on each of ADL, IADL and supervising; and: time per day during the past month on each of ADL, IADL, and supervising. The total Other Caregiver Time per month could range from 0 – 720. This was calculated by multiplying the number of days per month (30) by the number of hours per day (24).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Global CDR Score of Equal to or Greater Than 1 for the First Time</title>
        <description>CDR is a global clinical staging instrument that was administrated by a trained rater to assess a participant’s level of impairment in six domains including: Memory, Orientation, Judgement and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care, based on the CDR interview. The CDR included discussions with the participant and study partner using a structured format. CDR global score was derived from the six domains according to a complex algorithm with emphasis on the Memory Domain score. Global CDR score = 0.5 with memory box score of 0.5. The total CDR-SB score is calculated as the sum of the six clinical ratings. The CDR-SOB score range for each domain is 0 to 3, with higher score indicating no significant function. If any individual item is missing, then the CDR-SB is set to missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ) – Subject – Attention/Concentration Domain Score</title>
        <description>The PDQ is a tool consisting of 20 questions and is designed to assess perceived cognitive deficits from the participant’s perspective. The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Attention/Concentration Domain Score is the sum of the raw scores on items 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17, with a range from 0 – 4 for each of the 5 items. So the Attention/Concentration Domain Score could range from 0 – 20, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.</description>

          <description>The PDQ is a tool consisting of 20 questions and is designed to assess perceived cognitive deficits from the participant’s perspective. The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Attention/Concentration Domain Score is the sum of the raw scores on items 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17, with a range from 0 – 4 for each of the 5 items. So the Attention/Concentration Domain Score could range from 0 – 20, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.</description>

So the Retrospective Memory Domain Score could range from 0 – 20, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PDQ-R – Relative – Total Score</title>
        <description>The PDQ-R is a tool consisting of 20 questions, is designed to assess perceived cognitive deficits, and was administered to the study partner. The instrument assessed a variety of questions in the following areas: attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization. The Total Score is computed by adding raw scores for all of the items (or all 4 domain scores) together. It could range from 0 – 80, with higher scores indicating greater perceived cognitive impairment.</description>

        <description>The AD MACQ was administered to the study partner to address preferences for medication administration by assessing: Question a: I would find it easy to give the study medication to the patient myself. Question b: The number of times the medication was given was convenient. Question c: I would prefer to have the study medication given at home by me instead of at the doctor's office by the doctor or nurse. Question d: I would prefer to have the study medication given at home by a nurse instead of at the doctor's office by the doctor or nurse. Question e: Overall, I am satisfied with the way the medication was given.</description>
