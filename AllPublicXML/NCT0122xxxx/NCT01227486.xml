      The purpose of this study is to determine whether verification of correct tube placement
      after endotracheal intubation in the obese patient can be conducted as fast with ultrasound
      as with the conventional method of combined auscultation and capnography.

      The investigators hypothesize that ultrasound is a faster method for verifying correct
      endotracheal tube placement in the obese patient than combined auscultation and capnography.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both verification methods are conducted in all patients and patients act as their own control
