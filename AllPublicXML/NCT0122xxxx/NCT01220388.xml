  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from the literature and previous in vitro research conducted in the investigators'
      laboratory (INSERM U413/EA4310, University of Rouen) suggest that adrenal corticosteroid
      secretion might be controlled by a paracrine mechanism involving serotonin type IV receptor
      (5-HT 4). L-lysine, a common amino-acid has been shown to act as a 5-HT4 agonist in vitro as
      well as in vivo. In the present physiology trial, plasma aldosterone and cortisol levels will
      be measured under treatment with aprepitant versus placebo, in both basal conditions and
      after activation of the adrenocortical function by various stimuli, including upright
      posture, metoclopramide, and after a 3 days salt-free diet. All healthy volunteers will be
      given two substances (L-lysine and placebo) in a random order during two 13 days periods
      separated by a 14 day-wash-out. This study should allow to determine the role of 5-HT4
      receptors in the control of corticosteroid production in normal man.

      STUDY DESIGN Proof of concept, interventional, monocentric, randomised, double blind,
      cross-over study: The effects of L-lysine on corticosteroid secretion will be compared to
      those of a placebo. STUDY OBJECTIVES Main objective: to verify that adrenal corticosteroid
      secretion is actually controlled by L-lysine. Secondary objective: to determine the
      physiological conditions that involve the control of adrenocortical function by t5-HT4
      receptors. NUMBER OF SUBJECTS 20 healthy volunteers ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (see below) DURATION
      OF STUDY Overall duration: 13 months Inclusion period: 12 months Follow up period (for 1
      subject): 5 weeks Exclusion period: 1 month ENDPOINTS PRIMARY ENDPOINT: blood aldosterone
      variation during orthostatic test SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Basal aldosterone alteration
      Aldosterone variation during metoclopramide &amp; salt-free diet tests Basal and stimulated (3
      different tests) alterations of renin, cortisol &amp; ACTH REGULATORY AUTHORIZATIONS Ethics
