    <textblock>
      Brain hypoperfusion patients may cause vascular dementia results from their hypoperfusion
      state except that is a risk factor for stroke. The most common clinical symptom of
      hypoperfusion syndrome is dizziness.Siwu tang is made of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels
      (當歸), Rehmannia glutinosa (Gaertn) Libosch (熟地黃), Paeonia lactiflora Pall (白芍), Ligusticum
      chuanxiong Hort (川芎), and that was used to treat patients with blood deficiency for several
      centuries. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the complementary effect of
      siwu tang on brain hypoperfusion syndrome patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We designed a randomized, double-blinded controlled study, and a total of 80 patients with
      brain hypoperfusion syndrome should be finished assessment in two years. The 80 patients with
      hypoperfusion syndrome were divided into as follows:1) control group, receiving siwu tang
      placebo 3 g bid continuously two weeks except ordinary treatment; 2) treatment group,
      receiving siwu tang 3 g bid continuously two weeks except ordinary treatment. The patients
      were assessed before, and 4 weeks (weeks±3 days) and 12 weeks (12 weeks±3 days) after siwu
      tang treatment, respectively. Primary outcome measure was cerebral blood flow by using single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); Second outcome measure included severity of
      dizziness by using visual analogue scale (VAS); cognitive function by using Mini-Mental
      Status (MMSE), Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), and Clinical Dementia Rating
      (CDR); quality of life by using barthel index (BI) and Functional Independent Measure (FIM).

      We predict that siwu tang can improve cerebral blood flow, and clinical manifestation
      including dizziness, and cognition function and quality of life in patients with brain
      hypoperfusion syndrome .
