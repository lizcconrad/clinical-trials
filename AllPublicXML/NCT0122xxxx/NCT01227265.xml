  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the efficacy and safety of preladenant in adult participants with moderate
      to severe Parkinson's Disease (PD). While on this study, participants will continue to take
      their usual, prescribed, stable regimen of levodopa (L-dopa) or L-dopa plus adjunct PD
      medications and will be randomized to receive 2 mg preladenant, 5 mg preladenant, or placebo,
      twice daily, for 12 weeks. After that, participants may choose to receive additional
      treatment with preladenant. The primary hypothesis is that at least the 5 mg twice daily dose
      of preladenant is superior to placebo as measured by the change from Baseline to Week 12 in
      the mean &quot;off&quot; time.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average &quot;Off&quot; Time (Hours Per Day) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;on&quot; state is defined as the period of time during which a patient's symptoms of PD improve or disappear following treatment with L-dopa or dopamine agonists. The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the period of time characterized by the return of symptoms (i..e. tremor, slowness, and rigidity) following treatment with L-dopa or dopamine agonists. Study participants reported their symptoms at half-hour intervals as &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, or &quot;asleep&quot; on their daily diary for 3 days before randomization (baseline) and for the 3 days immediately before their Week 12 visit. The mean change from baseline in &quot;off&quot; time was based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≥180 mmHg and 20 mmHg Increase</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) ≥180 mmHg and 20 mmHg increase was reported. Participants lie supine at rest for 5 minutes, then have a single BP measurement taken (ie, 1 reading). Participants then stand for 3 minutes at rest, followed by a single BP measurement (1 reading) in the standing position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≥105 mmHg and 15 mmHg Increase</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) ≥105 mmHg and 15 mmHg increase was reported. Participants lie supine at rest for 5 minutes, then have a single BP measurement taken (ie, 1 reading). Participants then stand for 3 minutes at rest, followed by a single BP measurement (1 reading) in the standing position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Suicidality</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with suicidality using the Columbia - Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was reported. The C-SSR was used in this study only for the purpose of safety monitoring by measuring the incidence of different types of suicidality categories during treatment. The assessment was done by the nature of the responses, not by a numbered scale. Participants who reported at least one occurrence of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation were counted as having experienced suicidality. Suicidal behavior included suicide attempt, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, or preparatory behavior. Suicidal ideation included a wish to die or active suicidal thought with or without method, intent or plan.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire providing a measure of a person's general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life. The scale consists of 8 situations in which the participant rates their tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0=no chance of dozing to 3=high chance of dozing. The overall score is the sum of the scores for the 8 situations for a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 24 with a higher score indicating greater sleepiness. The mean change from baseline in total EES was based on a cLDA with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With &gt;30% Change (Reduction) From Baseline at Week 12 in Mean &quot;Off&quot; Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A participant with at least a 30% reduction in mean &quot;off&quot; time from Baseline to End of Treatment (Week 12) is considered as &quot;responder&quot;. The &quot;on&quot; state is defined as the period of time during which a patient's symptoms of PD improve or disappear following treatment with L-dopa or dopamine agonists. The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the period of time characterized by the return of symptoms (i..e. tremor, slowness, and rigidity) following treatment with L-dopa or dopamine agonists. Study participants reported their symptoms at half-hour intervals as &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, or &quot;asleep&quot; on their daily diary for 3 days before randomization and for the 3 days immediately before their Week 12 visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average &quot;On&quot; Time (Hours Per Day) Without Troublesome Dyskinesia at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;On&quot; time is when a PD participant's symptoms are improved. Mean &quot;on&quot; time without troublesome dyskinesias is derived from the available diary data collected for 3 days immediately prior to a clinic visit. &quot;On&quot; time without troublesome dyskinesia is the sum of &quot;on&quot; time without dyskinesia plus &quot;on&quot; time with non-troublesome dyskinesia as recorded in the diary. The mean change from baseline in &quot;on&quot; time was based on a cLDA with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average &quot;Off&quot; Time (Hours Per Day) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The &quot;on&quot; state is defined as the period of time during which a patient's symptoms of PD improve or disappear following treatment with L-dopa or dopamine agonists. The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the period of time characterized by the return of symptoms (i..e. tremor, slowness, and rigidity) following treatment with L-dopa or dopamine agonists. Study participants reported their symptoms at half-hour intervals as &quot;off&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, or &quot;asleep&quot; on their daily diary for 3 days before randomization (baseline) and for the 3 days immediately before their Week 12 visit. The mean change from baseline in &quot;off&quot; time was based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>

        <description>&quot;On&quot; time is when a PD participant's symptoms are improved. Mean &quot;on&quot; time without troublesome dyskinesias is derived from the available diary data collected for 3 days immediately prior to a clinic visit. &quot;On&quot; time without troublesome dyskinesia is the sum of &quot;on&quot; time without dyskinesia plus &quot;on&quot; time with non-troublesome dyskinesia as recorded in the diary. The mean change from baseline in &quot;on&quot; time was based on a cLDA with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>

The C-SSR was used in this study only for the purpose of safety monitoring by measuring the incidence of different types of suicidality categories during treatment. The assessment was done by the nature of the responses, not by a numbered scale. Participants who reported at least one occurrence of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation were counted as having experienced suicidality. Suicidal behavior included suicide attempt, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, or preparatory behavior. Suicidal ideation included a wish to die or active suicidal thought with or without method, intent or plan.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire providing a measure of a person’s general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life. The scale consists of 8 situations in which the participant rates their tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0=no chance of dozing to 3=high chance of dozing. The overall score is the sum of the scores for the 8 situations for a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 24 with a higher score indicating greater sleepiness. The mean change from baseline in total EES was based on a cLDA with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>

The mean change from baseline in total EES was based on a cLDA with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>
