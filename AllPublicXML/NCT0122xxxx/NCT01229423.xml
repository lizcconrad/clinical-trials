    <measure>Change From Baseline in Eyelash Length at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in eyelash length at Week 20. Measurements made were based on the mean length of the upper left and right eyelashes. A positive change from baseline indicates an increase in eyelash length, and a negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in eyelash length.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With an Improvement of at Least 1-Point in Global Eyelash Assessment (GEA) Score at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects with an improvement of at least 1-point in GEA score at Week 20 from baseline. The GEA scale is an investigator-graded 4-point scale of overall eyelash prominence where 1=minimal, 2=moderate, 3=marked, and 4=very marked prominence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Eyelash Thickness at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in eyelash thickness at Week 20. Assessments made were based on the mean thickness of the upper left and right eyelashes. A positive change from baseline indicates an increase in eyelash thickness, and a negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in eyelash thickness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Eyelash Intensity (Darkness) at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in eyelash intensity (darkness) at Week 20. Assessments made were based on the mean eyelash intensity of the upper left and right eyelashes. Intensity was measured on a scale ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). A negative change from baseline indicates eyelash darkening in color, and a positive change from baseline indicates eyelash lightening in color.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With an Improvement in Satisfaction With Overall Eyelash Prominence at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects with an improvement in satisfaction with overall eyelash prominence at Week 20. Subject satisfaction with overall eyelash prominence was assessed by response to the question &quot;Overall how satisfied are you with your eyelashes?&quot; Responses were based on a 5-point scale (&quot;very unsatisfied&quot;, &quot;unsatisfied&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;satisfied&quot;, &quot;very satisfied&quot;). Improvement in subject satisfaction is defined as a 1-point increase from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Satisfied With Treatment at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects satisfied with treatment at week 20 was assessed using the Treatment Satisfaction Scale response to the question &quot;Which best describes your satisfaction with LATISSE®?&quot; Responses were &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;satisfied&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;unsatisfied&quot;, and &quot;very unsatisfied.&quot; Satisfied is defined as responses of &quot;very satisfied&quot; and &quot;satisfied.&quot;</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Eyelash Intensity (Darkness) at Week 20</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in eyelash intensity (darkness) at Week 20. Assessments made were based on the mean eyelash intensity of the upper left and right eyelashes. Intensity was measured on a scale ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). A negative change from baseline indicates eyelash darkening in color, and a positive change from baseline indicates eyelash lightening in color.</description>

Subject satisfaction with overall eyelash prominence was assessed by response to the question “Overall how satisfied are you with your eyelashes?” Responses were based on a 5-point scale (“very unsatisfied”, “unsatisfied”, “neutral”, “satisfied”, “very satisfied”). Improvement in subject satisfaction is defined as a 1-point increase from baseline.</description>
