    <textblock>
      This study is a longitudinal single-center pilot study designed to describe changes in lung
      function and levels of noninvasive biomarkers of airway inflammation in children ages 6-18
      years over two months following hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of asthma. Forty
      children ages 6-18 years with asthma who are admitted to Children's Hospital and Regional
      Medical Center (GCRC) for an asthma exacerbation will be enrolled and complete an initial
      study visit prior to hospital discharge. Children with asthma will be recruited from the
      inpatient medical unit. During their initial visit subjects will undergo a clinical
      assessment and perform spirometry to measure lung function. In addition, exhaled nitric oxide
      (eNO) concentration will be measured and a sample of exhaled breath condensate (eBC) will be
      collected during 20 minutes of tidal breathing. Breath condensate will be analyzed to
      determine the concentration of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT), an important mediator of
      airway inflammation in asthma. Subjects with asthma will return to the GCRC pediatric
      satellite at Seattle Children's Hospital for follow-up study visits at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4
      weeks following hospital discharge. During follow-up visits subjects will complete a
      questionnaire regarding symptoms and medication use since the most recent study visit, will
      perform spirometry, and have eNO concentration measured and breath condensate collected for
      CysLT analysis.

      The aims of this observational study are to:

        1. Assess the association of levels of exhaled nitric oxide and cysteinyl leukotrienes in
           breath condensate with measures of airflow obstruction (FEV1) and asthma symptoms
           during, and at one, two, and four weeks following hospital discharge for asthma
           exacerbation.

        2. Compare levels of exhaled nitric oxide and cysteinyl leukotrienes in breath condensate
           from children ages 6-18 years hospitalized for status asthmaticus to levels from
           age-matched healthy control subjects without asthma.
