  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases requiring
      life-long insulin therapy. Children and adolescents with T1D need regular insulin injections
      or the continuous insulin delivery using an insulin pump in order to keep blood glucose
      levels normal. The investigators know that keeping blood sugars in the normal range will help
      prevent long-term diabetes-related complications involving the eyes, kidneys and heart.
      However, achieving treatment goals can be very difficult as the tighter the investigators try
      to control blood glucose levels, the greater the risk to develop symptoms and signs of low
      glucose levels (hypoglycaemia). This is a particular problem at night and one solution is to
      develop a system whereby the amount of insulin injected is controlled by a computer and is
      very closely matched to the blood sugar levels on a continuous basis. This can be achieved by
      what is known as a &quot;closed-loop system&quot; where a small glucose sensor placed under the skin
      communicates with a computer containing an algorithm that drives an insulin pump. The
      investigators have been testing such a system in Cambridge over the last three years in
      children and have found that this system is effective at preventing nocturnal hypoglycaemia.
      The next stage of this research is to test the system for a longer period of time at home. In
      the present study the investigators are planning to study 16 adolescents aged 12-18 years on
      insulin pump therapy. During 21 nights glucose will be controlled by the computer and during
      the other 21 nights the subjects will make their own adjustments to the insulin therapy. The
      investigators will then analyze the data to determine the effect of the computer algorithm in
      keeping glucose levels between 3.9 and 8 mmol/L (normal levels) and reducing the time they
      spent with glucose below 3.9 mmol/L (hypoglycaemia). Subjects' response to the use of the
      system in terms of life-style change, daily diabetes management and fear of hypoglycaemia
      will be assessed. The investigators will also test for longer term glucose control by
      measuring glycated haemoglobin and other blood parameters.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) combined with overnight automated closed-loop glucose control in maintaining CGM glucose levels within the target range from 3.9 to 8.0 mmol/L, when compared with the use of CGM alone in the home setting.</description>

    <time_frame>At least 7 days of valid CGM nights (midnight-7:30)</time_frame>
    <description>As a secondary research question, the safety of overnight automated closed-loop glucose control in terms of number of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia as well as the number of subjects experiencing severe hypoglycaemia and other adverse events.
Furthermore, the frequency and duration of use of the closed-loop system will be evaluated. Subjects' perception in terms of life-style change, daily diabetes management and fear of hypoglycaemia will be assessed using questionnaires and a qualitative interview.</description>
