      In this research study the investigators are looking for the highest dose of a stereotactic
      radiation boost that can be given safely. Because stereotactic radiation is so precise, the
      investigators are testing whether it can be used to increase the dose to the primary tumor
      without significantly increasing the side effects the participant experiences; the goal is to
      improve the likelihood of killing the tumor.

      Primary Objectives Phase I: Determination of the MTD and dose-limiting toxicities of a
      stereotactic boost to chemoradiotherapy for stage II/III non-small cell lung cancer.

      Phase II: Two-year local control rate

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a stereotactic boost to chemoradiotherapy.

        -  To determine the 2-year overall survival.

        -  To determine the 2-year disease-free survival.

        -  To determine the 2-year regional control rate.

        -  To characterize the change in pulmonary function tests over the first 2 years after
           chemoradiotherapy.

      Statistical Design The Phase I study followed a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Three
      dose levels were evaluated. The DLT observation period was the 7-week chemoradiotherapy
      period and the subsequent 8-week recovery period.

      To better study the toxicity at the MTD of the stereotactic boost, there was a 10 patient
      expansion cohort.The primary endpoint of the phase II portion of the study was two-year local
      failure rate of the protocol treatment. Local failure was defined as biopsy-proven recurrent
      disease, or if a biopsy was not attainable, by increasing FDG-avidity on PET-CT on 2
      consecutive scans at least 1 month apart. Based on prior studies, a 2-year local failure rate
      of 15% would be worthy of further study, while a 2-year local failure rate of 35% would not
      justify further utilization of the treatment. With 32 eligible patients on this study, the
      treatment will be deemed promising if at least 25 patients are free of local failure at 2
      years. Using this design, there was an 8% probability of declaring the treatment worthy of
      further study if the true 2-year local failure rate was 35%, and a 90% probability of
      declaring the treatment worthy of further study if the true 2-year local failure rate was 15%
      by using a one-sided one-sample exact binomial test.

    <description>The MTD is determined by the number of patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached.
DLTs were defined as follows (CTCAE v4.0):
Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicities: Myelitis; Esophageal fistula, perforation, hemorrhage
Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities considered to be a direct result of therapy:
Radiation pneumonitis; Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade; Esophageal necrosis, stenosis, ulcer; Dyspnea; Myelitis Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities: Radiation pneumonitis; Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade; Esophagitis (not due to mediastinal irradiation unrelated to the stereotactic boost), esophageal necrosis, stenosis, ulcer; Dyspnea; Myelitis Grade 5 non-hematologic toxicity: Any</description>

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</title>
        <description>The MTD is determined by the number of patients who experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience a DLT. If no DLTs are observed, the MTD is not reached.
DLTs were defined as follows (CTCAE v4.0):
Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicities: Myelitis; Esophageal fistula, perforation, hemorrhage
Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities considered to be a direct result of therapy:
Radiation pneumonitis; Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade; Esophageal necrosis, stenosis, ulcer; Dyspnea; Myelitis Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities: Radiation pneumonitis; Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pericardial tamponade; Esophagitis (not due to mediastinal irradiation unrelated to the stereotactic boost), esophageal necrosis, stenosis, ulcer; Dyspnea; Myelitis Grade 5 non-hematologic toxicity: Any</description>
        <time_frame>7-week chemoradiotherapy period and the subsequent 8-week recovery period</time_frame>
        <population>All treated participants who received at least one dose of the study drug and were evaluable for DLT.</population>

            <title>Stereotactic Boost to Chemoradiotherapy (Dose Level 1)</title>
            <description>Chemotherapy: Etoposide 50 mg/m2, d1-5, 29-33 and Cisplatin 50 mg/m2, d1, 8, 29, 36; Conventional RT Dose to Primary: 54 Gy; Stereotactic Boost to Primary: 10 Gy; Total Dose to Primary: 64 Gy
Patients were to start radiation to the primary tumor site and to the lymph nodes and chemotherapy in the same week. The treatment was identical to standard chemotherapy and radiation treatment until the 5th week. During the fifth week, patents would undergo another radiation mapping session to prepare for the stereotactic boost. After that, the radiation treatments to the lymph nodes would continue but the radiation treatment to the primary cancer site would stop until the last week (week 7). During week 7, participants would receive 2 doses of stereotactic radiotherapy to the site of the primary tumor instead of the lower doses of radiotherapy that they were treated with up to that point.</description>
