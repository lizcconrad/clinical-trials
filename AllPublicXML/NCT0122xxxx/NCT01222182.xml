      A group of ~ 225 patients were switched from atorvastatin to an equivalent statin either by
      their physicians usual management or by an collaborative pharmacist coordinated process. We
      will compare the results of pharmacist process to the standard medical practice to find
      potentially which process is more effective, safer and efficient. We are surveying a total of
      35 physicians, 12 using the pharmacist coordinated process and 23 not, comparing their
      satisfaction of the 2 processes.

      This study is a retrospective analysis of patients converted from atorvastatin to another
      equivalent statin. It is observational because the patients were all on atorvastatin, had
      been informed by their prescription drug plan that it would not be covered, and that if
      agreed they would be changed to an equivalent that is covered by their plan. The patients
      were either converted with the help of pharmacist by collaborative practice agreement (CPA)or
      upon contacting their physician requesting a different medication. We are comparing the
      percentage first converted to the equivalent dose in each group and whether patients
      continued to be at hyperlipidemia treatment goal after the interchange.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if a process of pharmacist practice agreement is effective in changing from atorvastatin 10, 20mg to a therapeutic equivalent dose.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 9 months after conversion from atorvastatin</time_frame>
    <description>We compared doses selected for therapeutic equivalency for the new statin Did the process result in selecting a safe and effective statin alternative?</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Was the process regarded as efficient and satisfying to physician compared to usual practice.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months post conversion</time_frame>
    <description>A satisfaction survey of physicians who utilized the pharmacist collaborative practice agreement(CPA) will be compared to satisfaction of phycians who were not able to use the CPA. Was the process regarded as efficient and satisfying to physician compared to usual practice.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Did the patients' low density lipoprotein(LDL) cholesterol require further statin dose intervention?</measure>
    <time_frame>6-12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Of patients who had a follow up LDL cholesterol, how many required another intervention after failing to stay within treatment goal. Physicians usually measure each of these patients within 3 months of a change of treatment and annually thereafter. We will look at follow up LDL cholesterol and liver function test (LFT) as recommended.</description>
