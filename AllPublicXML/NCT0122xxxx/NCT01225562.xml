  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out to see if a new drug called ticagrelor given twice daily in
      addition to the ASA therapy decreases the frequency of cardiovascular events (e.g., death
      from heart disease, heart attack, or stroke).

    <description>Participants with CV death, MI or Stroke. If no event, censoring occurs at the earliest of the efficacy cut-off date 14 Sep 2014, withdrawal of consent, non-CV death or at the last time point of complete clinical event assessment.

    <description>A Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) study group major bleeding is defined as any fatal bleeding (leading directly to death within 7 days), any intrcranial bleeding or any clinically overt signs of haemorrhage associated with a drop in Haemoglobin of &gt;= 5g/dL. Events were adjudicated by a clinical events committee. Censoring ocurrs at 7 days following last dose of study drug. The Kaplan-Meier estimate reports the percentage of patients who experienced a TIMI Major bleeding within 3 years from first dose of study drug</description>
