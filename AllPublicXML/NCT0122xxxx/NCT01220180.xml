Based on individual subject response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 300 mg per day after an interval of 3 to 7 days, and if needed, to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day after an additional 7-day interval.
Central neuropathic pain: Pregabalin treatment can be started at a dose of 150 mg per day. Based on individual subject response and tolerability, the dosage may be increased to 300 mg per day after an interval of 1 week, and if needed, to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day after an additional 1 week interval.

Dosing should begin at 75 mg two times a day (150 mg/day) and may be increased to 150 mg two times a day (300 mg/day) within 1 week based on efficacy and tolerability. Subjects who do not experience sufficient benefit with 300 mg/day may be further increased to 225 mg two times a day (450 mg/day).

        <title>Number of Participants With Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale for NeP in ITT Population</title>
        <description>PGIC was defined as participant rated instrument to measure participant's change in overall status on a 7-point scale; range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Change was defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (a little improved), 4 (no change), 5 (a little worse) , 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse) on the scale. Higher score is equal to more affected.</description>
