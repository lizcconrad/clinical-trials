  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will help us learn more about how chronic graft-versus-host disease
      affects the skin, hair and nails. We are interested in knowing if hair and nail problems
      predict worse disease. This information may help us treat patients like you in the future.

      -  At the initial visit, participants will have a complete examination of their skin, hair
           and nails. We will also test muscle strength and movement by moving the participant's
           arms, legs and neck. Photographs will be taken of the skin, hair and nails of they are
           abnormal. Blood tests will be done to check the liver and blood cell count. The
           participant and their legal guardian will answer questions about how the participant
           feels and about their health.

        -  Participants will then be scheduled for follow up visits at 3 months, 6 months, and 12
           months. At each subsequent visit the following will be done: A complete examination of
           the skin, hair and nails; a test of muscle strength; photographs will be repeated; blood
           tests to check liver and blood cell counts; and questions about how the participant
           feels and about their health.

        The research subject population is children who have received hematopoietic stem cell
        transplant and developed chronic graft-versus-host disease. All children seen at the
        pediatric GVHD clinic at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will be recruited.
