  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In low-risk node-negative breast cancer patients adjuvant chemotherapy should be spared. The
      identification of this subgroup can be based either on clinical and pathological or on
      tumour-biological criteria. Due to their high prognostic impact, the tumour-biological
      invasion markers uPA/PAI-1 (urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its inhibitor PAI-1) are
      potential candidates to effectively assess the risk of relapse in node-negative breast
      cancer. This study is aimed to compare the risk assessment by the traditional
      clinico-pathological factors and by tumour-biological factors. The second study question
      refers to the comparison between an adjuvant combination treatment with FE100C*6 and a
      sequential treatment with FE100C*3 and Docetaxel*3.

      1. To compare FEC*6 with FEC*3 followed by DOC*3 with regard to:

             -  the primary endpoint of the study: Disease-Free Survival (DFS)

             -  the secondary endpoints: Overall Survival (OS), compliance, and toxicity of
                chemotherapy in each patient group

        2. To compare patients with low risk according to clinico-pathological versus those
           according to biological risk criteria with regard to:

             -  the proportion of low risk versus high risk patients

             -  DFS

             -  OS (secondary endpoint)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological proven primary breast cancer

          -  Axillary lymph nodes tumour free (node-negative disease)

          -  Adequate surgical procedure: R0-resection and axillary dissection with more than 10
             lymph nodes examined or adequate sentinel procedure in a qualified centre
