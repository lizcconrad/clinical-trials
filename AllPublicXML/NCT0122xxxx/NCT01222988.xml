      Obtain a preliminary assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the
      sustained lost weight (SLW) intervention in a real-world clinical setting for patients who
      have completed a 21-week very low calorie diet (VLCD).

      Hypothesis: Intervention will be feasible to implement as evidenced by the ability to recruit
      and retain participants and acceptable to participants as evidenced by self-report of
      satisfaction with the program and adoption of weight maintenance behaviors.

      Secondary Aim: Obtain a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of the sustained lost
      weight (SLW) intervention for patients who have completed 21 weeks of a very low calorie diet
      (VLCD).

      Hypothesis: Greater than 75% of participants who receive this novel approach, where
      maintenance behaviors are individualized based on resting metabolic rate and a physical
      activity factor, will regain greater or equal to 10 kg. at week 52 follow-up.

    <description>Treatment will be considered feasible if greater than 50 % of participants attend a minimum of 17 of 20 sessions. The treatment will be considered acceptable for further study if greater than 50% of participants rate the maintenance program with a mean score of 6 or higher.</description>
