  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with marked bladder dysfunction as a result of secondary progressive multiple
      sclerosis are being recruited to receive AIMSPRO or placebo by subcutaneous injection, in
      this double-blind crossover study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment periods of 4 weeks' duration are separated by a 6 week wash-out phase. After 14
      weeks of randomised therapy there is a 38 week period of &quot;open-label&quot; AIMSPRO treatment.
