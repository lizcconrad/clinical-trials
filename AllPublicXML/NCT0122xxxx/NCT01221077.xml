      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of Erlotinib
      (Tarceva®) in combination with OSI-906 in Patients with Advanced non-small cell lung cancer

      Based on the recommendation of the Data Monitoring Committee, OSI-906 and matching placebo
      are no longer being administered as of 01 March 2013.

      This is a multi-center, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study.
      Patients will be stratified according to the following 2 parameters: (1) EGFR activating
      mutation type (exon 19 deletion versus exon 21 single point mutation); and (2) Eastern
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs. 1).
