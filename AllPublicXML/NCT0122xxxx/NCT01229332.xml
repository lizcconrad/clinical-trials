  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cross-over study, where ND0611 or placebo will be tested on top of 3 different LD/CD dosage
      forms. Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile of levodopa and carbidopa and the
      potential clinical effect of ND0611 will be explored in subjects with PD and motor
      fluctuations.
