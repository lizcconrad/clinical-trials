  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare dosing effect of water on the single dose
      bioavailability of Ondansetron ODFS 8mg (MonoSol Rx, USA) administered with and without water
      to Zofran ODT® 8mg administered without water in healthy male and female adult, human study
      participants under fasting conditions.

        -  To monitor clinical status, adverse events and laboratory investigations, and to assess
           the relative safety and tolerance of the study drug formulations under fasting
           conditions.

        -  To estimate intra-subject coefficients of variation (CV).
