  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1-3% worldwide. At
      present, there is no curative therapy available and the clinical course is unpredictable, but
      in the majority of cases psoriasis is a chronically remitting and relapsing disease. Several
      clinical subtypes of psoriasis exist with differences in manifestations and skin areas
      involved.

      Chronic stable plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Vulgaris) is the commonest form of the disease,
      accounting for 85-90% of cases. The circumscribed infiltrated skin lesions are scaly and
      erythematous and often symmetrically distributed over the body. Several types of palliative
      therapies exist. The therapies are either topical or systemic. The severity of chronic plaque
      psoriasis is often determined by the percentage of body surface area (BSA) involved. For
      mild, moderate and severe chronic plaque psoriasis with BSA involvement of up to 20%, initial
      therapy is topical. Phototherapy and numerous systemic therapies are usually indicated when
      more than 20% of skin is affected.

      Severe plaque-type psoriasis requires systemic and long-term therapy in order to induce and
      maintain remission. Acitretin 25mg/day combined with a phototherapy regimen is a standard
      treatment that provides clinically significant efficacy, however many patients experience
      tolerability issues due to retinoid-related adverse events. Retinoid-related adverse events
      include but are not limited to: alopecia, dry mucus membranes, pruritus, photosensitivity,
      elevation of liver enzymes, elevation of serum triglycerides, cholesterol and decrease of
      HDL, arthralgias, myalgias, eye irritation, blepharitis, photophobia, conjunctivitis,
      headaches, nausea, anemia and leukemia. Reducing the acitretin dose from 25mg/day to
      17.5mg/day may provide improved tolerability without compromising efficacy.

      The purpose of this study is to ascertain if reducing the acitretin dose from 25mg/day to
      17.5mg/day will provide improved tolerability without compromising efficacy.
