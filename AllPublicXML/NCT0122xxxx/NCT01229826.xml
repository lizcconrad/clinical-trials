      The purpose of this study is to gain additional information regarding use of Magnetic
      Resonance Elastography (MRE) for uterine fibroid characterization. In this study, the
      investigators will use a new noninvasive technology, MRE, to further characterize the elastic
      properties of the uterine fibroids. To date, very little is known concerning how the tissue
      composition of the uterine fibroid may affect its treatment with Magnetic Resonance Guided
      Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS).

      In this study, the investigators will use a new noninvasive technology, magnetic resonance
      elastography (MRE), to further characterize the elastic properties of the uterine fibroids.
      This information will be gathered during routine magnetic resonance imaging for symptomatic
      uterine fibroids. It is known that some fibroids with increased T2-signal on Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging(MRI) can be more difficult to treat.

      This information will be gathered during routine magnetic resonance imaging for symptomatic
      uterine fibroids.

      This is a single-site, non-randomized pilot study to determine whether Magnetic Resonance
      Elastography (MRE) can be optimized for clinical use as part of the patients routine clinical
      imaging and to correlate with MR signal characteristics of the uterine fibroid.

      MRE is performed at the end of the examination after the standard Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      protocol.

      Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To acquire magnetic resonance elastography images on women who have a
      clinically ordered pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for uterine fibroids.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine the correlation between MRE stiffness values and MR T2 signal
      characteristics for uterine fibroids. For a subset of patients going on to surgery
      correlation with pathology can also be performed.

      This study will seek to determine whether MRE can be performed in the pelvis on a routine
      clinical basis as well as correlating the MRE findings with magnetic resonance signal
      characteristics. There are no additional risks to the patient and no additional cost to the
      MRI exam.

    <description>MRE is performed at the end of the examination after the standard MRI protocol. A test vibration is first applied on the patient to familiarize the patient with the vibration. The MRE sequence is performed with either a body coil or a pelvic-array coil. The total acquisition time is split into four periods of suspended respiration of 16 seconds for acquisition of wave images at four phase offsets. To obtain a consistent position of the fibroid for each phase offset, patients are asked to quietly breath and remain still.</description>
