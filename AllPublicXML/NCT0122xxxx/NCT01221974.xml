      The purpose of this study is to gather safety data related to the use of Essure®
      micro-inserts in women with hydrosalpinx prior to in vitro fertilization and during pregnancy
      and to collect data with regard to implantation rates, clinical pregnancy rates, and
      pregnancy outcomes.
