  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vinorelbine (NVB) and platinum compounds are anticancer agents with broad spectrum of
      efficacy, clinically and preclinically proven synergism and only partially overlapping
      toxicities. Combinations with vinorelbine and platinum compounds with limited neurotoxicity
      are among the most used palliative regimens in a variety of solid tumors, including NSCLC,
      breast and cervical cancer. The oral platinum analogue satraplatin (SATRA) has been brought
      into clinical development because of the antitumor activity and toxicity comparable to those
      of carboplatin, together with a good acceptability of the oral administration.The recent
      availability of oral formulation of anticancer agents of proven efficacy in some indications
      is likely to become a valid option which could affect clinical daily management. The oral
      administration of vinorelbine and satraplatin might represent a reasonable option of
      palliative treatment in patients with advanced breast cancer, NSCL, GU or GY tumors for which
      a curative treatment can not be provided.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically/ cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic or unresectable
             and for which standard curative or palliative chemotherapy measures do not exist or
             are no longer effective.

          2. Histological/cytological diagnosis of solid tumors in which treatment with oral
             vinorelbine and oral platinum compounds(preferentially breast, NSCL, GU or GY tumors)
             is medically indicated

          3. Progressive disease (also in terms of tumor markers only, like CA 125 for ovary and
             PSA for prostate). No measurable disease is necessary.

          4. Age 18-75 years

          5. Prior chemotherapy of ≤ 2 lines for advanced disease

          6. ECOG Performance Status &lt; 2
