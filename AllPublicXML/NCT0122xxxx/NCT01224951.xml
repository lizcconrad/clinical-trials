  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the study are:

      -to unravel the importance of molecular phenotyping in predicting the response to classical
      anti-asthma treatment (inhaled corticosteroids)

      The investigators have developed a non-invasive technique based on mRNA analysis of induced
      sputum that enables us to study airway inflammation in detail. This technique forms the basis
      for our current project based on the following hypotheses:

        1. different molecular asthma phenotypes exist: a Th2 phenotype and a non Th2 phenotype as
           reported by Woodruff and colleagues (Woodruff PG et al). Sputum mRNA cytokine levels can
           be used to diagnose Th2 asthma and discriminate this from non-Th2 asthma.

        2. Based on our previous research and preliminary data that non-Th2 asthma can be further
           divided in Th17 asthma and Th1+Th2 asthma; besides these, a fourth group without Th2,
           Th17 or Th1 characteristics also exist. The investigators hypothesize that the
           epithelial cell cytokine, TSLP, can be increased as an early marker of airway
           inflammation in this latter group.

        3. these subgroups have different responses to anti-inflammatory treatment.
