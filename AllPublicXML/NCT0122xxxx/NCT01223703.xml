    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that n-3 PUFAs improve left ventricular
      systolic function in patients with stable chronic HF secondary to nonischemic dilated
      cardiomyopathy (NICM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of the GISSI-HF trial indicate that in patients with chronic HF on evidence-based
      medical therapy and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV, long term
      treatment with n-3 PUFAs 1 g daily reduces mortality and hospitalizations for cardiovascular
      reasons. Several potential mechanisms may underlie the beneficial effects of n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in HF patients, including, but not limited to,
      antiarrhythmic, and hemodynamic actions. The current investigation was therefore designed to
      test the hypothesis that treatment with n-3 PUFAs improves LV systolic function expressed as
      EF in patients with stable chronic HF secondary to a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy
      (NICM). Additionally, we sought to determine if n-3 PUFAs also exert positive effects on LV
      diastolic function assessed by echocardiography; functional capacity assessed by
      cardiopulmonary stress testing (CPET); and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
      class.

    <description>NYHA class I: No symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity, e.g. shortness of breath when walking, climbing stairs, etc...
NYHA class II: Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity.
NYHA class III: Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20-100 m). Comfortable only at rest NYHA class IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound patients.</description>
