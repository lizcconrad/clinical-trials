      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects Exposure, Rescripting, and Relaxation
      Therapy (ERRT) has on nightmares and associated problems in veterans.

      The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to extend previous findings regarding the impact
      of a brief cognitive behavioral treatment for chronic nightmares by examining the emotional,
      cognitive, behavioral, and health-related changes following treatment. Experiencing a
      traumatic event may initiate or exacerbate the occurrence of nightmares. Indeed, sleep
      disturbance, including nightmares, is considered a hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Nightmares have been related to a variety of factors including stress, medications,
      trauma, and substance use. Among veterans, especially combat veterans or those reporting
      sexual assaults, symptoms of traumatic stress and nightmares are extremely common. Few
      studies have investigated the efficacy of nightmare treatment in a veteran population, and
      the impact of nightmare treatment on suicidal ideation has never been assessed.

      Imagery Rehearsal Treatment (IRT) has received increased attention in the past decade for use
      with chronic nightmares. Studies suggest that the treatment is promising for the reduction of
      frequency and intensity of chronic nightmares in trauma exposed persons and may have a
      generalized impact on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression and
      quality/quantity of sleep, although there is mixed evidence for sleep improvement among
      veterans. The principal investigator has completed two randomized controlled trials of a
      modified version of IRT, Exposure, Rescripting, and Relaxation Treatment (ERRT) and is
      currently conducting a third randomized controlled trial (Davis, 2008; Davis &amp; Wright, 2007).
      The current randomized controlled trial is comparing ERRT to an active treatment
      (relaxation). Results demonstrated positive treatment response. Although these trials have
      included some veteran participants, veterans have not been studied as a group using this
      protocol. The purpose of this prospective study is to conduct a pre- and post-treatment
      comparison of suicidal ideation and posttraumatic, depressive, and health symptoms in a
      single group of veterans.

    <description>This fill-in-the-blank variable assesses the number of nights the individual experienced nightmares in the past week (range = 0 - 7 nights). Higher values indicate more nights with nightmares (worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>pre, one week, two months</time_frame>
    <description>This semi-structured clinical interview assesses each of 17 DSM-IV-TR criteria for PTSD utilizing separate queries for frequency and severity on a 5-point scale (0 - 4). This study utilized the &quot;FI/I2&quot; rule, where frequency ratings of one or more and intensity ratings of two or more must be present in order for a symptom to count towards diagnosis.
Total scores are comprised of the three factors (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal), with 136 being the maximum. 0-19 = asymptomatic or few symptoms. 20-39 = mild PTSD, subthreshold. 40-59 = moderate PTSD at threshold. 60-79 = severe PTSD. 80+ = extreme PTSD.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 21-item, self-report measure was designed to assess the severity of depression among adults. Responses on a Likert-type scale range from 0 - 3, and scores may be summed to derive a total score (0-63), with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. Scores of 18 and above have been suggested to reliably identify depressed patients.</description>

        <description>This semi-structured clinical interview assesses each of 17 DSM-IV-TR criteria for PTSD utilizing separate queries for frequency and severity on a 5-point scale (0 – 4). This study utilized the “FI/I2” rule, where frequency ratings of one or more and intensity ratings of two or more must be present in order for a symptom to count towards diagnosis.
Total scores are comprised of the three factors (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal), with 136 being the maximum. 0-19 = asymptomatic or few symptoms. 20-39 = mild PTSD, subthreshold. 40-59 = moderate PTSD at threshold. 60-79 = severe PTSD. 80+ = extreme PTSD.</description>

Scores of 18 and above have been suggested to reliably identify depressed patients.</description>
