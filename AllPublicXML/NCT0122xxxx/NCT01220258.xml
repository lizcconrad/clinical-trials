      One objective of this study is to determine the levels of markers of inflammation on the
      eyelid margin of subjects with blepharoconjunctivitis and compare them with those of healthy
      volunteers. Another objective is to determine in subjects with blepharoconjunctivitis the
      effect of azithromycin ophthalmic solution, 1 % on markers of inflammation of lid margins and
      conjunctivae and on signs and symptoms of blepharoconjunctivitis.
