  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lamellar ichthyosis (IL) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis with a defect of
      keratinization of the skin which results in a severe generalized cutaneous xerosis with dark
      brown big scales, an ectropion, an eclabion, an alopecia and a palmo-plantar keratodermia.
      They are due to mutations of the gene TGM1 coding for the transglutaminase keratinocyte 1
      (TG1) in 1/3 of the cases. Other genes were recently identified, ABCA12 coding for the
      triphosphate-binding adenosine cassette A12 and FLJ39501 which codes for a protein of the
      cytochrome p450 ( CYP4F2).

      No etiological treatment is available. Symptomatic treatment consists on twice application of
      emollients and keratolytic ointments which decrease the dryness of the skin and reduce
      scales. Oral isotretinoin is usually partially effective but is only suspensive and has
      numerous side effects.

      Recent studies showed that the epigallocatechin-3-gallate (POLYPHENON E®), extracted from
      green tea increases the differentiation of the normal human keratinocytes, as showedb by the
      increase of the involucrine, TG1 and caspase-14 genes expression.

      The main objective of this pilot study is to estimate the action and the tolerance of a daily
      application of topical Polyphénon E 10% ® to improve the desquamation and the cutaneous
      roughness of patients with lamellar ichthyosis, after 4 weeks of treatment.

      The secondary objectives

        -  To estimate the duration of remission obtained after the treatment

        -  To estimate the action of cutaneous Veregen® to improve the palmar and plantar
           involvement.

        -  To estimate the action of cutaneous Veregen on the pruritus

        -  And to estimate the global level of acceptability by the patient of the Veregen 10 %
