      Study Objectives:

      The overall objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and activity of single cycles of AFM13 in patients with CD30 positive
      refractory and/or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of single cycles of AFM13
           monotherapy.

        2. To determine the OBD (Optimal Biological Dose) or MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) of AFM13;
           whichever is reached first.

        3. To define the pharmacokinetic profile of AFM13.

        4. To analyse immunological markers e.g. ADCC (Antibody dependent cell mediated
           cytotoxicity), NK (Natural killer) cell activity, complement activation and depletion,
           and cytokine release.

        5. To assess the immunogenicity of AFM13.

        6. To assess the activity of AFM13.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological diagnosis of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma expressing the CD30
             antigen.

          2. Age ≥18 years.

          3. Both genders.

          4. Patients who have relapsed or are refractory after at least two prior potentially
             curative therapies including autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Patients
             with a progressive disease after the first-line therapy who are ineligible for, or
             refused to receive high dose chemotherapy and/or ASCT for the second-line therapy, or
             any other established curative therapy, are also eligible.

          5. Completed radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or treatment with other investigational
             agents at least 3 weeks prior to study entry.

          6. Patients who received ASCT should have fully recovered prior to study entry.

             or squamous intraepithelial lesions (e.g., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] or

          7. Any active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection within 4 weeks prior to
             study entry.

          8. Known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).

          9. History of significant chronic or recurrent infections requiring treatment.
