  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with multiple co-morbidities, such as
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. The foundation of these
      conditions lays in childhood. Exercise is known to have a positive influence on bone mineral
      density (BMD) and some impact on cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy children, but
      little is known about these associations in children with T1DM.

      The main purpose of this study is to assess the effects of a 9-month weight-bearing exercise
      training program on skeletal development in children with T1DM, compared to healthy subjects.
      The second aim is to evaluate whether the program influences also cardiovascular diseases
      risk factors.

      This is a randomized controlled study incorporating 30 children with T1DM and 30 healthy
      children. Both groups are randomly divided (1:1) in an exercise or a control group: 1)
      exercise diabetic, 2) controls diabetic, 3) exercise healthy, 4) controls healthy.

      Exercise groups participate to an identical weight-bearing exercise training program 2 x 90
      minutes per week and controls are relatively inactive.

      Main measures include: total body, lumbar spine and hip BMD by DXA, body fat and fat-free
      mass, bone biomarkers levels, resting and ambulatory blood pressure and fasting blood lipids.

    <description>Exercise Diabetic and Healthy groups perform a similar training program including two exercise sessions per week, of 90 minutes each, during 9 months (excluding holidays) under supervision by physical education teachers and pediatricians. Sessions comprise various weight-bearing activities: rope skipping, jumping, ball games and gymnastics.
Control groups are relatively inactive.</description>
