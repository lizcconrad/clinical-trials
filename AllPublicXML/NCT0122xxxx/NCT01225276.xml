    <textblock>
      NewGam (current working title for a new IGIV formulation) is a newly developed human normal
      immunoglobulin solution ready for intravenous administration (IGIV). This study will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of three different dosages of NewGam 10% in patients with Chronic
      Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3 study that will take place in 2 stages. The primary objective of Stage 1
      (Phase 2 dose-finding part)is to determine and select one dosage from three NewGam
      maintenance dosage arms in comparison with a placebo arm, based on the percentage of
      responders (response defined as a decrease, meaning improvement, in the adjusted INCAT
      disability score by at least 1 point). The selected NewGam dosage and placebo will be
      employed and compared in Stage 2.

      The primary objective of Stage 2 (Phase 3 confirmatory part) is to demonstrate superiority of
      the maintenance dosage regimen selected at study Stage 1 over placebo in patients with CIDP
      as assessed by the percentage of responders.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety (measured by number of adverse events)and
      efficacy of NewGam administration in patients with CIDP compared to baseline.
