  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An endotoxin challenge will be administered to healthy subjects to induce production of
      inflammatory markers. An investigational drug or placebo will be administered prior to the
      endotoxin challenge to assess the effect of the investigational drug on the markers of
      inflammation. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial was terminated on 25 March 2015 due to safety concerns regarding the administration
      of endotoxin and because of the uncertain availability of future endotoxin lots.

    <measure>Peak Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Activity Following Inflammatory Stimulus</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 3-5</time_frame>
    <description>MPO is a heme-containing peroxidase enzyme produced in the bone marrow and stored in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, where it constitutes up to 5% of the cellular protein. Since PF-06282999 is a mechanism-based inactivator of MPO, it is of interest to evaluate the level of MPO activity in order to investigate the inhibition activity of PF-06282999.</description>

    <time_frame>From Day 0 till approximately 7-10 days following the last dose of PF-06282999/Placebo in Period 2 (up to approximately 2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. AEs comprised both SAEs and non-SAEs. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were defined as newly occurring AEs or those worsening after first dose. Due to early termination of the study, only AE data from partial enrollment are reflected and comparisons between treatment arms should not be attempted.</description>

The final dose of PF-06282999 125 mg was administered on the evening of Day 3.

          <description>Participants received PF-06282999 125 mg TID or 500 mg BID or matching placebo orally in tablet form from Days 1 to 3. On Day 3, participants received a dose of LPS as an IV bolus at a dose of 4 ng/kg over 45-60 secs 2 hours after the morning dose of PF-06282999 or matching placebo. A final dose of PF-06282999 or matching placebo was administered on the evening of Day 3. Period 2 started after a washout period of approximately 15 days with at least 21 days in between administration of LPS. Participants who took active treatment (PF-06282999) in Period 1 received placebo in Period 2 and vice versa.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Withdrawals Due to TEAEs</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. AEs comprised both SAEs and non-SAEs. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were defined as newly occurring AEs or those worsening after first dose. Due to early termination of the study, only AE data from partial enrollment are reflected and comparisons between treatment arms should not be attempted.</description>

        <description>Criteria for ECG (12-lead) values meeting categorical summarization criteria were: the interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization (PR interval &gt;=300 milliseconds (msec) and increase from baseline &gt;=25/50%; time from the beginning of the ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricular depolarization (QRS) interval &gt;=140 msec and increase of &gt;=50%; the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole (QT) interval &gt;=500 msec; QT corrected using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) of 450 to &lt;480 msec, 480 to &lt;500 msec, and &gt;=500 msec, or an increase of 30 to &lt;60 msec or &gt;=60 msec. Due to early termination of the study, only ECG data from partial enrollment are reflected and comparisons between treatment arms should not be attempted.</description>

          <description>Criteria for ECG (12-lead) values meeting categorical summarization criteria were: the interval between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex, corresponding to the time between the onset of the atrial depolarization and onset of ventricular depolarization (PR interval &gt;=300 milliseconds (msec) and increase from baseline &gt;=25/50%; time from the beginning of the ECG Q wave to the end of the S wave corresponding to ventricular depolarization (QRS) interval &gt;=140 msec and increase of &gt;=50%; the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave corresponding to electrical systole (QT) interval &gt;=500 msec; QT corrected using the Fridericia formula (QTcF) of 450 to &lt;480 msec, 480 to &lt;500 msec, and &gt;=500 msec, or an increase of 30 to &lt;60 msec or &gt;=60 msec. Due to early termination of the study, only ECG data from partial enrollment are reflected and comparisons between treatment arms should not be attempted.</description>
