    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind crossover study in female healthy volunteers to compare the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of either 1 or 6 days of dosing with two different formulations
      of Proellex for vaginal administration. Each formulation will be designated as either
      Treatment A or Treatment B. A total of 8 subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be
      randomized to receive either Treatment A or Treatment B as their first assigned treatment.
      Subjects will receive a single dose of Treatment A or daily dosing with Treatment B for 6
      days. After a 7-day washout period subjects will receive the alternative treatment. On the
      day of treatment with Treatment A and on the first and last days of treatment with Treatment
      B subjects will remain in the clinic overnight and undergo 32-hour pharmacokinetic assessment
      at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 hours after
      administration of study drug. For Treatment B study drug will be administered in the clinic
      each day after a trough blood sample has been drawn.
