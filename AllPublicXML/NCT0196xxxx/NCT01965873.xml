  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomised clinical trial is to compare beneficial and
      harmful effects of the use enteral nutrition versus a nil-by-mouth and intravenous fluid
      replacement principle of treatment in patients with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis
      (AP).

      The hypothesis:

        -  enteral nutrition is no significantly better compared with the nil-by-mouth principle
           regarding mortality, incidence of local and systemic complications, length of hospital
           stay, and intensity of the inflammatory response in patients with moderate to severe AP

        -  enteral nutrition has the same safety as nil-by-mouth principle in patients with
           moderate to severe AP

      Patients with first attack of AP irrespective of etiology will be enrolled in the study, if
      they are eligible according to the following criteria:

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  onset of symptoms consistent with AP within 72 hours before admission to the hospital

        -  an 3-fold elevation of serum amylase or serum lipase over the upper limit of normal

        -  APACHE II score 6 or more

        -  a signed informed consent

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  patients &lt; 18 years of age

        -  pregnant and breastfeeding women

    <description>In the enteral nutrition group a nasojejunal feeding tube will be placed via esophagogastroduodenoscopy and the position confirmed radiographically. Nutritional support will be started within 24 hours of enrollment, supplying daily 105 kJ (25 kcal)/kg, and 1.5 g/kg of protein based on ideal body weight. An elemental product for enteral nutrition will be infused at a rate of 25 ml/h, and increased by 10 ml/h every 6 hours, until the target rate of 100 ml/h will be achieved within 24-48 hours.</description>
