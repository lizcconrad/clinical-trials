      Background:

      Bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR) assessed by methacholine challenge test (MCT) may aid in
      the diagnosis of asthma, while negative MCT can help to exclude the diagnosis. Laboratory
      measures that predict the results of MCT are expected to reduce the number of procedures. The
      possible capacity of High sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of systemic
      inflammation, to predict negative or positive MCT in children has not been evaluated.

      Aim: to evaluate the capacity of hs-CRP to predict positive or negative MCT in school aged
      children and to compare it with markers of airway inflammation: Fractional exhaled Nitric
      Oxide (FeNO) and markers of allergic sensitization (IgE and peripheral blood eosinophils).

      Design: Prospective study evaluating these parameters in patients with positive and negative
      MCT.

      Participant selection: The study population included subjects (age range 6 to 18 years)
      referred for Methacholine Challenge Test (MCT)

      Sample size: 130 participants in the two groups. Intervention: Each subject will undergo
      evaluation including a respiratory questionnaire, methacholine challenge test with
      determination of PC20(the provocative concentration that reduced FEV1 by 20% from baseline),
      exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Venous blood will be analyzed for complete blood count +
      eosinophils, IGE levels, hs-CRP. All measurements will be evaluated in a single 3 hour visit,
      with no follow up study visits.

      Primary end point: hs-CRP levels as add on tool to predict negative or positive MCT in
      children Secondary outcome parameters: All other parameters are the secondary end points.
