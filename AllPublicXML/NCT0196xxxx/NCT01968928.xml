  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder urothelial carcinoma (UC) is a common malignancy and the incidence is increasing by
      years in Taiwan. Chemoresistance was inevitable in treatment of metastatic disease and lead
      to the ominous outcomes. To develop novel therapeutic strategies to overcome chemoresistance
      is imperative. Cancer cells uptake glucose at higher rates than normal tissue but use most of
      glucose for glycolysis even under normoxia condition, which is known as the Warburg effect.
      Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the last step in the process of glycolysis, and one of it
      isoform--PKM2 has been reported to be associated with tumor progression and some specific
      tissues and promotes the Warburg effect in cancer cells.

      Regulation of PKM2 can be a novel target of cancer therapy. Meanwhile, PKM2 may play a
      critical role in the development of drug resistance and can be a promising target to overcome
      drug resistance.

      In this study, our specific aims are as follows:

        1. To prove the differentia expression levels of PKM2 in UC cells and drug-resistant UC
           cells, as well as in human UC tissues and drug-resistant UC tissues.

        2. To examine the effect of PKM2 regulations（PKM2 siRNA and shikonin）on invasiveness and
           metastatic ability of UC cells and clarify the role of PKM2 in human UC cells.

        3. To investigate the combinatory effect of PKM2 regulations（PKM2 siRNA and shikonin）and
           currently used chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin，gemcitabine ,doxorubicin). Do PKM2
           regulations enhance the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy and overcome the
           chemoresistance？

        4. To further prove the in vitro findings in the nude mice xenograft model。

      Tissue samples of tumors as well as normal-appearing mucosa collected in the tissue bank are
      to be used to examine the cellular and molecular events involved. Comparisons will be made to
      differentiate cellular changes between tumors and the normal counterparts.
