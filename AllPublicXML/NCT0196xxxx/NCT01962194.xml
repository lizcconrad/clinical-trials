    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the emotional and cognitive areas of the Subthalamic
      Nucleus (STN) have distinct electrophysiological properties and that specific stimulation of
      these areas can influence the mental and the emotional state. Parkinson's disease (PD; n=5)
      and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n=5) patients that are candidates for treatment with
      Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) will be recruited over a period of two
      years. The patients will be enrolled in a prospective, open label, clinical trial and will be
      followed for one year. No randomization or blinding will be used in this study.

    <description>In this study we will use implantable Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) system with local field potential sensing capability. The Device is the Medtronic, Inc DBS Implantable System, &quot;Activa PC+S&quot;, which has therapy equivalent to &quot;Activa PC&quot;, and has a new sensing programmer.</description>

          1. Patients with PD who meet accepted criteria for DBS surgery:

             i. advanced idiopathic PD ii. long-term levodopa use that leads to decreased efficacy
             and increased incidence of adverse effects iii. normal cognitive function or
             mild-moderate cognitive decline (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) &gt; 75 and
             the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) &gt; 10.

          2. Age 40-75 years
