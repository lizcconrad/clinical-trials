    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients exhibit many glucose homeostasis abnormalities in different
      tissues and organs. Among the more important defects are disturbed hepatic glucose metabolism
      and defective pancreatic β-cell function. Hexokinase IV, commonly known as glucokinase, is
      the predominant hexokinase expressed in the liver, the pancreatic β-cells (where it functions
      as the glucose sensor for insulin secretion) and in glucose-sensory cells in the hypothalamus
      and gut.

      The glucokinase gene contains two distinct promoters. The downstream one is active only in
      hepatocytes and the upstream promoter is active only in extrahepatic glucose sensory-cells.
      Alternative promoters enable differential regulation of gene transcription in liver and
      extrahepatic sites. In pancreatic β-cells, glucokinase expression at the mRNA level is
      largely constitutive, whereas in the liver it undergoes large adaptive changes in response to
      nutritional states, enabling larger changes in glucokinase activity than would otherwise be
      possible by post-transcriptional regulation alone.

      Most of the MODY-2 patients were found to have glucokinase mutations located in areas that
      are common to the liver and pancreas. The diabetes in these patients is related both to
      defect in insulin secretion and abnormal hepatic glucose metabolism. Point mutation in the
      pancreatic specific promoter was recently described as a cause for impaired fasting glucose
      [Diabetes 58:1929-1935, 2009]. The investigator have recently identified a MODY-2 family with
      a genetic defect that is located in the pancreatic promoter, sparing the liver promoter. This
      family demonstrates that abnormal insulin secretion alone (perhaps together with other
      extrahepatic glucose sensors) is enough to cause diabetes.

      In this study, the investigators would like to use an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technique in order to elucidate the relative roll of the
      hepatic glucokinase in normal glucose homeostasis. This issue is complicated by the fact that
      in addition to glucokinase, hexokinase isoenzymes I, II and III are also expressed at very
      low levels in hepatocytes. They are an important back-up mechanism when glucokinase activity
      is compromised, as in liver cirrhosis or murine models with liver-specific glucokinase
      knock-down. However, impaired hepatic glycogen synthesis was demonstrated in MODY-2 subjects
      (JCI 1996:98:1755). By comparing members of the investigators MODY-2 family with members of
      other MODY-2 families and normal controls the investigators hope to shade some light on this
      question.
