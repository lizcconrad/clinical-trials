      The purpose of this study is to find the safe dose of nab-paclitaxel in children with solid
      tumors, and to see if it works to treat these solid tumors in children and young adults (in
      phase 1 ≤ 18 years old and in phase 2 ≤ 24 years old). After the final dose has been chosen,
      patients will be enrolled according to the specific solid tumor type, (neuroblastoma,
      rhabdomyosarcoma, or Ewing's sarcoma), to see how nab-paclitaxel works in treating these
      tumors.

    <textblock>
      ABI-007-PST-001 is a Phase 1 / 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study to assess the
      safety , tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of weekly nab-paclitaxel in pediatric
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding brain tumors). The Phase 1
      portion of the study, with a dose escalation design, ended and the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) was determined as 240 mg/m2 IV in patients weighing &gt; 10 kg and 11.5 mg/kg in patients
      weighing ≤ 10 kg on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle . The Phase 2 portion of the study
      will enroll additional patients at the RP2D into one of three solid tumor groups
      [Neuroblastomas, Rhabdomyosarcomas, Ewing's Sarcomas]. Both phases of the study are
      open-label and conducted at multiple centers.

      The Phase 2 is using a Simon two-stage design to monitor patient enrollment for each group
      separately. The Rhabdomyosarcoma group did not reach the expected number of two responders
      out of fourteen efficacy eligible patients. Consequently, this group is stopped.

                  ongoing or active infection requiring antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral
                  therapy, symptomatic heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
                  illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

              13. The patient has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or
                  psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from participating in the

              14. The patient has any condition, including the presence of laboratory
                  abnormalities, that places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to
