  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of different ways of taking erlotinib. The
      investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, combination daily low dose and
      twice weekly high dose erlotinib has on the patient and lung cancer. The investigators are
      also seeing whether different schedules of erlotinib are better at treating lung cancer that
      has spread to the central nervous system.

      CNS expansion phase:

      The pulse continuous regimen will be then assess in patients with EGFR mutant lung cancers
      and CNS involvement. An additional expansion cohort (A) will enroll 19 patients with newly
      diagnosed EGFR mutant lung cancer with CNS involvement at diagnosis. The patients in the
      expansion cohorts will undergo the same treatment plan as the patients in the dose expansion
      cohort. A patient in the expansion cohorts will not be replaced if he/she does not finish the
      first 28 day (cycle 1) treatment period.

    <description>This protocol is a phase 1, single arm, open label study of combination daily low dose erlotinib plus twice weekly high dose erlotinib in patients with EGFR-Mutant lung cancer who have not yet received erlotinib or gefitinib. Six dose levels are planned for escalation, with the pulse dose erlotinib increasing.

    <description>Cycle 1, week 1 (D1-D7) will consist of pulse dose erlotinib on D1 &amp; D2 without daily low dose erlotinib on D3-7. For all subsequent weeks, patients will take high dose erlotinib on D1 &amp; D2, &amp; will receive erlotinib 50 mg oral daily x 5 days on days 3-7. On days 1 &amp; 2, patients will take one of the following doses of erlotinib, depending on the dose cohort they are enrolled in: Dose level 1 600 mg oral daily on D1, D2 Dose level 2 750 mg oral daily on D1, D2 Dose level 3 900 mg oral daily on D1, D2 Dose level 4 1050 mg oral daily on D1, D2. An additional Dose -1 (pulse dose erlotinib on D1, D2 with 25 mg oral daily x 5 days in D3-D7) will be reserved, in the unlikely situation that Dose 1 is proved too toxic. If Dose -1 is tolerated well (600mg oral daily D1, D2 &amp; 25mg oral daily D3-D7), pulse dose escalation can continue as described above, with erlotinib at the daily low dose of 25 mg oral on D3-D7.</description>
