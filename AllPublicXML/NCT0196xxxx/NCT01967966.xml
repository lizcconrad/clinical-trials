  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-arm, open-label, non-randomized study will investigate the absolute bioavailability,
      pharmacokinetics, mass balance, and routes of elimination of GDC-0032 as well as its safety
      in healthy volunteers. Patients will receive either a single oral dose of GDC-0032 followed
      by a 14C-labeled IV dose of GDC-0032 or a single oral dose of 14C-labelled GDC-0032.
