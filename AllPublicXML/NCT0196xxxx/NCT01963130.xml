    <textblock>
      This study investigated how vildagliptin (a di-peptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor) affects portal
      vein pressure and hepatosteatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group 1 used metformin (1000 mg bid) and gliclazide (60 mg qd); Group 2 used the same amounts
      of metformin and gliclazide, with the addition of vildagliptin (50 mg bid). The patients were
      prospectively assigned to each of these two groups for the purpose of this study. Using
      Doppler ultrasound, all cases were measured for portal vein flow velocity, portal vein flow
      and portal vein diameter. Degree of hepatosteatosis was also recorded.

    <description>This study investigated how vildagliptin (a di-peptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor) affects portal vein pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Portal vein flow velocity, portal vein flow, and portal vein diameter of all cases were measured by Doppler ultrasound in both groups.</description>

    <time_frame>followed for at least 3 months (mean 7.8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were examined in the left decubitus position with a Logiq 9 Review (GE, Milwaukee, WI, USA) ultrasound device and a 3.5-mHz convex transducer probe was used. Gray scale and color Doppler features were used. All segments of the liver were examined and the presence and degree of hepatosteatosis was recorded</description>
