      The purpose of this study is to investigate if rTMS may have a positive impact on pain
      thresholds and cortical excitability in subjects with chronic musculoskeletal diseases of
      complex cranio-cervical-mandibular with myofascial component.

      About 30% of the world population suffers from pain. These data demonstrate the great need
      for research focusing on findings that contribute to the development of more
      effectivetreatments for patients with chronic pain syndromesThe chronic pain can occur by
      various means, either physical or psychological injuries. Above all, whatever its history,
      its installation is due to mechanisms of neuroplasticity, in this case non-functional, called
      maladaptive plasticity. This process and the symptoms associated with chronic pain cause the
      treatment to be a challenge for health professionals. To obtain a positive result, it is
      necessary to modulate all aspects involved in the processing of pain, including functional
      retraining.

      This study is a randomized, blinded, parallel medical trial, placebo-sham- controlled and
      will be carried out int the Clinical Research Outpatient Clinic of the Hospital de Clínicas
      de Porto Alegre (HCPA), with females, aged 19 to 65 years, who are limited in their ability
      to perform active and routine activities due to MPS in the previous 3 months. We will test
      the hypothesis that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) would be more
      effective than a placebo-sham for the treatment of chronic MPS by pain score, cortical
      excitability parameters, function of cortical-spinal modulatory system (CSMS), sleep quality
      and serum BDNF.The participants will be randomized into the placebo-sham or rTMS treatment
      groups for 10 consecutive sessions, at 10 Hz frequency. To assessment will be used the visual
      analogue scale (VAS), Brazilian Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen (B-PCP:S), quantitative
      sensory testing (QST), TMS parameters, (motor-evoked potential (MEP), intracortical
      facilitation (ICF) ) and serum BDNF.

      Through, these data will prompt us to investigate whether rTMS can be used as a therapeutic
      option in short and long term in MPS. In this context, we will test the hypothesis that rTMS
      would be more effective than a placebo-sham for the treatment of chronic MPS that determined
      some disability. We also will teste whether rTMS would change induced changes in both
      electrophysiological markers of LTP-like phenomena and in the levels of BDNF. Additionally,
      we will assess whether the treatment induce changes on the cortical-spinal modulatory system,
      as well if this effect would be associated with the inhibition or facilitation. Finally, we
      will test whether rTMS would be more effective than a placebo-sham in improving sleep
      quality.

    <description>The primary outcome will be pain, as assessed by the pain score diaries [global pain in the last 24 hours, and the score on Brazilian Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen (B-PCP:S) the amount of analgesics used weekly throughout the treatment period, the effect of treatment on modulates corticospinal excitability assessed by evoked pain by Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) during Conditional Pain Modulation (CPM) and the level of BDNF.</description>

    <description>The resting motor threshold (RMT) will be determined by obtaining five MEP with peak-to-peak amplitude of 50 µV out of ten consecutive trials. Next, ten MEP will be recorded with an intensity set to 130% of the individual RMT. Moreover, CSP will be performed during muscle activity measured by a dynamometer to be approximately 20% of maximal force. Accordingly, ten CSP will be recorded using an intensity of 130% of the RMT. SICI using an interstimulus interval of 2 ms was also assessed. The first conditioning stimulus will be set at 80% of the RMT, whereas the second test stimulus will be set at 100% of the individual MEP intensity. ICF will be assessed with an interstimulus interval of 12 ms.</description>
