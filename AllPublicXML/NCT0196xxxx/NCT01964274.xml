  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, multicenter observational study the investigators capture the
      perioperative course of peripheral cholinesterase activity. The focus is the perioperative
      inflammation causing postoperative delirium. Therefore we measure the activity of
      Acetylcholine-Esterase and Butyrylcholine-Esterase in whole blood of adults in the
      perioperative context. Early postoperative delirium will be detected by Nu-DESC in the
      Recovery Room or the Postanaesthesia-Care-Unit. The course of the peripheral cholinesterase
      activity will be compared with the incidence of postoperative delirium and other clinical
      dysfunctions.

      We follow up the patients for up to five years regarding Delirum, comorbidities and mortality
      data.
