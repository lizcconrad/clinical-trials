      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utilization of health resources in a testing
      based strategy versus an empiric dose escalation strategy to manage Crohn's disease and
      Ulcerative Colitis in subjects with loss of response to infliximab or adalimumab.

          -  Current infliximab therapy (naive to adalimumab) or current adalimumab therapy (naive
             to infliximab ).

          -  A minimum of 13 weeks of infliximab or adalimumab treatment prior to visit 1 at the
             following dose:

          -  Stable dose of azathioprine, 6 mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and/or 5-aminosalicylates
             in the 4 weeks prior to visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to the use of either infliximab or adalimumab.

          -  Current infliximab treatment but not naive to adalimumab or
