  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the age-adjusted telomere length in lung cancer patients
      before chemotherapy may be correlated to comorbidity status and predict outcome. The change
      of telomere length shortening after chemotherapy may relate to treatment side effect and
      treatment response.

    <textblock>
      Except chemotherapy, telomere shortening were also related to a variety of cellular stress,
      including hydrogen peroxide, UV, and x-irradiation, transforming growth factor-beta,
      overexpression of oncogenes such as Ha-Ras. The cellular stress induced telomere shortening
      and/or telomere dysfunction and promote accelerated senescence in normal and malignant cells.
      Oxidative stress, which presented in several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as
      atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive airway disease, was also
      found to be correlated with telomere shortening.

    <description>The clinical data, including age, gender, clinical presentation, performance status, disease stage at diagnosis, initial treatment modality, progression-free survival of initial treatment, and survival duration will be recorded. Blood sample collection, quality of life, and cognitive function assessment will be performed before chemotherapy, one and four weeks after initial chemotherapy for telomere length measurement. Telomere length is measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction(qPCR). Patients' characteristics are compared with chi-square test. Progression-free survival and survival time are analyzed by Kaplan-Meier with log rank test.</description>

        Patients who are newly diagnosed as lung cancer and prepared for scheduled chemotherapy in
        National Taiwan University Hospital will be enrolled for screening. The diagnosis is based
        on pathology via surgical specimen, or biopsy; or cytology via lung, lymph node aspiration
        or effusion study.
