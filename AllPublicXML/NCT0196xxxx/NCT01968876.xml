    <textblock>
      This research will act as a pilot study that will be conducted to determine the effectiveness
      of a smartphone medication adherence application on adherence to oral hypertensive, diabetic,
      and dyslipidemic medications using a prospective randomized design. Subjects will be
      recruited from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Internal Medicine
      Clinic North, and the study data will be collected using only subject self-reports and
      subject pharmacy records.

    <intervention_name>Medication Adherence Smartphone App</intervention_name>
    <description>MyMedSchedule is a consumer-grade smartphone application currently available on various marketplaces of the Android and iOS platforms that acts as a portal to the free service MyMedSchedule.com website. It can interface with the MedActionPlan discharge planning tool for providers by automatically populating fields, allowing medication lists to be pushed to a subject's MyMedSchedule account, allowing the input of complex medication regimens, and aiding in medication reconciliation. A MyMedSchedule account can be setup with the patient's name, date of birth, allergies, emergency contact, healthcare providers, insurance plan information, and complete medication list. Medication dose and refill reminders can be set and sent through short message service (SMS) text message or e-mail. SMS text message reminders will be used for this study.</description>
