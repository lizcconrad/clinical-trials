  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to look at the effectiveness of a combination of cognitive remediation and
      social cognition training to improve cognition and functioning when compared to cognitive
      remediation alone. The target population will be those who are experiencing their first
      episode of psychosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A first episode of psychosis is defined as the first experience of positive symptoms, such as
      hallucinations and delusions, and the behaviour that accompanies it. This is associated with
      problems in many areas of cognitionÍ¾ the ability to acquire knowledge and understanding.
      These cognitive symptoms have been found to have a large impact on daily functioning (e.g.
      accessing education or employment and maintaining relationships) and cannot effectively be
      treated with medication. Cognitive remediation (CR) is a therapy that aims to improve
      cognition and, through generalisation of this, improve daily functioning and quality of life.
      Although it is an area of deficit, social cognition, the ability to perceive and understand
      emotional states, is often not targeted in cognitive remediation. However, interventions
      which have focused on providing social cognition training (SCT) alongside CR have shown large
      improvements in daily functioning.

      This study aims to look at the effectiveness of a combination of CR and SCT to improve
      cognition and functioning when compared to CR alone. The target population will be those who
      are experiencing their first episode of psychosis. Participants will be recruited from an
      Early Intervention in Psychosis service which is an NHS service set up to provide rapid
      treatment for those experiencing psychosis.

      Participants will take part in a ten week CR or CR+SCT intervention which will consist of
      spending 90 minutes a week in a small group setting working through a series of computer
      games which aim to improve cognition. Interviews and questionnaires regarding daily
      functioning, cognition, quality of life and symptoms will be used before and after the
      intervention. Participants will be asked to attend follow-up interviews 6 months after the
      intervention has ended to complete the measures again to see if any beneficial effects have
      lasted.

    <description>Additional computerised neuropsychological tests from the CANTAB schizophrenia battery will be used. These are the rapid visual information processing task (RVP), the spatial working memory task (SWM), the paired associates learning task (PAL), one touch stockings of Cambridge task (OTS) and the intra-extra dimensional set shift task (IED).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Specific levels of functioning scale (SLOF)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>SLOF is an observer-rated set of 6 domains of functioning where ratings are made on 5-point Likert scales based on how often a particular behaviour occurs or how much help is required to perform certain tasks. The 6 domains are: physical functioning, personal care skills, interpersonal relationships, social acceptability, activities and work skills, the final four of which will be used in this study. This will be completed with the participant's primary care team and verified with the participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>An additional measure of functioning, the PSP will be added on to the end of the SLOF. The PSP addresses 4 domains: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviours. It is scored on a 1-100 scale. This is a validated and reliable measure of functioning with high test-retest reliability. It will be completed by a member of the participant's care team.</description>
