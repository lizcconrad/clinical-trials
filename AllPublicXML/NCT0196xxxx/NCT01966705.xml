  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background

      Severe health anxiety, Somatic symptom disorder or Illness anxiety disorder according to the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5), is associated with
      considerable personal distress, functional disability and societal costs. Several studies
      have demonstrated the efficacy of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for severe health anxiety,
      both on anxiety itself and on secondary symptom measures (for example of depression). One
      published randomized controlled trial (RCT) has examined the feasibility of delivering CBT
      for severe health anxiety via the Internet as a form of guided self help. Participants had
      contact with a therapist via an e-mail-like system throughout the treatment. This approach
      yielded results superior to a waiting-list condition, thus potentially greatly increasing the
      availability of psychological treatment. However, more studies on the effects of
      Internet-delivered CBT are warranted (NCT01673035 being one). Additionally, little is known
      about the active ingredients and mechanisms of change involved in Internet-delivered CBT. For
      example, the significance of therapist support in relation to treatment outcomes remains to
      be determined. CBT-based self-help literature, so called bibliotherapy, has shown great
      promise in the treatment of several anxiety disorders, including panic disorder and social
      anxiety disorder. Two small pilot studies have indicated that bibliotherapy with no or
      minimal therapist contact could be suitable for treating health anxiety.

      Aim of the study

      The aim of the present RCT is to compare therapist-guided Internet-delivered CBT (n=33),
      Internet-delivered CBT without therapist guidance (n=33), CBT-based bibliotherapy without
      therapist guidance (n=33) and a waiting-list control condition (n=33) for adult participants
      with severe health anxiety.

      Participants in all treatment programs are expected to be significantly improved on measures
      of health anxiety, compared to participants allocated to the waiting-list condition.
