  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To enhance understanding of supplemental oxygen—its utility in and adoption by patients with
      pulmonary fibrosis—by examining how patients perceive it and by determining how perceptions
      and patient-centered outcome measures change from before to after supplemental oxygen is
      prescribed.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators aim to recruit patients with PF to participate in interviews and/or a
      one-year study of supplemental oxygen (O2). In the one-year study, the investigators will
      collect data before and for one year after PF patients are prescribed daily-use supplemental
      oxygen and compare outcomes, including shortness of breath, quality of life, fatigue, cough,
      and day-to-day functioning before and after O2.

      In addition to this, the investigators will interview O2 prescribers and primary
      supporters/caregivers of PF patients prescribed daily-use O2 to understand the perceptions of
      others affected by supplemental O2.
