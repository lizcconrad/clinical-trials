      the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high-dose，pulsatile
      Erlotinib/Gefitinib in advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after failure of
      standard dose EGFR-TKIs（Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors）

      To evaluate the efficacy and safety by treating the advanced non small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) patients who have failure of standard dose EGFR-TKIs(Erlotinib or Gefitinib ) with
      high-dose, pulsatile Erlotinib(450mg every 3 days) or Gefitinib (1000mg every 4 days)

    <description>To evaluate the efficacy and safety by treating the advanced NSCLC patients who have failure of standard dose EGFR-TKIs with high-dose, pulsatile Erlotinib(600mg every 4 days) or Gefitinib (1000mg every 4 days)
Radiologically measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria:
At least one target lesion that has not previously been radiated and is measurable according to RECIST v1.1;
Acceptable radiologic procedures for disease assessment include contrast enhanced conventional or spiral computed tomography (CT), or contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Non-contrast CT scan is acceptable only for subjects who are both allergic to intravenous contrast and unable to cooperate with MRI, or MRI is not available. The following are not allowed as sole documentation of target lesions: CT component of a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT,ultrasound alone, nuclear scans (including bone or PET scans), chest X-ray or bone radiographs, and tumor markers</description>
