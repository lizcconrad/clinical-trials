    <textblock>
      In the history of TKA several different types of prosthetic designs have been evolved in
      order to optimize knee function after total knee replacement. The most common difference
      between the prosthetic designs revolves around issues concerning the preservation of the
      cruciate ligaments. The most popular prostheses have been the posterior stabilized prosthesis
      (PS) in which both cruciate ligaments are resected and the posterior cruciate retaining
      prosthesis (CR) in which only ACL is resected and PCL is preserved. Both these prosthetic
      designs have shown excellent clinical results in the literature.

      In the knee the role of the cruciate ligaments is to insure anterior/posterior stability, but
      studies have also shown, that the cruciate ligaments contain proprioceptive mechanisms which
      control joint kinematics essential for accurate knee function. One could therefore imagine
      that a prosthetic design that preserves both cruciate ligaments would be superior to
      prosthetic designs in which ACL or ACL/PCL is resected in achieving good clinical results and
      patient satisfaction.

      Only a few prosthetic designs, which preserve both cruciate ligaments, have been available to
      the market. However studies based on fluoroscopic assays and gait analysis has shown that
      this prosthetic design is superior to cruciate sacrificing designs in preserving normal knee
      kinematics during activities of daily living after TKA. Studies, in which patients have
      received two different types of prosthesis in each knee, have also shown that bi-cruciate
      retaining TKA's is preferred, when compared to more constrained prosthetic designs.

      The new Vanguard XP TKA system (Biomet®, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) is a further development of
      the Vanguard TKA system, which has shown good clinical results in earlier studies. With the
      new Vanguard XP system both cruciate ligaments are preserved. In theory this should result in
      a more natural feeling of the knee because the stability and proprioceptive signals from both
      cruciate ligaments are preserved. In order to investigate the potential benefits of this new
      prosthetic design, the clinical and radiological results of knees receiving a Vanguard XP and
      Vanguard CR prostheses are compared.

      In this study we wish to investigate:

        1. If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will influence the migration of the femur- and
           tibial components measured by Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) when compared to the
           Vanguard CR prosthesis.

        2. If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will result in increased participant knee
           function, satisfaction and quality of life when compared to the Vanguard CR prosthesis.

        3. If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will influence radiologic signs of osteolysis,
           complication rates and revision rates when compared to the Vanguard CR prosthesis.

      This project is carried out as a randomized controlled double-blinded trial, in which the
      clinical and radiological outcomes after treatment of knee osteoarthritis with insertion of
      either a Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis is compared.

      1. Objectives Primary objective The primary objective of this study is to compare stability
           and fixation by RSA of Vanguard XP to that of Vanguard CR.

      Secondary objective Secondary objective of this study is to assess the patient reported
      outcomes of Vanguard XP in comparison to Vanguard CR.

      2. Background The primary goal of Total Knee Replacement surgery in the treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis is to reduce pain and restore knee function (stability and range of motion) in
      order to increase patient mobility and quality of life.

      At Copenhagen University Hospital of Hvidovre, patients with severe osteoarthritis of the
      knee are treated with insertion of a cemented total knee prosthesis in which the anterior
      cruciate ligament is resected and the posterior cruciate ligament is retained (CR).

      In the history of TKA several different types of prosthetic designs have been evolved in
      order to optimize knee function after total knee replacement. Most differences between the
      prosthetic designs revolve around issues concerning the preservation of the cruciate
      ligaments. The most popular prostheses used have been the posterior stabilized prosthesis
      (PS) in which both cruciate ligaments are resected and the posterior cruciate retaining
      prosthesis (CR) in which only ACL is resected and PCL is preserved. Both these prosthetic
      designs have shown excellent clinical results in the literature.

      In the knee the role of the cruciate ligaments is to insure anterior/posterior stability, but
      studies have also shown, that the cruciate ligaments contain proprioceptive mechanisms which
      control joint kinematics essential for accurate knee function. One could therefore imagine
      that a prosthetic design that preserves both cruciate ligaments would be superior to
      prosthetic designs in which ACL or ACL/PCL is resected in achieving good clinical results and
      patient satisfaction.

      Only a few prosthetic designs, which preserve both cruciate ligaments, have been available to
      the market. However studies based on fluoroscopic assays and gait analysis has shown that
      this prosthetic design is superior to cruciate sacrificing designs in preserving normal knee
      kinematics during activities of daily living after TKA13-16. Studies, in which patients have
      received two different types of prosthesis in each knee, have also shown that bi-cruciate
      retaining TKA's is preferred, when compared to more constrained prosthetic designs17-19.

      The new Vanguard XP TKA system (Biomet®, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) is a further development of
      the Vanguard TKA system, which has shown good clinical results in earlier studies11-12. With
      the new Vanguard XP system both cruciate ligaments are preserved. In theory this should
      result in a more natural feeling of the knee because the stability and proprioceptive signals
      from both cruciate ligaments are preserved. In order to investigate the potential benefits of
      this new prosthetic design, the clinical and radiological results of knees receiving a
      Vanguard XP and Vanguard CR prostheses are compared.

      In this study we wish to investigate:

      1) If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will influence the migration of the femur- and
      tibial components measured by Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) when compared to the Vanguard
      CR prosthesis.

      2) If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will result in increased participant knee
      function, satisfaction and quality of life when compared to the Vanguard CR prosthesis.

      3) If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will influence radiologic signs of osteolysis,
      complication rates and revision rates when compared to the Vanguard CR prosthesis.

      3. Device description Please see separate application for premarket testing. The Vanguard XP
      (with the XP tibial tray and XP tibial bearing to be used in this study) is not yet
      CE-marked.

      4. Project design Project type This project is carried out as a randomized controlled
      double-blinded trial, in which the clinical and radiological outcomes after treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis with insertion of either a Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis are compared.

      After informed consent is obtained, participants are randomized to receive either a Vanguard
      XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis. Allocation of the patient to one of the two treatment groups is
      done in the operating room after surgical verification of both cruciate ligaments being
      intact. Non-transparent envelopes are used for the randomization process. Participants are
      unaware of which prosthesis they receive and the research coordinator handling the collected
      questionnaires postoperatively is also unaware of which prosthesis the patient has received.

      Time schedule Recruitment of participants to this project is expected to begin in October
      2013 or as soon as permission from the local Ethics Committee and the National Board of
      Health is obtained. 50 participants are to be randomized (25 participants in each study
      group). Recruitment is expected completed after a period of 1 year. Inclusion and
      randomization of approximately 5 participants per month is considered realistic regarding the
      logistical capacity for the additional necessary studies in this study. The project is
      expected to be completed 10 years after recruitment of the last participant (fall of 2024).

      Participant termination At their own will participants can choose to leave the project at any
      time. Participants can also be withdrawn from the project at any time, if this is considered
      necessary by the investigators, e.g. in the event of deep infection leading to replacement of
      the prosthesis or long-term immobilisation because of comorbidity. If a participant is
      withdrawn or rescinds their consent, a &quot;Lost to Follow-up&quot; case report form will be completed
      detailing the reason for the participant's withdrawal.

      Data recording Data relevant for this project will be registered in a data sheet. An
      individual data sheet will be kept for each recruited participant. Data will also be
      aggregated and stored electronically. The storage of data will be done according to the rules
      posted by the Danish Data Protection Agency. This project will be notified to and approved by
      the Danish Data Protection Agency before recruitment of partisipants is initiated.

      5. Participant population 50 participants with knee osteoarthritis set to receive primary
      cemented total knee prosthesis at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.

      Number of participants 50 recruited patients (25 in each group) are randomized to receive
      either Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis.

      Patients may be excluded intraoperatively, before randomization, if one or both of the
      cruciate ligaments are found to be missing or totally ruptured. We estimate that 20 % of
      enrolled patients will be excluded due to this, and therefore recruitement of 60 patients is
      needed.

      Prior to recruitement of patients for the randomized study we will conduct a pilot study
      which will include 5 patients who will all receive the Vanguard XP.

      The study's primary outcome measure is implant migration measured by RSA. If the minimally
      relevant total migration of the prosthesis measured by RSA is set to 0.2 mm1 then a total of
      18 participants must be enrolled in each study group to show a statistically significant
      difference (95 % confidence, 80 % power).

      In this study 2 x 25 participants are included. This will insure sufficient statistical power
      despite a dropout of 20%.

      The power calculation is based on reaching sufficient power when a comparison of the two
      study groups is carried out.

      Inclusion criteria • Patients with primary knee osteoarthritis set to receive a primary
      unilateral cemented total knee arthroplasty at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.

        -  Participants must be &gt;18 years of age.

        -  Participants must be able to speak and understand Danish.

        -  Participants must be able to give informed consent and be cognitively intact.

        -  Participants must be expected to be able to complete all postoperative controls.

        -  Participants must not have severe comorbidities, ASA-score ≤ 3. Exclusion criteria

        -  Terminal illness.

        -  Rheumatoid arthritis.

        -  Prior open surgery on the affected knee.

        -  Prior arthroscopic surgery with surgery on anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament
           (meniscal surgery only does not lead to exclusion).

        -  Prior high-energy trauma to the affected knee.

        -  Prior history of anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament rupture.

        -  Suspicion of anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament rupture at clinical
           examination.

        -  Documented osteoporosis with patient in active medical treatment.

        -  Comorbidity with altered pain perception (e.g. DM with neuropathy).

        -  Participants that develop deep infection in the follow-up period are excluded from the
           study.

      Regarding RSA assays

      • Participants with less than 3 Tantalum beads visible around the Femur- or Tibia component
      on RSA assays are excluded from the migration measurements. Data regarding secondary
      objectives from these subjects will be included.

      Regarding intraoperative exclusion • If the anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligaments are
      found missing or totally ruptured at direct intraoperative visualization, patients excluded
      at this point and will receive the department's standard prosthesis (Vanguard CR if posterior
      cruciate ligament is intact).

      Regarding contraception

      • Patients who receive knee prosthesis have most often reached the non-fertile age (50+). In
      the case that a fertile woman participates in the study it will be ensured that she is not
      pregnant.

      Intervention group After being allocated to either of the two groups, participants will
      receive either Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis. After discharge outpatient controls are
      carried out after 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. RSA assays are performed
      postoperatively and after 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. Patients who meet the inclusion
      criteria but do not wish to participate in the study will receive the standard treatment for
      knee osteoarthritis at our institution, which is a cemented TKA and outpatient follow-up 3
      months postoperatively.

      6. Methods The study is conducted in accordance with the CONSORT statement. The project in 5
      steps

        1. Project information and signed consent before surgery.

        2. Intraoperative assessment of the cruciate ligaments with exclusion of the patient if the
           anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligaments are found missing or totally ruptured.

        3. Surgery with insertion of either Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis. Tantalum beads
           are placed in the bone around the femur- and tibial components. Surgery is performed at
           Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.

        4. Postoperatively, participants are admitted to a dedicated fast track arthroplasty unit
           and will receive standard treatment after TKA until discharge. Discharge criteria are
           ability to walk &gt;70 m with crutches or better, ability to get in and out of bed as well
           as up from a chair, and sufficient oral pain treatment. Before discharge RSA is
           performed.

        5. 3 months and 1, 2, 5. and 10 years postoperatively participants are seen on an
           outpatient basis.

      Demographic data, surgery time and length of hospital stay are also registered.

      Surgery procedure Surgery is performed as described in the manufacturer's technical guide.
      After randomization participants will receive either a cemented Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR
      prosthesis.

      One of three senior surgeons (Henrik Husted, Kristian Otte, Anders Troelsen) dedicated to
      knee arthroplasty surgery will perform all operations with an assistant.

      Technique: A standard medial Para patellar incision is used. Femur and tibial surfaces are
      prepared using standard cutting guides. When the CR prosthesis is used ACL is resected and
      PCL is spared. When the XP prosthesis is used both ACL and PCL are spared. The XP prosthesis
      is used with a tibail tray and a bearing surface for this purpose. A minimum of six 1 mm
      Tantalum beads are placed in the distal femur and proximal tibia. A sawbones phantom study to
      detect optimal placement of beads will be performed prior to operation of the first patient.
      Femur- and tibial components are cemented to the bone. Soft tissue balancing is performed to
      ensure optimal stability and ROM. An E1-vitamin enriched polyethylene tibial liner is used.
      Resurfacing of patella is performed in all cases. Joint capsule and subcutis are closed using
      tied nuts. Skin is closed with staples. No drains are used.

      Postoperatively, participants will receive standard pain treatment and rehabilitation until
      discharge2.

      Measurements with RSA Since the 1970ies, RSA has been used to measure the migration of
      implants in relation to the surrounding bone. Peroperatively, 1 mm Tantalum beads are placed
      in the bone surrounding the prosthesis using a specialized instrument. Postoperatively,
      simultaneous radiographs from two different angles are used to visualize distances between
      the prosthesis and the Tantalum beads three-dimensionally using a special computer software
      programme (Model Based RSA)3. Then the migration of the prosthesis over time can be
      calculated. Migration of both the femur- and tibia components can then be calculated.

      Radiographs are performed at the Radiological Department, Copenhagen University Hospital
      Hvidovre. Participants are placed in the supine position and the lower leg is placed on a
      premade cushion. The x-ray tubes are placed 145 cm above the floor in a mutual angle of 44
      degrees (+/-22 degrees relative to the sagittal axis of the participant) so that the path of
      the beam from each x-ray tube passes through the knee of the participant. Standard x-ray
      films are placed in a calibration box designed to Model Based RSA. Using Model Based RSA
      software and pre-scanned models of the prosthesis, the radiographs are used to establish a
      three-dimensional coordinate presenting the relations between the prosthesis and the Tantalum
      beads. Distances between the Tantalum beads and the prosthesis can be calculated and
      subsequently used to calculate migration of the prosthesis over time.

      In order to be able to calculate migration of the prosthesis, at least three Tantalum beads
      around the femur- and tibial components should be visual on the RSA radiographs. If this is
      not achieved, the participant is excluded from the migration measurements. In order to
      address this issue at least 6 Tantalum beads are placed in the distal femur and proximal
      tibia preoperatively.

      7. Registrations All registrations are done prospectively. Primary objectives
      Migration/rotation: Migration of the prosthesis measured by RSA3. Implant-migration/rotation
      is defined as changes in distances between the prosthesis and the Tantalum beads over time.

      Participant perceived knee function: Participant perceived knee function is evaluated
      preoperatively and at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up using the validated Forgotten
      Joint Score (FJS)4 and Oxford Knee Score (OKS)5.

      Secondary objectives Health related quality of life (HRQoL): Participant perceived HRQoL is
      evaluated preoperatively and at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up using the validated
      EQ-5D Range of motion (ROM): Active and passive knee ROM is measured preoperatively and at 3
      months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up using a goniometer6.

      Periprosthetic osteolysis: Radiological signs of periprosthetic osteolysis are evaluated on
      plain radiographs at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up.

      Knee pain: Knee pain is evaluated at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up using the
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)7 in which 0 represents no pain at all and 10 represents worst
      pain imaginable.

      Satisfaction with the knee: At 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years participants are asked to
      describe their satisfaction with the knee using the VAS-scale. 0 is used when the participant
      is maximally dissatisfied with the knee.

      Expectations/fulfilment of expectations: Preoperatively participants are asked about their
      expectations to the forthcoming knee replacement. At 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up,
      participants are asked to evaluate how well the knee replacement met their expectations using
      the VAS-scale. 0 is used when expectations were not fulfilled at all and 10 is used when
      expectations were fully fulfilled.

      Surgery time: Duration from the start of the incision until staples are placed is documented.

      Length of hospital stay: Length of hospital stay defined as from the day of surgery until
      discharge is documented.

      Complications: Thrombo-embolic complications, wound healing complications, infections, nerve
      palsies and revisions are documented.

      Peroperative release: If peropertive release (medial, lateral, posterior) is performed in
      order to obtain stability, this is documented.

      8. Risks and adverse effects The risks in this study are related to: 1) Insertion of Tantalum
      beads in the bone, 2) Additional radiation in relation to the RSA-assays, and 3) The use of a
      new prosthetic design.

        1. Insertion of Tantalum beads in the bone in order to carry out RSA-assays has been done
           increasingly over the last 25 years. In the literature, no side effects have been
           reported regarding insertion of Tantalum beads when these have been used for RSA-assays.
           Tantalum is also used in sutures and staples and has proven bio-convertible and without
           tendency to corrode bone8-9.

        2. In this study RSA-assays are carried out postoperatively and at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and
           10 years follow-up. At 3 months follow-up an additional RSA-assay is performed to ensure
           the precision of the setup. This means that each participant is exposed to 5 additional
           RSA-assays. The radiation dose used at each RSA-assay is equivalent to that of
           conventional radiographs, 0.2 mSV. Each participant is therefore exposed to an
           additional radiation dose of 1.4 mSV. The background radiation in Denmark is ≈ 2-3
           mSV/year. The additional radiation that each participant is exposed to in this study is
           equivalent to 6-8 months of background radiation. Therefore we believe that the
           RSA-assays will not cause additional risks for the participants in this study10.

        3. In this study a new prosthetic design, the Vanguard XP TKA system (Biomet®, Warsaw,
           Indiana, USA), is tested. The Vanguard XP system has obtained FDA-approval in the USA
           and is the further development of the Vanguard system, which has shown good clinical
           results in earlier studies11-12. We therefore find it highly relevant to investigate the
           results of primary total knee replacement with the Vanguard XP TKA system. We do not
           believe that the use of this new prosthetic design will cause additional risks for the
           participants in this study.

           Investigators Surgery procedures, investigations and radiological assays are carried out
           by trained medical doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and radiologists associated to the
           Orthopaedic and Radiology departments at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.

           Unintended events Unintended events are defined as any unintended and unfavourable
           occurrences, symptoms or illnesses experienced by the participants in this study,
           regardless of its coherence with the study.

           Unintended events are documented continuously. Data regarding unintended events will be
           retrieved from the participant's medical records by the primary investigator. Data from
           participant medical records will not be disclosed to a third Party.

           Severe unintended events

           Severe unintended events are defined as serious unintended occurrences or side effects
           that cause:

           • Death.

           • Life threatening situations.

           • Admittance to an intensive care unit.

           • Permanent severe disabilities.

           In the case of a severe unintended event, the investigators of this study are obligated
           to assess if the event is caused by the interventions introduced in this study, e.g. the
           insertion of Tantalum beads in the bone. In this assessment, the following factors
           should be included:

             -  Coherence in time.

             -  Accordance with known consequences of the treatment or investigations.

             -  Alternative reasons for the unintended event. If the severe unintended event is
                considered caused by the interventions introduced in this study, the project will
                be terminated ahead of time.

      9. Ethics At Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, treatment of osteoarthritis with TKA is
      mastered on a super-specialist level. We find this study to be highly relevant regarding the
      potential beneficial effects of the new prosthetic design (Vanguard XP) on postoperative knee
      function and patient perceived outcome.

      The study is conducted in accordance with principals described in the Helsinki declaration.

      Participants in the study are covered by the patient insurance of Copenhagen University
      Hospital Hvidovre.

      This protocol, along with written participant information and consent declaration, is to be
      approved by the local Ethics Committee before enrolments of participants are commenced.

      The project will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov. The project will be approved by the
      Danish Data Protection Agency. It is the responsibility of the primary investigator to inform
      the local Ethics Committee if any changes are made to the protocol or if any severe adverse
      effects occur. The primary investigator stores all correspondence regarding the study.

      All participants will receive oral and written information about the study before consent. It
      is the responsibility of the primary investigator that the information to the participant is
      adequate. Participants are included when signed consent from the participant is obtained.
      Project information is then given in an undisturbed environment (in a closed examination
      room) by an authorized investigator of this study. Project information is given at the first
      outpatient consultation, when treatment with insertion of a TKA is decided. A nurse is
      present when the information is given. Participants are informed about the right to having a
      dependent present when project information is given. Participants are informed that a period
      of consideration of at least 2 weeks is an opportunity along with the right to a second
      consultation. Signed consent, however, is to be given latest at admittance before surgery.

      The oral information is in accordance with the written information and is adjusted to the
      age, educational level and social conditions of the participant. It is ensured that the
      participant has understood the content of both the oral and written information before signed
      consent is given.

      It is the responsibility of the primary investigator that the authorized investigator is
      adequetly informed about the study and academically qualified to giving the oral information.

      10. Data recordings Participants in this study are identified with an assigned allocation
      number. At the end of the study all patient related data are destroyed.

      All sensitive personal data regarding participants will be stored in accordance with
      guidelines presented by the Personal Data Act. Personal data regarding participants will be
      treated anonymously. The study will be reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency. The
      primary investigator will process all data. Participants will receive oral and written
      information concerning the handling of sensitive personal data.

      11. Statistics The STATA statistical software will be used when processing data in this
      study. Comparative statistics will be used based on the distribution of data.

      12. Financial conditions This project is financed by Dept. of Orthopaedic Surgery, Copenhagen
      University Hospital Hvidovre with finantial support from Biomet®, Warsaw, Indiana, USA.

      The investigators of this study have independently initiated the project. Besides this study,
      the primary investigator has no affiliation to Biomet®. 13. Publications The results of this
      project are expected to be published in an international medical journal. The primary
      investigator prepares the manuscript, which is approved by the remaining investigators of the
      project. The results of this study are also expected to be presented at national and
      international orthopaedic conventions. If publication is not achieved, the results of this
      study (positive, negative or inconclusive) will be presented on the homepage of our
      institution.

      Co-authorship is awarded according to the Vancouver rules. The investigators will be the
      authors in the following order:

      Morten G. Thomsen, Henrik Husted, Kristian S. Otte, Kasper Gosvig, Anders Troelsen

      Biomet will not be able to prevent publication of the results of this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with primary knee osteoarthritis set to receive a primary unilateral cemented
             total knee arthroplasty at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.

          -  Participants must be &gt;18 years of age.

          -  Participants must be able to speak and understand Danish.

          -  Participants must be able to give informed consent and be cognitively intact.

          -  Participants must be expected to be able to complete all postoperative controls.

          -  Participants must not have severe comorbidities, ASA-score ≤ 3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Terminal illness.

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  Prior open surgery on the affected knee.

          -  Prior arthroscopic surgery with surgery on anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament
             (meniscal surgery only does not lead to exclusion).

          -  Prior high-energy trauma to the affected knee.

          -  Prior history of anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament rupture.

          -  Suspicion of anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament rupture at clinical
             examination.

          -  Documented osteoporosis with patient in active medical treatment.

          -  Comorbidity with altered pain perception (e.g. DM with neuropathy).

          -  Participants that develop deep infection in the follow-up period are excluded from the
             study.

        Regarding RSA assays

        • Participants with less than 3 Tantalum beads visible around the Femur- or Tibia component
        on RSA assays are excluded from the migration measurements. Data regarding secondary
        objectives from these subjects will be included.

        Regarding intraoperative exclusion • If the anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligaments
        are found missing or totally ruptured at direct intraoperative visualization, patients
        excluded at this point and will receive the department's standard prosthesis (Vanguard CR
        if posterior cruciate ligament is intact).

        Regarding contraception

        • Patients who receive knee prosthesis have most often reached the non-fertile age (50+).
        In the case that a fertile woman participates in the study it will be ensured that she is
        not pregnant.
