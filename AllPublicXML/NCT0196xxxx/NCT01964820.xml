  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder affects over 120 million people worldwide. Only 50% of Americans
      with depression receive adequate treatment, and one-third of those receiving treatment do not
      benefit. In this pilot project investigators will bring together two approaches that have the
      promise to reach large numbers of depression sufferers: a skills-based intervention for
      increasing positive affect and experiences in depressed individuals, delivered in an
      inexpensive self-paced mobile format. The study will make use of smartphone technology to
      improve conventional outcome measurement via in-the-moment emotion sampling and mobile
      assessment of heart rate variability, a predictor of cardiac health that may mediate some of
      the health effects of depression. The aims are: 1) Retool the existing web-based positive
      emotion intervention for use on smartphones, with innovative exercises that help participants
      bring the skills they are learning into real- life situations; 2) Measure heart rate
      variability and emotions using existing smartphone software; and 3) Perform a randomized
      pilot trial of the mobile intervention on individuals with clinical depression recruited
      online.

    <intervention_name>Positive Affect Skills Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Our intervention teaches 8 skills that research suggests lead to increased positive emotions, beginning with basic skills (recognizing and savoring positive events), and progressing to more complex ones such as goal- setting and acts of kindness. Established skills such as reappraising negative thoughts are also taught, in the context of cultivating positive emotions and coping with stress.
The skills are taught over 5 weeks, with one or more new skills introduced each week. A week consists of 1-2 days of didactic material and 5-6 days of real-life skills practice and reporting.
