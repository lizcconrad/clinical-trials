  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine are seeking participants for a
      study examining the effectiveness of vasopressin, a neuropeptide, in treating children with
      autism spectrum disorder. Difficulty with social interactions is characteristic of people
      with autism, who often have problems interpreting facial expressions or maintaining eye
      contact while talking with someone. There are currently no effective medicines available to
      treat social problems in individuals with autism. Neuropeptides, such as vasopressin and
      oxytocin, are molecules used by neurons in the brain to communicate with one another.
      Vasopressin is closely related to oxytocin, which is currently being tested as a treatment
      for autism, and has been shown to enhance social functioning in animals. Animal studies have
      shown that when the proper functioning of vasopressin is experimentally altered, animals
      develop a variety of social deficits, including impaired memory for peers and a reduced
      interest in social interaction. Researchers found that when vasopressin was administered to
      mice with a genetically induced form of autism, their social functioning improved.
      Vasopressin is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans, and
      has proved to be a successful treatment for some common pediatric conditions, including
      bedwetting. Similar to oxytocin, it also has been shown to improve social cognition and
      memory in people who do not have autism. The researchers will test the effects of vasopressin
      on social impairments in 50 boys and girls with autism, ages 6 to 12 years old. The study
      will last four weeks for each participant. Participants will receive either vasopressin or a
      placebo nasal spray. At the end of this phase of the study, those who received the placebo
      will have the option of participating in a four-week trial during which they will be given
      vasopressin. Stanford is the only site for the study. Participants do not need to live
      locally but will need to come to the Stanford University Department of Psychiatry and
      Behavioral Sciences for study visits.

             vasopressin when used concurrently); 2) demeclocycline; norepinephrine; lithium;
             heparin; alcohol (all of which may decrease the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin

             chlorisondamine, pentamine (all of which may produce a marked increase in sensitivity
             to the pressor effects of vasopressin)
