  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of children and adults
      for which there is presently no therapy. Recently, a study reported that interferon gamma
      (IFN-g) could raise frataxin protein levels in both cell lines derived from patients with
      Friedreich ataxia and in a mouse model with Friedreich ataxia. The present study will test
      whether IFN-g is safe, tolerated and potentially efficacious in a heterogeneous cohort of
      children with FRDA.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary:

      • To assess the effect of Interferon Gamma-1b (IFN-g) on increasing frataxin expression and
      protein in children with FRDA.

      Secondary:

        -  To assess the effect of IFN-g on neurological outcomes (FARS, performance measures, and
           hearing) in subjects with FRDA.

        -  To assess the effectiveness of IFN-g on quality of life in subjects with FRDA.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of IFN-g at the currently approved dose in the
           FRDA population.

      Study Phases:

      Screening - During screening, subjects will be assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Intervention - Subjects will begin treatment at baseline visit and the dose of study
      medication will be increased to the maximum dose over four weeks. The subjects will be
      maintained at the maximum dose for 8 weeks. After 12 weeks, treatment will stop. Study
      medication will be administered via subcutaneous injections three times per week for 12
      weeks.

      Follow-up - Follow-up visits will occur at 7 and 28 days after the subject has completed the
      12 weeks of active treatment.

    <description>Assessment of the change in whole blood frataxin levels as assessed by lateral flow assay using an immunoassay for frataxin. Frataxin levels in the blood were measured at each study visit. Change in frataxin level at the end of treatment (week 12) relative to frataxin level at baseline was analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>FARS score was calculated at the beginning and conclusion of treatment (baseline and 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) is neurological rating scale specifically developed and validated for FRDA. The FARS includes assessments of stance, gait, upper and lower limb coordination, speech, proprioception and strength. In addition to the standard neurological examination, the FARS contains three quantitative performance measures and a component that assesses activities of daily living (ADL). Quantitative performance measures include the nine-hole peg test, and a timed 25-foot walk. FARS scores correlate significantly with functional disability, activities of daily living scores and disease duration. The scores from the three subscales are added to generate a total score ranging from 0 to 159, with a higher score indicating a greater level of disability.</description>

    <description>Subjects will begin by taking 10 mcg/m2 of IFN-g-1b for the first two weeks of the study. Dose will be escalated to 25 mcg/m2 of IFN-g-1b for weeks three and four of the study. Finally, the dose will be escalated to 50 mcg/m2 of IFN-g-1b for the last eight weeks of the study, which is the current dose approved by the FDA for children.
All doses will be administered via subcutaneous injection.</description>

        <title>Change in Total Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) Score</title>
        <description>The Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) is neurological rating scale specifically developed and validated for FRDA. The FARS includes assessments of stance, gait, upper and lower limb coordination, speech, proprioception and strength. In addition to the standard neurological examination, the FARS contains three quantitative performance measures and a component that assesses activities of daily living (ADL). Quantitative performance measures include the nine-hole peg test, and a timed 25-foot walk. FARS scores correlate significantly with functional disability, activities of daily living scores and disease duration. The scores from the three subscales are added to generate a total score ranging from 0 to 159, with a higher score indicating a greater level of disability.</description>
