      Stimulation of the left and right auditory cortex with daily transcranial random noise
      stimulation (tRNS) is used to modulate the neural pathways involved in chronic tinnitus.

    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the phantom auditory perception of sound in the absence of an external or
      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with
      the ability to lead a normal life. Tinnitus has been shown to be generated in the brain, as a
      result of functional reorganization of auditory neural pathways and the central auditory
      system. These changes are represented by hyper-activity and hyper-synchronicity in the
      auditory pathway. Treatment remains difficult. Non-invasive brain stimulation methods has
      shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic tinnitus with moderate effect size.
      Preliminary data presented on international conferences suggest the use of transcranial
      random noise stimulation (tRNS) over both auditory cortices as new and highly effective
      treatment. High-frequency (hf; 100-650Hz) tRNS might be highly effective in tackling
      hyper-synchronised cell assemblies. Daily Hf-tRNS (2 weeks) will be examined with regard to
      feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy in patients suffering from chronic tinnitus in an
      one-arm pilot trial.
