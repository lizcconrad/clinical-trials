      Assess the safety and efficacy of VNS paired with tones for tinnitus using a randomized,
      controlled, parallel study design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have moderate to severe tinnitus, at least one year post diagnosis, may enroll.
      All patients will be implanted and randomized to one of two groups:

        -  a group receiving VNS paired with tones and;

        -  a group that receives VNS and tones, but with different settings.

      After device use training, therapy is delivered at home by the patient for 6 weeks. Patients
      have eight baseline audiometric assessments along with two questionnaire assessments, an
      assessment after recovery before treatment starts, and tinnitus assessments every two weeks
      during therapy through the 6 week randomized portion of the study. After the randomized
      portion, all patients receive VNS paired with tones. Patients will continue to return for
      quarterly visits and tinnitus assessments through the first year after implant, regardless of
      their therapy status. Interested patients can continue to receive longer-term treatment after
      the first year. A goal of up to 30 patients enrolled and implanted across four sites is
      planned for this study.

    <time_frame>6-weeks (pre-implant to after 6-weeks of VNS)</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the change in THI score for both groups and compare between the groups. The THI is a questionnaire that asks subjects to assess their perception of their tinnitus by rating each question as a Yes (4 points), No (0 points) or Sometimes (2 points). There are 25 questions, scores are summed, so the scale ranges from 0 to 100. Scores are graded as: Grade 1 - Slight (0-16) Only heard in a quiet environment; Grade 2 - Mild (18-36) Easily masked by environmental sounds and easily forgotten with activities.; Grade 3 - Moderate (38-56) Noticed in presence of background noise, although daily activities can still be performed.; Grade 4 - Severe (58-76) Almost always heard, leads to disturbed sleep patterns and can interfere with daily activities.; Grade 5 - Catastrophic (78-100) Always heard, disturbed sleep patterns, difficulty with any activities.</description>

    <measure>Change in Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-weeks (pre-implant to after 6-weeks of VNS)</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the change in THQ score for both groups and compare between the groups. The THQ is a patient questionnaire with 27 questions with each question having a score from 1 to 100. Scoring includes three factors - Factor 1 (Social, Emotional, Behavioral), Factor 2 (Tinnitus and Hearing), Factor 3 (Outlook). Fifteen questions are included in Factor 1, 8 questions in Factor 2, and 4 questions in Factor 3. A total score is calculated by adding the scores for Factor 1 questions and multiplying by 15/27, adding the scores for Factor 2 and multiplying by 8/27, and adding the scores for Factor 3 and multiplying by 4/27. This is then summed for the total score. Total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe tinnitus.</description>

    <measure>Change in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-weeks (pre-implant to after 6-weeks of VNS)</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the change in TFI score for both groups and compare between the groups. The TFI has eight subscales that address the intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the patient has, cognitive interference, sleep disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and emotional distress. There are a total of 25 questions, with a range of 0 to 10 on each item (0 to 250) total. All valid answers are summed, divided by the number of questions which were answered, and multiplied by 10 (0-100 range). Score range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating worse tinnitus.</description>

        <description>Assess the change in THI score for both groups and compare between the groups. The THI is a questionnaire that asks subjects to assess their perception of their tinnitus by rating each question as a Yes (4 points), No (0 points) or Sometimes (2 points). There are 25 questions, scores are summed, so the scale ranges from 0 to 100. Scores are graded as: Grade 1 - Slight (0-16) Only heard in a quiet environment; Grade 2 - Mild (18-36) Easily masked by environmental sounds and easily forgotten with activities.; Grade 3 - Moderate (38-56) Noticed in presence of background noise, although daily activities can still be performed.; Grade 4 - Severe (58-76) Almost always heard, leads to disturbed sleep patterns and can interfere with daily activities.; Grade 5 - Catastrophic (78-100) Always heard, disturbed sleep patterns, difficulty with any activities.</description>

        <title>Change in Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ)</title>
        <description>Assess the change in THQ score for both groups and compare between the groups. The THQ is a patient questionnaire with 27 questions with each question having a score from 1 to 100. Scoring includes three factors - Factor 1 (Social, Emotional, Behavioral), Factor 2 (Tinnitus and Hearing), Factor 3 (Outlook). Fifteen questions are included in Factor 1, 8 questions in Factor 2, and 4 questions in Factor 3. A total score is calculated by adding the scores for Factor 1 questions and multiplying by 15/27, adding the scores for Factor 2 and multiplying by 8/27, and adding the scores for Factor 3 and multiplying by 4/27. This is then summed for the total score. Total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe tinnitus.</description>

            <description>Vagus nerve stimulation and tones are given daily over a 2.5 hour period, but not in the same way as the experimental group, and in such a way that it is believed to be ineffective but still provide both VNS and tones so that blinding is maintained.
VNS Control: This is the sham-control group; subjects in this group will receive both tones and VNS, but in a manner that is expected to be ineffective.</description>

          <title>Change in Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ)</title>
          <description>Assess the change in THQ score for both groups and compare between the groups. The THQ is a patient questionnaire with 27 questions with each question having a score from 1 to 100. Scoring includes three factors - Factor 1 (Social, Emotional, Behavioral), Factor 2 (Tinnitus and Hearing), Factor 3 (Outlook). Fifteen questions are included in Factor 1, 8 questions in Factor 2, and 4 questions in Factor 3. A total score is calculated by adding the scores for Factor 1 questions and multiplying by 15/27, adding the scores for Factor 2 and multiplying by 8/27, and adding the scores for Factor 3 and multiplying by 4/27. This is then summed for the total score. Total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe tinnitus.</description>

        <title>Change in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)</title>
        <description>Assess the change in TFI score for both groups and compare between the groups. The TFI has eight subscales that address the intrusiveness of tinnitus, the sense of control the patient has, cognitive interference, sleep disturbance, auditory issues, relaxation issues, quality of life, and emotional distress. There are a total of 25 questions, with a range of 0 to 10 on each item (0 to 250) total. All valid answers are summed, divided by the number of questions which were answered, and multiplied by 10 (0-100 range). Score range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating worse tinnitus.</description>
