      Evaluating neurobiological disorder associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) and the contribution of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in the
      adaptation of inhibitory control.

    <textblock>
      1. Assess the neurobiological aspects evidenced by the amount of brain electrical activity
           observed by the amplitude of waves through graphs in patients with ADHD, using
           quantitative electroencephalography;

        2. Study the contribution of transcranial direct current stimulation compared with sham in
           the adequacy of inhibitory control in ADHD patients through neuropsychological
           test-Go/No Go;

        3. Assessing the efficacy of tDCS in neurobiological parameters evidenced by quantitative
           EEG in patients with ADHD;

        4. Perform the Reconstruction of the Functional Brain Network of each subject based on the
           quantitative EEG data through computational and mathematical modeling;

        5. Register indicators of quality of life in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
           Disorder through the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults with ADHD (AAQoL).

    <description>Subjects will undergo to procedure similar to the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation with anode in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left cathode region supraorbicular right. They will receive a stimulus of 1mA only in initial 30 seconds and it will change the electrical charge for 0mA after this time, however the electrodes will be kept for 20 minutes as the active arm.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>This technique consists in the use of low voltage electric current to increase or reduce neuronal excitability in the area stimulated. This is a non-invasive and safe intervention having infrequent and insignificant side effects characterized by mild local discomfort, itching, tingling and/or headache of short term.</description>
