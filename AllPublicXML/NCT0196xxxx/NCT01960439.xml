      The purpose of this study of this study is to assess the responsiveness and validity of CIMS
      (Central Image Management System)-based endoscopic evaluation of UC (Ulcerative Colitis)
      clinical disease activity by measuring:

      The responsiveness central reader endoscopic EIs [(Endoscopic Indices) (MMCS (Modified Mayo
      Clinic endoscopy Subscore), UCEIS (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity) MBS
      (Modified Baron Score)] to clinical change from baseline to week 6 in a prospective trial of
      a treatment of known efficacy in UC.

      This study will evaluate the responsiveness central reader based EIs for assessing clinical
      disease activity. Endoscopic images will be obtained from recent large multicenter randomized
      clinical trial and assessed using utilizing CIMS readers using EIs (MMCS, UCEIS, MBS) and a
      VAS (visual analog scale). The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was clinical and
      endoscopic remission at week 6, with a secondary endpoint of endoscopic and clinical
      remission at week 10. For the same subjects, clinical data will be obtained including a
      modified UCDAI (Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index). Central readers are blinded to
      clinical scores.

    <description>The study population contained a broad spectrum of endoscopic disease and clinical activity. At entry to the trial patients had active disease defined by the presence of a modified UCDAI score between 4 and 10.1 Only patients who had a MMCS endoscopy subscale score according to a single central reader (n= 194 of 281 participants) were eligible for assessment in the current study.</description>
