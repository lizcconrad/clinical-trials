  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Islet transplantation is a promising treatment of type 1 diabetes in selected cases. Results
      are however hampered by a relatively low number of islets surviving the transplantation into
      the liver, which currently is the site for transplantation. In the present study we compare a
      new transplantation site (intramuscular in the arm) to the golden standard (the liver) in
      patients undergoing kidney transplantation from the same donor. In half of the intramuscular
      transplanted patients, the islets will be mixed with mesenchymal stemcells from the recipient
      to, possibly, improve the immunological aspects of the transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients age 18 to 65 years of age.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent.

          -  Mentally stable and able to comply with the procedures of the study protocol.

          -  Clinical history compatible with type 1 diabetes with onset of disease at &lt; 40 years
             of age and insulin-dependence for &gt; 5 years at the time of enrolment.

          -  Absence of stimulated C-peptide &lt;0.1 nmol/L in response to a MMTT.

          -  All subjects must have received adequate medical treatment of their diabetes under the
             guidance from an experienced diabetologist.

          -  All subjects must have renal failure and be eligible for renal transplantation
