  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to see whether the test drug in this research study,
      2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (2HPBCD), might potentially be able to improve cough in
      healthy volunteers. The investigators are initially recruiting healthy volunteers such as who
      are free from any respiratory disease and not on any concurrent medication, so there are no
      confusing effects from pre-existing respiratory symptoms or disease, nor interaction of any
      medication with the test drug.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy non−smoking participants (we have excluded smoking participants in light of
             the greater potential for cough to be present as a result of their smoking habit and
             they may be unduly sensitive to inhaled cough stimuli, such as the inhaled capsaicin
             cough challenge)

          -  Age 18−65 years

          -  No history of respiratory disease

          -  Normal baseline spirometry as predicted for age, sex and height (we have excluded
             those with abnormal spirometry, as we aim to induce cough in our otherwise healthy
             volunteer participants. Also, abnormal spirometry in the presence of no respiratory
             symptoms − may indicate an underlying lung condition that needs attention, and such
             participants will be told their result and with their consent, the information will be
             forwarded to their General Practitioner, as part of the safety and well−being of the
             research participant).

          -  No history of allergic disease i.e., a negative skin prick test(we have excluded those
             with allergic disease as they may have a heightened sensitivity to inhaled cough
             stimuli, such as the inhaled capsaicin cough challenge)

          -  Participants who are free from significant cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal,
             haematological, neurological and psychiatric disease

          -  Not taking any regular medication, other than the oral contraceptive pill (we do not
             want any interaction with other medication that the participant may be taking i.e. we
             hope to measure the cough 'tussive' response in our healthy volunteers solely as a
             result of the effect of our compound under investigation, 2HPBCD)

          -  All participants must have a minimum gap of one−month from completion of a previous
             study, before commencement in this current study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of respiratory disease (we have excluded those with respiratory disease so
             that the outcome, attenuation of the induced capsaicin cough response by intravenous
             2HPBCD, is unaffected by any respiratory disease status of the participant)

          -  History of upper respiratory tract infection or respiratory symptoms in the preceding
             six weeks (as respiratory tract infections may cause cough or highly sensitize the
             respiratory airways to inhaled cough stimuli, such as the inhaled capsaicin cough
             challenge i.e. the induced cough capsaicin challenge will not be a true reflection of
             cough in the healthy volunteer participant)

          -  Evidence of a positive pregnancy test (urine beta−human chorionic gonadotrophin level)
             for female volunteers or female participants that are pregnant or lactating or are
             likely to become pregnant during the trial. Women of childbearing potential may be
             included in the study if, in the opinion of the investigator, they are taking adequate
             contraceptive precautions

          -  Gastrointestinal symptoms such as a recent alteration in bowel habit or new bowel
             symtpoms including participants with a known or suspected history of lactose
             intolerance (as 2HPBCD when given as an oral tablet in chronic dosing, has been shown
             to sometimes cause flatulence, diarrhea, soft stools and abdominal cramps)

          -  Participants susceptible to renal impairment from their medical history (symptoms of
             renal failure, medical conditions predisposing to renal impairment such as diabetes,
             history of recurrent urinary infection either as an adult or in childhood, history of
             peripheral vascular disease/stroke/coronary heart
             disease/hypercholestrolaemia/hyperlipidaemia), or from their medical examination
             (kidney size, renal bruits, peripheral upper and lower limb arterial pulses)or from
             their urine analysis on urine 'dipstick' (glucose, protein, blood). Any positive
             finding listed above will lead to exclusion of the participant from the clinical study

          -  Participants with an abnormal urine cytology. Any positive finding in this tests will
             lead to exclusion of the participant from the clinical study

          -  Participants who are unable to give informed consent
