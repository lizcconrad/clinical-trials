  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify patients with Morquio syndrome type A (MPS IVA) and
      Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MPS VI) who may have been missed or misdiagnosed due to atypical
      clinical features, a milder course, and/or negative urine screening. We will recruit
      participants who have certain hip and/or joint problems that could potentially be caused by
      one of these two genetic conditions through a chart review process conducted at Shriners
      Hospital for Children in Greenville, SC. Diagnostic testing will be performed for each
      participant to determine if he or she is affected by one of these two conditions. Results
      will be disclosed to all participants and their legal guardians, and appropriate follow up
      will be recommended for those who are found to have abnormal results.

        We plan to recruit 75 patients who will meet chart review criteria, selected from a
        population of 250-300 patients in the Shriners Hospitals for Children--Greenville (SHC)
        database. In addition, any patients evaluated at a monthly Genetics clinic held at SHC who
        meet eligibility criteria will be offered enrollment in the study in person (with a goal of
        15). Participants of any ethnicity and both genders will be represented in this study.
        Since participants will be selected from the SHC patient database, as well as Greenwood
        Genetic Center clinics held at SHC in Greenville, SC, study participant's geographic
        location will be concentrated in the Southeastern region of the United States.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants must currently receive care in the Shriners Hospitals for
             Children system, and therefore, will be under 19 years of age.

          -  Eligible participants must have one of the following diagnoses: bilateral
             Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, bilateral hip dysplasia, multiple joint pain, unidentified
             skeletal dysplasia

          -  Eligible participants (or legal guardian) must be able and willing to sign informed
             consent/assent in English or Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with one or more or the above inclusion diagnoses who have a specific
             etiologic diagnosis will not be eligible to participate in this study.

          -  If we are unable to obtain the necessary specimens, the participant will be removed
             from the study.
