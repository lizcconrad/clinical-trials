      This is a multicenter, randomized study in subjects with heterozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia receiving highly effective statins to assess the safety, efficacy and
      tolerability of Bococizumab (PF-04950615; RN316) to lower LDL-C.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to the end of study (up to 58 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Type 1 hypersensitivity or allergic reactions were possible in response to any injected protein and included shortness of breath, urticaria, anaphylaxis and angioedema. Type 3 hypersensitivity reactions were similar to Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions but were likely to be delayed from the time of injection and included symptoms such as rash, urticaria, polyarthritis, myalgia, polysynovitis, fever and if severe then included glomerulonephritis as well. Injection site reaction is a reaction at the site of the subcutaneous injection and characterized by the symptoms of erythema, swelling, tenderness and warmth. Participants with any of the above type 1 or type 3 hypersensitivity reactions and participants with any of the above injection site reactions were reported in this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events Related to Type 1 or 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions and Injection Site Reactions</title>
        <description>Type 1 hypersensitivity or allergic reactions were possible in response to any injected protein and included shortness of breath, urticaria, anaphylaxis and angioedema. Type 3 hypersensitivity reactions were similar to Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions but were likely to be delayed from the time of injection and included symptoms such as rash, urticaria, polyarthritis, myalgia, polysynovitis, fever and if severe then included glomerulonephritis as well. Injection site reaction is a reaction at the site of the subcutaneous injection and characterized by the symptoms of erythema, swelling, tenderness and warmth. Participants with any of the above type 1 or type 3 hypersensitivity reactions and participants with any of the above injection site reactions were reported in this outcome measure.</description>
