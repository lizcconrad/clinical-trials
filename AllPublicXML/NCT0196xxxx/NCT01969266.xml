      The purpose of this study is to examine the exposure and safety of a supratherapeutic dose of
      PCI-32765 (ibrutinib) in healthy adult volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), 2-period, sequential,
      exploratory study in healthy adult men and women to determine the exposure and safety of a
      supratherapeutic dose of PCI-32765 (ibrutinib) as a capsule or solution formulation
      administered with food. Eight participants (including at least 2 women) will be enrolled and
      receive 2 treatments: PCI-32765 840 mg will be administered as capsule (Treatment A in Period
      1) and solution (Treatment B in Period 2) formulations. All participants will receive both
      treatments with a 7-day washout period between doses. A high-fat breakfast will be provided 2
      hours before dosing. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples
      will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after each dose and safety will be
      monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be approximately 46
      days.
