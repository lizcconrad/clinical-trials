    <textblock>
      Introduction: Closure of the hernia gap in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair before mesh
      reinforcement has gained increasing acceptance among surgeons despite creating a
      tension-based repair. Beneficial effects of this technique have sporadically been reported
      but no evidence is available from randomized controlled trials.

      The primary purpose is to compare early postoperative activity-related pain in patients
      undergoing ventral hernia repair with closure of the gap with patients undergoing standard
      laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (non-closure of the gap). Secondary outcomes are cosmesis
      and hernia-related quality of life (QoL) at 30-days and clinical or radiological recurrence
      and chronic pain after 2 years.

      Material and Methods: A randomized, controlled, double-blinded study is planned. Based on
      power calculation we will include 40 patients in each arm. Patients undergoing elective
      laparoscopic umbilical, epigastric, or umbilical trocar-site hernia repair at Hvidovre
      Hospital, Herlev Hospital, or Køge Hospital, who meet the inclusion criteria, are invited to
      participate.

      Conclusion: The technique with closure of the gap may induce more postoperative pain, but may
      be superior with regard to other important surgical outcomes. No studies have previously
      investigated closure of the gap in the setting of a randomised controlled trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria

          -  Elective, primary or recurrent laparoscopic umbilical or epigastric hernia repair,
             umbilical trocar-site hernia and epigastric hernia repair where laparoscopic hernia
             repair is no contraindication (i.e. previous laparotomy with anticipated severe and
             dense adhesions

          -  Hernia defect between 2-6 cm measured preoperatively by the surgeon at the out-patient
             clinic

          -  Maximum 1 defect

          -  Patients 18-80 years Patients with technical failure (where it is not possible to
             suture the defect) or patients who are reoperated due to complications remain included
             and will stay in their primary assigned randomization group in order to perform an
             intention to treat (ITT) analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Open hernia repair

          -  Poor compliance (language problems, dementia and alcohol or drug abuse etc.)

          -  Fascia defect &gt;6 cm (largest diameter, evaluated preoperatively and intra-operatively,
             thus patients are excluded if the defect is found larger intra-operatively)

          -  Emergency repair

          -  Chronic pain syndrome (chronic back pain, chronic headache, severe dysmenorrhea,
             fibromyalgia, whiplash or other conditions requiring daily opioid medication)

          -  Daily consumption of opioids (for the last 3 weeks up till the operation)

          -  If the hernia repair is secondarily to another surgical procedure

          -  If a patient withdraws his/her inclusion consent
