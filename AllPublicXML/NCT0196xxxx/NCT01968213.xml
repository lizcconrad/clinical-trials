    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled into this study will be stratified into 3 groups based on gene mutations
      identified in their tumor tissue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient response
      to maintenance treatment with rucaparib versus placebo. Response to treatment will be
      analyzed based on homologous recombination (HR) status of tumor samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate
      [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated
      with homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency (HRD). Clinical data have shown that
      ovarian cancer patients with and without evidence of a gBRCA mutation benefit from treatment
      with a PARP and that maintenance treatment with a PARP inhibitor following a response to
      platinum-based treatment increases PFS in patients with ovarian cancer. While patients with a
      BRCA mutation derived the most benefit, patients without evidence of a BRCA mutation also
      derived significant benefit.

      Patients enrolled into this study will be stratified into 3 groups based on tumor HRD status.
      The purpose of this study is to identify which of these groups of patients will most likely
      benefit from treatment with rucaparib. It is anticipated that rucaparib will provide
      therapeutic benefit and increase PFS in patients with HRD associated with a BRCA gene
      mutation or other HR gene alteration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary
             peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

             that must have been administered immediately prior to maintenance therapy in this
             trial.

          -  Received no more than 1 non-platinum chemotherapy regimen. Prior hormonal therapy will
             not be counted as a non-platinum regimen.

          -  Must have had at least a 6-month disease-free period following prior treatment with
             the penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy and achieved a response.

          -  For the last chemotherapy course prior to study entry, patients must have received a
             platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimen and have achieved a CR or PR (as defined
             by RECIST) and/or a GCIG CA-125 response.

          -  Have sufficient archival tumor tissue for analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior cancer except for non-melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer curatively
             &gt; 3 years ago, curatively treated solid tumor (&gt;5 years ago without evidence of
             recurrence), and synchronous endometrial cancer (Stage 1A) with ovarian cancer.

          -  Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor, including rucaparib. Patients who received
             prior iniparib are eligible.

          -  Untreated or symptomatic central nervous system metastases.

          -  Pre-existing duodental stent and/or any gastrointestinal disorder or defect that
             would, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with absorption of study drug.

          -  Required drainage of ascites during the final 2 cycles of their last platinum-based
             regimen and/or during the period between the last dose of chemotherapy of that regimen
             and randomization to maintenance treatment in this study.
