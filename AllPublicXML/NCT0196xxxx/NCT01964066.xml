  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For 40 years, the post-ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) pancreatitis has
      been the most frequent adverse effect of endoscopic transpapillary interventions. We sought
      to determine the efficacy of thoracic epidural analgesia for the prevention of post-ERCP
      pancreatitis.

      Between 2008 and 2013, a randomized study of the results of endoscopic treatment of 491
      patients was conducted. The first group of patients (N=247) received thoracic epidural
      analgesia (TEA) during ERCP procedures, the patients of the second group (N=244) received a
      narcotic analgesic. To detect statistically significant differences between research groups
      adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

      Preoperatively the subjects were randomly assigned (by using sealed envelopes - blind
      randomization) into two groups, 250 patients each.

      The patients of the first group had TEA applied during the ERCP procedure; other methods of
      pain relief were applied to the patients of the second (control) group.

      The first group (TEA group) of patients received the following premedication: atropine
      sulfate 0.5-1 mg, midazolan 5 mg. The puncture and catheterization of the epidural space was
      carried out according to standard procedure between thoracic vertebrae VII-VIII. Half an hour
      before performing ERCP ropivacaine 0.5% -10 ml. was injected into the epidural space.

      The second group (control group) of patients received the following premedication: atropine
      sulfate 0.5 -1 mg, midazolan 5 mg, trimeperidine 2% -1 ml.
