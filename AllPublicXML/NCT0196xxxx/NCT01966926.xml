  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scant data have been reported on the effects of weight self-monitoring during weight control.
      The purpose of this pilot project was to consider the questions: Is it possible to assign
      participants to engage in daily weight self-monitoring, and are there differential effects on
      mood of daily versus weekly weighing?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study tested the feasibility of assigning participants to daily or weekly weighing,
      monitored adherence to weighing instructions, and tracked additional behavioral and
      psychosocial indicators over a period of six months. It was hypothesized that there would be
      no differences in mood or adherence between daily versus weekly weighing conditions.
      Knowledge about the benefits of frequent self-weighing may shape public health
      recommendations for regular weighing as a weight reduction or obesity prevention strategy.

    <measure>Changes in Depression Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ratings of depressed mood, assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, were obtained at baseline, three, and six months; the comparison of depression scores between groups and over time from baseline to 3 and 6 months was considered as a secondary outcome and analyzed using repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Scores on the inventory range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater presence of depressive symptoms. Scores from 0-10 represent normal mood; 11-16 = mild mood disturbance; 17-20 = borderline clinical depression; 21-30 = moderate depression; 31-40 = severe depression; &gt; 40 = extreme depression.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ratings of anxiety, assessed by the Beck Anxiety Inventory, were assessed at baseline, three, and six months; a comparison of anxiety scores between groups and over time from baseline to 3 and 6 months was considered a secondary outcome and analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA. Possible scores on the scale range from 0-63. Scores from 0-7 indicate minimal anxiety; 8-15 = mild anxiety; 16-25 = moderate anxiety; 26-63 = severe anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Body Image</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reported body image were assessed at baseline, three, and six months using the Appearance subscale of the Multidimensional Body Image Questionnaire. The subscale has a range of 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating better body image. A comparison of body image scores between groups and over time from baseline to 3 and 6 months was considered a secondary outcome and analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Barriers to Weight Tracking</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived barriers to self-weighing were assessed at baseline, three, and six months using a scale created for this study. The scale has a range of 18 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater perceptions of barriers to self-weighing. A comparison of barriers scores between groups and over time from baseline to 3 and 6 months was considered a secondary outcome and analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Perceptions of Weight Tracking</measure>
    <time_frame>three to six months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of weight tracking (ease of remembering and understanding, usefulness, awareness, interest, reward value, satisfaction, motivational value) were assessed at three and six months using a scale created for the study. The scale has a range of 0 to 64, with higher scores indicating greater perceptions of favorability of weight tracking. A comparison of perceptions scores between groups and over time from 3 and 6 months was considered a secondary outcome and analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA.</description>

        <title>Changes in Depression Ratings</title>
        <description>Ratings of depressed mood, assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory, were obtained at baseline, three, and six months; the comparison of depression scores between groups and over time from baseline to 3 and 6 months was considered as a secondary outcome and analyzed using repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Scores on the inventory range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater presence of depressive symptoms. Scores from 0-10 represent normal mood; 11-16 = mild mood disturbance; 17-20 = borderline clinical depression; 21-30 = moderate depression; 31-40 = severe depression; &gt; 40 = extreme depression.</description>

        <description>Perceptions of weight tracking (ease of remembering and understanding, usefulness, awareness, interest, reward value, satisfaction, motivational value) were assessed at three and six months using a scale created for the study. The scale has a range of 0 to 64, with higher scores indicating greater perceptions of favorability of weight tracking. A comparison of perceptions scores between groups and over time from 3 and 6 months was considered a secondary outcome and analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA.</description>
