  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goal is to promote evidence-based patient-centered evaluation in the acute
      setting to more closely tailor testing to disease risk. To compare the use of risk
      stratification tools with usual clinical approaches to treatment selection or administration,
      we propose the following:

        1. Test if Chest Pain Choice safely improves validated patient-centered outcome measures in
           a pragmatic parallel patient randomized trial.

           Hypothesis: The intervention will significantly increase patient knowledge, engagement,
           and satisfaction with no increase in adverse events.

        2. Test if the decision aid has an effect on healthcare utilization within 30 days after
           enrollment.

      Hypothesis: The intervention will significantly reduce the rate of hospital admission, rate
      of cardiac testing, and total healthcare utilization.

    <description>The clinician will review the decision aid with the patient. The decision aid will be used as a tool to facilitate discussion and educate the patient regarding the rationale for their evaluation up to that point in the ED visit and their individual risk for a heart attack or pre-heart attack. The clinician will provide the patient with management options consistent with both the patient's values and preferences and the clinician's level of comfort.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18+ years of age (at least 18).

          2. Admitted to emergency department for chest pain.

          3. Being considered by the treating clinician for admission for cardiac testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram not known to be old as determined by the
             treating clinician in real time.

          2. Elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) above the 99th percentile reference limit.

          3. Known coronary artery disease as defined by consensus guidelines on risk
             stratification studies for ED patients with potential ACS (â‰¥ 50% stenosis on cardiac
             catheterization; prior electrocardiographic changes indicative of ischemia, e.g.,
             ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, or left bundle branch block; perfusion
             defects or wall motion abnormalities on previous exercise, pharmacological, or rest
             imaging studies; previous documentation of acute myocardial infarction; or, if no
             records are available, patient self-report of coronary artery disease).

          4. Cocaine use within the previous 72 hours by clinician history.

          5. Pregnancy.

          6. Referral to the emergency department by a personal physician for admission.

          7. Patients who indicate that a hospital different than the site hospital is his or her
             &quot;hospital of choice&quot; in the event of a return ED visit.

          8. Patients undergoing medical clearance for a detox center or any involuntary court or
             magistrate order.

          9. Homelessness, out-of-town residence or other condition known to preclude follow-up.

         10. Patients in police custody or currently incarcerated individuals.

         11. Patients who have, in their clinician's best judgment, major communication barriers
             such as visual or hearing impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability
             to give written informed consent (or use the decision aid).
