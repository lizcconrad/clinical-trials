  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platinum, fluorouracil and taxane based regimen are all acceptable in the first line
      treatment of metastatic gastric cancer. The TX and XELOX regimen are two common regimen used
      in MGC. whichever regimen is used, the average response rate is less than 50%. So a rather
      part of patients can't get benefit from the treatment. It is urgent to find out the
      predictive factors of these regimens in order to get a higher response and better survival
      outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with MGC will be treated with TX or XELOX regimen. Before treatment, 14 days after
      treatment and after progression, the blood sample will be collected. Primary tumor blocks
      will also of collected. These samples will be used to detect predictive factors of the two
      types first line therapy.
