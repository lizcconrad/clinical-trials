      This study is to compare Smart phone mobile device and/or web based application asthma action
      plan to the standard of care paper based asthma action plan within an asthma program. The
      Primary hypothesis: Health Outcome - The Breathe mobile health and web-based application
      improves asthma related quality of life more than conventional best practice

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial comparing a web-based (Smart phone
      mobile device, tablet and/or personal computer PC) asthma action plan application to best
      practice/usual care within an asthma program. A third external comparator arm will compare
      participants to all patients with asthma in Ontario using data obtained from the Ontario
      Asthma Surveillance Information System (OASIS) cohort, created from administrative data sets
      within the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Subjects will be randomly
      assigned in blocks of four, stratified by site to, in a ratio of 1:1 intervention or control
      arms. The study will enrol approximately 400 patients in total at all study sites.
