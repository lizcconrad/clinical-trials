  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the effectiveness of a preoperative pulmonary
      rehabilitation program in patients awaiting lung resection for lung cancer by Video-assisted
      thoracic surgery in order to improve exercise tolerance and quality of life. The
      investigators hypothesized that a pulmonary rehabilitation program including both endurance
      and strength training may improve exercise tolerance and quality of life measured with a
      submaximal exercise test and a quality of life questionnaire respectively.
