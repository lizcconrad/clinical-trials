  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to collect additional data on safety, performance and
      effectiveness of Phasix™ Mesh in subjects requiring primary ventral, incisional or
      first-recurrent (protocol version 1.4)/multiply-recurrent (protocol version 2.0) hernia
      repair in subjects at high risk for complications. Subjects at high risk are defined as
      having 1 or more of the following co-morbidity conditions: body mass index (BMI) between
      30-40 kg/m2, inclusive, active smokers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      diabetes, immunosuppression, coronary artery disease, chronic corticosteroid use, low
      pre-operative serum albumin, advanced age, or renal insufficiency.

    <description>Hernia recurrence rates will be assessed by physical examination at each study visit through 36 months. A recurrent hernia will be defined as any hernia identified or confirmed by the investigator, during any study follow-up visit, in approximately the same position as the hernia repaired in the study procedure. Potential hernias identified via incidental magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan will be evaluated by the operating surgeon for clinical significance and confirmation of hernia recurrence.</description>

    <measure>Surgical Site Infections</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Infections at the surgical site will be assessed by physical examination at each study visit through 24 months. If an infection is suspected, a routine culture, obtained via each site's standard protocol, should be obtained to determine cell count and type (i.e. yeast, gram positive or gram negative bacteria, or other). If genus and species of the culture are identified as part of the routine practice at the site, that information should be recorded. Classification will follow the CDC guidelines for superficial and deep surgical site infections</description>
