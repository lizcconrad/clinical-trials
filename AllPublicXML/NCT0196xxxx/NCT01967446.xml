      The Investigators hypothesize that functional status scores in elderly women undergoing
      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse will be lower at 6 weeks post-operatively but will have
      returned to baseline at 12 weeks post-operatively.

      The Investigators hypothesize that greater co-morbidity, frailty and worse functional status
      before surgery are associated with slower functional recovery, prolonged length of stay in a
      hospital or nursing care institution and greater post-operative complications following
      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of elderly women are undergoing surgical treatment for pelvic organ
      prolapse (POP). Based on US Census data1 and the estimated prevalence of pelvic organ
      prolapse in women 60 and over, an estimated 1.6 million women over 60 are currently affected
      with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). This number is expected to increase to 3.4 million by 2050.
      Prior studies show that geriatric patients have unique physiologic vulnerability, and elderly
      women undergoing surgery are at risk for worse post-operative outcomes than younger women.
      However, data from the urogynecology literature are conflicting. Some studies show an
      increased risk for complications as women age while other studies show no significant
      increased risk. Other evidence suggests that elderly women still are below their baseline
      quality-of-life status 6 weeks post-operatively. Return to baseline functional status at 6
      weeks post-operatively was not improved when these women were randomized to enhanced
      pre-operative geriatric assessment versus routine care. These studies were limited by low
      numbers of very old women and women undergoing obliterative surgery, usually recommended for
      women with higher co-morbidities and lower functional status.

      Post-operative outcomes have been traditionally measured in terms of medically documented
      complications such as infection, organ injury, cardiac and pulmonary complications. However,
      studies from other surgical specialties suggest that older subjects undergoing surgery can
      suffer from significant worsening of functional status resulting in disability, need for
      long-term care, and dependency at home. Objective markers of functional status, co-morbidity
      and frailty are potential useful predictors of post-operative complications following surgery
      in the elderly. However, there is lack of data on the functional status of elderly women
      undergoing POP surgery, as well as on factors influencing recovery from surgery. The goal of
      our study is to explore the utility of pre-operative markers of functional status,
      co-morbidities and frailty to explain post-operative morbidities in elderly women undergoing
      surgical treatment for pelvic organ prolapse.

        Women will be recruited from 3 sites in the University of Pennsylvania Health System: 1)
        the Division of Urogynecology (OB/GYN) at Hospital of University of Pennsylvania (HUP) 2)
        the Division of Urogynecology (OB/GYN) at Pennsylvania Hospital (PAH) and 3) Division of
        Urology (Surgery) at Pennsylvania Hospital (PAH). Approximately 60 women age 60 or over
        undergo surgery for POP at HUP and 45 each in Urogynecology and Urology at PAH each year.
        This yields an eligible population of more than 150 women during the 1.25-year proposed
        recruitment period. We anticipate that interest in the study will be high because the study
        is investigating post-operative recovery and no invasive testing is planned.
