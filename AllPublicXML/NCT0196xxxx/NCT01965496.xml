  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyethylene Glycol Loxenatide (PEX168) is a new human glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
      analogue that created on the basis of the Exenatide and modified by polyethylene glycol
      (PEG).

      This study aims to evaluate whether the titration mode of administration could reduce the
      incidence of adverse reactions of PEX168, also decided to observe long-term continuous
      administration of PK/PD correlation.
