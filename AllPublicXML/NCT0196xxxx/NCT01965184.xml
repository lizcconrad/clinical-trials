  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for disruptive
      behavior such as anger and aggression in children and adolescents. CBT will be compared to
      Supportive Psychotherapy (SPT) and participants of this study will be randomly assigned (like
      the flip of a coin) to receive CBT or SPT. Participants will be also asked to complete
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiological (EEG) tasks
      (recordings/images of brain activity) before and after treatment. CBT is a behavioral
      intervention that consists of 12 one-hour long, weekly sessions. During CBT children are
      taught various skills for coping with frustration and parents are taught various strategies
      for managing situations that can be anger provoking for their child. This study is conducted
      to examine whether reduction of behavioral problems including anger outbursts, irritability,
      aggression and noncompliance after CBT may be paralleled by changes in areas of the brain
      responsible for emotion regulation and social perception.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Boys and girls, 8 to 16 years of age.

          2. T-Score &gt; 65 on the parent-rated Aggressive Behavior Scale of the Child Behavior
             Checklist (CBCL).

          3. Unmedicated or on stable medication for aggression, ADHD, anxiety, or depression for
             at least 6 weeks, with no planned changes for duration of study.

          4. Children can speak English sufficiently enough to participate in CBT and study
             assessments.

          5. Children should have 1) no metal medical implants, 2) a body weight of less than 250
             lbs. and 3) no claustrophobia. [These are necessitated by the safety requirements of
             the fMRI.]

          6. Children should be able to meet fMRI data quality requirements at baseline [to enable
             pre- to post-treatment comparison.]

          7. Families can commute to the Yale Child Study Center in New Haven, CT for weekly
             visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. IQ below 85.

          2. Children across various DSM diagnoses will be eligible for participation. However,
             significant levels of psychopathology that require immediate clinical attention such
             as severe depression or psychosis will be exclusionary because it will require
             alternative treatments.

          3. Significant medical condition such as heart disease, hypertension, liver or renal
             failure, pulmonary disease, seizure disorder, brain injury based on medical history
             which can interfere with participation in the study.

          4. Concurrent psychotherapy can continue, but CBT for aggression is exclusionary.
             Subjects will be asked not to initiate any new child psychotherapy during the study.
