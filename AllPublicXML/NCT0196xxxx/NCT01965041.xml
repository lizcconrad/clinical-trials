  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult-onset vitelliform detachments associated with pattern dystrophy is a genetic disorder
      that carries visual implications that most commonly affect the macula (area in the eye near
      the retina that is essential for sharp central vision). Adult onset vitelliform detachments
      have an accumulation of material on the outer retina. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of
      this material can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result,
      people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become
      blurry or distorted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subretinal fluid is thought to play a role in the formation of vitelliform detachments, which
      are associated with progressive vision loss. Fluid in the subretinal space disrupts the
      physical apposition between photoreceptor outer segments and retinal pigment epithelial
      cells, which may in turn hinder the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments.
      Material derived from the unphagocytized outer segments may accumulate in the subretinal
      space to form vitelliform lesions, resulting in a persistent detachment. Anti-VEGF therapy in
      the form of intravitreal aflibercept injections may be useful in controlling or eliminating
      subretinal fluid, thus promoting contact between photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal
      pigment epithelium. Vitelliform detachments may resolve subsequent to the removal of
      subretinal fluid and restoration of contact-dependent mechanisms of photoreceptor outer
      segment recycling.

        least one year duration 2. Treatment naive 3. Age &gt;50 years old 4. Willing and able to
        comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures 5. Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Previous treatment of adult onset vitelliform detachment associated with pattern
             dystrophy

          2. Presence of any substantial ocular disease that may compromise or confound
             interpretation of the data

          3. Active intraocular inflammation

          4. Patients allergic to fluorescein, povidone iodine (Betadine) or aflibercept

          5. Patients on systemic anti-VEGF agents within 3 months of study enrollment
