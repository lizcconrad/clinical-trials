      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of topical 2% lidocaine in
      the therapy of symptomatic hemorrhoids. Efficacy will be determined by:

        1. the change from baseline in pain, itching, bleeding, swelling, discomfort, general
           well-being and improvement since the beginning of treatment as separate components of
           CORRECTS scale

        2. the change in overall CORRECTS values from baseline

        3. the change in degree of hemorrhoids from baseline

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded randomized clinical study into the effect of topical 2% lidocaine in
      patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids.

      Calculated sample size is 69 patients per arm, based on expected improvement of pain and
      healing by 30% at p&lt;0.05 and power goal of 95%. Taking into account a drop-out rate of 50%,
      total number of 69 patients in each arm is estimated as sufficient to close the study.

      Patients will be randomly assigned into 2 arms, arm 1 (treatment): topical 2% lidocaine and
      arm 2 (control): vaseline base. Each arm will consist of 69 patients. Patients will be
      assigned to either treatment or control arm according to the randomization table.

        -  Treatment arm - topical 2% lidocaine. Topical application of 2% lidocaine in vaseline
           base repeated two times per day,

        -  Control arm - vaseline base. Topical application of pure vaseline base twice per day.

      In addition to the aforementioned topical treatments, all patients will be given written
      instructions to perform dietary modifications and anal hygiene. All patients with bleeding
      hemorrhoids will be given Detralex 2 tablets twice per day.

      Those patients in whom a technically successful procedure has been completed will be
      considered as valuable for the efficacy evaluation. A technically successful procedure is
      defined as the completion of treatment procedures stipulated in this protocol and consists of
      correct drug dose and frequency of application, adherence to written instructions for dietary
      modification and anal hygiene and presence at follow-up visits.
