  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-arm, randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with pertuzumab versus trastuzumab in combination
      with pertuzumab and a taxane as adjuvant therapy in participants with human epidermal growth
      (HER) factor 2 (HER2)-positive primary invasive breast cancer. Following surgery and
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy, participants will receive either trastuzumab emtansine at a
      dose of 3.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and pertuzumab at a dose of 420 milligrams (mg)
      intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w) or trastuzumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg and pertuzumab at
      a dose of 420 mg IV q3w in combination with a taxane.
