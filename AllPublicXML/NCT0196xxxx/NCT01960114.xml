    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen ER 1500 mg
      (two 750 mg tablets) over 10 to 12 hours in the dental pain model following third molar
      extraction(s) and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen ER 1500 mg (two 750 mg
      tablets) in a sub-group of subjects.

    <description>Time weighted sum of pain intensity difference scores from baseline over 10 hours. Pain intensity was evaluated using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) where 0 = no pain and 10 = very severe pain. SPID 0-10 = 0.25 x (PID at 15 min + PID at 30 min + PID at 45 min + PID at 60 min + PID at 75 min + PID at 90 min) + 0.5 x (PID at 120 min) + PID at 3 h + PID at 4 h + PID at 5 h + PID at 6 h + PID at 7 h + PID at 8 h + PID at 9 h + PID at 10 h.</description>

The subject was instructed to stop the stopwatch when they first began to feel any pain relief. The first perceptible pain relief was confirmed if the subject also stopped the second stopwatch indicating meaningful pain relief.</description>
