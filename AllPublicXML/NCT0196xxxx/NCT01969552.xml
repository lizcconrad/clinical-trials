    <textblock>
      TSH plays a central role in current thyroid function testing both as a diagnostic tool and
      therapeutic target. Recent studies have suggested a more complex and hierarchical
      relationship between logTSH and FT4 over the entire functional spectrum than the widely
      assumed single log linear gradient (1-4). Our group has also shown a disjoint between
      pituitary TSH and FT3 serum levels being operative under conditions of levothyroxine
      monotherapy (5).

      The present prospective observational study aims at confirming some of these findings and
      exploring additional factors other than TSH that may be important in shaping the
      interrelation of thyroid parameters and modulating thyroidal activity in health and disease.

      To this purpose, unselected patients presenting for thyroid testing or treatment to a
      specialised unit at a teaching hospital will be prospectively studied to assess the interplay
      of FT3, FT4 and TSH under various conditions, and to evaluate various thyroidal and
      non-thyroidal influences, such as disease entity, thyroid volume, deiodinase activity,
      thyroid medication, surgery, radioiodine treatment, age, BMI, smoking on pituitary set-point
      and homeostatic equilibria.

      Study Design: Prospective observational cross-sectional monocentre study

      Eligible Patients: Adult subjects presenting for thyroid testing or treatment to the
      Department of Nuclear Medicine, Klinikum Luedenscheid, Luedenscheid, Germany.

      Inclusion criteria: All consecutively seen subjects who consent to precipitate and to fill
      out a questionnaire, which represent the full functional spectrum, as seen in a praxis
      setting.

      Exclusion criteria from analysis: Missing consent, severe illness that may be associated with
      euthyroid sick syndrome (non-thyroidal illness syndrome), pregnancy, pituitary and
      hypothalamic disorders as well as medication that may impair pituitary thyroid hormone
      feedback

      Methods: Except for a detailed questionnaire the study includes routine work-up, established
      standard procedures for diagnosis and standard care for treatment of thyroid disease Patient
      history and physical examination Detailed questionnaire on disease history and medication
      Measurement of thyroid function parameters and autoantibodies Ultrasound of thyroid gland and
      scintigraphy where required

      Statistical analysis includes group comparisons, correlations, generalised linear models with
      multiple covariates and more advanced modelling techniques of feedback control and FT3-
      FT4-TSH interrelations, as previously described (4, 5, 6).

      Outcome Measures: Group comparisons among treated patients and untreated subjects and various
      disease entities, modelling of lnTSH interactions with FT4 and FT3,influence of clinically
      relevant covariates on FT3-FT4-TSH interrelations and equilibria.

      Estimated Enrolment : approx. 1500 patients

      Estimated Duration: approx. 12 months

      Ethical approval: Ethical Committee of the University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany

      Sponsor: none

    <description>According to our previous work, the states of hypothyroidism, euthyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be regarded as differently regulated entities. The present study assesses modulators that influence pituitary thyroid feedback control and impact on the pituitary setpoint and hormonal equilibria. The measure is change in circulating levels of TSH (mU/L) per change in FT4 (nmol/L) or FT3 (pmol/L).</description>
