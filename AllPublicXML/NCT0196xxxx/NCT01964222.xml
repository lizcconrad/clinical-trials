  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will update an existing health literacy intervention (decision aid) for informed
      consent procedures and then conduct a randomized experiment implementing the health literacy
      intervention at Siteman Cancer Center and evaluate its effectiveness compared to usual care.
      Our hypothesis is that implementing the targeted, web-based decision aid (DA) in addition to
      usual care will increase knowledge about cancer clinical trials. Secondary outcomes include
      patients' ability to communicate with health care providers about trials, willingness to
      participate in trials, and enrollment rates for minority participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A previously developed and pilot tested web-based decision aid (DA) based on best practices
      in health literacy that is well received by minority participants and significantly improved
      knowledge about cancer clinical trials and decision self-efficacy will be used. This study
      will expand the reach of the DA and test it in a larger study in a different geographic
      region and center (Siteman Cancer Center). An additional benefit of conducting this work at
      Siteman Cancer Center is that Siteman and the Program for the Elimination of Cancer
      Disparities (PECaD) already institute structural changes at the system level to improve
      minority participation in trials. This study will activate and educate patients and will
      complement the system-level interventions.

      By random 1:1 assignment, 180 participants will either receive:

      *Targeted, web-based decision aid (DA) about participating in cancer clinical trials.

      or

      *Usual care/control-Access to the Siteman Cancer Center website about clinical trials.

      Outcomes from the DA group will be compared to outcomes in a usual care/control group.

    <description>A questionnaire will be administered to assess outcomes of interest immediately after showing the participant either the decision aid (DA) about clinical trials or the Siteman Cancer Center website about clinical trials. The questionnaire will include eleven knowledge items such as &quot;Only very sick patients are asked to take part in a cancer research study&quot; and &quot;Cancer research studies almost never involve the use of a placebo or sugar pill alone&quot;. Participants will indicate each item as &quot;True&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, or &quot;I don't know&quot;. An overall knowledge composite score will be created with the average percentage of items participants in each condition correctly answer. Participation in study concludes upon completion of questionnaire.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire will be administered to assess outcomes of interest immediately after showing the participant either the decision aid (DA) about clinical trials or the Siteman Cancer Center website about clinical trials. The questionnaire will include the Values Clarity Subscale to evaluate decisional conflict. The subscale includes two items from the ten-item Low Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale, each with three response categories. The combined score on the two items will be divided by 2 and multiplied by 25 to produce an overall &quot;values clarity&quot; score from 0 to 100. Higher values represent less clarity. Participation in study concludes upon completion of questionnaire.</description>

        <description>A questionnaire will be administered to assess outcomes of interest immediately after showing the participant either the decision aid (DA) about clinical trials or the Siteman Cancer Center website about clinical trials. The questionnaire will include eleven knowledge items such as &quot;Only very sick patients are asked to take part in a cancer research study&quot; and &quot;Cancer research studies almost never involve the use of a placebo or sugar pill alone&quot;. Participants will indicate each item as &quot;True&quot;, &quot;False&quot;, or &quot;I don't know&quot;. An overall knowledge composite score will be created with the average percentage of items participants in each condition correctly answer. Participation in study concludes upon completion of questionnaire.</description>

        <description>A questionnaire will be administered to assess outcomes of interest immediately after showing the participant either the decision aid (DA) about clinical trials or the Siteman Cancer Center website about clinical trials. The questionnaire will include the Values Clarity Subscale to evaluate decisional conflict. The subscale includes two items from the ten-item Low Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale, each with three response categories. The combined score on the two items will be divided by 2 and multiplied by 25 to produce an overall “values clarity” score from 0 to 100. Higher values represent less clarity.

The questionnaire will include the Values Clarity Subscale to evaluate decisional conflict. The subscale includes two items from the ten-item Low Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale, each with three response categories. The combined score on the two items will be divided by 2 and multiplied by 25 to produce an overall “values clarity” score from 0 to 100. Higher values represent less clarity. Participation in study concludes upon completion of questionnaire.</description>

The combined score on the two items will be divided by 2 and multiplied by 25 to produce an overall “uncertainty” score from 0 to 100. Higher values represent more uncertainty.
