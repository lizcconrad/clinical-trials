  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia, defined as a subjective report of difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep,
      and/or non-restorative sleep, leads to significant daytime dysfunction and increased health
      risks. A commonly held hypothesis is that insomnia is caused by a state of hyperarousal, but
      the neurobiological mechanisms of hyperarousal in insomnia are poorly understood, in part
      because of limitations in our ability to image the brain during normal human sleep with
      sufficient temporal resolution. Furthermore, the efficacy of insomnia treatment is judged by
      subjective report of the patient and demonstration of changes in sleep latency and/or sleep
      amount which are generally small in magnitude; there are currently no data to demonstrate
      that insomnia treatments correct any functional abnormalities in the sleep process that
      likely contribute to neurobehavioral abnormalities and health risks. The goals of the
      proposed study are to use high density EEG to define abnormalities in specific aspects of
      sleep in insomnia patients compared to healthy sleeping control subjects to define biomarkers
      that will both increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of insomnia as well as
      provide targets to assess treatments for insomnia.

    <description>The first study night will be a baseline sleep recording. The second night will consist of a series of awakenings (using auditory tones) and subsequent periods of falling back asleep in order to examine the cortical dynamics of hyperarousal or other dysfunction during these two critical sleep processes in insomnia.</description>
