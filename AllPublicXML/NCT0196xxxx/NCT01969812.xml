    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine patient satisfaction and tolerability of the Evie®
      slow-release insemination device for US population. Additionally, to assess cramping with the
      device and to determine pregnancy rates using the slow insemination device compared to
      standard IUI.

    <description>Preliminary studies in Europe have shown increased pregnancy rates using slow-release insemination. Evie slow-release insemination device is a device that is FDA approved. This device has been used in Europe, it has not yet been used at Carolinas Medical Center, by the Women's Institute. The technique for using this device involves loading a pump syringe with the prepared sperm, placing a balloon-secured catheter and syringe in the patient's sounded uterus, and connecting the insemination syringe to the catheter. The slow-release insemination occurs for 4 hours after the insertion of the catheter. The removal procedure, which can be performed by the patient if desired, involves deflating the catheter balloon and removing the catheter.</description>

    <description>Traditional IUI is one of the treatment modalities for infertility that allows sperm to bypass the cervix and shortens the distance to the fallopian tubes for fertilization. The pregnancy rates for IUI with clomiphene citrate for couples with relatively unexplained infertility have been found to be 7.6% (for women 21-39 years old with up to 3 cycles of IUI with clomiphene).</description>
