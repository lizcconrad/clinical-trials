    <textblock>
      Succinylcholine is commonly used for neuromuscular relaxation for short procedures such as
      rigid bronchoscopy. A alternative is the application of low dose mivacurium, reversed with
      neostigmine. The investigators compare the intubating conditions, incidence of postoperative
      myalgia (POM), patient satisfaction and the postoperative performance with respiration
      exercise device for these two muscle relaxants.

    <description>For measuring the intubation conditions the scoring system proposed for Good clinical Research Practice using the following variables is used: conditions of inserting the rigid bronchoscope, vocal cord position and coughing</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Myalgia</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of POM was measured using a four point scale:
0=no myalgia
minor pain limited to one area of the body
muscle pain or stiffness noticed spontaneously by the patient, which may have required analgesic therapy
generalized, severe or incapacitating discomfort</description>

The study arm is immobilized and a dual electrode for peripheral nerve stimulation is placed over the ulnar nerve near the wrist. Neuromuscular monitoring is performed with accelerometry. the patients receive the muscle relaxant according to the study group.</description>
