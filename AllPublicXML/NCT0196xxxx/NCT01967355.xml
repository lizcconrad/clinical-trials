      Preeclampsia is a disease which occurs in about 6-8% of all pregnancies and is the main cause
      of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The cause of preeclampsia is still not clear
      and the only therapy is preterm caesarean section. In severe preeclampsia an accumulation of
      triglyceride-rich lipoproteins occurs. Therefore, lipid apheresis is performed as
      lipid-removing therapy for treatment of preeclampsia in order to prolong pregnancy and
      provide the fetus more time for maturation. In this individual treatment patients with early
      preeclampsia (&lt;= 32 weeks of gestation) will be offered a H.E.L.P.-apheresis to postpone
      caesarean section and therefore prolong pregnancy.

    <description>A deteriorating clinical condition of the mother and the fetus necessitates a caesarean section (c.s.). However, if c.s. takes place too early lung maturation of the fetus may not be completed. Apheresis is initiated and will be continued until lung maturity is achieved and the clinical condition of the mother and the fetus improves.</description>
