  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is comparable efficacy between
      carbocisteine and a protective cough syrup from natural ingredients in children's cough due
      to upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) such as the common cold. The hypothesis is that
      protecting the throat is very useful in decreasing cough severity, both day and night,
      without needing to subdue such an important reflex as cough, and without only acting on
      mucous fluidification, especially in children where sedation and excessive fluidification is
      dangerous. The research hypothesis is that the protective (Grintuss) Syrup relieves cough
      (frequency, intensity, degree of disturbance due to nocturnal cough, and improves the quality
      of sleep of the child) as much as or more than the carbocysteine syrup usually used to treat
      children (Syr Mucolit).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cough is a life saving reflex, therefore it is important, especially in pediatrics, to calm
      cough spells without sedating the reflex. Mucolytic agents have been shown to be helpful but
      side effects have been reported and use has been prohibited under 2 years of age. Therefore,
      a completely safe and effective cough remedy has not been officially reported yet in a
      randomised trial. Looking into other mechanisms for cough management such as protection of
      irritated pharynx mucosa from post nasal drip or other irritating substances is theoretically
      sound and shows practical interesting results.

      A parallel comparison of efficacy and tolerability between such protective mechanism (acting
      through a barrier and radical scavenging action) due to natural substances (honey, plantago
      lanceolata, grindelia robusta and helichrysum italicum) and a mucolytic substance has not
      been done so far, in young children, especially in a time frame of 4 days. The intent of this
      study is to use the protective syrup versus carbocysteine in children with moderate to severe
      night and daily cough, measured with a validated parent questionnaire. The invasiveness of
      cough is followed immediately after one night administration of the study products and daily
      for four days.

      A similar effectiveness of the protective cough syrup as compared to carbocisteine is
      considered very interesting due to the mechanism of the remedy.

    <measure>Change in Night Cough Score on First Night of Treatment (From N0 to N1)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 night from before enrollment (N0) to first night after treatment (N1)</time_frame>
    <description>Night cough is most bothersome to the child and family. Cough was measured with a validated questionnaire which asks parents to rate 5 aspects of night cough: frequency, severity, bothersomeness, child sleep and parent sleep according to a 7 point Likert scale, from 0 (not at all) to 6 (extremely). Lower scores indicate a better condition. The morning after the first night of treatment (N1) the parents rated the passed night by scoring from 0-6 each of the 5 aspects of night cough. The sum of scores for all 5 aspects gives the combined night cough score. This score, ranging between 0-30, was subtracted from the sum of all aspects, also ranging between 0-30, form the basal night cough score of the night before enrollment (N0). This change is recorded as &quot;change in combined night cough score&quot; and it refers to the change from N0 to N1. Negative values of the change indicate an improvement in the condition of the patient.</description>

    <time_frame>4 nights (onset of trial Night 1 to Night 4) and 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>A validated cough questionnaire measuring 5 aspects of night cough (frequency, severity, bothersomeness, child sleep and parents' sleep) on a 7 point Likert scale was used each morning to rate the passed night. The scale rates each parameter from 0 (not at all) to 6 (extremely). Every night of the trial is rated. The morning after the last night of the study (N4) the parents rated the passed night by scoring from 0-6 each of the 5 aspects of night cough. The summed score for all aspects gives the combined night cough score. This score, ranging between 0-30, was subtracted from the sum of all aspects, also ranging between 0-30, form the basal night cough score of the night before enrollment (N0). This change is recorded as &quot;change in combined night cough score&quot; and it refers to the change from N0 to N4.

    <description>A validated cough questionnaire measuring 3 aspects of daytime cough (frequency, severity, bothersomeness) on a 7 point Likert scale was used each evening to rate the passed day, as regards these aspects. The scale rates each parameter from 0 (not at all) to 6 (extremely). Every day of the trial is rated. The last evening of the study (D4) the parents rated the passed day by scoring from 0-6 each of the 3 aspects of day cough. The summed score for all aspects gives the combined day cough score. This score, ranging between 0-18, was subtracted from the sum of all aspects, also ranging between 0-18, form the basal day cough score of the day before enrollment (D0). This change is recorded as &quot;change in combined day cough score&quot; and it refers to the change from D0 to D4. Negative values of the change indicate an improvement in the condition of the patient.</description>

        <title>Change in Night Cough Score on First Night of Treatment (From N0 to N1)</title>
        <description>Night cough is most bothersome to the child and family. Cough was measured with a validated questionnaire which asks parents to rate 5 aspects of night cough: frequency, severity, bothersomeness, child sleep and parent sleep according to a 7 point Likert scale, from 0 (not at all) to 6 (extremely). Lower scores indicate a better condition. The morning after the first night of treatment (N1) the parents rated the passed night by scoring from 0-6 each of the 5 aspects of night cough. The sum of scores for all 5 aspects gives the combined night cough score. This score, ranging between 0-30, was subtracted from the sum of all aspects, also ranging between 0-30, form the basal night cough score of the night before enrollment (N0). This change is recorded as &quot;change in combined night cough score&quot; and it refers to the change from N0 to N1. Negative values of the change indicate an improvement in the condition of the patient.</description>
