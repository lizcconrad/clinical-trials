  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle activity in the aquatic environment was investigated while performing different
      exercises by electromyography analysis, due to conflicting results in the literature in
      relation to the floor. This study evaluated and compared the electrical activity of the
      rectus femoris and biceps femoris, in aquatic method and on the floor, during flexion and
      knee extension exercises with and without load.

    <time_frame>April-October 2013</time_frame>
    <description>It is believed that there is a decrease in muscle electrical activity following the exercises without resistance in the heated water in comparison with cold water and soil due to muscle relaxation and a reduction of the viscosity of water. Considering the resistance exercises, it is believed that there is an increase in muscle electrical activity when held in cold water in comparison with heated water and soil due to the increased viscosity of water.</description>
