    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of
      ranibizumab for the treatment of macular edema due to BRVO if the re-treatment regimen is
      guided by morphological macular changes detected by OCT compared to re-treatment according to
      SmPC defined re-treatment criteria (in case of increase of CRT and concomitant decrease of
      BCVA).

      In a prospective, randomized, interventional, controlled phase IIb clinical the functional
      results of treatment with ranibizumab in patients with macular edema due to branch retinal
      vein occlusion when given according to morphological changes detected by OCT compared to
      standard re-treatment criteria according to SmPC

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrence of macular edema defined as any kind of fluid accumulation in the macula
             (microcystic changes with or without increase of central retinal thickness) detected
             by OCT in the month 1 to 6 after the last Lucentis injection without any decrease of
             BCVA measured with ETDRS charts 2. Diagnosis of BRVO with macular edema treated with
             at least three intravitreally applied injections of ranibizumab after the up-load
             phase of treatment 3. Age ≥ 18 years 4. Ability and willingness to attend all
             scheduled visits and assessments 5. For sexually active women of childbearing
             potential, use of an appropriate form of contraception (or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Macular edema due to another etiology than retinal vein occlusion (e.g. diabetic
             maculopathy, uveitis, age related macular degeneration, Irvine-Gass syndrome)

          2. Evidence upon examination of vitreoretinal interface disease (e.g., vitreomacular
             traction, epiretinal membrane), either on clinical examination or OCT, thought to be
             contributing to macular edema

          3. Use of intraocular or periocular injection of steroids in the study eye (e.g.,
             triamcinolone) prior to study entry

          4. History of cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic
             attacks in last 6 months

          5. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          6. History of allergy to humanized antibodies or any component of the ranibizumab
             formulation
