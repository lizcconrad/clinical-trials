  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary manipulation is proving to be an effective lifestyle strategy to combat the obesity
      epidemic. Increased dietary protein is one effective strategy. For example, increased whey
      protein ingestion with and without exercise training is associated with enhanced weight loss,
      body composition and subjective hunger in overweight and obese individuals. Our findings
      suggest that the effects of whey protein ingestion occur independent of a calorie-restricted
      diet and to a greater extent in individuals following a combined exercise program of
      resistance exercise, sprint intervals, stretching/yoga/pilates, and aerobic exercise training
      compared to standard resistance training.

      This study was a 16 week whey protein and exercise training intervention in middle aged
      overweight/obese adults. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups: Whey protein only consumed
      as 20 grams per serving three times per day (total 60 grams per day) (WP); Whey protein and
      resistance exercise training (WP-RT); and Whey protein and combined exercise training
      (P+RISE). All outcomes, including the primary outcome of visceral fat was measured at
      baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 17) in all study subjects.
