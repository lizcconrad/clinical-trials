    <textblock>
      This study uses an ingestion sensor and a wearable sensor (worn as a patch on the skin),
      which are new Proteus Digital Health (PDH) technologies approved by the FDA, to collect
      information about patients taking their TB medications. The wearable sensor records
      information, which is uploaded wirelessly to a mobile device and then to a secure computer.
      Together the sensors and the mobile device transmitting the information to the study computer
      are called a digital health feedback system (DHFS), which gives healthcare providers
      information about when patients have taken their TB medications. The advantage of the DHFS is
      that patients can take their medication where and when it is convenient for them, and do not
      have to wait for a nurse to directly observe them taking their medication.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if using these new technologies works as well as the
      standard method of observing in person when patients take their TB medications. This study
      will also look at the costs of using a DHFS for TB medications, what patients and healthcare
      providers think about using it, and other factors that can determine when one approach works
      better than another.

      This study has two parts. For the first part of the study (Step I), patients will have an
      initial screening visit and then, in one two-week period, they will have 4 study visits at
      the UCSD AntiViral Research Center (AVRC) and routine visits from Public Health Services
      (PHS) workers. This part of the study is designed to confirm that the DHFS is working
      correctly and is accurately collecting information about each dose of medication that
      patients take, and to understand what patients and healthcare providers think about using the
      DHFS.

      If patients are eligible for the second part of the study (Step II) and want to continue,
      that will last another 8-14 weeks with an additional 4 study visits at the AVRC. In the
      second part of the study, patients will be randomized into one of the following two groups.

      Group 1: TB treatment is monitored by continued use of the DHFS

      Group 2: TB treatment is monitored by the standard methods used by PHS (DOT)

      The second part of the study is designed to compare these two methods of observing patients
      taking their TB medications, what the relative costs of these methods are , and the
      perception by patients and/or healthcare providers of the ease of use of the novel
      technology.

      PHARMACOKINETIC (PK) SUBSTUDY

      The purpose of the PK substudy is to prospectively evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of
      isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) concentrations derived from dosing with Rifamate when
      given in native format compared to over encapsulated, ingestion sensor-enabled format.

      The UCSD substudy aims to co-enroll 12 patients with Phase 1- the two-week investigation
      period of the characteristics of use of DHFS and patient acceptability. These subjects will
      be randomized to start on either Phase 1 or on two weeks of native Rifamate followed by
      24-hour PK sampling.
