    <textblock>
      The study is designed to validate the use of speckle-tracking echocardiography to measure
      tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion as a measurement of right ventricular function
      during transesophageal echocardiography.

      1. Use of speckle-tracking echocardiography to validate tricuspid annular plane systolic
           excursion measurements with transesophageal echocardiography.

        2. This study intends to validate the use of speckle-tracking echocardiography to measure
           the distance the tricuspid annulus moves during the systolic phase. The guideline
           articles regarding right ventricular function suggest m-mode measurements from the
           transthoracic approach and the same measurements may underestimate the actual distance
           on transesophageal echocardiography. This speckle-tracking technology will allow this
           distance to be measured despite its often non-parallel motion to the ultrasound beam,
           which otherwise limits the reliability of the valve recorded.

        3. All subjects undergoing a planned surgical procedure in which the use of transesophageal
           echocardiography would be used regardless for their management.

        4. No interventions, only evaluation of the measurements obtained with transthoracic
           echocardiography compared to transesophageal echocardiography.

        5. No follow-up, study will be completed at the time of image acquisition.

        All subjects will be scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia
        and either due to subject factors or procedure factors, the use of intraoperative
        transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring will occur. These subjects will then have both
        transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiographic measurements of one variable of right
        ventricular function to validate the results from the transesophageal window.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects who are scheduled to undergo general anesthesia and concurrently will be
             managed with intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography will be included in
             potential subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who do not have adequate transesophageal and/or transthoracic imaging windows
             to allow for accurate analysis of tricuspid annular motion.
