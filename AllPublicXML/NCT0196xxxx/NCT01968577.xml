    <textblock>
      Patients with stable coronary disease when undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention may
      present periprocedural myocardial infarction defined at present as a creatine
      kinase-myocardial isoenzyme (CK-MB) elevation 3 times upper limit of normal, as a cut off for
      periprocedural myocardial infarction after PCI. Although percutaneous coronary intervention
      is associated with low rates of complications, periprocedural myocardial infarction has been
      touted as a negative factor in long-term clinical results . Several clinical, anatomical and
      technical associate to the occurrence of this event . Although randomized controlled trials
      and systematic reviews to statin pre intervention have targeted the administration of
      high-dose statin is recommended before surgery to reduce the risk of periprocedural
      myocardial infarction, there is no information on the impact of the maximum concentration
      plasma of statin at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention in stable patients on
      chronic statin use in preventing periprocedural myocardial infarction or the elevation of
      cardiac enzymes . The anti-ischemic effect of statins in percutaneous coronary intervention
      was mainly determined in statin -na√Øve patients or in patients with acute coronary syndromes
      . In this work , we studied the impact of the peak plasma concentration of statin at the time
      of percutaneous coronary intervention was studied through prospective randomized single
      center in stable patients with chronic statin divided into two groups . In the group (1)
      Experimental (n = 268 ) was administered at a dose of 40 mg rosuvastatin between one and six
      hours before surgery and group (2) control without rosuvastatin (n = 268). This range 1 to 6
      hours is the time at the peak concentration of rosuvastatin in the blood after oral
      ingestion. The primary objective was to assess the incidence of periprocedural myocardial
      infarction by creatine kinase above three times upper normal limit in hospital period and as
      a secondary objective to analyze the elevation of any amount of creatine kinase on the
      baseline.
