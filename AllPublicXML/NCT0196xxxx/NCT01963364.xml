  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some carbohydrates (complex sugars) which are found in grains, fruit and vegetables, cannot
      be digested by humans. When eaten they pass through the small bowel to the large bowel, or
      colon. Some bacteria that live in the colon are able to digest these carbohydrates, and use
      them as an energy source. This releases energy that humans can absorb, and may have other
      effects on health as well. The process also releases gases such as hydrogen and methane into
      the colon, which will eventually be released as flatulence.

      There is some evidence in animals, and humans, that changing the carbohydrate content of the
      diet may increase the numbers of bacteria in the colon that can use this energy source.
      Recent work has looked at how changes in colon bacteria and carbohydrate in the diet affect
      transit, the speed at which food and stool moves through the stomach and bowels. This
      undergraduate project will use techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging developed in
      Nottingham to investigate how a prolonged change in dietary carbohydrate might affect speed
      of transit through the bowel and gas production in the colon, and whether there is any
      evidence of a change in the level of signalling chemicals that may affect bowel function.

    <description>5 markers pills will be swallowed 24 hours before MRI scanning. Each pill will be given a score 0-9 based on the colonic segment where it is located. The weighted mean of these scores will be the geometric centre. Previous validation allows a transit time to be calculated from the geometric centre.</description>

    <description>We will measure 4 symptoms from a previously validated questionnaire on a scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild/ distinct but negligible), 2 (moderate/ annoying), 3 (severe/ disabling), and also on a Visual Analogue Scale (0-100)
Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, gas/flatulence, and diarrhoea.
We will define clinically important symptoms as a composite score of 3 or more at any time point or on any day.</description>
