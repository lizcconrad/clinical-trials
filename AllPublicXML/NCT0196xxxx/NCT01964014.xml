      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety and Immunosuppressant
      Therapy Barrier Scale (ITBS) of once daily immunosuppressant maintenance therapy in patients
      who had kidney transplantations earlier.

    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month, single-arm, multi-center, open-label, continuous cohort study. 160
      subjects who had kidney transplantations at least 3 months earlier will participate in the
      study. All enrolled subjects will discontinue the existing Tacrolimus preparations for 6
      months from enrollment and be converted to Extended Release Tacrolimus at a biologically
      equivalent dose. They will also discontinue enteric-coated mycophenolate sdium or
      mycophenolate sodium and be treated with Sirolimus and observed.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Advagraf ® (Extended Release Tacrolimus) at 6 months after immunosuppressant conversion to the once daily therapy.
