      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Udenafil 150 mg
      compared to placebo.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Udenafil. Udenafil is being tested to determine
      a safe and well-tolerated dose. This study will look at vital signs, laboratory tests and
      side effects in people who take Udenafil.

      The study will enroll approximately 84 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance) and by blocks to assure balanced groups (i.e. same number of participants) to one of
      the four treatment schemes—which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  a) Udenafil-Udenafil

        -  b) Udenafil- Placebo

        -  c) Placebo-Udenafil

        -  d) Placebo-Placebo

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet on Day 1 and one tablet on Day 3.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in Mexico. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 7 days. Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic, including 5 days
      confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 15 days after last visit to the
      clinic for a follow-up assessment.
