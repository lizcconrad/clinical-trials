  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral immunotherapy (OIT) programs for milk, egg and peanut, desensitize patients to their
      respective allergens and thereby decrease their risk of morbidity and mortality. OIT
      programs, however, are not without adverse events, particularly in highly sensitive patients.
      Recently, it has been demonstrated that the administration of baked milk (BM) products to
      IgE-CMA patients that are non-reactive to BM, can promote tolerance to unheated milk (UM).
      The goal of our research is to determine whether BM can promote desensitization even in the
      highly sensitive patient, who reacts to baked milk as well. In a second step, we hypothesize
      BM-OIT will promote desensitization to unheated milk, as well.

      Importance: The change in the risk/benefit ratio of such a program will alter the therapeutic
      approach to an IgE-CMP allergic patient.

      Probable implications to Medicine: BM-OIT will allow highly sensitive patients to tolerate
      milk products, decreasing their risk of life-threatening reactions. Furthermore, analysis of
      the immune modulation parameters that change during the treatment program, should pave the
      way for defining mechanisms underlying tolerance in CMP allergy.

      In our first aim, we will test over a four day induction (escalating) program, whether highly
      sensitive UM-reactive patients) can tolerate BM . Those successful will be randomized to a
      treated BM-OIT group (group A) and an observational control group (group B). In the second
      aim, the fraction of patients in Group A who successfully progress in BM-OIT (tolerate ≥ 360
      mg BM) over a 6 month period will be determined and compared to the fraction of patients in
      Group B who can tolerate 360mg. The results will also be compared to the progression of
      highly sensitive IgE-CMA patients on UM-OIT (Group C, reactive to ≤21 mg of UM ). In aim-3,
      the fraction of BM-OIT patients able to tolerate minimally ≥ 12.5 mg of UM or higher than
      their initially eliciting dose. will be assessed.

      Methods: Severe patients (&gt;4 years) with a positive clinical history, SPT and a positive
      DBPCFC to CMP will be first tested for their ability to tolerate BM. The treatment group will
      undergo three rounds of oral induction, each consisting of 4 days and performed every 4
      weeks. On day #1, the patient will be rapidly desensitized up to their threshold. On days
      2-3, the maximum tolerable dose and interval is determined. Day #4 mimics the home treatment.
      Home treatment will then continue until the next induction. After 6 months of treatment
      patients will be evaluated for reactivity to UM.
