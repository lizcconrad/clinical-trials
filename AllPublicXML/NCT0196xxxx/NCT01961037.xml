  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the leading cause of death and injuries in adults over age 65 both nationally and
      in West Virginia. Rurality, age, physical inactivity, and chronic conditions, such as
      arthritis, are strong risk factors for falls in this population. West Virginia has a higher
      than average fall rate, the second oldest population, the greatest proportion of inactive
      adults, and the second highest prevalence of arthritis in the US. Thus, older adults in rural
      West Virginia are at high risk for falls and in great need of public health fall prevention
      programs. The Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance (MFBB) program is a community-based,
      fall-prevention exercise program for older adults. A waiver of informed consent will be
      requested to conduct the telephone screenings to determine study eligibility. We will enroll
      up to 300 people in classes to be held at 20 churches in West Virginia. Classes will be held
      twice per week for 16 weeks and taught by certified MFBB instructors. Participants will be
      interviewed by telephone, have a brief physical function ability exam, and complete a
      questionnaire before starting the exercise class, at the end of the class, and 4 months
      later. The study is being conducted to answer the following questions: 1) What are the
      functional improvements of older adults who participate in a 16-week MFBB program; 2) What is
      the rate of falls for those adults; 3) What is the rate and severity of those fall-related
      injuries of the MFBB participants? The purpose of the study is to: 1) implement a 16-week
      intervention of MFBB with a 16-week follow-up, in older adults in churches in rural West
      Virginia; 2) describe functional and fall/injury outcomes. Ultimately, we will translate an
      efficacious and effective fall-prevention intervention into a new setting.
