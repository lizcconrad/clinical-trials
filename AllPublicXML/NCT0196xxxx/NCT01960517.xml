      This is a single centre, non-randomised, baseline controlled, prospective pilot clinical
      trial to be undertaken at Rotherham General Hospital, Rotherham, UK.

      The study will examine the safety and performance of a new urinary catheter, the Alternative
      Catheter System (ACS) (Alternative Urological Catheter Systems Ltd (AUCS), Bristol, UK) which
      has been developed to reduce the morbidity of long-term catheterisation and the acknowledged
      deficiencies of the conventional Foley urinary catheter.
