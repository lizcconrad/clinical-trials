  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of brief organ donation video
      interventions on consent for organ donation among college and university students. Our
      hypothesis is that the organ donation video interventions will be superior to lay health
      websites for increasing organ donation consent.

      This randomized controlled trial will involve 600 intervention and 600 control university
      students. Students will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms: a 5-minute video by the U.S. Department
      of Health and Human Services, a 5-minute video by the study principal investigator, or a
      health-related website by the Centers for Disease Control. After viewing the intervention,
      participants will be asked questions including whether they would like to consent to organ
      donation on their state electronic registry.
