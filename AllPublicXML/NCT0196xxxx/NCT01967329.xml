      The CANHelp Working Group Treatment Trials are part of a comprehensive research program
      carried out by the Canadian North Helicobacter pylori (CANHelp) Working Group. The treatment
      component involves a series of community-specific trials designed with community input and
      varying on the specific treatment regimens and number of treatment arms among other study
      details.

      The CANHelp Working Group is a collaborative team that links University of Alberta
      researchers with Canadian northern community leaders and health officials in a collaborative
      effort to investigate H. pylori infection with the goal of finding solutions to community
      concerns about health risks. The research program uses a community-driven research approach
      in northern communities to characterize the burden of disease from H. pylori infection and
      exchange knowledge with community members and decision makers to identify ways to reduce
      health risks from this infection.

      For the participating communities, the treatment trials aim to:

        1. Estimate the effectiveness of alternate H. pylori treatment regimens to identify optimal
           regimens for the local setting

        2. Identify factors external to the treatment regimen that influence short- and long-term
           treatment success

    <time_frame>A minimum of 10 weeks after participant has completed treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment effectiveness, defined as the probability (average risk) of elimination of H. pylori infection following treatment, measured as the proportion of trial participants with a negative post-treatment urea breath test at least 10 weeks following completion of treatment. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the denominator for this proportion is the number of trial participants assigned treatment. Using a per-protocol analysis, the denominator for this proportion is the number of trial participants who completed treatment and were tested post-treatment.
Participants are administered a urea breath test using 13C-labeled urea dissolved in a citric acid solution. We use the following test value classifications for determining the outcome:
&gt;=4.0 (Positive for H. pylori infection) Between 2.5 and 4.0 (Borderline; repeat test) Between 2.4 and -1.99 (Negative for H. pylori infection) Less than -2.0 (Uncertain test result, repeat test)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to treatment regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 1 week after treatment is completed</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to return blister packs with unused medication so skipped doses can be counted. Participants are also interviewed to obtain details about their adherence to the regimen.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time treatment is started to an expected average of 1 week after treatment is completed</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are contacted by telephone during the completion of the treatment regimen and asked if they have experienced adverse effects. Participants are also interviewed immediately after the completion of treatment and asked if they experienced adverse effects during the completion of treatment.</description>
