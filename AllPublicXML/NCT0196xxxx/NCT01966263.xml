      The objective of this study is to determine whether either a femoral nerve block (FNB) or
      local infiltration analgesia (LIA) is a better anesthetic technique to achieve optimal
      functional outcome after one year in patients receiving a total knee arthroplasty and
      following a fast track rehabilitation protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For an optimal and fast recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a fast track
      rehabilitation protocol has been developed. The literature is not yet conclusive about the
      optimal anesthestic technique. The optimal technique should support fast mobilization by
      giving good pain relieve with minimal side effects such as nausea, drowsiness and muscle
      weakness. If pain relieve is optimal, the patient mobilizes fast and length of stay is
      shortened. But does fast recovery lead to better functional outcome? The objective of this
      study is to determine whether either a femoral nerve block (FNB) or local infiltration
      analgesia (LIA) is a better anesthetic technique to achieve optimal functional outcome after
      one year in patients receiving a total knee arthroplasty and following a fast track
      rehabilitation protocol.

    <description>local infiltration analgesia is an anesthetic technique that consists of the infiltration of operated tissue with a long acting local anesthetic during surgery to achieve postoperative pain relieve. In this study LIA of the knee will exist of: 1. local infiltration analgesia (LIA) of the posterior capsule of the knee, 2. LIA of the anterior capsule of the knee and 3. LIA of the subcutaneous tissue of the knee</description>

    <description>a femoral nerve block is an anaesthetic technique that consists of anesthetizing the femoral nerve proximal of the operating area to achieve numbness distal of the block puncture site. A catheter can be placed, so the nerve can be anesthetized continuously or repeatedly for post-operative pain relieve.
In this study the FNB with catheter will be combined with local infiltration analgesia (LIA) of the posterior capsule of the knee</description>

    <description>pre-operatively the anesthesiologist will ultrasound guided place a catheter close to the femoral nerve using sodium chloride (NaCl 0.9%) (no local anesthetic). During surgery, when the LIA of the posterior capsule is performed, 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% will be administered through the catheter to create a femoral nerve block (FNB). Postoperatively patients will receive 20 mL ropivacaine 0.2% through the catheter 6 times daily for 24 hours</description>
