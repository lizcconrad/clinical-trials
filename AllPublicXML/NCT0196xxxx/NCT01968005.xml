        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and be using an
             adequate method of birth control.

          -  Subject has an exacerbation of acute low back pain with the onset of the current
             episode ≥3 and ≤7 days preceding the screening visit. The acute back pain must be
             muscular in origin.

          -  Subject has a Current Pain Intensity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with LBP potentially associated with a specific spinal cause (e.g. known
             high-grade spondylolisthesis [Grade 3 or 4], tumour, infection, vertebral compression
             fracture [history ≤1 year], Paget's disease, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis).

          -  Any past low-back surgery, or scheduled low back surgery during the trial, or any
             other scheduled surgery or painful procedure during the course of the trial that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may affect efficacy or safety assessments.

          -  Invasive procedures (e.g. epidural injections, spinal cord stimulation therapy) within
             the past six months aimed to reduce LBP.

          -  Clinically relevant history of hypersensitivity, allergy or contraindications to any
             of the IPs' excipients, or to aspirin-like drugs

          -  Presence of conditions other than LBP that in the investigator's opinion could
             confound the assessment or self-evaluation of pain, such as but not limited to
             anatomical deformities, significant skin conditions such as infections (abscesses or
             ulcers), unilateral or bilateral lower limb pain independent from the indication LBP,
             painful venous insufficiency, painful post thrombotic syndrome, painful osteoarthritis
             of the knee, distal lower limb inflammation, or diffuse widespread pain such as
             fibromyalgia.

          -  Subject has received passive physical therapy treatments (e.g. deep heat or
             ultrasound) or used iontophoresis for the pain within the past 12 hours; or requires
             continued use of an immobilization device for treatment of the current episode of low
             back pain. Subject on any therapeutic exercise regimen should stay on the same regimen
             for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject has used oral pharmacologic treatment (NSAIDs or analgesic medications) less
             than 5 half-lives before the baseline assessments; acetaminophen or ibuprofen is
             permitted prior to baseline as long as it is not within six hours of the baseline
             assessment. Aspirin (81-325 mg daily) taken prophylactically for cardiovascular
             reasons is permitted.

          -  Subject has used any form of opioid within 24 hours of study entry or use of opioids
             for five or more consecutive days within the 30 days preceding enrolment.

          -  Subject has received systemic corticosteroids in the 30 days preceding the screening
             visit (e.g. oral, or parenteral administration) or local injections such as
             intra-articular, peri-tendinous (topical acceptable, unless applied to the target
             effected area and inhaled or intranasal steroids acceptable, e.g. Flonase®)

          -  Subject has recently initiated sleep medications, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants or
             antidepressants (within the past 30 days); if using any of these, subject must be on a
             stable dose and regimen for 30 days prior to study enrolment.

          -  Subject has used TNF-alpha blockers of any type or Class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs
             within the past 60 days.

          -  Subject has a history or physical assessment finding of clinically significant GI
             ulcers or abnormal bleeding, anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, poorly controlled
             lung, stomach, heart or other vital organ disease as determined by the study
             investigator/physician.
