  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyethylene Glycol Loxenatide (PEX168) is a new human glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
      analogue that created on the basis of the Exenatide and modified by polyethylene glycol
      (PEG).

      This study aims to evaluate the effective therapeutic concentration range of PEX168, also
      decided to observe safety and PK/PD correlation by long-term continuous administration.
