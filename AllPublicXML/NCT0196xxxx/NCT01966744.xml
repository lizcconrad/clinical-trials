  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop, evaluate, and optimize an interactive website (the
      SMART portal). The SMART portal will use IBD-specific and general assessments and
      interventions to reduce the burden of common barriers to treatment adherence and enhance
      self-management skills. This study aims to build and revise the SMART portal according to
      feedback and testing from participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of three phases for development and evaluation of the SMART portal. Phase
      1 is the development of online assessments and intervention components. There will be no
      participant interaction with the portal during Phase 1. Phase 2 will consist of one,
      individual interview with patients, caregivers, and clinicians/nurses to interact with a
      portal prototype and provide feedback. Phase 3 will contain an open trial for patients and
      caregivers with baseline, 2-6 months interacting with the portal and progressing through
      applicable intervention components, and post-treatment. Patient test data will also be loaded
      into the portal during Phase 3 for clinicians/nurses to interact with for 2-6 months.
      Feedback from all users will be collected at post-treatment for optimization of the portal.

    <time_frame>Phase 3 - Approximately 2-6 months, depending upon progression through portal components</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured by pill count data provided by patients or caregivers at baseline and post-treatment during Phase 3. Phase 3 will start approximately in October 2014 and continue through March 2015.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase 3 - Approximately 2-6 months, depending upon progression through portal components</time_frame>
    <description>Disease severity will be measured at baseline, post-treatment, and periodically throughout the intervention as the patient logs in to view intervention materials during Phase 3. The portal will prompt the patient to complete disease severity questions throughout the intervention, but it will be dependent upon the patient actually logging into the system. Therefore, exact time points during treatment are unknown. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) will be used to measure disease severity for patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis, and the Partial Harvey Bradshaw (PHBI) will be used for patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Phase 3 will start approximately in October 2014 and continue through March 2015.</description>
