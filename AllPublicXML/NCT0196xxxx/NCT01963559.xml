  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      15% of diabetics have a diabetic foot (DF) in their lives associated with a risk of
      amputation and mortality two times greater than that of a diabetic population without DF.
      Predicting the occurrence of an DF is limited and only the occurrence of a diabetic wound up
      involved assessment and treatment. Our team is behind the discovery of the Pressure-Induced
      Vasodilation (PIV) first observed in healthy subjects after local application of a gradual
      pressure on the skin leading to cutaneous vasodilation at the application of pressure. This
      gain in blood flow delays the onset of ischemia. However the involvement of PIV in the DF,
      which is also a pressure-induced skin lesion, remains to be demonstrated in diabetic
      subjects. The main objective of this study is to show that PIV, a functional examination of
      the cutaneous microcirculation we developed, is altered in the presence of DF, taking into
      account the influence of age and neuropathy.
