    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study with three study groups. This study will
      be conducted in 25 HIV negative subjects, 17 of whom will have LTBI and 8 of whom will not
      have LTBI at study enrollment. The investigational product is AERAS-456 at a dose of 15 ug of
      H56 antigen with IC31 500 nmol KLK (15/500), and a dose of 50 ug of H56 antigen with IC31 500
      nmol KLK (50/500). The vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study with three study groups. This study will
      be conducted in 25 HIV negative subjects, 17 of whom will have Latent Tuberculosis Infection
      (LTBI) and 8 of whom will not have LTBI at study enrollment. The investigational product is
      H56:IC31 (AERAS-456) at a dose of 15 ug of H56 antigen with IC31 500 nmol KLK (15/500), and a
      dose of 50 ug of H56 antigen with IC31 500 nmol KLK (50/500). The vaccine is administered by
      intramuscular (IM) injection.

      Subjects will be assigned to a study group based on LTBI status at enrollment and time of
      completion of screening. Subjects without LTBI will be assigned to Group 1. Subjects with
      LTBI will be sequentially assigned to Groups 2 and 3 based on the order in which they
      complete screening. All subjects will receive a first dose of study vaccine on Study Day 0, a
      second dose of study vaccine on Study Day 56, and a third dose of study vaccine on Study Day
      112. Enrollment of subjects into Group 2 will begin only after a review of safety data from
      the 14-day period after initial vaccination of all subjects in Group 1. Likewise, enrollment
      of subjects into Group 3 will begin only after the corresponding review of safety data from
      Group 2.

      The total duration of study follow-up for all subjects is 210 days. Study groups 1 -2 will
      enroll 8 subjects each and study group 3 will enroll 9 subjects. This study is planned at a
      single clinical site in South Africa. The sizes specified for each study group were selected
      because they are judged to be adequate for preliminary safety and immunogenicity evaluations
      for a Phase I study rather than for statistical reasons.

    <description>Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be collected on subjects throughout their participation in the study. Solicited adverse events are captured 14 days post vaccination and unsolicited adverse events are captured 28 days post vaccination. Evaluation of the safety profile of AERAS-456 will be performed using data from all subjects who received at least one dose, and will be summarized by cohort and treatment group. The number (percentage) of subjects with any adverse event (including solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events) will be summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and Preferred Term. Additional summaries will present the number (percentage) of subjects with any adverse events by severity and by relationship to study vaccine; parameters evaluable by the Aeras 456 Toxicity Table per US FDA guidance provided in the protocol, will be summarized by severity corresponding to Toxicity Grade, as appropriate.</description>
