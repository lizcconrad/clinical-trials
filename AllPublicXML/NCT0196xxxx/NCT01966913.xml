    <textblock>
      High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is a standard
      salvage treatment used in adults with germ cell tumors (Einhorn et al, J Clin Oncol 2007).

      Disease prognosis following 1 to 2 intensified combinations of etoposide - carboplatin +/-
      ifosfamide depends on the patient's performance status (PS) at inclusion and the prior
      sensitivity of the disease to cisplatin. A poor PS and/or being refractory to cisplatin
      suggest a higher toxicity and a bad prognosis.

      However, predictive factors of response to high-dose chemotherapy do not include a
      chemo-sensitivity phase with a semi-intensive chemotherapy excluding a platinum compound
      (epirubicin - paclitaxel), which still allows stem-cell harvest. The use of this chemotherapy
      combination induced a response in more than one third of the patients treated during disease
      progression in the TAXIF I study. The same strategy was tested in the TAXIF II study, which
      completed the inclusion of 45 patients and was closed in May 2008. Results of the TAXIF II
      study, are currently being analyzed; they support the hypothesis to prioritarily treat
      patients with a sensitive relapsed disease at the time of the high-dose administration.

      A combination of a semi-intensive sequential ICE type chemotherapy plus bevacizumab was used
      on a highly refractory patient. A 5 months nearly complete response was achieved. Indeed, the
      overexpression of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) has been identified as an
      independent risk factor in patients with germ cell tumor. Therefore, a treatment strategy
      using an inductive chemotherapy followed, in case of response, by a double intensification
      therapy in combination with a VEGF treatment, could be an interesting approach in patients
      with poor prognosis germ cell tumors.

      The aim of this phase I/II trial is to assess the feasibility of a Bevacizumab - ICE
      (Ifosfamide-Carboplatin-Etoposide) high dose combination with the support of autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell for two intensive consecutive cycles (&quot;tandem&quot; intensification) in
      patients with a poor prognosis germ cell tumor non refractory to a front-line mobilization
      chemotherapy using two half intensified consecutive combinations of Epirubicin-Paclitaxel.
