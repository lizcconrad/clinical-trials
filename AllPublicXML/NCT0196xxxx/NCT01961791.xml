      For staging the status of lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer, typographic based staging
      system was applied until last decade, especially in Eastern countries. However the old
      typographic lymph node staging system in gastric cancer was too complicated and less accurate
      for predicting the prognosis. Now the numeric based lymph node staging system is used in both
      East and West, but it include problems: no information on the anatomical extent of the
      disease, preoperative lymph node staging is nearly impossible, failure to provide an
      appropriate treatment plan, cannot represent the extent of lymph node dissection. We designed
      simple and specifically representing the anatomic extent of the disease for staging the
      status of lymph node in gastric cancer. Thus we compared its prognostic performance of this
      new staging system with those of the current TNM 7th edition of AJCC/UICC.

    <description>The overall survival (OS) was used to evaluate the prognosis after gastrectomy. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were applied to analyze the OS. In addition, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs). To compare the discrimination of each stage, the Kaplan-Meier curves from each stage in both staging systems was used. For comparing prognostic performance of each staging system, Harrell C-index (for measuring the predictive accuracy of survival outcome) were used.</description>
