  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this feasibility trial, the investigators will compare participants treated with
      montelukast and hydroxyurea to those treated with placebo and hydroxyurea for a total of 8
      weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis for this trial is that montelukast adds efficacy to hydroxyurea
      therapy for improving vaso-occlusion when compared to hydroxyurea alone. The following
      specific aims will be tested in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease:

      Aim 1. To determine whether montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve
      markers of vaso-occlusion-associated tissue injury in adolescents and adults with sickle cell
      disease.

      Aim 2. To evaluate physiologic effects of montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea in
      adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease.

      Subaim 2A. To determine if montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve lung
      function in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease.

      Subaim 2B. To determine if montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will improve
      forearm microvascular blood flow in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease,
      respectively.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is based on a 30% reduction, which would be ~106 ng/ml reduction. The study was designed with 25 in each group in order to explore all three aims and potential confounders. However, if the investigators are not able to accrue 25 subjects in each arm, the investigators would still be able to detect a 30% difference in sVCAM with 17 subjects in each group. The 95% confidence interval for detecting a 30% difference is between 204 ng/ml and 290 ng/ml (or an 18-42% reduction in sVCAM). Importantly, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (18%) is still a clinically relevant reduction in sVCAM. Thus, if the investigators detect a 30% or larger difference in sVCAM in this study, the investigators will be assured that, based on the 95% confidence interval, these data are clinically important.</description>
