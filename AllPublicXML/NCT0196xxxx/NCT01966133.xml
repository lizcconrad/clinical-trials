      Investigators hypothesise that the use of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) after liver
      resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can eradicate residual cancer cells in
      the liver and thus improve survival of patients with high risk factors for residual tumor.
      The aim of this study is to compare the survival of patients with high risk factors for
      residual tumor undergoing liver resection plus post-operative TACE versus liver resection
      alone.

    <textblock>
      Liver resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      However, recurrence is common after surgery and most occurs in the liver, especially for the
      patients with high risk factors for residual tumor, such as tumors with a diameter more than
      5 cm, multiple nodules, and microvascular invasion. Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is
      an effective palliative treatment for HCC. It involves the infusion of chemotherapeutic agent
      admixed with iodised oil followed by embolisation of the hepatic arterial flow using small
      particles. This procedures allows application of smaller dose of chemotherapy concentrated to
      the liver and thus is well tolerated with minimal side effects. The main complications of
      TACE are liver function damage, mild feverish symptoms, vomit , etc. But most of them are
      reversible.

      We conduct a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of using TACE after
      hepatectomy in HCC patients with high risk factors for residual tumor (tumors with a diameter
      more than 5 cm, multiple nodules, or microvascular invasion).
