      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention program based on
      physical activity and diet, memory workshops and review of medication, to modify frailty
      parameters, muscle strength and physical and cognitive performance in people 65 years or
      older with a positive screening for frailty. Secondly, to assess changes in falls,
      hospitalizations, nutritional risk, disability and institutionalization or home-care.

      Methods: randomized clinical trial with a control group, of one year and a half of follow-up,
      conducted in eight primary care teams in Barcelona. Individuals to be included are 65 years
      or older with positive frailty screening, timed get-up-and-go between 10 to 30 seconds, and
      cognitive Lobo test greater than or equal to 18. 165 patients will be selected in each group
      (difference to be detected on physical performance (Short physical performance battery
      (SPPB)): 0.5 units; common Standard Deviation : 1.42, 20% lost to follow-up).

      Intervention: consists in three different actions on frailty dimensions, applied to each
      subject in the intervention group, in groups of 15 participants: rehabilitative therapy plus
      intake of hyperproteic shakes, memory workshop and review of the medication.

      Evaluations will be blinded and conducted at 0, 3 and 18 months. Analysis of variance for
      repeated measures to adjust for differences attributable to intervention effect and for
      potential confounders such as comorbidity, sensory limitations, social risk, other medical or
      social interventions, among others.

    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a standardised assessment tool of lower limb function, testing 3 dimensions: standing balance, walking speed, and chair stands. Each component is scored between 0-4, total score from 0 (poor performance) to 12 (best performance).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Muscle strength at 3 and 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>0,3,18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of upper extremities strength was assessed through the measurement of force with a handgrip dynamometer. Grip strength was evaluated using a portable hand dynamometer (JAMAR®0-90 kg, coding 506320). The participants were seated with their shoulder in a neutral position and their elbow flexed at 90°. Three attempts were performed alternately in each hand; the mean of the three measures was recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Cognitive Performance (Barcelona test) at 3 and 18 months</measure>
    <time_frame>0,3,18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The first neuro-psychometric instrument developed in Spain to measure semi-quantitatively cognitive status in clinical neurology was the Barcelona Test (BT). Shortened version of the BT, named Barcelona Test Review (BTR) had been used for neuropsychological area evaluation in our participants and it takes only 20-30 minutes to administer</description>
