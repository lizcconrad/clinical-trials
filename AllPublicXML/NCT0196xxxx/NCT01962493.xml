    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the stain effect on teeth of twice daily brushing with a
      67% sodium bicarbonate containing toothpaste versus standard toothpaste (not containing
      sodium bicarbonate) for six weeks whilst using a chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% mouthwash.

    <measure>Modified Lobene Stain Index (MLSI) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 post treatment administration</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of the area and intensity of dental stain on the study teeth was performed using the MLSI after usage of 0.2% w/v chlorhexidine digluconate mouthwash for 6 weeks. The intensity of stain was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 - no stain, 1- light stain, 2 - moderate stain, 3 - heavy stain). The area of stain was scored on the following scale: 0 - no stain; 1 - stain up to 1/3 of the area affected; 2- stain between 1/3 and 2/3 of the area affected; and 3 - stain more than 2/3 of area affected. Intensity X Area was thus analyzed on a scale of 0 (best score) to 9 (worst score).</description>

        <description>An assessment of the area and intensity of dental stain on the study teeth was performed using the MLSI after usage of 0.2% w/v chlorhexidine digluconate mouthwash for 6 weeks. The intensity of stain was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 - no stain, 1- light stain, 2 - moderate stain, 3 - heavy stain). The area of stain was scored on the following scale: 0 - no stain; 1 - stain up to 1/3 of the area affected; 2- stain between 1/3 and 2/3 of the area affected; and 3 - stain more than 2/3 of area affected. Intensity X Area was thus analyzed on a scale of 0 (best score) to 9 (worst score).</description>

The area of stain was scored on the following scale: 0 - no stain; 1 - stain up to 1/3 of the area affected; 2- stain between 1/3 and 2/3 of the area affected; and 3 - stain more than 2/3 of area affected. Intensity X Area was thus analyzed on a scale of 0 (best score) to 9 (worst score).</description>
