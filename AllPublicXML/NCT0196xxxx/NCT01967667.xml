    <textblock>
      Low levels of antioxidant molecules such as glutathione have been found in people with a
      diagnosis of schizophrenia. However, oral glutathione is not well absorbed because the
      compound is mostly broken down in the gastrointestinal system. Liposomes are tiny droplets of
      oil particles that encapsulate and protect the glutathione. In this study we will evaluate a
      liposomal formulation of glutathione for tolerability and to examine if this formulation
      serves the function of increasing glutathione in the brain and body.

      Additional information about this dietary supplement:

        -  Glutathione is an antioxidant naturally produced in our body. Glutathione protects the
           brain and other organs from oxidative stress.

        -  Low glutathione is associated with high oxidative stress, which has been linked to aging
           and many illnesses. Schizophrenia is a mental illness that doctors still do not fully
           understand. Individuals with schizophrenia often have low levels of glutathione.

        -  Glutathione can be supplied through dietary supplement. However, if taken plainly, it
           easily breaks down in our gut.

        -  Scientists have now found a way to wrap glutathione in tiny drops of oil particles
           called liposomes. That way, the gut cannot break it down so it is absorbed into our
           body. Once inside the body, our cells can take in the liposomes and use the glutathione
           to reduce oxidative stress.

        -  Liposome-wrapped glutathione is not a drug or medicine.
