  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if synchronizing when patients with diabetes and/or
      coronary artery disease fill their prescriptions improves long-term adherence to these
      medications.

    <description>Each patient's medication that has the greatest quantity of pills on hand after randomization will be defined as the &quot;index &quot;medication and partial supplies will be provided for all other eligible medications in order to synchronize all of a patient's medication. Prescribers will be contacted for a new prescription to ensure all eligible medications are on the same renewal schedule.
Randomization will occur within strata of whether patients are enrolled in the &quot;ReadyFill@Mail&quot; program. Once synchronized, patients who are not enrolled in the ReadyFill@Mail program will initiate their own refills. Patients who are enrolled in the ReadyFill@Mail program will have their refills automatically filled, however patients may disenroll from ReadyFill@Mail at any time, in which case they will initiate their own refills. Patients may disenroll in whole or in part from the program at any point.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        We will enroll patients 18 years of age and older who within 6 months of study enrollment
        have filled â‰¥ 2 medications intended for long-term use (i.e. maintenance medications) by
        mail order at CVS Caremark. At least 1 of these 2 medications of must be for the treatment
        of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. In addition, these medications must be delivered on
        two or more unique delivery dates, there must be at least one refill remaining for all
        eligible medications and either all or none of their prescriptions must be enrolled in the
        ReadyFill@Mail program (see Intervention Description for details).
