  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal wall incisions used for liver surgeries are associated with significant
      postoperative pain and disability. Epidural analgesia is often contraindicated in these
      patients due to common bleeding problems. Furthermore, drugs such as acetaminophen and
      opioids are often inadequate and can lead to detrimental side-effects. Abdominal wall (AW)
      catheters can be placed during surgical closure along the incision line and can be used to
      administer local anesthetics for postoperative pain. The study is a multi-centre,
      double-blind, randomized controlled trial involving 120 patients undergoing elective liver
      surgery. Patients will be randomly assigned to AW catheter group treated with drug or control
      treated with saline. Treatment group will receive AW catheters with ropivacaine plus standard
      patient controlled analgesia (PCA). Control group will obtain AW with normal saline and no
      local anesthetics and PCA. Patients are followed for 6 months post-operatively for pain
      scores, side-effects, chronic pain and complications.

    <description>The primary endpoint is mean cumulative postoperative opioid consumption over the first two postoperative days (48 hours). Both intravenous PCA opioids and oral opioids will be recorded from the patient's medical records daily, converted to morphine equivalents, and compared between the two groups.
The following information will be collected at regular intervals as a measure of the primary endpoints: Cumulative i.v. PCA opioid consumption every 12 hours for 72 hours as well as total opioid consumption for the entire hospital stay.</description>
