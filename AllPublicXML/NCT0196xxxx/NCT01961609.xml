  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to prove and quantify the hypothesis that secukinumab is effective,
      safe and well tolerated in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis
      in patients who are inadequate responders to anti-TNFα therapy in a UK (and Republic of
      Ireland) specific population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no clear evidence or guidelines on appropriate treatment once a patient with
      moderate/severe psoriasis has failed to respond to anti-TNFα therapy, whether a single
      anti-TNFα therapy failure or multiple anti-TNFα therapy failures.

      Numerous double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel-group, active and placebo
      controlled studies have already been designed and run for the Phase III secukinumab clinical
      development program, in accordance with Health Authorities guidelines and feedback, including
      FDA and EMA. None of these specifically studies patients who have failed to respond to
      anti-TNFα therapy as defined by NICE guidelines.

      Therefore, this study utilises a pragmatic, open-label, non-comparator design, which has been
      shown to be appropriate in similar studies looking at anti-TNFα therapy in patients failing
      on other therapies (Papp et al. 2012; Strober et al. 2011), to answer the question of whether
      secukinumab is an appropriate choice in patients who have failed to respond to anti-TNFα
      therapy (TNF-IR) per NICE definitions, whether a single anti-TNFα therapy failure or multiple
      anti-TNFα therapy failures.

             initiation of study drug and any infections that reoccur on a regular basis;
             investigator discretion should be used regarding patients who have travelled or
             recently resided in areas of endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis,
             coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis and for patients with underlying conditions that
             may predispose them to infection, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes

         10. History of an ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease, or evidence of
             tuberculosis infection as defined by a positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test (QFT) at
             screening. Patients with a positive QFT test may participate in the study if further
             work up establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of active
             tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established, then treatment must
             have been initiated and maintained according to UK guidelines.
