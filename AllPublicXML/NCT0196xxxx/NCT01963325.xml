      This phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus Abraxane as
      second-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no standard second-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma, new therapies are needed.
      The efficacy of S-1 as first-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma was confirmed in several
      studies. The IMPACT study showed that Abraxane plus gemcitabine provide better survival than
      gemcitabine alone. Since cholangiocarcinoma displayed similar sensitivity to chemotherapy
      which was used in pancreatic carcinoma, we assume that S-1 plus Abraxane is effective and
      safe in treating cholangiocarcinoma.
