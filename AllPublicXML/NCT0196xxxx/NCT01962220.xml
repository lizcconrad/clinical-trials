      Linking HIV-infected pregnant women into prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT)
      services and keeping them in care is important in ensuring that both mother and infant beneﬁt
      from interventions that improve maternal health and decrease HIV transmission to infants. We
      propose an evaluation of strategies to link newly diagnosed HIV-infected women to care and
      keep them in care during pregnancy and after delivery in our study called MIR4HEALTH. The
      study will be conducted in Nyanza Province, Kenya. All participants will provide informed
      consent and will be randomized to receive the intervention, including individualized patient
      education, adherence support and phone call/Short Message Service (SMS) reminders for clinic
      appointments, or the standard of care (no additional intervention services).

      Mother Infant Retention for Health (MIR4HEALTH) is an innovative implementation science study
      focused on testing an effective multicomponent strategy to improve linkage and retention of
      newly identified HIV‐infected pregnant women accessing maternal child health (MCH) services
      in Nyanza Province, Kenya. MIR4HEALTH is distinguished by several innovations including the
      recognition that newly identified HIV-infected pregnant woman are especially vulnerable to
      poor retention within PMTCT services and that both mother and child must be retained in care
      to ensure optimal health outcomes.

      The study is a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a novel strategy using Active
      Patient Follow-Up (APFU) to the current standard of care (SOC) routinely provided for the
      retention of women and their exposed infants postpartum. The proposed APFU includes a package
      of evidence-based interventions including health education, provision of phone and short
      message service (SMS) appointment reminders, active tracking of patients for linkage and
      retention, and individualized retention and adherence support. Patients enrolled in the APFU
      intervention arm will complete three antenatal study visits after enrollment as well as two
      postnatal study visits with their infants at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Laboratory
      blood specimens will be collected from mothers and infants at two separate visits to assess
      viral load and and drug levels. Additionally, all staff will be offered a chance to
      participate in an interview assessing the feasibility and acceptability of APFU.

      Study participants will be recruited from various clinics in the Nyanza Province in Kenya.
      This study will enroll pregnant women who test positive for HIV during their first antenatal
      visit and have no prior HIV diagnosis. Upon live birth, the infants of participating women
      will also be included in the study. The study will enroll 214 newly-infected pregnant women,
      with 107 participants in the APFU arm (intervention) and 107 participants in the SOC arm.
      Infants born to women enrolled in the study will also be included so there will be a total of
      214 mother-infant pairs, totaling 428 participants.
