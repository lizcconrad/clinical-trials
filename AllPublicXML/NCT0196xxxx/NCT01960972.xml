  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol aims to implement, using a stepped wedge trial design, a population-level
      intervention to replace high-sodium salt for a salt substitute (low-sodium, high-potassium
      salt) to reduce blood pressure levels among adults aged 18 years and over of the semi-urban
      area of Tumbes.

      We hypothesize that participants aged 18 years and over from villages receiving a salt
      substitute will have lower blood pressure compared to control villages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several randomized clinical trials and meta-analysis have reported that reduction of sodium
      intake decreases blood pressure. Also, the increase of potassium ingestion in minimal doses
      has been found in systematic reviews to produce a small reduction in blood pressure levels.

      The proposed intervention is a community-wide mass-strategy in which direct delivery of a
      salt substitute to households is accompanied by wide social marketing campaigns, both before
      and during the intervention period. With this experimental stepped wedge trial design, we
      will estimate the impact of a reduced-sodium salt substitution program on blood pressure at
      the population level.

      We propose the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To implement and assess the impact of an intervention using a salt substitute
      on blood pressure at the population level using a stepped wedge trial design.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine costs and efficacy of this implementation strategy using
      cost-effectiveness analysis.

    <description>We will assess changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over time. Periodic assessments will be carried out to obtain clinical measurements. Every five months, a new evaluation will be performed in all participant villages (intervention and control).
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured in triplicate using standard procedures and automated and validated devices. These periodic assessments will be taken at each household to guarantee contact with each family member enrolled in this study.</description>

    <description>As described by Brown, in a stepped wedge design, an intervention is rolled-out sequentially to the trial participants (either as individuals or clusters of individuals) over a number of time periods. The order in which the different individuals or clusters receive the intervention is determined at random and, by the end of the random allocation, all individuals or groups will have received the intervention. Stepped wedge designs incorporate data collection at each point where a new group (step) receives the intervention.
Thus, the salt substitute will be implemented in each cluster (village) in a randomized fashion. Not arms are needed since the 6 randomly-selected villages will be implemented in some moment of the protocol.</description>
