  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was composed of a screening period followed by 2 sequential on-treatment periods,
      as follows:

        -  Screening Period (up to 28 days): determination of eligibility and discontinuation of
           antiparkinsonian disease medications other than levodopa-carbidopa immediate release
           (LC-oral) prior to nasojejunal (N-J) tube placement.

        -  N-J Test Period (2 to 14 days): first hospitalization period, Baseline assessments,
           placement of N-J tube, and optimization of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG)
           treatment via N-J tube and infusion pump (participant was hospitalized for N-J tube
           placement but hospitalization was not required for entire duration of LCIG treatment
           optimization).

        -  PEG-J Period (12 weeks): second hospitalization period; placement of PEG-J tube; further
           optimization of LCIG treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline (end of screening period) and Final PEG-J Visit (up to week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items (each question answered on a 5-point scale) addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson's disease patients: Mobility (e.g., fear of falling when walking) includes 10 questions; Emotional Well-being (e.g., feelings of isolation) includes 6 questions; Stigma (e.g., social embarrassment) includes 4 questions; Social Support includes 3 questions; Cognition includes 4 questions; Communication includes 3 questions; and Bodily Discomfort includes 3 questions. The domain scores are calculated by first summing the answers to the questions in the domain. The sum is divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) and the quotient is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</description>

    <description>All participants received LCIG via the N-J tube during the nasojejunal (N-J) Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J) during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the PEG-J Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease according to the United Kingdom
             Parkinson's Disease Society (UKPDS) Brain Bank Criteria.

          2. Subjects have 4 or 5 in modified Hohn and Yahr (H &amp; Y) classification of disease
             severity at &quot;Off&quot; state determined by the UPDRS Part V at Screening Visit 1.

          3. The subject's advanced Parkinson's disease must be levodopa-responsive as judged by
             the Investigator.

          4. Subjects have had optimal treatment with available Parkinson's disease medication as
             defined by local standards of care and, based upon the judgment of the Investigator,
             and their symptoms are judged inadequately controlled on this optimized treatment.
             Optimized treatment is defined as the maximum therapeutic effect obtained with
             available anti-parkinsonian pharmacological therapy when no further improvement is
             expected regardless of any additional manipulations of levodopa and/or other anti
             parkinsonian medication; this will be based on the Investigator's best clinical
             judgment.

          5. Presence of a recognizable &quot;Off&quot; and &quot;On&quot; state (motor fluctuations) as confirmed by
             UPDRS Part III (in both &quot;On&quot; and &quot;Off&quot; states), and by the Parkinson's Disease Diary©
             which must be observed and confirmed at Screening Visit 1.

          6. Subjects must be experiencing a minimum of 3 hours per day of &quot;Off&quot; time, as estimated
             by the Investigator and supported by the UPDRS at Screening Visit 1 and the
             Parkinson's Disease Diaries at baseline. The &quot;Off&quot; time must occur during a continuous
             16-hour interval, including the portion of the day during which the subject is awake
             the majority of the time (e.g., 5 AM to 9 PM, 7 AM to 11 PM).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Parkinson's disease diagnosis is unclear or a suspicion of other parkinsonian
             syndromes exists, such as secondary Parkinsonism (caused by drugs, toxins, infectious
             agents, vascular disease, trauma, brain neoplasm), Parkinson's-plus syndromes (e.g.,
             multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy) or the other
             neurodegenerative diseases that might mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease .

          2. Subjects who have undergone neurosurgery for the treatment of Parkinson's disease .

          3. Current primary psychiatric diagnosis of acute psychotic disorder or other
             uncontrolled primary psychiatric diagnoses, (e.g., bipolar disorder or major
             depressive disorder per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th
             edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria.

          4. Alzheimer's disease; or other significant cognitive impairment or dementia (defined as

          5. Subject has significant current suicidal ideation within the previous year as
             evidenced by answering &quot;yes&quot; to questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of
             the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) completed at Screening or any
             history of suicide attempts.

          6. A low B12 level or low-normal B12 level (less than 300 pg/mL) with elevated
             methylmalonic acid (MMA). Note: Abnormal Vitamin B12 of questionable clinical
             significance (i.e., indeterminate or low normal results) prior to or at Screening
             Visit 2 require appropriate interpretation in conjunction with MMA and homocysteine
             laboratory values prior to proceeding further into the study.

          <description>All participants received LCIG via the N-J tube during the nasojejunal (N-J) Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J) during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the PEG-J Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour).</description>

        <title>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Summary Index: Change From Baseline To The Final PEG-J Visit</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson's disease patients. These include: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. The PDQ-39 Summary Index is the sum of all answers divided by the highest score possible (i.e. number of answers multiplied by 4) which is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a 0-100 scale. Higher scores are associated with more severe symptoms.</description>

            <description>All participants received LCIG via the N-J tube during the nasojejunal (N-J) Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J) during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the PEG-J Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour).</description>

          <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson's disease patients. These include: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. The PDQ-39 Summary Index is the sum of all answers divided by the highest score possible (i.e. number of answers multiplied by 4) which is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a 0-100 scale. Higher scores are associated with more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Average Daily Normalized &quot;On&quot; Time With Troublesome Dyskinesia: Change From Baseline To The Final PEG-J Visit</title>
        <description>Based on the Parkinson's Disease Symptom Diary. &quot;On&quot; time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. &quot;Off&quot; time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. The diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected clinic visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e. 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. Positive change from baseline for &quot;on&quot; time indicates improvement.</description>

The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the PEG-J Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour).</description>

        <title>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Mobility, Emotional Well-Being, Stigma, Social Support, Cognition, Communication, and Bodily Discomfort Domain Scores: Change From Baseline To The Final PEG-J Visit</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items (each question answered on a 5-point scale) addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson's disease patients: Mobility (e.g., fear of falling when walking) includes 10 questions; Emotional Well-being (e.g., feelings of isolation) includes 6 questions; Stigma (e.g., social embarrassment) includes 4 questions; Social Support includes 3 questions; Cognition includes 4 questions; Communication includes 3 questions; and Bodily Discomfort includes 3 questions. The domain scores are calculated by first summing the answers to the questions in the domain. The sum is divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) and the quotient is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</description>

        <title>Average Daily Normalized “Off” Time Including All PD Diaries Regardless if They Were Completed After the Subject Had Used a Concomitant Anti-Parkinsonian Medication: Change From Baseline To The Final PEG-J Visit</title>
        <description>Based on the Parkinson's Disease Symptom Diary. &quot;On&quot; time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. &quot;Off&quot; time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. The diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected clinic visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e. 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. Negative change from baseline for &quot;off&quot; time indicates improvement.</description>

The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the PEG-J Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious AE (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after N-J placement. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as Reasonable Possibility or No Reasonable Possibility.
For more details on adverse events please see the AE section below.</description>

          <description>All participants received LCIG via the N-J tube during the nasojejunal (N-J) Test Period and delivered to the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy - with jejunal extension tube (PEG-J) during the Post-PEG-J Long-Term Treatment Period. The starting dose was individually determined based on the daily dose of oral levodopa prior to study enrollment.
The infusion dose was individually optimized for each participant on the basis of response and potential adverse events. During the PEG-J Period, LCIG was expected to be infused continuously over approximately 16 hours daily with a rate of infusion ranging from 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour).</description>
