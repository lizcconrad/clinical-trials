  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited inborn error of an amino acid phenylalanine (PHE)
      metabolism affecting 1:15,000 births. It is caused by a decreased activity of an enzyme in
      the liver called phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) which is important to convert PHE into
      tyrosine, another amino acid. Consequently, PHE accumulates in the blood leading to mental
      and developmental delays. Nutritional management is the primary choice of treatment that
      includes providing sufficient protein in the diet and at the same time restricting PHE.
      However the amount of protein to be given is unknown. A new technique called Indicator Amino
      Acid Oxidation (IAAO) will be used to determine the protein requirements in children with PKU
      (5-18y). The study will help treat and manage these children with sufficient protein to
      ensure proper growth and development. Current dietary recommendations range from 35-65 g/day
      and is based on factorial calculations.

      The investigators hypothesize that the protein requirement in children with PKU will be
      higher than the current mathematically calculated recommended intake of 35-65 g/day for the
      5-18y children.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children (5-18y) who are diagnosed with Phenylketonuria (PKU), and clinically stable
             with no acute illness

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children less than 5y of age and who are diagnosed with PKU, as it may be difficult to
             take breath samples and perform indirect calorimetry in very young children.

          -  Children diagnosed with PKU, but are currently ill, with a fever, cold, vomiting or
             diarrhea.
