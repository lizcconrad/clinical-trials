  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two different treatment strategies in patients
      admitted to hospital with Community Acquired Pneumonia. The investigators hypothesize
      treatment according to both procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be
      effective in reducing the length of antibiotic treatment.

    <description>Cure — resolution or improvement of symptoms and clinical signs related to pneumonia without the need for additional or alternative antibiotic therapy
Failure — persistence or progression of all signs and symptoms of the acute process after randomisation or the development of a new pulmonary or extrapulmonary respiratory tract infection, or the progression of abnormalities on chest radiograph after randomisation, or death due to pneumonia, or the inability to complete the study owing to adverse events
Indeterminate — patient receives less than 80% of the study drug for reasons other than clinical failure, a concomitant infection outside the respiratory tract requiring antibiotic treatment, lost to follow-up, or death unrelated to the primary diagnosis.</description>
