  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical cross-over study, we will compare the efficacy of different oral nutrition
      regimens for night-time glucose control in adult GSD 1 patients. Three different over-night
      nutrition regimens (=interventions) will be compared in each patient sequentially, (1)
      uncooked corn starch (UCSS, &quot;Maizena&quot;), (2) modified corn-starch, (3) other carbohydrate
      (starch) containing meal. During each intervention, glucose profiles will be continuously
      monitored by continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS). The duration of each intervention is 3d
      (mimimum) to 6d (maximum), depending on the quality of night-time glucose control and the
      technical quality of glucose sensor readings. Between the interventions, the patients follow
      their normal prescribed diet.
