      The overall objective of this study is to utilize heart rate variability and respiratory rate
      variability in patients with sepsis to predict clinical deterioration and death.

      Our specific objectives are:

        1. To study the ability of a change in composite variability (∆CVI) assessment to act as a
           prognostic aid in predicting disease progression in sepsis.

        2. To study the effect that standard resuscitation interventions will have on the direction
           and magnitude of ∆CVI in patients with sepsis.

      B. Hypotheses H1: In the initial resuscitation of sepsis, a low or declining multi-parameter
      composite variability index (CVI) over 4 hours will predict a significant increase in the
      combined outcome of overt shock, organ dysfunction, and mortality.

      H2: In the initial resuscitation of sepsis, low volume fluid resuscitation (&lt;20 cc/kg) over 4
      hours will be associated with a low or declining CVI.
