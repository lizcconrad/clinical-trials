  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the response rate and safety profile of irinotecan plus epirubicin
      as the second-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer and fully evaluate the
      feasibility and effectiveness of the regime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purposes: to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
      of gastric cancer patients given irinotecan + epirubicin as second-line treatment, who are at
      Stage IV with disease progressed or recurred after first-line chemotherapy failed, ,

      The Secondary purposes: to determine disease control rate (Disease Control Rate, DCR), the
      objective response rate (Object Response rate, ORR) and the Quality of life (Quality Of Life,
      QOL)
