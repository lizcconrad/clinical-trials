  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite intermittent control of tracheal cuff pressure using a manual manometer, cuff
      underinflations and overinflations frequently occur in critically ill patients, resulting in
      increased risk for microaspiration and tracheal ischemic lesions. The aim of this study is to
      determine the efficiency of Mallinckrodt electronic device (Mallinckrodt electronic cuff
      pressure controller, VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz aN) in continuous control of tracheal cuff
      pressure.
