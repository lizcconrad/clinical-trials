  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The kidneys are an important regulator of blood pressure. Previous research has shown that
      disrupting the nerves (denervate) of the kidney may successfully decrease blood pressure. In
      the past, one technique that was used to treat severe high blood pressure was a surgical
      procedure to cut these nerves. However, this surgery is no longer commonly performed.

      Another approach to disrupting these nerves is to use the Beta-Cath 3.5F system to deliver a
      small amount of radiation to the treatment zone. The Beta-Cath 3.5F System (Novoste) is
      currently approved in the United States to deliver ion dose therapy to re-narrowings that
      form in the coronary arteries in the heart. This trial is assessing the safety of treating
      patients with the Beta-Cath 3.5F System (Novoste) to denervate the nerves around the kidney
      to help control blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

        1. Renal artery brachytherapy with beta-emitting source is safe.

        2. Renal artery brachytherapy with beta-emitting source can reduce systolic/diastolic blood
           pressure via renal denervation mechanism within 6 months post treatment.
