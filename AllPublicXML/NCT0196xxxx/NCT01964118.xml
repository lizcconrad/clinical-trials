  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Intermittent Fasting study is to investigate whether intermittent fasting
      could decrease the chronic inflammation levels in overweight/obese people.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether or not IF reduces the level of
      chronic inflammation as evidenced by a decrease in high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP),
      as the main outcome measure

    <description>Participant with a BMI between 28 and 35 kg/m2 will fast 3 non-consecutive days per week, whereas participant with a BMI between 24 and 27.9 kg/m2 will fast 2 non-consecutive days per week. Individuals following intermittent fasting (IF) will work with the study dietitian to design their weekly meal plans and menus for the non-fasting days. The subjects following IF will be asked to skip breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and calorie-containing beverages on the fast days, but we will give them the option to consume at dinner a big salad (i.e. non-starchy raw and/or cooked vegetables dressed with 2 tablespoons of salad dressing prepared with vegetable oil, vinegar and seasonings).</description>
