  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter study of the efficacy of golimumab 2 mg/kg IV in subjects
      with active rheumatoid arthritis who are receiving methotrexate and have inadequate disease
      control (defined as an erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]-based Disease Activity Score in
      28 joints [DAS28] ≥ 3.2 and ≥ 4 swollen and ≥ 4 tender joints) despite current anti-TNFα
      therapy with infliximab 2 - 4 mg/kg every 4 weeks, 2 - 5 mg/kg every 5 weeks, 3 - 6 mg/kg
      every 6 weeks, 3 - 7mg/kg every 7 weeks, or 4 - 8 mg/kg every 8 weeks.

      To be eligible for participation, subjects must have previously demonstrated initial and/or
      temporary improvement in disease signs and symptoms, who have since exhibited a diminished
      response despite continued treatment. It is estimated that 200 subjects will be enrolled in
      the study at approximately 85 global sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study employs an open-label &quot;active switch&quot; design that moves subjects from infliximab to
      golimumab 2 mg/kg IV. In general, subjects eligible for the study include men or women who
      are currently receiving infliximab in actual clinical practice who are at least 18 years of
      age with active rheumatoid arthritis, and have previously demonstrated initial and/or
      temporary improvement in disease signs and symptoms, but now exhibit a diminished response
      and inadequate disease control despite continued treatment. Subjects must have received
      infliximab in combination with methotrexate for a minimum of 9 months prior to the first
      screening visit.

      The screening visit will occur sometime between Week -12 and Week -10. Consenting subjects
      who meet screening criteria will receive their final dose of infliximab at Week -8 as part of
      actual clinical practice. Golimumab IV treatment, which will be supplied by the sponsor, will
      be received at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, and 28. The primary endpoint is at Week 24, the final
      efficacy assessment is at Week 32, and a follow-up safety assessment by telephone is at Week
      44. There will be a maximum of 36 weeks between the last infliximab infusion at Week -8 and
      the last infusion of golimumab at Week 28. The duration of study participation is expected to
      be a maximum of 56 weeks (including the Screening Period, 32 weeks of golimumab treatment and
      assessment, and a 12-week safety follow-up).
