    <textblock>
      This single-center, open-label, one-sequence, 2-period, within-subject study in 2 cohorts
      will evaluate the effects of multiple doses of itraconazole and fluoxetine on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of RO5285119 in healthy volunteers. In Cohort 1, subjects
      will receive a single dose of RO5285119 on Day 1 (Period 1) and, after a wash-out period of
      14 days, itraconazole on Days 1-8 of Period 2 with coadministration of RO5285119 on Day 4. In
      Cohort 2, subjects will receive a single dose of RO5285119 on Day 1 (Period 1) and, after a
      wash-out period of 14 days, fluoxetine on Days 1-12 of Period 2 with coadministration of
      RO5285119 on Day 6.

          -  Hypersensitivity to itraconazole, to any of the other ingredients, or to any other
             triazole antifungal, or any other known contraindications to itraconazole as stated in
