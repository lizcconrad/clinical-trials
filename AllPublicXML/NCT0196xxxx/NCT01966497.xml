      The main objective of this observational survey is to estimate the incidence, the typology,
      and the evolution of patients with acute myelobalstic leukemia, aged more than 60 years old.
      In this age group (aged more than 60y), three groups of patients with very different response
      rates and late outcome can be delineated with specific standard chemotherapy.
