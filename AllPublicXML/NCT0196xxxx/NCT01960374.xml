      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of selumetinib
      (AZD6244; ARRY-142886) (Hyd-Sulfate) in healthy male Japanese and non-Japanese Asian
      volunteers following administration of a single dose. Standard safety assessments including
      ECGs, vital signs, blood/urine safety tests, PK samples and monitoring of adverse events and
      an optional exploratory pharmacogenetics will be performed.
