      To compare the efficacy and safety of ASP3550 to goserelin acetate in patients with prostate
      cancer.

      This study consists of two parts. The purpose of PART 1 is to test non-inferiority of ASP3550
      to goserelin acetate with respect to the cumulative castration rate in terms of serum
      testosterone when ASP3550 or goserelin acetate is administered for one-year in patients with
      prostate cancer.

      The patients assigned to receive ASP3550 and completed the treatment in PART 1 are eligible
      for the treatment in PART 2, and will receive ASP3550 maintenance dose subcutaneously for
      additional term. The long-term safety, efficacy and PK of the continued ASP3550 treatment
      will be assessed in PART 2.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male patient with histologically confirmed prostate cancer (adenocarcinoma).

          -  Patient in whom endocrine treatment is indicated. Patient having undergoing
             prostatectomy or radiotherapy with curative intention and has a rising serum PSA (PSA
             ≥ 2 ng/mL at screening) may be included.

          -  Has a serum testosterone level above 2.2 ng/mL at screening.

          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score of 0 to
             2 at screening.

          -  Has a serum PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL at screening.

          -  Has a life expectancy of at least 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or present endocrine treatment for prostate cancer. Example: surgical
             castration, GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, antiandrogens or oestrogens, and
             5α-reductase inhibitors.

          -  Received a 5α-reductase inhibitor within 25 weeks preceding screening.

          -  Is a candidate for curative therapy, i.e., radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy
             within 12 months.

          -  Has concurrent or a history of poorly controlled severe asthma, anaphylactic
             reactions, severe urticaria or angioedema.

          -  Has hypersensitivity towards mannitol.

          -  Has a marked prolongation of QT/QTc interval (two consecutive increases to &gt;450 ms in
             QTc interval at retest) at screening.

          -  Has concurrent or a history of a disease (heart failure, hypokalemia, a family history
             of QT prolongation syndrome, etc.) that may induce Torsade de Pointes.
