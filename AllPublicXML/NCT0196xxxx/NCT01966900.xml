  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potential HIV vaccine has two components: a protein immunogen based on the coat protein
      of HIV; and an adjuvant which enhances the vaccinee's response to the immunogen. The
      immunogen is CN54gp140, and the adjuvant is glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant - aqueous
      formulation (GLA-AF).

      We wish to assess the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity (the nature of the immune response
      stimulated by the vaccine) when it is given in two different dose regimens:

      Group A: vaccinations at Months 0, 1, 2 and 6Í¾ and Group B: vaccinations at Months 0, 1, 2
      and 12.

      Each dose will be an intramuscular injection of 100 micrograms of CN54gp140 mixed with 5
      micrograms of GLA-AF.

      We will recruit only healthy, HIV-uninfected men and women. We will assess the safety of the
      vaccine by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events in the participants. We will assess
      the immunogenicity of the vaccine by monitoring the immune response to the vaccine in blood
      and in genital mucosal secretion samples.

             from the day of first vaccination until at least 4 months after the last vaccination;

          -  Willing to forgo donations of blood or any other tissues during the study and, for
             those who test HIV-positive due to trial vaccination (vaccine-induced HIV

             positive partner) either currently or within the past six months; unprotected anal
             intercourse in the last six months, outside a relationship with a regular partner
             known to be HIV negative; or unprotected vaginal intercourse in the last six months
             outside a relationship with a regular known/presumed HIV negative partner.

          -  Reported abnormal cervical cytology or previous or ongoing treatment for Cervical
             Intraepithelial Neoplasia;

             formal diagnosis and has intramuscular injections and blood draws without any adverse
             experience, is eligible);

             within the previous 3 months or expected participation during this study;

          -  Prior receipt of another investigational HIV vaccine candidate (Note: receipt of
             placebo in a previous HIV vaccine trial will not exclude a volunteer from

             respiratory difficulty, angioedema);

          -  Psychiatric condition that compromises safety of the volunteer and precludes
             compliance with the protocol. Specifically excluded are persons with psychoses within

             within the past 3 years;

          -  Seizure disorder: a participant who has had a seizure in the last 3 years is excluded.
             (Not excluded: a participant with a history of seizures who has neither required
             medications nor had a seizure for 3 years.);

          -  If female, history of toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which would preclude the use of
             Softcup;

          -  If female, current use of intrauterine device (IUD), which would preclude the use of
             Softcup;

          -  If, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, it is not in the best interest of
             the volunteer to participate in the trial.
