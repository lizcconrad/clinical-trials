      BACKGROUND: Smartphone technology presents a novel and promising opportunity to extend the
      reach of psychotherapeutic interventions by moving selected parts of the therapy into the
      real-life situations causing distress. This randomised controlled trial will investigate the
      effect of a transdiagnostic, Internet-administered cognitive behavioural (iCBT) self-help
      program for anxiety, supplemented with a tailored smartphone application. The effect of added
      therapist support will also be studied.

      METHODS/DESIGN: 150 participants meeting diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder
      and/or panic disorder will be evenly randomised to one of three treatment arms: (1)
      smartphone-supplemented iCBT with therapist support; (2) smartphone-supplemented iCBT without
      therapist support; or (3) an active waiting list control group with delayed treatment. After
      the 10 week treatment period, the control group (3) will receive the same treatment as group
      (2). Primary outcome measure will be the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item self-rating
      scale. Secondary measures include other anxiety, depression and quality of life measures. In
      addition to pre- and post-treatment measurements, the study includes two mid-treatment and
      two follow-up assessments (12 and 24 months).

      HYPOTHESES: Based on prior research, we hypothesise that the therapist-guided form will be
      superior to the unguided form in reducing anxiety levels, and that both delivery modes will
      be superior to an active waiting-list control group.

    <description>The Internet-administered cognitive behavioural self-help program (iCBT) will be divided into 10 weekly, progressively available modules covering CBT and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) conceptualisations of anxiety disorders, as well as more specific therapeutic techniques such as cognitive restructuring, exposure training, attention and breathing exercises and relapse prevention . Each module also includes writing exercises.
Also included is a tailored smartphone application. Briefly, the application allows the user to access, create and modify a personal database of behaviours and check-off these behaviours immediately when completed. Frequency of carried-out behaviours are recorded and displayed as statistics. The application also allows users to browse and search a database of behaviours uploaded by other study participants, providing both inspiration and a sense of social support.</description>

    <description>The role of the therapists will be to provide feedback on the written exercises of each treatment module, as well as to provide support and encouragement. As a rule of thumb, the therapists will devote 15 minutes per participant and week.</description>
