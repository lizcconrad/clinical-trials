      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dose escalation of
      Icotinib in advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after the therapy of
      Icotinib, Iressa and Tarceva.

      -  1:to evaluate the efficacy correlation between the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs
           and high-dose Icotonib group in advanced NSCLC patients with high -dose Icotinib going
           on after the routine TKI therapy

        -  2 to evaluate the efficacy correlation between different high-dose group in advanced
           NSCLC patients with high -dose Icotinib going on after the routine TKI therapy

    <description>The efficacy of dose escalation of Icotinib in advanced NSCLC patients after failure of TKI (Icotinib 125mg po tid. Iressa 250mg po qd. Tarceva 150mg po qd) therapy will be evaluated according to the revised RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors).
The safety of high dosage of Icotinib will be evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.</description>
