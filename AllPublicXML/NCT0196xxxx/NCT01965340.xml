      Sepsis is the major cause of morbidity and mortality amongst burn patients. Burn shock and
      respiratory failure that used to be the major cause of mortality have progressively been
      replaced by sepsis and multiple organ failure. It is not rare that treatment failures occurs
      several weeks, or even months after injury as a consequence of sepsis usually caused by
      multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms. Introduction of early surgery combined with
      topical and systemic antibiotherapy dramatically enhanced survival from sepsis after burn
      trauma, but further improvement is impaired by the rapid development of hard-to-treat MDR
      bacteria.

      Correct prescription of anti-infective agents could be one way to curb the steadily
      increasing development of multidrug resistance. Administration of antibiotic to burn patient
      is complex: they frequently suffer from kidney dysfunction, they usually experience
      tremendous shifts of liquids between intra-vascular - inter-cellular and intra-cellular
      compartments, they often are hypo-albumin and protein-emic, and finally they present with a
      profoundly modified metabolism. All those aspects make this particular population of patients
      at high risk of both under or over prescription.

      Monitoring of drug concentrations in the plasma of patients, so-called TDM for Therapeutic
      Drug Monitoring, has been introduced to clinical practice for several decades primarily to
      avoid toxicity of a small number of drugs with narrow therapeutic windows. However, with the
      increasing availability of detection techniques, the number of drugs that can be measured in
      the plasma of patients has grown tremendously over the last decade. As a consequence, it is
      currently possible to monitor drug concentrations not only to prevent toxicity, but also to
      improve efficacy. For instance, several studies demonstrated that TDM improved antibiotic
      prescription in different populations of hospitalized patients, including critically ill
      patients, with a direct impact on outcome.

      Such studies amongst burn patients are however lacking, although this particular population
      is at high risk to suffer from mis-prescription. We thus hypothesize that systematic TDM
      could improve antibiotic prescription in this peculiar population. To this end, we propose to
      implement a 3-year prospective, randomized, mono-centric, clinical trial that will analyze
      the impact of systematic TDM on anti-infective agent prescription amongst burned patients.
