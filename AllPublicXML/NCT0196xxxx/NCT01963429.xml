      The sample size for this study was based on a non-inferiority design. Primary objective:
      estimate local progression-free survival (LPFS) rate in two treatments Primary endpoint:
      2-year LPFS rate Expected 2-year LPFS rate in the RFA: 85% Accural time and follow up time:
      24 months and 24 months, respectively. Precision for 2-year LPFS rate estimation: Allowing a
      difference of 15% as the non-inferiority margin, with a power of 80% and a type I error level
      of 5%, evaluable 68 patients are required.

      Considering 5% of follow-up loss, we need 72 patients in each arm, so a total of 144 patients
      will be enrolled.
