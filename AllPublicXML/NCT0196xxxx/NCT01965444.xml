      The objective of this study is to establish required data for SEM Scanner analysis of the
      readings given by the SEM Scanner in the target patient population.. In order to better
      understand the data this non-invasive scanner provides a collection of data/readings is
      required to be collected in a certain population. This will help with clinical interpretation
      of the numbers and readings this device will provide.

             enrollment.

          -  Subject is agreeable to having skin assessments, blanchability tests, and SEM Scanner
             readings performed daily at all anatomical sites for a duration of five (5) days, with
             photography as needed.

          -  Subject is admitted to an intensive Care Unit (ICU) and has an anticipated ICU course

          -  Subject is anticipated to be bedridden for ore than 6 hours per day.

          -  All four (4) of the subject's anatomical sites in question (sternum, sacrum, left heel
             and right heel) are accessible for scanning (e.g., no cast or medical device present
             such that heels are not accessible).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has broken skin or scar tissue at the sternum, sacrum, left heel or right
             heel.

          -  Subjects for whom the physical act of performing the inspections and measurements
             required in this study are contra-indicated, as determined by the principal
             investigator or attending physician.

          -  Subjects or legal representatives who are unable to understand the aims and objectives
