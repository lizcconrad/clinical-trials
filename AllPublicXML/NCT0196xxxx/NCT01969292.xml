  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our team has created an automated, real-time software based image analysis tool called
      Colometer to improve screening colonoscopy providing real time visual feedback on image
      quality. There are three components to this study. The first is to validate the bowel
      assessment preparation using the recorded colonoscopy videos from 50 consented normal risk
      patients. In the second phase, technological and machine user interface refinements will be
      identified and completed. Finally, the third phase will be a sham controlled prospective
      study of Colometer versus standard care in 100 consented average risk patients undergoing
      screening colonoscopy as performed by 10 consented endoscopists.

    <description>This is defined as the Percentage of the total withdrawal time where the withdrawal velocity is below a set speed limit and the view is clear (ie, not blurry) as measured by the software. Visualization of the colon lumen is ideal with a slow, non-blurry view in order to detect polyps.</description>
