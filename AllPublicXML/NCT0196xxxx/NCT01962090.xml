  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the short term effects of two different thoracic spine
      thrust manipulation techniques on neck range of motion, pain, and self-reported disability in
      a sample of dental students experiencing neck pain.

      The hypothesis of the study is that there will be a difference between the two thoracic spine
      thrust manipulation techniques for short term effects on neck range of motion, pain, and
      self-reported disability in a sample of dental students experiencing neck pain.

             overall average of the participant's rating of current, least, and worst pain
             experienced over the previous 24 hours on separate numeric pain rating scales where 0
             corresponds to &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 corresponds to &quot;worst pain possible&quot;.

          -  Neck Disability Index (NDI) score &gt; 10 points (measure of self-reported disability
