  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training is recognized as effective in preventing and treating many chronic
      metabolic disorders (1), and long-term exercise programmes have similar effects on glucose
      control as long-term drug or insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients (2). The precise
      intensity and volume of aerobic exercise needed to produce the most wanted effects on
      targeted risk factors for subjects at risk of/with established type 2 diabetes, is still
      uncertain. In this study the investigators will investigate the acute effects of a single
      bout of moderate versus high intensity exercise on insulin sensitivity in pregnant women with
      and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The investigators think that very short
      bouts of high intensity exercise can be a way to reduce blood glucose in these women.

    <description>insulin sensitivity index, as described by Matsuda and DeFronzo. This calculation uses the fasting plasma glucose and plasma insulin, and the average plasma glucose and insulin values over the 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and is calculated as:. 10 000/âˆš[fasting glucose x fasting insulin) x (mean glucose during OGTT x mean insulin during OGTT)]. We will use a carbohydrate rich meal instead of a classic oral glucose tolerance test with glucose in water.</description>
