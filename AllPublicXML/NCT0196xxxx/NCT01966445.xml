  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 3 (HER3) expression is seen across a wide variety of
      solid malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis. Up-regulation of HER3 expression
      and activity is also associated with resistance to multiple pathway inhibitors. GSK2849330, a
      monoclonal antibody targeting HER3, is a new agent for subjects whose tumors express HER3.
      This study is a phase I, first time in human, open-label, dose escalation study. The purpose
      of this study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      of GSK2849330 in subjects with advanced HER3-positive solid tumors. The study will be
      conducted in two parts. Part 1 (Dose-Escalation Phase) will include dose escalation and PK/PD
      cohorts to evaluate safety, PK, and PD to guide selection of dose regimen(s) for Part 2. In
      Part 2 (Expansion Cohorts), up to 3 cohorts will be enrolled at the dose regimen(s) selected
      based on Part 1 data, to evaluate safety in a larger cohort of subjects at the recommended
      dose regimen and also to evaluate preliminary evidence of clinical benefit.
