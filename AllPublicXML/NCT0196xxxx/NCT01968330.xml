      This study will be a randomized controlled trial involving obese women obtaining prenatal
      care at an obstetric care clinic. Study subjects will undergo prenatal care in a group
      setting or prenatal care with a behavioral intervention to improve sleep. Anthropometric
      measurements, blood draws, questionnaires and at home sleep studies will be completed at
      three specified times (two antepartum and one postpartum). Primary outcome will be a
      comparison of postpartum weight loss amongst the intervention and control groups.

    <measure>Weight loss at 6 weeks postpartum.</measure>
    <time_frame>six weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary objective of this study is to determine if a sleep intervention delivered in a group prenatal care setting of obese women can improve weight loss at one year postpartum (i.e. patient's ability to loose weight gained in pregnancy). This will be accomplished by:
Randomizing study subjects to groups with or without a sleep intervention component
Assessing weight, neck and abdominal circumference at each prenatal visit and at six weeks postpartum
Obtaining information regarding the patient's pre-pregnancy weight.
Assessing baseline sleep habits with at home polysomnography and actigraphy and repeating these measurements in the late third trimester as well as postpartum.
Assessing sleep habits through the Epworth Sleepiness scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at baseline.
Obtaining qualitative feedback on the patient's experience with the sleep program and their sleep habits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Affects of improved sleep on insulin resistance and cholesterol levels</measure>
    <time_frame>From the second trimester of pregnancy to six weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective will be to assess the affect of a sleep intervention on insulin resistance and cholesterol levels. This will be accomplished by:
Assessing glucose, insulin, HOMA, AUCgluc, leptin, adiponectin, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride levels at four time points in pregnancy and postpartum.
Completing the PRIME screen, a diet assessment tool, at approximately 20 weeks, 34 weeks and 6 and weeks postpartum
Assessing the neonates body composition at birth.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of improved sleep on mental health</measure>
    <time_frame>Second trimester of pregnancy to six weeks postpartum.</time_frame>
    <description>The tertiary objective will be to assess the affect of a sleep intervention on mental health This will be accomplished by
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) at approximately 24 weeks, 38 weeks, and 6 weeks postpartum
Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) at approximately 20 weeks gestation
Edinburgh Depression Scale at approximately 24 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum
COPE scale for ability to cope with stress at approximately 24 weeks, 38 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum
Obtaining qualitative feedback on the patient's mental health status throughout pregnancy.</description>

    <description>Patients in the sleep intervention arm will undergo a sleep wellness program entitled Go!®to sleep as part of their group prenatal visits. This intervention is a six-week online program developed by the Cleveland clinic for non-pregnant patients suffering from insomnia. In collaboration with the Cleveland clinic sleep disorders center researchers will modify the program to fit the specific needs of a pregnant population. Subjects will receive access to the program and instructed on its use at their initial group prenatal visit. In subsequent visits subjects will be able to discuss their experience with the program.</description>
