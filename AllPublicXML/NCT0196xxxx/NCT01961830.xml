  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-dose study. The primary objective is to determine
      Epithelial Lining Fluid (ELF) levels of ME1100 after a single orally inhaled dose. The
      secondary objectives are to determine systemic exposure to inhaled ME1100 and to assess
      tolerability and safety of a single dose of ME1100 inhalation solution.
