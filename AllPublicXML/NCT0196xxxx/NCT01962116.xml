    <textblock>
      After obtaining written informed consent and inclusion, patients will be randomised into 2
      groups for the type of dialysis catheter lock:

        -  The first group will have a citrate lock

        -  The second group will have a heparin lock Patients will be stratified according to the
           centre and type of Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) continuous or intermittent.

      The daily surveillance of patients will be no different from the usual surveillance of
      patients on Renal Replacement Therapy.

      The hemodialysis catheters used will be specific Renal Replacement Therapy catheters.

      The decision to withdraw the catheter will be made by the investigator and based on clinical
      criteria (complications related to the catheter, termination of Renal Replacement Therapyâ€¦)
