  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a family-based
      program to improve physical activity and tobacco outcomes in a small pilot of middle school
      students and their families.

    <textblock>
      Low income ethnic minority youth tend to be at greater risk for obesity, physical inactivity,
      high risk behaviors such as tobacco and substance use and resulting cardiovascular and
      chronic disease. In this study we modified a tobacco and substance use risk prevention
      program to develop a tailored intervention (Healthy Families DC) that also included promotion
      of physical activity (PA) for DC middle-school students referred by school staff as
      over-weight and at risk for problem behaviors. The program included an initial family
      assessment, a family feedback session with family PA goal setting and 6 phone/text based
      booster sessions. A pilot study with 18 families, comprised of at least one caregiver and
      target child, was conducted to examine feasibility, acceptability, and trends in preliminary
      outcomes such as PA via self-report and accelerometry, health risk behaviors (e.g., tobacco
      use), health goal setting, and changes in family functioning (e.g., youth positive behaviors,
      parenting).
