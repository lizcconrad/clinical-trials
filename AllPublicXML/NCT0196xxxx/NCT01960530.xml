  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate a new drug called Infacort®; a newly-developed immediate release
      formulation of a well-established drug called hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone is used as a
      replacement treatment for people whose adrenal glands are not producing enough natural
      cortisol - a condition known as adrenal insufficiency. The study will assess how Infacort®
      acts once inside the body, by measuring cortisol and other hormone levels in the body,
      compared to already marketed hydrocortisone tablet and hydrocortisone intravenous (through
      the vein) injection.

      The population who are eligible to take part in the study are healthy male volunteers, aged
      between 18 and 60 years of age.

      The study will evaluate the normal physiology, PK and metabolism of cortisol, investigate the
      PK and bioavailability of cortisol from the test Infacort® Granules (hydrocortisone) and the
      reference hydrocortisone tablets and i.v injection in healthy adult male volunteers and
      explore the role of cortisol in the regulation of metabolic pathways.

Subjects were observed over a 24 hour period, during which sleep disruption was minimised, to record their endogenous cortisol production as a baseline figure and to confirm eligibility for the subsequent study periods.
Study Period 2 (Dexamethasone): Subjects were admitted to the unit following a final confirmation of eligibility, prior to administration with Dexamethasone.
Study Periods 3 and 4 (Infacort Granules or Hydrocortisone Tablets): Subjects were admitted to the unit and ongoing eligibility was confirmed. Subjects received both treatments (1 in Period 3, and 1 in Period 4), and were randomised using the PROC PLAN procedure of SAS. Subjects received Dexamethasone 1 hour prior to IMP administration.
Study Period 5 (I.V. Hydrocortisone Injection): Subjects were admitted to the unit and ongoing eligibility was confirmed. Subjects received Dexamethasone 1 hour prior to IMP administration.</description>
