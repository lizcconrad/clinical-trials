    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Mishaps were reported by scuba divers themselves, at the end of their diving day (the day they were enrolled). Mishaps are precursors of injuries. Injuries are less common outcomes (in fact, nobody got injured), hence we used mishaps - which allowed us to test the efficacy of pre-dive checklists, and do so with limited resources.</description>

    <description>The pre-dive checklist included a checklist of tasks to be undertaken before the dive, a dive-plan that asked the diver to plan the depth, and amount of gas kept at different levels of diving, and 4 dive tips.</description>
