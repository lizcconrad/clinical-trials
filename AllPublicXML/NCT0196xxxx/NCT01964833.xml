  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and periodontal disease is bidirectional. DM
      is a predisposing and modifying factor of periodontitis, which, in turn, worsens glycemic
      control and increases proteins found in the acute phase of inflammation. The gold standard
      for the treatment of periodontal disease is oral hygiene orientation, scaling and planing.
      Moreover, systemic antibiotic therapy may be employed in some cases. In an effort to minimize
      the prescription of antibiotics, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been studied as an
      antimicrobial technique and has demonstrated promising results. The aim of the proposed study
      is to determine whether PDT as a complement to periodontal therapy (PT) is helpful in the
      metabolic control of individuals with type 2 diabetes and the reduction of acute phase
      inflammatory markers. The patients will be randomized using a proper software program into
      two groups: 1) PT + placebo PDT or 2) PT + active PDT. All patients will first be examined by
      a specialist, followed by PT performed by two other healthcare professionals. At the end of
      each session, PDT (active or sham) will be administered by a fourth healthcare professional.
      The following will be the PDT parameters: diode laser (660 nm); power output = 110 mW;
      exposure time = 90 seconds per point (9 J/point); and energy density = 22 J/cm2. The
      photosensitizer will be methylene blue (50 µg/mL). The patients will be re-evaluated 15, 30,
      90 and 180 days after treatment. Serological exams with complete blood count, fasting
      glucose, glycated hemoglobin and crevicular fluid exams to screen for tumor necrosis factor
      alpha, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin/RANKL will be performed at
      each evaluation. At baseline and 180 day periapical radiographs will be performed to evaluate
      the alveolar bone crest level. The data will be statistically evaluated using the most
      appropriate tests.

      Randomization of the patients to the different groups will be performed with the appropriate
      software program. Only the lead researcher will have access to the randomization list.
      Allocation to the two groups will be carried out in blocks of four.

      The patients will be sent to Operator A for the periodontal exam. Without knowledge of the
      results of this exam, the patients will be treated by Operators B and C for periodontal
      treatment, which will involve oral hygiene instructions as well as supra-gingival and
      sub-gingival scaling and planing in up to four sessions. At the end of each session, the
      patients will be sent to Operator D, who will administer either placebo or active PDT based
      on the content of the sealed envelope. Thus, both the patients and operator in charge of the
      periodontal exams will be blinded to the PDT protocol (double-blind study).

      Fasting blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin exams will be performed at baseline as well as
      15, 30, 90 and 180 days after the completion of treatment. All exams will be carried out at
      the same laboratory affiliated with the university.

      The clinical periodontal exams will be performed by a single examiner specialized in
      periodontics, who will evaluate six regions of each tooth with a 15-mm probe (North Carolina
      model, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). The following aspects will be recorded: plaque index,
      bleeding upon probing, probing depth, gingival recession and attachment loss (Armitage,
      2004). Evaluations will be carried out performed at baseline (prior to initial treatment) as
      well as 15, 30, 90 and 180 days after the completion of treatment.

      Patients will receive periodontal treatment and photodynamic therapy (active or sham
      depending on the allocation).

      Crevicular fluid will be collected from the previously defined sites with a probing depth
      equal to or greater than 4 mm that will receive treatment. Collection will be performed with
      relative isolation using cotton rolls following the removal of supra-gingival plaque with
      periodontal curettes and air drying for five seconds. Absorbent paper strips (PerioPaper,
      ProFlow Inc., Amityville, NY, USA) will be individually inserted into each site for 30
      seconds (Rudin et al., 1970). The collections will be performed by a single researcher. The
      volume of crevicular fluid samples will be measured using the Periotron 8000 micro-moisture
      meter (Oraflow Inc., NY, USA). The samples will then be placed in duly identified sterile
      plastic microtubes, temporarily stored in dry ice and subsequently stored in a freezer at -80
      ºC

Calculus deposits will also be removed using ultrasound equipment with the appropriate tips for periodontics as well as scaling and planing with dental instruments, as recommended by the AAP (2001). Treatment will be carried out in two to four one-hour sessions.

    <description>Patients will receive periodontal treatment as previously described and PDT. PDT will be administered at the end of the periodontal treatment session at sites with pocket depths equal to or greater than 4 mm. A diode laser will be used at the 660 nm wavelength, P= 100 mW, 9 J/point, D = 22 J/cm2 (per point). The photosensitizer (BlueMet 0.005 % DMC)will be deposited at the fundus of the periodontal pocket using a syringe. The laser will be applied to the mucosa over the oral epithelium that lines the periodontal pocket using an optical fiber.</description>
