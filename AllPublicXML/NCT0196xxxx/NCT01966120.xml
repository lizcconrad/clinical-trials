    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz)
      versus placebo in the field-directed treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis with
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp.

    <textblock>
      The study was performed as a randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo- controlled,
      parallel-group, phase III trial with BF-200 ALA and placebo in seven centres in Germany. A
      total of 94 patients were screened in this study; 87 were randomized (55 patients received
      BF-200 ALA, 32 received placebo). Patients received one PDT. If residual lesions remained at
      3 months after treatment, PDT was repeated. Illumination was performed with the PDT lamp
      BF-RhodoLED.

    <measure>Overall Patient Complete Response 12 Weeks After the Last Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after PDT 1 or 12 weeks after PDT 2 which might have been necessary because not all lesions were cleared after the first PDT</time_frame>
    <description>All efficacy variables were evaluated for the FAS. The primary efficacy variable was also analyzed for the PP population. All subgroup analyses were carried out for the FAS. Data for size and grade of AK lesions were analyzed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach, affecting the response rates evaluation.
Due to the small amount of missing data in the study, which did not have any relevant impact on primary results, sensitivity analyses for missing data were not performed.
The primary efficacy variable was the overall patient complete response 12 weeks after the last PDT. An overall complete responder was defined as a patient in whom all treated actinic keratosis (AK) lesions were cleared (Olsen score of 0) after the last PDT, i.e. after PDT 1 or after PDT 2 if re-treatment was performed.</description>

    <measure>Patient Histopathological Confirmed Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after PDT 1 or 12 weeks after PDT 2 which might have been necessary because not all lesions were cleared after the first PDT</time_frame>
    <description>For the secondary confirmatory analysis, several superiority hypotheses were tested within a pre-defined hierarchic multiple testing procedure as described in the Statistical Analysis Protocoll (SAP).
The key secondary efficacy variables were tested strictly in a pre-defined order to ensure the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the testing procedure had to be stopped once the first non-significant test was obtained.
The results of the confirmatory analysis are presented in the order pre-defined by the confirmatory testing procedure.
Assessments of the patient histopathological confirmed response (HCR) rates were based on the results from the biopsy taken 12 weeks after the last PDT from a representative AK lesion selected at screening. If the biopsy result for a patient revealed a residual AK, the patient was considered &quot;not cleared&quot; for the analysis irrespectively of the investigator's clinical assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks after PDT 1 or 12 weeks after PDT 2 which might have been necessary because not all lesions were cleared after the first PDT</time_frame>
    <description>Study personnel assessed and recorded the skin quality of the treated field(s) at baseline and at the end-of-study visit including skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring and atrophy.
Upon visual examination of the treated field(s), the investigator coded the intensity of each skin parameter on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.
The cosmetic outcome evaluations were based on the sum score of the skin quality assessment (sum of all ratings for each skin parameter) at the end-of-study visit (Visit 4 or Visit 6, if retreated).
The outcome was calculated using a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;very good&quot; (0) to &quot;impaired&quot; (4) based on the change of the skin quality assessments compared to baseline (0 = 2 points improvement; 1 = 1 point improvement; 2 = no change; 3 = 1 point worsened; 4 = at least 2 points worsened).</description>

After lesion preparation, the entire content of 1 tube of verum was applied to the treatment fields identified for this study at screening. The verum was applied to the entire field(s) covering a size of approx. 20 cm² with a film of about 1 mm thickness. Application near the eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, or mucosa was to be avoided (by a distance of 1 cm). After application, the investigational medicinal product (IMP) was allowed to dry for approx. 10 minutes before occlusion.
Following incubation of 3 hours (+/- 10 minutes) the dressing was removed and the remnant gel wiped off with a 0.9% saline solution. Thereafter illumination was performed using BF-RhodoLED lamp (635 nm) applying a total light dose of 37 J/cm² (per treated field). This treatment was performed once and repeated after 12 weeks if no complete response was observed.</description>

        <title>Overall Patient Complete Response 12 Weeks After the Last Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)</title>
        <description>All efficacy variables were evaluated for the FAS. The primary efficacy variable was also analyzed for the PP population. All subgroup analyses were carried out for the FAS. Data for size and grade of AK lesions were analyzed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach, affecting the response rates evaluation.
Due to the small amount of missing data in the study, which did not have any relevant impact on primary results, sensitivity analyses for missing data were not performed.
The primary efficacy variable was the overall patient complete response 12 weeks after the last PDT. An overall complete responder was defined as a patient in whom all treated actinic keratosis (AK) lesions were cleared (Olsen score of 0) after the last PDT, i.e. after PDT 1 or after PDT 2 if re-treatment was performed.</description>

After lesion preparation, the entire content of 1 tube of verum was applied to the treatment fields identified for this study at screening. The verum was applied to the entire field(s) covering a size of approx. 20 cm² with a film of about 1 mm thickness. Application near the eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, or mucosa was to be avoided (by a distance of 1 cm). After application, the IMP was allowed to dry for approx. 10 minutes before occlusion.
Following incubation of 3 hours (+/- 10 minutes) the dressing was removed and the remnant gel wiped off with a 0.9% saline solution. Thereafter illumination was performed using BF-RhodoLED lamp (635 nm) applying a total light dose of 37 J/cm² (per treated field). This treatment was performed once and repeated after 12 weeks if no complete response was observed.</description>

        <description>For the secondary confirmatory analysis, several superiority hypotheses were tested within a pre-defined hierarchic multiple testing procedure as described in the Statistical Analysis Protocoll (SAP).
The key secondary efficacy variables were tested strictly in a pre-defined order to ensure the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the testing procedure had to be stopped once the first non-significant test was obtained.
The results of the confirmatory analysis are presented in the order pre-defined by the confirmatory testing procedure.
Assessments of the patient histopathological confirmed response (HCR) rates were based on the results from the biopsy taken 12 weeks after the last PDT from a representative AK lesion selected at screening. If the biopsy result for a patient revealed a residual AK, the patient was considered “not cleared” for the analysis irrespectively of the investigator’s clinical assessment.</description>

            <description>Photodynamic therapy with BF-200 ALA
After lesion preparation, the entire content of 1 tube of verum was applied to the treatment fields identified for this study at screening. The verum was applied to the entire field(s) covering a size of approx. 20 cm² with a film of about 1 mm thickness. Application near the eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, or mucosa was to be avoided (by a distance of 1 cm). After application, the IMP was allowed to dry for approx. 10 minutes before occlusion.
Following incubation of 3 hours (+/- 10 minutes) the dressing was removed and the remnant gel wiped off with a 0.9% saline solution. Thereafter illumination was performed using BF-RhodoLED lamp (635 nm) applying a total light dose of 37 J/cm² (per treated field). This treatment was performed once and repeated after 12 weeks if no complete response was observed.</description>

        <description>Study personnel assessed and recorded the skin quality of the treated field(s) at baseline and at the end-of-study visit including skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring and atrophy.
Upon visual examination of the treated field(s), the investigator coded the intensity of each skin parameter on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.
The cosmetic outcome evaluations were based on the sum score of the skin quality assessment (sum of all ratings for each skin parameter) at the end-of-study visit (Visit 4 or Visit 6, if retreated).
The outcome was calculated using a 5-point scale ranging from “very good” (0) to “impaired” (4) based on the change of the skin quality assessments compared to baseline (0 = 2 points improvement; 1 = 1 point improvement; 2 = no change; 3 = 1 point worsened; 4 = at least 2 points worsened).</description>

        <title>Overall Cosmetic Outcome 12 Weeks After Last PDT for Patients With Sum Score at Baseline of 1 to 3</title>
        <description>Study personnel assessed and recorded the skin quality of the treated field(s) at baseline and at the end-of-study visit including skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring and atrophy.
Upon visual examination of the treated field(s), the investigator coded the intensity of each skin parameter on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.
The cosmetic outcome evaluations were based on the sum score of the skin quality assessment (sum of all ratings for each skin parameter) at the end-of-study visit (Visit 4 or Visit 6, if retreated).
The outcome was calculated using a 5-point scale ranging from “very good” (0) to “impaired” (4) based on the change of the skin quality assessments compared to baseline (0 = 2 points improvement; 1 = 1 point improvement; 2 = no change; 3 = 1 point worsened; 4 = at least 2 points worsened).</description>

After lesion preparation, the entire content of 1 tube of verum was applied to the treatment fields identified for this study at screening. The verum was applied to the entire field(s) covering a size of approx. 20 cm² with a film of about 1 mm thickness. Application near the eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, or mucosa was to be avoided (by a distance of 1 cm). After application, the IMP was allowed to dry for approx. 10 minutes before occlusion.
Following incubation of 3 hours (+/- 10 minutes) the dressing was removed and the remnant gel wiped off with a 0.9% saline solution. Thereafter illumination was performed using BF-RhodoLED lamp (635 nm) applying a total light dose of 37 J/cm² (per treated field). This treatment was performed once and repeated after 12 weeks if no complete response was observed.</description>

        <description>All efficacy variables were evaluated for the FAS. The primary efficacy variable was also analyzed for the PP population. All subgroup analyses were carried out for the FAS. Data for size and grade of AK lesions were analyzed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach, affecting the response rates evaluation.
Due to the small amount of missing data in the study, which did not have any relevant impact on primary results, sensitivity analyses for missing data were not performed.
The primary efficacy variable was the overall patient complete response 12 weeks after the last PDT. An overall complete responder was defined as a patient in whom all treated AK lesions were cleared (Olsen score of 0) after the last PDT, i.e. after PDT 1 or after PDT 2 if re-treatment was performed.</description>
