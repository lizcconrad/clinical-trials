  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is that ruxolitinib may be a possible treatment option for relapsed
      or refractory patients with Hodgkin and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.

      Patients will take ruxolitinib 20 mg orally twice a day, 40mg in total per day, for 4 weeks.4
      weeks is 1 cycle. Treatment will be continued until documented disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity and the maximum period of treatment is 16 cycles.
