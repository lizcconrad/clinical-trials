  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that nipple-areola skin sparing mastectomy (NASSM) performed
      through an inframammary incision has a superior blood supply relative to a lateral oblique
      incision. Moreover, by minimizing complications and optimizing aesthetic outcomes, the
      investigators believe it will be associated with significantly higher patient reported
      outcome scores. The addition of information gained by use of intraoperative laser-assisted
      fluorescent angiography (measured with the Spy Elite imaging device) will reduce complication
      rates by directing intraoperative resection of ischemic tissue and limiting the volume of
      immediate implant placement in instances where real time imaging would suggest compromised
      perfusion. These quantifiable, objective measures will justify the use of NASSM and immediate
      implant placement coupled with intraoperative laser-assisted fluorescent angiography in
      prosthetic based breast reconstruction despite longer operative times.

    <description>Laser-assisted fluorescent angiography via the Spy Elite imaging device will be utilized to capture this data during mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction. Standard postoperative patient follow up will assess for perfusion.
The Spy device quantifies perfusion by measuring relative fluorescence of indocyanine green bound to plasma proteins. This produces an intensity value of 0-255 based on an 8-bit greyscale. The investigators measured this value preoperatively when measured and compared to the post-intervention measurement. The device can calculate the cumulative intensity of a defined region of interest which the investigators categorized as the lateral, lower, medial, or nipple-areola region of the breast. The investigators also evaluated the cumulative value of these areas in total. Rate of perfusion was simply this value over time (90 seconds).</description>

    <measure>Breast Q Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post permanent implant placement</time_frame>
    <description>-The BREAST-Q is a previously validated instrument which measures patient reported outcomes. It has several iterations including the one utilized here which is specific for implant-based breast reconstruction. Each of its 6 domains generates a Q-score from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest). A higher number indicates a higher satisfaction or better quality of life than a lower number. Based on answers to the questions, each individual will generate a whole number score for each domain. The patient can be sampled preoperatively and postoperatively as well as over time to calculate the impact of intervention and time on this value. Q-scores are calculated for each domain, and the investigators report a mean value based on data from an entire cohort for the particular domain. Domains include evaluation of overall satisfaction with breasts, physical well being, sexual well being, as well as satisfaction with office staff, information provided, and the provider.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be scheduled to undergo either a single or bilateral elective
             nipple-areola skin sparing mastectomy (NASSM) procedure with planned immediate
             reconstruction.

          -  Patient must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Scale of at least 80%.

          -  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive impairment.

          -  BMI &lt; 18 or &gt; 35

          -  Breast &gt;800 grams or &lt;100 grams in predicted weight. &quot;Breast&quot; includes the breast
             tissue and in cases where the patient already has cosmetic breast implants, the
             additional breast implant mass. The sum total must be &gt;100 g and &lt;800 g.

          -  History of radiation to the chest wall or breast being studied

          -  Patients who have a history of allergy to iodides or iodinated contrast agents

          -  Surgeon's opinion at the time of surgery that the subject's well-being would be
             compromised (e.g. significant comorbidities, intraoperative findings of a higher stage
             cancer or other independent acute health problems). If the contralateral breast is
             undergoing a nipple-sparing mastectomy with reconstruction as well, then the
             contralateral breast can be studied so long as there is no compromise to any element
             of their care.

        <description>Laser-assisted fluorescent angiography via the Spy Elite imaging device will be utilized to capture this data during mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction. Standard postoperative patient follow up will assess for perfusion.
The Spy device quantifies perfusion by measuring relative fluorescence of indocyanine green bound to plasma proteins. This produces an intensity value of 0-255 based on an 8-bit greyscale. The investigators measured this value preoperatively when measured and compared to the post-intervention measurement. The device can calculate the cumulative intensity of a defined region of interest which the investigators categorized as the lateral, lower, medial, or nipple-areola region of the breast. The investigators also evaluated the cumulative value of these areas in total. Rate of perfusion was simply this value over time (90 seconds).</description>

        <title>Breast Q Score</title>
        <description>-The BREAST-Q is a previously validated instrument which measures patient reported outcomes. It has several iterations including the one utilized here which is specific for implant-based breast reconstruction. Each of its 6 domains generates a Q-score from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest). A higher number indicates a higher satisfaction or better quality of life than a lower number. Based on answers to the questions, each individual will generate a whole number score for each domain. The patient can be sampled preoperatively and postoperatively as well as over time to calculate the impact of intervention and time on this value. Q-scores are calculated for each domain, and the investigators report a mean value based on data from an entire cohort for the particular domain. Domains include evaluation of overall satisfaction with breasts, physical well being, sexual well being, as well as satisfaction with office staff, information provided, and the provider.</description>
