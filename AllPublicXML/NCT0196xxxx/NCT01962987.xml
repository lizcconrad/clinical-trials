  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bioequivalence in the Per-Protocol Population by evaluating the 90% CI of the difference between the proportion of patients in the test group and the proportion of patients in the reference group with 100% clearance of all AK</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure of bioequivalence will be evaluated using those patients who complete the study according to the (PP) population. The primary measure of interest is the proportion of patients in the per protocol (PP) population in each treatment group who are considered to have 100% clearance of all the AK lesions within the treatment area, assessed at study day 90 after the 60 days of treatment.
If the 90% confidence interval (using Yates Correction) of the difference between the proportion of patients considered to have 100% clearance of all AK lesions in the treatment area, assessed 30 days after the end of treatment (Day 90) in the test and the reference product groups is contained within -20%, +20% then bioequivalence will be considered to have been demonstrated.
The PP population will be used for the primary analysis of bioequivalence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>In the Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population, the superiority of the test and reference gels against the placebo will be tested</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The mITT population will be used to evaluate the superiority of both the test and reference product to placebo for the proportion of patients showing 100% clearance of AK lesions at Day 90 (30 days after completion of 60 days of treatment) using the mITT study population and LOCF. On condition that the proportion of patients showing 100% clearance in the test and reference groups is statistically significantly greater (p&lt;0.05) than the 100% clearance rate seen in the placebo group then the primary endpoint in the study shall be considered to have been validated.</description>
