      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem
      Cells transplantation in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date,hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is refractory, including after carbon monoxide
      poisoning, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,hemorrhagic shock and cerebral infarction etc. We
      used Mesenchymal Stem Cells via portal vein infusion method to treat hypoxic ischemic
      encephalopathy. With different durations of follow-up, we cleared therapeutic effect, the
      quality of life and prognostic implications of the cord blood stem cell infusion on hypoxic
      ischemic encephalopathy, and evaluated the adverse reactions, through the neurological
      function score (NIHSS，Barthel Index), cognitive score (MoCA, MMSE),and the international
      uniform Parkinson Rating Scale score (UPDRS). Here, we seek new means for the treatment of
      hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and provide the basis for clinical for further application
      of umbilical cord blood derived Mesenchymal stem cells.

      On the basis of conventional therapy, at the same time, selected patients were given by
      intravenous infusion of umbilical cord blood stem cells 100-800 million. All patients before
      treatment, after treatment for 15days, 90days and 180 days were evaluated respectively the
      curative effect. The neurological function score (NIHSS score, Barthel Index) was observed in
      patients with the ability to live independently and prognosis; MoCA, MMSE were used in the
      evaluation of cognitive function ；UPDRS was used in the evaluation of extrapyramidal tract
      function.

    <measure>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHSS is a systematic assessment tool that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. Values range from 0 (no deficit) to 42 (dead).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and post cell transplantation:15,90,180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index measures 10 activities of daily living and mobility. A score of 100 is best (able to live at home with a degree of independence), 0 is worst.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and post cell transplantation:15,90,180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and post cell transplantation:15,90,180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) is a brief 30-point screening instrument that was developed and validated to identify subjects with mild cognitive impairment. 30 is the maximum score, with a score of 26 or higher considered normal and below 26 indicative of Mild Cognitive Impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>before treatment and post cell transplantation:15,90,180 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS score has 4 components. Part I assesses mentation; Part II assesses activities of daily living; Part III assesses motor abilities; Part IV assesses complications of therapy. A total of 44 items are included in Parts I-III. Each item will receive a score ranging from 0 to 4 where 0 represents the absence of impairment and 4 represents the highest degree of impairment. Part IV contains 11 items, 4 of these items are scored 0-4 in the same manner, and 7 are scored 0-1, with 0 indicating the absence of impairment and 1 indicating the presence of impairment. Total UPDRS score represents the sum of these items in Parts I-IV. A total of 199 points are possible. 199 represents the worst (total) disability), 0--no disability.</description>

    <measure>adverse reaction</measure>
    <time_frame>post cell transplantation:15,90,180 days</time_frame>
    <description>adverse reaction include temperature changes,the change of blood pressure,anaphylaxis,seizure,renal dysfunction,or hepatic injury by monitoring blood routine, urinalysis, ALT,AST,Urea,Crea and electrocardiogram etc.</description>
