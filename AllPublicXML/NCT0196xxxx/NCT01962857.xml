  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have shown that short duration, high intensity interval training can
      improve health-related outcomes, such as insulin sensitivity and cardiorespiratory fitness.
      However, these often use specialized equipment, such as cycle ergometers, which makes it
      difficult to roll these interventions out for wide-scale use in the general population. This
      study aims evaluate the effects of a high intensity shuttle running intervention on insulin
      sensitivity, fitness and related cardiometabolic risk factors in men who are currently
      inactive. Participants will be randomized into intervention (4 weeks of shuttle running) and
      control groups. We hypothesize that the shuttle running programme will result in improved
      insulin sensitivity, fitness and increased fat oxidation at rest compared with the control
      group.
