      Study Design: Clinical measurement (cross-sectional)

      Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability and validity of the
      novel scapular dyskinesis classification test.

      Background: A visual-based clinical assessment with sufficient reliability and validity to
      identify scapular dyskinesis provides information for rehabilitation treatment.

      Methods: A visual-based palpation method was evaluated by two independent physiotherapists in
      60 subjects with unilateral shoulder pain to test reliability. This method classified the
      scapular movements during arm raising/lowing movements in scapular plane as single abnormal
      scapular patterns (inferior angle/ medial border/ superior border of scapula prominence and
      abnormal scapulohumeral rhythm) or mixed abnormal scapular patterns. Different patterns of
      scapular dyskinesis were also validated by corresponding alternation of the scapular
      kinematics and muscular activities assessed by electromagnetic motion-capturing system and
      surface electromyography (EMG).

    <description>The inter-rater reliability for the comprehensive scapular dyskinesis classification test was described using percentage of agreement and κ coefficient.
Rating of scapular dyskinesis was evaluated and classified into 8 patterns including(A) patterns I (B) patterns II (C) pattern III (D) pattern IV (E) pattern I+II (F) pattern II+III (G) pattern I+III (H) pattern I+II+III.</description>

    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Different patterns of scapular dyskinesis were validated by corresponding alternation of the scapular kinematics and muscular activities assessed by electromagnetic motion-capturing system and surface electromyography.
To quantitatively characterize the scapular kinematics and muscular activities, the kinematic data at 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° and EMG data at 0~30°, 30°~60°, 60°~90°, 90°~120°, and &gt;120° in the raising and lowering phases of humeral movement in the scapular plane were used as dependent variables. Data from the same scapular dyskinesis pattern assessed by 2 raters were used for validity analysis.</description>
