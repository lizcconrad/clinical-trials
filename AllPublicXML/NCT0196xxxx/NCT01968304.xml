  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cancerology, anemia is a frequently-found situation, with a prevalence ranging from 30% to
      90%, according to the series, disease stages, primary tumor locations and age (Scotte,
      Launay-Vacher et al. 2012). Although very probably a major cause of anemia, iron deficiency
      (ID) has been seldom investigated in the field of cancer. Its prevalence and incidence have
      never been assessed in a prospective study. It is well-known that anemia in the cancer
      setting is a source of asthenia and deterioration of quality of life, and can even reduce the
      efficacy of anticancer treatments such as radiotherapy. Correcting anemia therefore
      constitutes a daily challenge. Before 2004-2005, a very large proportion of patients were
      treated with erythropoietin (EPO). However, prescriptions for EPO appear to have considerably
      declined since the warnings issued by various scientific societies and governments on account
      of the possible increase in death rates and a higher incidence of thromboembolic events, as
      reported in 8 studies published to date (NCCN 2012). Simultaneously, the transfusion rate
      augmented from 3.4% to 8.7% and the median hemoglobin level fell from 10.8 to 8.9 g/dL
      (Feinberg, Bruno et al. 2012). The use of injectable iron appears to have improved the
      correction of anemia by EPO, as reported in several concordant studies versus oral iron and
      placebo (Pedrazzoli, Rosti et al. 2009; Steensma, Sloan et al. 2011). However, no monotherapy
      study has been conducted to evaluate the impact of injectable iron, alone without EPO, for
      the correction of ID (with or without anemia) in cancer treatment. Consequently, there exists
      a wide variety of practices, with an injectable iron prescription rate which, a priori, does
      not match the number of patients with iron deficiency. There exist other iron-based
      parameters to characterize ID but these are not yet used routinely during chemotherapy and
      need to be validated in the cancer field.

      These parameters include:

        -  An assay of reticulocyte hemoglobin content (rHC)

        -  An assay of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) Soluble transferrin receptors are mainly
           located on red blood line cells receiving iron delivered by transferrin.

      In this study, we propose to make a prospective assessment of the iron status of cancer
      patients beginning chemotherapy. The aim is to determine the proportion of patients who might
      benefit from injectable iron treatment. All ID will be covered prospectively over a 2-year
      period.

      Predictable risks The study will involve no increased risk or additional discomfort. Blood
      samples used in the study will be taken at blood samplings scheduled by the hospital practice
      of the reference institution. Only small amounts of blood will be taken for this study and
      they will have no repercussion on the patient's general status.

      Evaluation of the expected results Improved knowledge of ID epidemiology in patients
      receiving chemotherapy would enable more effective targeting of potential patients
      specifically requiring management by injectable iron.

      Expected benefits

      Through the medium of this study :

        -  We hope to optimize ID screening, increase our knowledge of ID characteristics and
           enhance patient management.

        -  Management of anemia in the cancer setting could thus be modified, i.e. via injectable
           iron treatment involving no EPO, the dangers of which (increase in the number of
           thromboembolic events, and even its potentially negative impact on survival) are being
           more and more fully documented.

        -  Patients included in this study will benefit from the detection of ID, which otherwise
           would not have been discovered.
