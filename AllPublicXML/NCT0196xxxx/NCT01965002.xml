  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ExAblate
      magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) surgery in the
      treatment of soft tissue tumors of the extremities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that the incidence of cancer increases with age, the number of elderly patients
      diagnosed and treated for soft tissue sarcomas (STS) will increase. The dilemma is that
      surgeons and medical oncologists may be hesitant to treat elderly patients in a comparably
      intensive manner as is used in the treatment of younger patients; factors such as decreased
      performance status, significant comorbidities, and disease natural history may erode
      enthusiasm for aggressive STS resection. To this end, a less invasive way of treating soft
      tissue tumors would be helpful in younger patients to minimize morbidity and in the elderly
      to provide less aggressive treatment options. The InSightec ExAblate 2000 magnetic
      resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) system is a non-invasive thermal
      ablation device fully integrated with an MR imaging system and used for the ablation of soft
      tissue (5-10). The ExAblate combines a focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) delivery system and a
      conventional diagnostic 1.5 T or 3 T MRI scanner. It provides a real-time therapy planning
      algorithm, thermal dosimetry, and closed-loop therapy control.

    <description>Safety determined by evaluating for the incidence of any device-related adverse events. Patients will be assessed for pain and limb function, and by clinical examination before and after treatment to collect adverse events related to the treatment. Safety is reported as the total incidence of device-related adverse events.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is further assessed by an evaluation of severity for the treatment-related adverse events, reported as the number of adverse events for each of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 grades.

    <measure>Percent Successful Tumor Ablation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>In the resected tumor specimen, the volume of the ablated area will be determined by obtaining a digital photograph of each pathology slice. The region of interest corresponding to the ablated area will be traced, and the ablated area will be calculated for each slice and summed. Accuracy is assessed as the percent ablated volume relative to pre-treatment tumor volume.</description>

    <description>The InSightec ExAblate 2000 magnetic resonance-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) system is a non-invasive device that is fully integrated with an MR imaging system and used for the ablation of soft tissue. The treatment process begins with the physician acquiring a set of MR images, identifying 1+ target volume(s) of fibroid tissue to be ablated, and drawing the treatment contours. The therapy planning software computes the type and number of sonications required to treat the defined volume while minimizing total treatment time. MR images taken during the sonication provide a diagnostic quality image of the target tissue and a quantitative, real-time temperature map overlay to confirm the therapeutic effect of the treatment. The transducer is then automatically moved to the succeeding treatment point and the process is repeated until the entire volume has been treated. About 100 individual sonications can be delivered over a 3-hour period to complete a treatment.</description>
