    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term antibody persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10
      years after receiving a primary vaccination of meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-TT
      versus Meningitec™ or Mencevax™ ACWY, and the safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of
      MenACWY-TT administered 10 years after the primary vaccination. All subjects received a
      primary vaccination at 1 to 10 years of age in study 108658 (NCT00427908). No new subjects
      will be enrolled in this booster study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the antibody persistence post primary vaccination with active
      control, safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose uncontrolled post primary vaccination
      during different phases:

      Persistence phase: Long-term persistence 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 years after primary vaccination
      with MenACWY-TT or Meningitec or Mencevax ACWY, in study MenACWY-TT-027.

      Booster phase: One month post booster vaccination with MenACWY-TT vaccine ten years after
      primary vaccination.

      The subjects in this study will be allocated to the same groups as in the vaccination study
      MenACWY-TT-027 (NCT00427908).
