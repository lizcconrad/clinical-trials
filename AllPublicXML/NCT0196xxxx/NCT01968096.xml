  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following injury to the spinal cord, the spinal circuit undergoes a series of adaptations. In
      parallel with the spinal circuit adaptation, the muscular properties also adapt. In human and
      animal studies, histochemical and physiological evidences showed that the paralyzed muscle
      transferred from slow, fatigue-resistant to fast, fatigable after injury.

      Reversal of neuromuscular property for persons with SCI needs to be resolved. Studies using
      high load electrical stimulations showed a reverse change of muscular properties, such as
      hypertrophy and reversal of fiber type transformations but failed to show a reversal of
      spinal circuitry function. Previous studies found that fast continuous passive motion (CPM)
      altered the H reflex excitability in human. Animal studies found that passive cycling and
      passive stretching delayed atrophy and influenced the transition of type I and IIa MHC.
      Theses findings lead to a hypothesis that mechanical stimulation might be able to reverse
      both spinal circuitry and muscular properties after SCI but it has not been confirmed in
      human study.

      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of mechanical stimulation by fast
      CPM on the reversing adaptation of human paralyzed muscle after SCI.
