      The aim of the study was to describe postoperative weight change in adults undergoing surgery
      for craniopharyngioma and identify preoperative factors associated with it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morbid obesity, intractable weight gain due to hypothalamic damage, is a common and troubling
      complication in patients undergoing surgery for craniopharyngioma combined or not with
      radiotherapy, with an incidence of 23~62% in pediatric patients. It has a major negative
      impact on metabolic and cardiovascular health and quality of life in long-term survivors.
      Identifying patients at higher risks for developing postoperative weight gain is of great
      importance in preventing obesity and taking early actions in this population. Though a lot of
      previous studies have been made in pediatric patients and several factors, such as
      hypothalamic involvement, higher body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) at
      diagnosis, age at diagnosis and hydrocephalus requiring a shunt, have been identified as risk
      factors for postoperative weight gain, data on this important morbidity in adult-onset
      patients are sparse, especially in Chinese population. Therefore, the investigators are going
      to undertake a retrospective evaluation of postoperative weight change in adult-onset
      patients undergoing surgery for craniopharyngioma and identify preoperative factors
      associated with it.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        adult-onset, aged 18 years or more; pathologically confirmed craniopharyngioma; primary
        surgery performed at our hospital; at least 3 months of follow-up including body weight
        measurement; ambulatory (since lack of ambulation may predispose to weight gain); not
        receiving supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoid (e.g. hydrocortisone, prednisone, or
        dexamethasone to exceed 12mg/m2â€¢d hydrocortisone equivalent) for more than 2 months after
        tumor therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Childhood-onset, &lt;18 years old; Inconsistent pathology; Without follow-up records in the
        investigators' institution.
