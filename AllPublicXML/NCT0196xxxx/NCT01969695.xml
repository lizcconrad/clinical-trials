      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, extension study. Subjects with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL) (excluding chronic lymphocytic lymphoma [CLL], small lymphocytic lymphoma
      [SLL], and mantle cell lymphoma [MCL]) who completed a prior ABT-199 study, or were active
      and assigned to ABT-199 when the study was completed, may roll over into this extension
      study. Subjects will receive ABT-199 during this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has completed a prior ABT-199 study (and had met the criteria for a diagnosis
             of NHL and all other eligibility criteria for the previous study) and the investigator
             believes that treatment with ABT-199 is in the best interest of the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject discontinued ABT-199 administration before completing the prior study (due to
             disease progression, toxicity, withdrawn consent, other).

          -  Subject has any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator places the
             subject at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.

          -  Subject has not recovered to â‰¤ Grade 2 clinically significant adverse
             effect(s)/toxicity(ies) of previous therapy.

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD),
             Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, chronic
             lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or mantle cell lymphoma
             (MCL).
