      This study is a phase 2, open-label extension study of 12 mg Proellex for 2 treatment cycles,
      each with a 16 week active dosing period. Endometriosis pain, dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual
      pelvic pain and dyspareunia (BBSS) as well as use of pain medications, and vaginal bleeding
      intensity will be recorded using an electronic diary and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain
      assessment will be utilized. All subjects will have completed an Off-Drug Interval (ODI)
      prior to starting treatment. Visit 1 will be scheduled within a week before the next expected
      menses (+/- 2 days), following the off-drug interval. Subjects will receive 2 cycles of
      treatment separated by an off-drug interval (ODI), after which they will be followed until
      menses has returned. During the follow-up period subjects will continue to record study
      information in the electronic diary. The final follow-up visit will be scheduled after blood
      flow has stopped.
