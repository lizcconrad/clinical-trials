  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a continuing research study of a vaccine for allergy to Japanese Red Cedar. The
      vaccine is called CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine. This research study will determine how the
      vaccine is tolerated and how previous Phase IA research participants respond to the vaccine
      in a booster dose. CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine is investigational, which means it is not
      approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but is available in
      research studies like this one. The study is a Phase IB, prospective, three cohort, open
      label study conducted on one cohorts of non-atopic subjects and two cohorts of subjects with
      a history of allergic rhinitis symptoms to Japanese red cedar CryJ 2 pollen allergen that
      participated in the previous Phase IA study (all the subjects participated in the previous
      study). The study will be conducted at 1 study center. Subjects are enrolled in the trial for
      a period of 80 days. The objectives of the statistical analyses are to establish the safety
      and to explore the immunogenicity of the LAMP-vax vaccine. All statistical analyses conducted
      on the data from this trial will be exploratory in nature.

      The primary objective of this Phase IB Study is to evaluate the safety and immunological
      responses of an additional dose of CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine delivered intramuscularly
      (IM) to subjects who previously received 4 doses of CryJ2-DNA-LAMP vaccine delivered IM every
      2 weeks in the previous Phase IA study.

      A further safety assessment of the JRC sensitive and non-sensitive subjects who were in Group
      1, 2 and 3 of the Phase 1A study will be further assessed in terms of current skin test
      reactivity, re-vaccination safety and continued safety.

      Group 1: will receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection.
      The dosing regimen for this group will be to receive one (1) booster dose. This group will be
      followed for 80 days (+/- 10), assessing skin reactivity and immune response.

      Group 2: will receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection.
      The dosing regimen for this group will be to receive one (1) booster dose. This group will be
      followed for 80 days (+/- 10), assessing skin reactivity and immune response.

      Group 3: will receive 2 mg CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine by intramuscular (IM) injection.
      The dosing regimen for this group will be to receive one (1) booster dose. This group will be
      followed for 80 days (+/- 10), assessing skin reactivity and immune response.

    <description>The primary objective of this Phase I Study is to evaluate the safety and immunological responses of therapeutic doses and the dosing regimen of CryJ2-DNA-LAMP plasmid vaccine.
Adverse events will be monitored on each subject from the time of enrollment to exit from the study. Vital signs will be recorded on each subject at baseline and days 50, 80 and early termination. Physical exams will be conducted on the subjects at the baseline and days 50, 80 and early termination.</description>

    <description>Immonogenecity parameters include: Japanese Red Cedar Immunocap (IgE &amp; IgG), Mountain Cedar Immunocap (IgE) &amp; Th1/Th2 cytokines ELISA Panel.
These parameters will determine if there is a change in beneficial immunoglobulins(IgG), and changes in Th1/Th2 cytokines in the serum of non-atopic (no allergic sensitivities to CryJ2 allergen) subjects and atopic subjects with known allergy to Japanese Red Cedar CryJ2 allergen. These subjects were identified by positive skin test re-activity and/or IgG specific antibody titers from previous time-points in the Phase IA using one boost of IM route of administration.
Immunogenicity parameters will be measured at baseline and days 50, 80 or ET of the trial.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects that participated in the previous Phase I A study who demonstrated a change
             from positive to Japanese Red Cedar pollen/Mountain Cedar at Day 0, to negative in at
             Day 132 (to be assigned to Group 1) and who have not experienced a grade 3 adverse
             reaction.

          -  Subjects that participated in the previous Phase I A study who originally tested
             negative and remained negative to Japanese Red Cedar pollen/Mountain Cedar negative
             from Day 0 through Day 132 (to be assigned to Group 2 ) and who have not experienced a
             grade 3 adverse reaction.

             *For the purposes of this study, retrospective skin testing data (as long as it has
             been performed within 60 days of screening) will be accepted, using the same positive
             inclusion criteria

          -  Execute a written informed consent (in English and where appropriate in Japanese) to

             Japanese Red Cedar pollen, CryJ2 or Mountain Cedar antigen (wheal &gt; 3mm greater than
             the negative control). Although, the subjects may have positive skin tests to other
             allergens, these will not be used to qualify or to participate in the study. For the
             purposes of this study, retrospective skin testing data (from the previous Phase IA
             study) will be accepted, using the same positive inclusion criteria

             allergic rhinitis, medical history, or clinical laboratory results during screening
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject
             or impact the validity of the study results.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:
