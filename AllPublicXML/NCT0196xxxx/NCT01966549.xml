      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of CNTO6785 compared with placebo in
      participants with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized (study medication is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (effect of the study medication will be compared with the effect of
      placebo [inactive substance]), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the
      treatment that the participant receives), parallel-group study (each group of participants
      will be treated at the same time). This study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase (within
      3 weeks prior to the start of study medication), a treatment phase (12 weeks), and a
      follow-up phase (12 weeks after the last administration of study medication). Approximately
      170 participants will be enrolled in this study to receive CNTO6785 or placebo in 1:1 ratio.
      Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead
      electrocardiogram, physical examination, early detection of active tuberculosis, and clinical
      laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study
      participation for a participant will be 30 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second. FEV1 will be measured by spirometry. A positive change from baseline in FEV1 indicates improvement in lung function.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in postbronchodilator (after taking an inhaled bronchodilator) Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second. FEV1 will be measured by spirometry. A positive change from baseline in FEV1 indicates improvement in lung function.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in weekly average number of occasions in a day that rescue medication is used at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue medication is a relief medication for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms. e.g. when patients feel breathless, chest tight, or frequent cough. The reduction of number of the occasions indicates disease improvement with less symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool-Respiratory Symptoms™ (E-RS™) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>E-RS is a 11-item respiratory system scoring algorithm to assess the severity of respiratory symptoms in participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Each item has either 5 or 6 response options. Higher score indicates more severe COPD.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline at Week 16 in total score of the St George's respiratory questionnaire for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) participants (SGRQ-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>SGRQ-C is a 40-item questionnaire designed to measure health impairment in participants with COPD. SGRQ-C is divided into two components: 1) symptoms, 2) activity&amp; impacts. Total SGRQ-C score ranges from 0 (best) and 100 (worst). Higher scores indicate greater health impairment.</description>
