  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess any side effects that may occur when QPI-1007 is injected into the eye
      in subjects with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, as well as how long it takes for the
      body to clear the drug. This study will also test whether QPI-1007, injected into the eye,
      helps prevent both structural damage of the nerve tissue in the eye and the loss of visual
      function in subjects with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma.

      This is a Phase IIa double-masked, single dose, randomized, sham-controlled study evaluating
      the safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of QPI-1007 versus Control (sham procedure)
      in subjects with an acute attack of primary angle-closure glaucoma.

      Subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 into one of two study arms: 1.5 QPI-1007 arm or
      Control arm (sham procedure). The study will enroll approximately 30 subjects into each arm.
      Randomization will be stratified by time from symptom onset to the study drug administration
      or sham procedure (â‰¤72 hours and &gt;72 hours).
