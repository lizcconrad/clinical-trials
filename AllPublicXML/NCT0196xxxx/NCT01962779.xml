      Our preliminary data show for in cognitively-normal elderly, that Sleep Disordered Breathing
      (SDB) is associated with the increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated-Tau (P-Tau)
      and total-Tau (T-Tau), decreases in medial temporal lobe glucose uptake (FDG-PET) and volume
      (MRI) and progressive memory decline, all of which have been shown to be useful in predicting
      future dementia in older adults. These findings raise the question as to whether Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) tissue damage causes SDB in the elderly, or alternatively, if SDB acts as a risk
      factor for AD neurodegeneration. In the proposed study, we will investigate these mechanistic
      hypotheses in cognitively normal elderly by examining the longitudinal associations between
      SDB and cognitive decline, novel MR neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers for neurodegeneration;
      while our secondary goal is to launch a pilot treatment study to aid in interpreting the
      mechanistic hypotheses and to examine the effects of nasal continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) on cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder with an estimated prevalence in the
      elderly ranging from 30-80%. The relevance of this high frequency in late life is emerging,
      as recent evidence suggests that SDB may be associated with the development of mild cognitive
      impairment and dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and
      affects nearly 45% of the population older than 85. Hippocampal atrophy and glucose
      hypometabolism, as well as changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid beta-42
      (Aβ42), phosphorylated-tau (P-Tau) and total-tau (T-Tau), have been shown to be useful in
      predicting future decline in cognitively normal older adults, which suggests that AD
      pathology is detectable prior to cognitive impairment in at-risk subjects. This
      &quot;presymptomatic phase&quot;, in which tissue damage is minimal and whose detection precedes
      clinical symptoms, is an ideal stage for risk factor analysis and intervention trials. Our
      preliminary data show, for the first time in cognitively-normal elderly, that the severity of
      SDB (as measured by respiratory events with 4% desaturation, Apnea Hypopnea Index 4% [AHI4%])
      is associated with the increase of CSF P-Tau and T-Tau, a decrease in glucose uptake
      (measured by FDG-PET) in the medial temporal lobe, reduced hippocampal volume, and
      longitudinal memory decline. These findings raise the question as to whether AD tissue damage
      causes SDB in the elderly, or alternatively, if SDB acts as a risk factor for
      neurodegeneration. The proposed parent grant for this project conducted at the NYU Center for
      Brain Health (CBH), is a 5-year NIH-funded longitudinal study of 180 normal elderly (50-95
      years), who will undergo complete baseline and 24 month follow-up evaluations. The exams
      include MR imaging: both structural and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using a novel NYU arterial
      spin labeling (ASL) protocol and regional brain vasoreactivity estimates after CO2 breathing
      (VR-CO2); as well as both plasma and CSF biomarkers. The present ancillary proposal,
      performed in collaboration with NYU's Sleep Disorders Center, will investigate: 1) SDB as a
      longitudinal predictor of changes in memory, levels of P-tau and T-Tau, hippocampal atrophy,
      and the blunted VR-CO2 response (all these effects of SDB were observed in cross-section in
      our pilot work); and 2) if these SDB related phenomena in normal elderly are susceptible to
      intervention with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in moderate-to-severe SDB
      subjects. This study has the potential to identify: 1) a highly prevalent AD-related
      mechanism by which SDB contributes to cognitive decline; 2) the alternative hypothesis, the
      presence of biomarker features of AD as risks factors for SDB; and 3) that the treatment of
      SDB with CPAP improves cognition through an AD-related pathway in the elderly.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects with normal cognition and &gt;50 years of age will be enrolled.
             Younger subjects are not included as the risk for cognitive impairment is too low.
             Moreover, by selecting this age-range we minimize the possibility of including
             early-onset genetic forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease
             and Frontotemporal Dementia.

          -  Normal subjects will be within normal limits on neurological and psychiatric
             examinations. All subjects enrolled will have both a Clinical Dementia Rating = 0 and
             Global Deterioration Scale &lt; 3.

          -  All subjects will have had a minimum of 12 years education.The education restriction
             reduces performance variance on cognitive test measures and improves the sensitivity
             for detecting pathology and disease progression using the robust norms available at
             NYU School of Medicine.

          -  All subjects will have an informed family member or life partner interviewed to
             confirm the reliability of the subject interview. All subjects will agree to the MRI
             imaging, the lumbar puncture, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping and DNA banking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of any brain disease or MRI evidence of brain damage including significant
             trauma, hydrocephalus, seizures, mental retardation or other serious neurological
             disorder (e.g. Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders). Persons with silent
             cortical infarcts are excluded. Subcortical infarcts and white matter lesions are not
             exclusions.

          -  History of brain tumor.

          -  Any radiation or chemotherapy anywhere in the body in the past 3-years.

          -  Significant history of alcoholism or drug abuse.

          -  History of psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, mania, PTSD, or life long history
             of major depression).

          -  Hamilton Depression Scale &gt;16 only with history of life long depressive episodes.
             Otherwise not excluded.

          -  Evidence of clinically relevant and uncontrolled cardiac, pulmonary, or hypothyroid or
             hematological conditions. Insulin dependent diabetes and/or history or treated
             hypertension are not an exclusion. Normal subjects with current levels of HbA1c &gt;5.9%
             or diabetics &gt;7.0% (American Diabetes Association, 2010) and/or current blood pressure
             levels &gt;140/90 mm Hg (JNC on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High
             Blood Pressure, 2003) will be advised to seek referral.

          -  Physical impairment of such severity as to adversely affect the validity of
             psychological testing.

          -  Hostility or refusal to cooperate.

          -  Any prosthetic devices (e.g., pacemaker or surgical clips) that constitutes a hazard
             for MRI imaging.

          -  History of a first-degree family member with early onset (before age 65) dementia.

          -  Medications adversely affecting cognition will result in exclusion. The excluded
             medications include:

               -  Antidepressants with anti-cholinergic properties.

               -  Regular use of narcotic analgesics (&gt;2 doses per week).

               -  Use of neuroleptics with anti-cholinergic properties.

               -  Other medications with central nervous system anticholinergic activity.

               -  Use of Anti-Parkinsonian medications.

          -  At the baseline individuals taking physician ordered or off-label memory or other
             cognitive enhancing medications (e.g. cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine) are
             excluded. At the follow-up these medications are allowed. Also excluded at baseline
             are individuals taking physician ordered, but off-label memory enhancements.
             Individuals taking over the counter memory enhancing or protecting medications (e.g.
             ginkgo biloba, vitamins) are not excluded.

          -  Patients with significant physical changes (e.g. amputations or loss of sensory input)
             as these may affect the MRI blood flow measures.
