    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether day and night closed-loop insulin
      delivery for 12 weeks under free living conditions is superior to addition of real-time
      continuous glucose monitoring in adults with type 1 diabetes and sub-optimal glucose control
      on insulin pump therapy.

      This is an open-label, multi centre, randomised, crossover design study, involving a 6 to 8
      week run-in period, during which glucose control will be optimised by a professional pump
      educator, followed by two 3 months study periods during which glucose levels will be
      controlled either by an automated closed-loop system or by subjects usual insulin pump
      therapy augmented with real-time continuous glucose monitoring in random order. A total of up
      to 42 adults (aiming for 30 completed subjects) aged 18 years and older with T1D on insulin
      pump therapy will be recruited through diabetes clinics and other established methods in
      participating centres. Subjects who drop out of the study within the first 6 weeks of the
      first intervention arm will be replaced.

      Subjects will receive appropriate training in the safe use of closed-loop insulin delivery
      system. Subjects will have regular contact with the study team during the home study phase
      including 24/7 telephone support. Subjects will be discouraged from international travel
      during the first two weeks of closed-loop use.

      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by
      CGM (adjusted for potential over-estimation) during home stay. Secondary outcomes are the
      HbA1c, time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other
      CGM-based metrics.
