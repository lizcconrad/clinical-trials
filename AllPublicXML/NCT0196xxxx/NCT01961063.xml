      This pilot clinical trial studies gene therapy after frontline chemotherapy in treating
      patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
      Placing genes for anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) into
      stem/progenitor cells may make the body build an immune response to AIDS. Giving the
      chemotherapy drug busulfan before gene therapy can help gene-modified cells engraft and work
      better.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of recombinant (r)HIV7-short hairpin RNA targeted
      to the HIV-1 tat/rev (shI)-trans-active response element (TAR)-chemokine cysteine-cysteine
      receptor 5 ribozyme (CCR5RZ)-treated hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPC) (lentivirus
      vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cells) infusion in AIDS
      patients completing treatment for NHL and non-myeloablative conditioning with busulfan.

      II. To demonstrate the engraftment of gene-modified progeny cells following such treatment.

      III. To determine if selection of these gene-modified progeny cells occurs during analytical
      treatment interruption (ATI) of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of busulfan in patients with AIDS-related lymphoma (ARL).

      II. To determine the effects of HIV-1 infection on the presence of gene-marked peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as measured by woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory
      element (WPRE) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed before,
      during, and after ATI.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day -2 followed by
      lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cells IV on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 7, 14, and 21 days and 1,
      2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months and then annually for 3 years.
