  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to evaluate the chronic effects of resistance training on blood pressure and
      biochemical exams in hypertensive elderlies and the influence of the polymorphism of the
      angiotensin converting enzyme in these response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the chronic effects of resistance training on blood pressure and biochemical
      exams in elderly, 135 hypertensive elderlies were divided into 2 groups: trained and control.
      The trained group was submitted to a resistance training period. Before the 16 weeks ACE gene
      was genotyped (PCR). Before and after 16 weeks, blood pressure (ambulatory), HDL-cholesterol,
      Total cholesterol, Glycemia, Triacylglycerol (colorimetric assay) and plasminogen activator
      inhibition (PAI-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), vascular endothelial cell
      adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), Adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), C Reactive
      Protein, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Angiotensin 1-7, (ELISA assay) were
      measured.
