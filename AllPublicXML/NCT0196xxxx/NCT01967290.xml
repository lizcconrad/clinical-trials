  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the impact of vibratory feedback on the quality
      and intensity of a common motor rehabilitation task of the upper-arm (hand-to-mouth) in
      stroke patients. For that purpose the investigators use the SWORD system that combines 3D
      motion quantification wearable sensors and a vibratory module.

      The investigators hypothesize that vibratory stimuli during a motor rehabilitation task
      increase significantly the number of correct movements performed per unit of time.

      The design of the study is a cross-over randomized clinical trial. With the SWORD system in
      place each patient will perform the hand-to-mouth task twice (with vibratory feedback and
      without it), the order being random. The number of correct movements and other motor outcomes
      will be assessed continuously under both conditions.

    <description>Hand-to-mouth task under vibratory feedback and 3D movement analysis. The SWORD device is in place over the patient arm, performs continuous 3D movement analysis and provides vibratory feedback according to quality performance settings established by the clinician after patient assessment. If movement is of lower amplitude or slower than prescribed a vibratory stimulus is delivered at the wrist of the patient. The intervention is repeated on the hemiparetic and normal sides and the duration of the task is defined according to the patient cardiovascular status.</description>

    <description>Hand-to-mouth task in the same conditions as the experimental arm but without vibratory feedback, only 3D movement analysis. The SWORD device is in place over the patient arm, performs continuous 3D movement analysis but does not provides vibratory feedback according to quality performance settings established by the clinician after patient assessment. If movement is of lower amplitude or slower than prescribed NO vibratory stimulus is delivered at the wrist of the patient. The intervention is repeated on the hemiparetic and normal sides and the duration of the task is defined according to the patient cardiovascular status.</description>
