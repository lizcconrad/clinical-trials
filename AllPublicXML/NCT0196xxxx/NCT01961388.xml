      The study is designed as non interventional to collect data on the effectiveness of acarbose
      and metformin monotherapy, respectively, in terms of change from baseline in post prandial
      blood glucose level at the end of 16 weeks in drug-na誰ve type 2 diabetic patients within each
      carbohydrates consumption subgroup under real-life treatment condition in large sample of
      type-2 diabetes patients in India. The study will begin after the study approval by ethics
      committee.All drug na誰ve patients in whom decision to administer acarbose or metformin
      monotherapy for type 2 diabetes management has been made will be included in study after
      taking the informed consent.Patients will be observed for up to 16 weeks (2 weeks).The study
      involves general examination of patients, collection of data like history of disease,
      concomitant medication, drug dose , 24 hr dietary recall etc. The study is planned to enroll
      12250 subjects from multiple study centers spread across India. The study data will be
      analyzed with appropriate statistical methods.
