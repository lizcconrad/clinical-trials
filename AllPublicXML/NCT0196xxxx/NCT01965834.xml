  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma cells are dependent on calcium (Ca2+) for their function. Specifically, Ca2+
      is required for the function of the endoplasmic reticulum in which proteins, including
      immunoglobulins, are folded prior to their release from the cell. Multiple myeloma cells
      secrete large concentrations of immunoglobulins continuously and as result depend on
      mitochondria activity to replenish the Ca2+ levels in the endoplasmic reticulum as was shown
      in vitro in our lab. Fenofibrate has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial function resulting
      in inhibition of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum of multiple myeloma (MM) cells
      that leads to the induction of a stress signal known as the unfolded protein response and
      subsequently apoptosis. The effective anti-myeloma concentrations for fenofibrate are
      attainable in the clinical setting as they are in the same range as the effective
      concentrations for anti-hyperlipidemic effect. The investigators propose to evaluate
      fenofibrate therapy in multiple myeloma patients.

Fenofibrate: Upon screening, registration and enrollment, all subjects will receive Fenofibrate 160 mg orally daily for at least 2 months and may continue receiving study medication for as long as in the opinion of the investigator there is clinical benefit in doing so. Patients with calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min will receive a reduced dose of 54 mg orally daily.</description>
