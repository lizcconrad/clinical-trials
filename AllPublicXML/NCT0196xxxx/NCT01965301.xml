      This is a single center, Double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study to assess the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BP1.5375 after single oral
      administrations ranging in healthy male subjects (Part 1) followed by the assessment of the
      effect of 3 single different BP1.5375 oral doses on polysomnography in comparison to 50 mg
      diphenhydramine and placebo in healthy male subjects (Part 2).

    <measure>Proof of Concept - effect on polysomnography (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Study period and follow up visit will be no more than 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether an BP1.5375 single oral dose induced an effect on polysomnography in healthy male subjects compared to diphenhydramine 50 mg and matching placebo.
Safety and tolerability :
Monitoring for the occurrence of AEs, changes in physical examination, vital signs (body temperature, lying and standing blood pressure and heart rate), ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. Assessments will be performed at the following time points :
Physical examination: at screening, on days 1 and FU,
Vital signs: at screening, on days 1 and 2 and FU,
Body temperature: at screening and FU,
Standard 12 lead ECG recording : at screening, on days 1 and 2 morning and FU,
