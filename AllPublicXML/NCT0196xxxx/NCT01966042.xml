  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic neovascularization is an innovative strategy for cardiac tissue recovery due to
      chronic, intense ischemia. Thus stem cell therapy has become a promising procedure for the
      large number of patients with refractory angina due to coronary disease, despite of the use
      of multiple anti-angina medications, remain severely symptomatic with disabling angina.

      Stem cell therapy using autologous cells from the patient's bone marrow, has been shown to be
      safe and associated with improved myocardial perfusion, reducing the symptoms of advanced
      coronary artery disease and increasing the functional capacity of patients whose therapeutic
      armamentarium available today has been exhausted.

      The study hypothesis was that the infusion of autologous mononuclear cells derived from the
      patient's bone marrow and delivered via intramyocardial injection in patients with refractory
      angina and normal or slightly depressed ventricular function, promote improvement in the
      anginal symptoms and myocardial perfusion by the inducing neoangiogenesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase II, non-controlled (single arm) and open label clinical trial. The study was
      approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all patients gave informed consent prior
      to participation.

      Refractory angina patients were defined as those with functional class IV (angina at rest)
      according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Classification (CCSAC) despite
      maximum medical therapy, not suitable for conventional myocardial revascularization and
      viable myocardium confirmed by nuclear imaging.

      Patients were evaluated according to different parameters, for a total period of 12 months,
      and the primary objectives were:

        1. Improvement in functional class and angina symptoms (CCSAC) of the patients with
           refractory angina pectoris after the infusion of autologous bone marrow mononuclear
           cells after the intervention;

        2. Improvement in myocardial perfusion before and after cell delivery;

        3. Evaluate the safety of the delivery of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells route in
           individuals with refractory angina.

      In the screening evaluation, individuals with the presumptive diagnosis of class IV
      refractory angina and who met all study criteria were approached about the possibility of
      participating in the study by the principal investigator. Then, the patients were submitted
      to a baseline evaluation with a serious of blood and image tests.

      The interventions were the Bone Marrow Aspiration - For each patient, a total of 100 cc of
      bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest at the time of anesthesia for their cardiac
      surgery - and the Infusion - After processing the cells, the surgeon delivered it by a series
      of epicardial injections into the left ventricular myocardium.

      The processing of bone marrow autologous cells aimed to enrich the content of the bone marrow
      aspirate, separating the mononuclear fraction from the cells which were already
      differentiated.

      The postoperative stage was conducted in an identical way to that of patients who undergo to
      a myocardial revascularization surgery. It is important to mention that both the ICU and the
      ward time varied according to the patient's individual evolution.

      Finally, the first follow up visit took place at 1 month after the surgery. The subsequent
      visits were held at 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure.

    <description>It was evaluated in accordance with the percentage of participants that change the functional class of angina according to CCSAC (Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Classification - description below), after treatment.

Screening of Functional Graduation of Stable Angina:
I - Angina only occurs after a fast or prolonged and strenuous effort during work or recreation.
II - Slight limitation to everyday activities. III - Considerable limitation of common physical activity. IV - Inability to perform any physical activity without discomfort, the symptoms can be present at rest.</description>

    <description>Analysis of the variation in life quality questionnaire - Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was performed. Each domain of the questionnaire was evaluated as a quantitative variable and the medians were retrieved before and after the procedure.
The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with only 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index.
It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
One patient was lost before answering the questionnaire post procedure.</description>

II - Slight limitation to everyday activities. III - Considerable limitation of common physical activity. IV - Inability to perform any physical activity without discomfort, the symptoms can be present at rest.</description>

Local sedation: All subjects enrolled in the study underwent local sedation for bone marrow aspiration.
Bone Marrow Aspiration: All subjects enrolled in the study underwent bone marrow aspiration after anesthesia.
Minithoracotomy: The cardiac access route was the left anterolateral thoracotomy or left anterior minithoracotomy, depending on the segment of the left ventricle to be treated, allowing the good access to the viable myocardial areas.
Autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells infusion: Once the subject had his or her chest opened and the coronary anatomy reviewed by examination of the pre-operatory nuclear scan to define the area of ischemia, the surgeon drew up the cells into a series of syringes and injected the entire contents of the cell preparation in a series of injections directly into the myocardium.</description>

          <description>It was evaluated in accordance with the percentage of participants that change the functional class of angina according to CCSAC (Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Classification - description below), after treatment. The functional class of angina was also analyzed as an ordinal variable and the median of the functional class was calculated before and after the procedure, at the time of interest (3, 6 and 12 months post treatment), in comparison to baseline, ie. value at 3 months minus value at baseline.

        <description>Analysis of the variation in life quality questionnaire - Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was performed. Each domain of the questionnaire was evaluated as a quantitative variable and the medians were retrieved before and after the procedure.
The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with only 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index.
It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
One patient was lost before answering the questionnaire post procedure.</description>

Local sedation: All subjects enrolled in the study underwent local sedation for bone marrow aspiration.
Bone Marrow Aspiration: All subjects enrolled in the study underwent bone marrow aspiration after anesthesia.
Minithoracotomy: The cardiac access route was the left anterolateral thoracotomy or left anterior minithoracotomy, depending on the segment of the left ventricle to be treated, allowing the good access to the viable myocardial areas.
Autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells infusion: Once the subject had his or her chest opened and the coronary anatomy reviewed by examination of the pre-operatory nuclear scan to define the area of ischemia, the surgeon drew up the cells into a series of syringes and injected the entire contents of the cell preparation in a series of injections directly into the myocardium.</description>
