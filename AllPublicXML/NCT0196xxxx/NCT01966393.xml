  <brief_title>Closed-loop Control of Glucose Levels (Artificial Pancreas) for 60 Hours in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.

      The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop
      strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and conventional insulin pump therapy to regulate
      glucose levels in a 60-hours in non-standardized conditions in adults with type 1 diabetes.

      The investigators hypothesized that 1) Controlling glucose levels using single- or
      dual-hormone CLS is feasible in free-living conditions for long period of time (60 hours); 2)
      Dual-hormone CLS is superior to single-hormone CLS as assessed by reducing time spent in
      hypoglycemic range; 3) Both single-hormone and dual-hormone CLS are superior to conventional
      pump therapy.

    <description>Interventions will be conducted at the research centre (RC) or at the patient's home based on the patient's preference. If the study takes place at the RC, patients will be admitted at 7:00. If the study takes place at the patient's home, a research team member will be at the patient's home at 7:00. Closed-loop strategy will start at 8:00 on day 1 and end at 20:00 on day 3. During the interventions conducted at the RC, patients will have access to entertainment activities such as movies, video games, board games, foosball, etc. During the interventions conducted at the patient's home, patients will do their usual activities. For interventions conducted at the RC, patients will freely choose their meals from a large choice of prepared frozen meals. For interventions conducted at the patient's home, patients will freely choose their meals. Participants will be encouraged to conduct their usual physical activities whether they conduct the study at the RC or at the patient's home.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females ≥ 18 years of old.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes for at least one year.

          -  The subject will have been on insulin pump therapy for at least 3 months.

          -  HbA1c ≤ 12%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant nephropathy, neuropathy or retinopathy as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Recent (&lt; 6 months) acute macrovascular event e.g. acute coronary syndrome or cardiac
             surgery.

          -  History of pheochromocytoma or insulinoma (glucagon could induce an hormonal response
             of these tumors)

          -  Beta‐blockers at high dose based on investigator's evaluation of dosage interference
             with glucagon (glucagon can modify effect of beta-blockers, mostly evident at very
             high doses)

          -  Chronic indometacin treatment (can prevent glucagon effect on liver thus its ability
             to raise glucose)

          -  Warfarin chronic treatment if INR monitoring cannot be evaluated (can increase the
             risk of bleeding)

          -  Anticholinergic drug (risk of interaction)

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Severe hypoglycemic episode within two weeks of screening.

          -  Current use of glucocorticoid medication (except low stable dose and inhaled
             steroids).

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the trial products or meal contents (gluten free menus
             will be available).

          -  Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator (e.g. need for major
             revision of carbohydrate counting).

          -  Anticipating a significant change in exercise regimen between admissions (i.e.
             starting or stopping an organized sport).

          -  Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to eat meals/snacks,
             not willing to change pump parameters, etc).

          -  Treatments that could interfere with glucagon
