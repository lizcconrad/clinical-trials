  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multicenter, study to assess the pharmacokinetic interaction of
      ketoconazole with ABT-199 in up to 12 subjects with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study designed to assess how the body processes the study drug ABT-199 when
      taken alone and in combination with ketoconazole and to assess the safety of ABT-199 in
      combination with ketoconazole. Subjects may enroll in a separate extension study to continue
      receiving ABT-199 after completion of this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

          -  Subject must have histologically documented diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as
             defined by a B-cell neoplasm in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification
             scheme except as noted in the exclusion criteria.

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 2.

          -  Subject must have adequate bone marrow (independent of growth factor support per local
             laboratory reference range), coagulation, renal and hepatic function:

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1000/µL (without growth
                  factor support unless neutropenia is clearly due to underlying disease);

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 75,000/mm3 (unless thrombocytopenia is clearly
                  due to disease-related immune thrombocytopenia or to underlying disease; entry
                  platelet count must be independent of transfusion within 14 days of Screening);

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL (unless anemia is clearly due to
                  underlying disease; entry hemoglobin must be independent of transfusion within 14
                  days of Screening);

               -  If cytopenias are present, no evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or hypoplastic
                  bone marrow;

               -  Subject must have activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin
                  time (PT) not to exceed 1.5 × the upper normal limit (ULN);

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/min using a
                  24-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance or per the Cockcroft-Gault
                  equation;

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or
                  equal to 3.0 × ULN of institution's normal range;

               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN. Subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome may
                  have a bilirubin greater than 1.5 × ULN per discussion with the AbbVie medical
                  monitor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD),
             Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, chronic
             lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or mantle cell lymphoma
             (MCL).

          -  Subject is receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy for HIV (due to potential
             drug-drug interactions between anti-retroviral medications and ABT-199, as well as
             anticipated ABT-199 mechanism based lymphopenia that may potentially increase the risk
             of opportunistic infections).

          -  Subject has hypersensitivity to ketoconazole.

          -  Subject has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class
             greater than or equal to 2. Class 2 is defined as cardiac disease in which patients
             are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue,
             palpitations, dyspnea or anginal pain.

          -  Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic,
             metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease within the past 6 months
             that in the opinion of the investigator would adversely affect his/her participating
             in this study.

          -  Subject has malabsorption syndrome or other condition which precludes enteral route of
             administration (e.g., prior surgical resection).

          -  Subject has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant.
