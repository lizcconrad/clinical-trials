  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research proposed in this application will determine the initial efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of a novel drug combination, oxazepam (Serax®) and naltrexone (Revia®), as a
      pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine (Desoxyn®) dependence. A rigorous, inpatient human
      laboratory study will be conducted. The proposed study is innovative and important because it
      will provide the impetus for the conduct of double blind, placebo-controlled trials to
      further demonstrate the efficacy of combined oxazepam and naltrexone for managing
      methamphetamine dependence.

    <measure>Reinforcing Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>After at least four days of placebo, oxazepam (Serax®), naltrexone (Revia®) or oxazepam and naltrexone maintenance</time_frame>
    <description>The reinforcing effects of methamphetamine will be determined using a self-administration procedure in which subjects choose to take previously sampled doses. Reinforcing effects are measured during maintenance on placebo, oxazepam (Serax®), naltrexone (Revia®), and oxazepam and naltrexone combined.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>12 sessions over approximately 4 week inpatient admissions</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete subjective effects measures during six sessions while they are admitted to our inpatient unit. These items will ask about drug effects and general mood.</description>

    <measure>Physiological and Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily over approximately 4 week inpatient admissions</time_frame>
    <description>Physiological and side effects measures will be completed daily while subjects are admitted to our inpatient unit. Physiological measures include heart rate and blood pressure. Side Effects questions will query subjects about common effects of centrally active medications.</description>
