      This clinical trial studies black raspberry confection in preventing oral cancer in healthy
      volunteers. Black raspberry contains ingredients that may prevent or slow the growth of
      certain cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To select an optimal black raspberry confection based on altered gene expression and
      chemical profiles in healthy individuals exposed to 3 black raspberry-based amorphous
      functional confections with modulated bioactive release rate at two doses (4 g and 8 g).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 6 arms after 2 weeks.

      ARM I: Participants receive black raspberry (BRB) confection 1 fast release orally (PO) 4-6
      hours apart thrice daily (TID) for 2 weeks.

      ARM II: Participants receive BRB confection 2 fast release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2
      weeks.

      ARM III: Participants receive BRB confection 1 intermediate release PO 4-6 hours apart TID
      for 2 weeks.

      ARM IV: Participants receive BRB confection 2 intermediate release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for
      2 weeks.

      ARM V: Participants receive BRB confection 1 prolonged release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2
      weeks.

      ARM VI: Participants receive BRB confection 2 prolonged release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2
      weeks.

    <time_frame>Up to day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance and safety of the confections will be evaluated using dietary and sensory questionnaires. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) style model accounting for the random effect of the individual subject and the fixed effect of the dissolution (amorphous confection form) group will be used to examine the effect of attribute data, gender, and age using a 9-point hedonic scale. The significant differences between means of the different groups will be examined using the Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch (REGW) multiple comparisons test.</description>

    <measure>Bioavailability index, defined as the average rank of BRB effect in anthocyanins, ellagic acid, urolithins, and quercetin derivatives</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 14</time_frame>
    <description>To select an optimal delivery vehicle &amp; dose, a combination that results in any of 10 subjects having an adverse event will be eliminated in the 1st stage. In the 2nd and 3rd stages ANOVA style models accounting for the random effect of individual subject and the fixed effect of dose &amp; release rate will be used to examine phytonutrient metabolite &amp; gene expression. Using the multiple comparisons with the best procedure, any combination will be eliminated that is significantly worse than the best combination for a global index of bioavailability (stage 2) and gene expression effects (stage 3).</description>
