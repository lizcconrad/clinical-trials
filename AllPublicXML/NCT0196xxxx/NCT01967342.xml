    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a significant public health problem that affects over 116 million Americans,
      costs $600 billion annually, and is unequally borne by people in low-income brackets,
      especially ethnic minorities. Many individuals also have health literacy deficits (difficulty
      understanding their illness and difficulty navigating the health care system for treatment)
      putting them at a greater disadvantage. Treatment usually relies on expensive medical
      interventions that often have negative side-effects. Psychosocial treatments, like Pain
      Education and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), show promise, but are usually unavailable.
      Clinicians are poorly equipped to provide psychosocial treatments to patients with low health
      literacy. CBT has not been adapted and supported for use in individuals with low health
      literacy, and even educational materials are often poorly adapted for their needs.

      To address this problem, the PI completed a small trial showing benefits from health
      literacy-adapted pain education and CBT groups for chronic pain in a population with low
      income and low health literacy. Patients in both treatments reported lower pain by the end of
      treatment, and the effects were maintained at one year. Patients in the CBT group also
      reported less depression. The current study uses a larger sample, and directly compares these
      psychosocial treatments to medical treatment-as-usual to seek better evidence for or against
      their widespread use in community settings.

      Our research questions:

        1. In people with chronic pain and low income and/or low literacy, does participating in a
           health-literacy-adapted psychosocial treatment improve their pain and interference in
           daily activities due to pain by the end of treatment when compared with a group
           receiving typical medical care, and are these effects maintained 6 months later?

        2. Does participation in the CBT pain management group improve symptoms of depression
           better than a pain education group by the end of treatment, and are these effects
           maintained 6 months later?

      In partnership with a federally qualified health center, we will enroll 294 patients with
      chronic pain. Main outcomes will be patient-reported pain intensity, pain interference,
      depression, and perceived change. From an earlier trial, we expect that our participants will
      be ~75% female and ~70% African American, and will have low literacy and low income (~60% in
      the low 15% nationally on word reading, and 90% at or below the poverty threshold).

      Study Description

      Chronic pain is a major public health problem that is compounded by a number of
      health-related disparities. Low health literacy presents a notable access barrier to
      effective treatment as it produces cumulative education and communication deficits. Standard
      care employs biomedical approaches that are expensive, often invasive, and limited in
      accessibility and long-term effectiveness. Psychosocial treatments are efficacious, yet few
      psychosocial interventions have adequately addressed the significant health literacy barriers
      that exclude a substantial portion of disadvantaged individuals from the benefits of
      treatment.

      Research Questions:

        1. In individuals with chronic pain and low socioeconomic standing who are receiving care
           at a federally qualified health center in the Southern US, does participating in a
           health-literacy-adapted psychosocial treatment group improve their self-reported pain
           intensity and interference in physical functioning by the end of treatment when compared
           with a group receiving standard medical care, and are these effects maintained 6 months
           later?

        2. In these same individuals, does participation in the CBT pain management group improve
           depressive symptoms better than a pain education group by the end of treatment, and are
           these effects maintained 6 months later? The proposed study will build on researcher
           experience developing and evaluating psychosocial treatments for chronic pain in
           individuals with low socioeconomic standing (SES) and on strong partnerships with
           community health centers to evaluate two innovative, health-literacy-adapted
           psychosocial interventions for chronic pain. Both interventions integrate patient
           feedback, expert opinion, and qualitative patient data.

      DESIGN

      We propose a three-group, community-based randomized, controlled, comparative effectiveness
      trial. Participants will be patients receiving care from a federally qualified primary care
      clinic. Patients are expected to be mostly ethnic minority females living below the poverty
      line with significant unmet need for chronic pain treatment. Patients will be randomly
      assigned by group to a standard medical treatment control, a pain education group, or a
      cognitive-behavioral therapy group. Primary outcomes are patient-reported pain intensity,
      pain interference in physical functioning, and psychological symptoms, all highly relevant to
      patient-provider decision-making.

      Aims:

        1. Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and comparative effectiveness of health
           literacy-adapted psychosocial group treatments to a standard-treatment control.

        2. Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of treatment groups on depressive symptoms, and
           evaluate all outcomes for heterogeneity of treatment effects.

      STUDY IMPACT

        -  Systems: Produces a new, low-cost treatment option for community health clinics.

        -  Providers: Offers options for treatments over and above surgery and medication.

        -  Patients: Provides information to patients on the benefits of psychosocial treatment on
           outcomes that matter.

Higher scores indicate greater pain severity.</description>

In particular, it seeks to empower patients to self-manage their chronic pain through building deeper knowledge about and better skills for improving their pain condition and their interactions with the health care system.

      <desc>Participants completed four assessments over the course of the study. Assessors asked about adverse events at these assessments, using a safety alert form prepared for the trial. Participants in the CBT and EDU conditions also completed weekly measures at the time of the weekly meeting over the 10-week class, and were asked about adverse events on a weekly basis. For each safety alert/adverse event, participants were asked whether it was related to being in the study.</desc>

          <description>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Pain: A 10-week psychosocial group treatment for chronic pain that focuses on providing core pain education and cognitive-behavior skills to low-income patients who may not have received this information due to existing barriers that often includes limited health literacy. In particular, it seeks to empower patients to self-manage their chronic pain through building deeper knowledge about and better skills for improving their pain condition and their interactions with the health care system.
