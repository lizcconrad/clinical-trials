  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the post-treatment decreases in the
      interstitial fluid pressure and hypoxia-specific PET-scan signal from GRID-treated tumors in
      patients with locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      The possible effects of GRID radiotherapy on tumor oxygenation levels and interstitial fluid
      pressure within the tumors will be measured by assessing the trend and statistical
      significance of the difference in values for each condition obtained prior to and just after
      GRID exposure in each subject enrolled in the study. We expect that there may be a trend for
      increases in tumor oxygenation and decreases in interstitial fluid pressure which would
      indicate that more accurately timed additional chemotherapy and radiation therapy would
      improve overall patient outcomes.
