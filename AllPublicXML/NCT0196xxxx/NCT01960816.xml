      Pilot Study of the Aerin Medical Wand used for Improvement in Nasal Breathing
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-significant risk, prospective, non-randomized pilot study to evaluate the
      incidence of serious adverse events directly attributable to the Aerin Medical Wand, when
      used to deliver radiofrequency (RF) energy to tissues of the nasal airway for the treatment
      of nasal obstruction.
