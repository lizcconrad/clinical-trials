  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study was done in HIV-infected participants on antiretroviral therapy to
      evaluate the effects of isotretinoin (a drug that is approved for use in the treatment of
      severe acne) on the immune system. The immune system helps the body fight infections. When
      the immune system is not working well, one may be at greater risk for diseases that are
      common in aging, like heart disease, weaker bones, and kidney disease.

    <textblock>
      Isotretinoin was administered to participants in the Isotretinoin arm at approximately 0.5
      mg/kg PO once daily for 4 weeks, then increased to approximately 1.0 mg/kg PO once daily for
      12 weeks. Follow-up continues to week 28 to evaluate the duration of effect. Randomization
      was stratified by willingness to participate in the gut biopsy substudy, A5330s. The study
      population included HIV-1 infected adults whose virus was suppressed on ART, excluding women
      of child bearing potential.

    <description>Cell-associated HIV-1 RNA in blood from baseline to week 14/16(week 14/16 - baseline), from week 14/16 to week 28 (week 28 - week 14/16), and from baseline to week 28 (week 28 - baseline).
Levels measured at pre-entry and entry were averaged for baseline, levels measured at week 14 and week 16 were averaged for week 14/16.
For cell-associated HIV-1 RNA results below the assay limit, the lowest value of the sample was imputed to these results (1.32 log10 copies/10^6 CD4 cells).
Since there are only a few results below the assay limit, it is still reasonable to summarize the absolute changes for cell-associated HIV-1 RNA, where changes were calculated based on the imputed values (described above) for below assay limit results.</description>

For cell-associated HIV-1 DNA results below the assay limit, the lowest value of the sample was imputed to these results and considered lowest ranks (1.62 log10 copies/10^6 CD4 cells).
It was originally planned to summarize the absolute changes for cell-associated HIV-1 DNA. However, since there are many results below limit of detection, analyzing the absolute changes would be inappropriate in this case.
Instead, the baseline, week 14/16, and week 28 levels were summarized.</description>

    <measure>Change in Treg Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 14/16, week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Treg (T Regulatory) Cells are a subpopulation of T cells which modulate the immune system.
The outcome measure is the change in Treg frequency from baseline to week 14/16 (week 14/16 - baseline), from week 14/16 to week 28 (week 28 - week 14/16), and from baseline to week 28 (week 28 - baseline).
Levels measured at pre-entry and entry were averaged for baseline, levels measured at week 14 and week 16 were averaged for week 14/16.
Data for Treg frequency are not available as of November 2017. These data are based on immunology assays which are to be tested in batch to minimize variability. Due to batch testing, shipment of samples for testing could not begin until after the study follow-up completion, which was 3 months after the primary complete date. Please note that these secondary outcomes are not included in the primary analyses. There are many outcomes in this study and the immunology lab had to give priority to the assays planned to be included in the primary manuscript.</description>

        the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial
        assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of
        rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different
        test principle (eg, indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA
        viral load.

          -  All measurements of HIV-1 RNA within the 12 months prior to study entry must be below
             the limit of detection with the following exception:

        NOTE A: 1 viral blip (&lt;200 copies/mL) is permitted if it is preceded and followed by viral
        loads below the limits of detection.

        NOTE B: The virologic assay must have a lower limit of detection of ≤ 75 copies/mL.

          -  CD4+ cell count &lt;350 cells/mm3 obtained at screening within 30 days prior to entry at

        oral communication from a clinician or clinician's staff documented in source documents of
        an operative report, discharge summary, or

          -  No active hepatitis B or C infection. NOTE: For subjects who have documentation of
             prior infection, but no active hepatitis infection, evidence of clearance must be
             greater than 1 year.

          -  Ability and willingness of subject to provide informed consent.

          -  Willingness to adhere to the iPLEDGE program requirements.

          -  Indication of willingness to participate in the substudy A5330s. NOTE: In the event
             that 12 or fewer subjects have enrolled into A5330s by the time enrollment in the main
             study has reached 50% of the accrual target, A5330s enrollment will be required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing diagnosis of diabetes.

        <title>Change in Cell-associated HIV-1 RNA</title>
        <description>Cell-associated HIV-1 RNA in blood from baseline to week 14/16(week 14/16 - baseline), from week 14/16 to week 28 (week 28 - week 14/16), and from baseline to week 28 (week 28 - baseline).
Levels measured at pre-entry and entry were averaged for baseline, levels measured at week 14 and week 16 were averaged for week 14/16.
For cell-associated HIV-1 RNA results below the assay limit, the lowest value of the sample was imputed to these results (1.32 log10 copies/10^6 CD4 cells).
Since there are only a few results below the assay limit, it is still reasonable to summarize the absolute changes for cell-associated HIV-1 RNA, where changes were calculated based on the imputed values (described above) for below assay limit results.</description>

        <title>Change in Treg Frequency</title>
        <description>Treg (T Regulatory) Cells are a subpopulation of T cells which modulate the immune system.
The outcome measure is the change in Treg frequency from baseline to week 14/16 (week 14/16 - baseline), from week 14/16 to week 28 (week 28 - week 14/16), and from baseline to week 28 (week 28 - baseline).
Levels measured at pre-entry and entry were averaged for baseline, levels measured at week 14 and week 16 were averaged for week 14/16.
Data for Treg frequency are not available as of November 2017. These data are based on immunology assays which are to be tested in batch to minimize variability. Due to batch testing, shipment of samples for testing could not begin until after the study follow-up completion, which was 3 months after the primary complete date. Please note that these secondary outcomes are not included in the primary analyses. There are many outcomes in this study and the immunology lab had to give priority to the assays planned to be included in the primary manuscript.</description>

Levels measured at pre-entry and entry were averaged for baseline, levels measured at week 14 and week 16 were averaged for week 14/16.
Data for endogenous retinoid metabolite profiles is not available as of November 2017. Pharmacokinetics assays were batched to minimize variability. Sample shipment could not begin until after the study follow-up completion, which was 3 months after the primary completion date. Given that this was a multi-center study, shipment of samples took several months to complete. Upon completion of the testing, the results will be reviewed for data completeness and quality. After resolution of any issues and finalization of the database, the analysis can be conducted and the results will then be posted to ClinicalTrials.gov.</description>
