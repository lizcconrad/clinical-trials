  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing an
      adapted form (i.e. IPT-MBD) of a psychosocial intervention, Interpersonal Psychotherapy for
      Depressed Adolescents, for youth with severe mood dysregulation (SMD) or disruptive mood
      dysregulation disorder (DMDD).

      The investigators hypothesize that retention rates will be &gt;80%, satisfaction scores will
      average 6 (high) on a 7 point satisfaction scale, and that youth who receive the IPT
      intervention will have overall improvement in SMD/DMDD symptoms.

      This research is being done to learn more about how to help teenagers with a sad or angry
      mood, and emotional responses out of proportion to what would be expected in a situation.
      Together these symptoms are called Severe Mood Dysregulation (SMD), a research diagnosis, or
      disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), a newer clinical diagnosis. Currently, there
      is no standard treatment for teens that have SMD/DMDD. These teens usually receive medication
      and some type of talk therapy. This research is being done to compare two types of talk
      therapy to see which is most effective in helping teens with SMD/DMDD. Investigators will
      compare treatment as usual (TAU) with Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Youth with Mood and
      Behavior Dysregulation (IPT-MBD). Investigators do not know if TAU and IPT-MBD work just as
      well, or if one is better than the other. When this study is over, investigators hope there
      will be a better idea of how to study treatments for teens with SMD/DMDD.

      For those participants who receive IPT-MBD, are prescribed an antipsychotic, and have
      significant improvement in symptoms, investigators will gradually taper the antipsychotic
      dose.

    <description>To describe/assess feasibility of IPT-MBD, investigators will look at ease of recruitment and retention rate goal of at least 80%. Investigators will collect data on the number of subjects recruited, enrolled, and who followed the protocol for 24 weeks. Investigators will comment on adherence to the overall study, as well as to specific treatment visits.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects, ages 12 to 17 years, who meet criteria for severe mood
             dysregulation (SMD) as defined by NIMH criteria or for disruptive mood dysregulation
             disorder (DMDD).

          -  Subject has an estimated IQ &gt;70 on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-

          -  Subjects will have continuously resided with a legal guardian who has known the
             adolescent well for at least one year before study entry and is legally able to sign
             the consent form.

          -  Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) ≤ 60

          -  CGI-S (SMD) ≥ 4

          -  Participant and guardian must agree to have therapy sessions audiotaped for training
             purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject poses a significant risk for dangerousness to self or others. Risk will be

             of parent and patient by clinician.

          -  Subject suffers from a concomitant medical or psychiatric comorbidity that makes this
             study protocol inadvisable (either the treatment is contraindicated or the disorder is
             not the primary focus of treatment).

          -  Subject meets DSM-IV criteria for current alcohol or substance dependence or current
             use (defined as the past 4 weeks).

          -  Primary caretaker does not speak English or is not capable of completing study
