  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how well Carbon Acetate PET/CT imaging helps to correctly
      identify recurrent tumor versus post treatment effects (radionecrosis) in patients with
      previously treated high grade brain gliomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of Carbon Acetate PET/CT (AC PET)in
      terms of its ability to distinguish between radionecrosis/pseudo-progression and viable tumor
      in patients previously treated with surgery and radiation for high grade glioma brain tumors.

      Eligible patients with biopsy proven high grade gliomas (WHO grades 3 and 4) status-post
      prior cranial irradiation for this tumor; age 18 to 70; ECOG/Zubrod of 0-2, no other
      contraindications to trial entry, and a post-irradiation cranial MRI or CT demonstrating an
      enhancing lesion of uncertain etiology (not biopsied) will be treated with at least two weeks
      of steroidal therapy.

      Responders to steroidal therapy will be classified as either pseudo-progression (if
      asymptomatic) or radionecrosis (if symptomatic). Non-responders (those who do not respond
      clinically, radiographically, or both) will be referred for an FDG PET/CT and initial AC
      PET/CT within 3 weeks, and subsequently referred for stereotactic biopsy of their lesion
      followed by focal laser treatment (in the same operative setting) within 3 weeks of AC
      PET/CT.

      Specific Goals/Questions:

        1. What is the yield (sensitivity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value) of
           state-of-the-art PET/CT with C-11 Acetate in detecting recurrent disease versus post
           treatment effects and pseudo-progression in this patient population?

        2. How does the performance of PET with C-11 Acetate compare with that of PET using F-18
           fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) and with that of MRI?

        3. Evaluate the optimal timing for post injection imaging.

Comparison of the lesional activity to normal contralateral tracer activity will also be measured.</description>
