      This is a standard &quot;3+3&quot; Phase 1b study to determine the MTD of Oraxol (paclitaxel + HM30181
      Methanesulfonate monohydrate) in subjects with advanced malignancies that may be metastatic
      or unresectable with measurable malignant lesion(s) per RECIST Version 1.1 criteria.

                  liver metastasis is present

               -  ALP ≤ 3 x ULN or ≤ 5 x ULN if bone metastasis is present

          7. Adequate renal function as demonstrated by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN, or 24-hr
             urine creatinine clearance calculation &gt;60 mL/min

          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1

         10. Subjects who are not currently taking prohibited medication

         11. Women must be postmenopausal (&gt; 12 months without menses) or surgically sterile (ie,

             contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 toxicity from previous anticancer treatments or
             previous investigational agents

          2. Received investigational agents within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the first study
             dosing day, whichever is longer.

             6 months, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, chronic pulmonary disease
             requiring oxygen, known bleeding disorders, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements

          5. Significant or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or bleeding disorder

          6. Major surgery to the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or have a history of GI
             disease or other medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator may
             interfere with oral drug absorption

          7. Subjects with a known history of allergy to paclitaxel. Subjects whose allergy was due
             to the IV solvent (such as Cremophor®) and not paclitaxel will be eligible for this
             study.
