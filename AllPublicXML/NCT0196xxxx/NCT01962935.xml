      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of AZD 4721 in healthy volunteers after once daily administration of
      multiple ascending doses for 10 days, and an open-label comparison with the pharmacodynamics
      of AZD5069 given twice daily for 3 days
