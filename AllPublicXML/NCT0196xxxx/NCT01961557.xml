      Background:

      - Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in children. CP often causes crouch
      gait, an abnormal way of walking. Knee crouch has many causes, so no single device or
      approach works best for everybody. This study s adjustable brace provides many types of
      walking assistance. Researchers will evaluate brace options to find the best solution for
      each participant, and whether one solution works best for the group.

      Objective:

      - To evaluate a new brace to improve crouch gait in children with CP.

      Eligibility:

        -  Children 5 17 years old with CP.

        -  Healthy volunteers 5 17 years old.

      Design:

        -  All participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.

        -  Healthy volunteers will have 1 visit. They will do motion analysis, EMG, and EEG
           described below.

        -  Participants with CP will have 6 visits.

        -  Visit 1:

      &lt;TAB&gt;1. Motion analysis: Balls will be taped to participants skin. This helps cameras follow
      their movement.

      &lt;TAB&gt;2. EMG: Metal discs will be taped to participants skin. They measure electrical muscle
      activity.

      &lt;TAB&gt;3. Participants knee movement will be tested.

      &lt;TAB&gt;4. Participants will walk 50 meters.

      &lt;TAB&gt;5. Participants legs will be cast to make custom braces.

        -  Visit 2:

        -  Participants will wear their new braces and have them adjusted.

        -  Steps 1 3 will be repeated.

        -  EEG: Small metal discs will be placed on the participants scalp. They record brain
           waves.

        -  Participants will have electrical stimulation of their knees and practice extending
           them.

        -  Participants will take several walks with the braces in different settings.

        -  Visits 3 5: participants will repeat the walking and some other steps from visit 2.

        -  Visit 6 will repeat visit 2.

      Objective

      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate several configurations of a prototype Extension
      Assist Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis (EA-KAFO) in patients with cerebral palsy (CP), muscular
      dystrophy (MD), spina bifida (SB), or incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) who have knee
      extension deficiency. Three forms of assistance will be provided at the knee joint including
      a passive-damper component, functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the quadriceps, and a
      motorized assist. One form will provide variable resistance at the ankle joint which can also
      promote knee extension. These will be compared to traditional bracing which typically
      improves crouch by blocking some or all motion at one or both joints. We hypothesize that all
      assistive configurations will improve gait alignment and performance compared to the
      non-assisted conditions. We further hypothesize that a best solution for each participant
      will exist, but may vary across subjects due to the heterogeneity of these movement
      disorders. Preliminary data on brain activation using EEG will be collected during all
      walking conditions.

      Study population

      Thirty (30) subjects, age 5 and above, diagnosed with crouch gait from diplegic CP, (30)
      subjects, age 5 and above, with knee extension deficiency from MD, SB, or iSCI (15 from each
      group) and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers will be recruited.

      Design

      This protocol will evaluate an EA-KAFO prototype consisting of a custom fabricated brace
      combined with a modular knee joint with three modes of operation: hinge (no assist), a
      passive spring-damper, and an active motorized assist. Since crouch can also be precipitated
      at the ankle, the orthotic ankle joint has an adjustable dynamic resistance (ADR) mechanism
      that can be locked (passive assist) to simulate a standard brace, free, or provide variable
      resistance to assist knee extension. Additionally, we will combine quadriceps FES with the
      hinge and the passive damper to create two hybrid configurations. The hinge and the passive
      damper (Ultraflex ) knee modules, and ADR ankle brace are FDA-approved (Class I),
      commercially available devices. The active motorized joint module and the two hybrid
      configurations have been evaluated by the FDA as non-significant risk to human subjects
      (Appendix F). Healthy controls will come for one visit, and participants with movement
      disorders will complete 6-10 visits: 1) initial assessment and casting for custom leg brace;
      2) EA-KAFO configuration; 3) initial data collection and practice; 4-5) accommodation to
      brace configurations; 6) final data collection. Additional accommodation visits may be added
      if necessary, up to the maximum of 10 total visits. Motion capture, force plates, and
      electromyography (EMG) will be used for gait analysis while electroencephalography (EEG) will
      measure brain activity during walking.

      Outcome measures

      The primary outcome is the amount of knee flexion during gait. The optimal solution for each
      individual will be that which provides the greatest reduction in peak knee angle. Secondary
      outcomes will include gait speed, knee extensor moment, and EEG activation profiles.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Age 5 years and above

          -  Either a healthy volunteer, have crouch gait with a diagnosis of spastic diplegic
             cerebral palsy, or have lower extremity weakness resulting in gait pathology from a
             diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, or incomplete spinal cord injury.

          -  Able to understand and follow simple directions based on parent report and physician
             observation during history and physical examination.

          -  Able to provide verbal/written assent.

          -  Less than 5 degrees of knee flexion contracture with hip extended in supine position.
             Hamstring contracture as assessed by straight leg raising test does not limit ability
             to participate in the study.

          -  Less than 10 degrees of plantar flexion contracture in neutral foot alignment.

          -  A measured foot-thigh angle of -10 to 25 degrees in prone position.

          -  Diagnosed with knee extension deficiency as indicated by a crouched posture during
             gait lacking at least 20 degrees of knee extension at mid stance during walking as
             assessed visually, knee extensor muscle weakness which prevents full extension of the
             limb, or reliance upon braces or other aids which lock the knee during walking. (The
             exact level of knee extension deficiency, or crouch, will be quantified after
             inclusion using gait analysis.)

          -  Able to walk at least 10 feet without stopping with or without a walking aid

          -  Agreement to not drink caffeine for 24 hours before each EEG assessment (CP only)
             visit because it can modify brain activity

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -Any neurological, musculoskeletal or cardiorespiratory injury, health condition, or
        diagnosis other than cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, or incomplete spinal
        cord injury that would affect the ability to walk as directed for short periods of time.

        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CEREBRAL PALSY:

        -A history of a seizure in the past year.
