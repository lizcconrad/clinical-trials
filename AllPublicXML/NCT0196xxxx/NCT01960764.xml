  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unlike healthy control skin, the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is frequently
      colonized by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), putting these patients at increased risk of
      S. aureus skin infections. In addition, research in the investigator's lab has shown that
      these patients have fewer protective antimicrobial Staphylococcal species such as
      Staphylococcal epidermidis (S. epidermidis) known to produce antimicrobial peptides that play
      a role in protecting the skin from invading pathogens. In this study, the investigator will
      attempt to decrease S. aureus colonization and increase colonization by protective Staph
      species. First the investigator will culture the bacteria on subjects' lesional AD skin. The
      investigator will selectively grow the subject's antimicrobial Staph colonies and place them
      into a base moisturizer. The moisturizer plus bacteria will be applied to both of the
      subject's arms. Prior to applying this, though, one arm will first be pre-treated with an
      antimicrobial regiment of Dial liquid antibacterial soap and alcohol. We will then compare
      the abundance of antimicrobial Staph species on each subject's arms 24 hours later to
      determine whether the pre-treatment regimen increased survival of the transplanted
      antimicrobial Staph species. The investigator expects that the arm pre-treated with the
      antimicrobial regimen will have more antimicrobial Staph species at this time point.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects who are not pregnant or lactating

          -  18-80 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis for at least 6 months using the Hanifin and Rajka
             Diagnostic Criteria for atopic dermatitis

          -  Presence of lesional atopic dermatitis skin in both antecubital fossae

          -  Positive S. aureus colonization based on results of a skin culture taken from one of
             their AD-affected antecubital fossae during the screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any topical AD treatments (including topical steroids, topical calcineurin
             inhibitors) to either arm within one week of either screening visit

          -  Use of any oral/systemic AD therapies (antihistamines, steroids) within 28 days of
             either screening visit

          -  Severe AD that would worsen significantly from holding a participant's usual
             topical/oral AD medications for the time periods required in the inclusion/exclusion
             criteria (one week prior to the screening visits and during the study for topical
             medications and 28 days prior to screening visits and during the study for oral
             medications)

          -  Subjects who have taken a bleach bath within a week prior to screening, or who take
             bleach baths during the study

             gathered verbally from the patient while taking a medical history from the patient,
