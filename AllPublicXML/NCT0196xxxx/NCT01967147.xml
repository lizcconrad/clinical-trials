      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the superior efficacy of Systane® Balance over
      Preservative-Free 0.9% Saline following 35 days of QID (4 times a day) dosing in treating dry
      eye subjects with lipid deficiency.

      This study consisted of 4 visits conducted during 3 sequential phases: the Run-in Phase
      (which included a screening visit and run-in period), Treatment Phase I and Treatment Phase
      II. In Phase I, subjects were randomized to either Systane® Balance or Saline and dosed 4
      times a day for 35 days. In Phase II (Day 35-90) subjects continued to dose with their
      assigned product on an as-needed basis.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in TFBUT at Day 35</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>TFBUT (the time required for dry spots to appear on the corneal surface after blinking) was assessed by the investigator using ophthalmic dye and a biomicroscope and measured in seconds. Subjects were dosed in the office 1 hour ±10 minutes prior to TFBUT assessment. A shorter TFBUT indicates a higher likelihood of dry eye symptoms. A positive change indicates an improvement in TFBUT. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in TOSS Score at Day 35</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>The TOSS score (a cumulative cornea and conjunctival staining score) was assessed by the investigator using ophthalmic dye and a biomicroscope. Three areas of the ocular surface were graded for dryness on a 0-5 scale (0=Absent, 5=Severe), with a resultant overall score of 0-15. A negative change indicates an improvement in dry eye-related staining. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in OSDI Score at Day 35</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI is a 12-item quality of life questionnaire designed to assess ocular surface symptoms, their severity, and their impact on the subject's ability to function. Each item was scored by the subject on a 0-4 Likert-type scale (0=None, 4=All of the Time), with a resultant overall score of 0-100 (0=no disability, 100=complete disability). A negative change number represents a perceived improvement in ocular health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in IDEEL Treatment Effectiveness Score at Day 35</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>The IDEEL is a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess the subject's general satisfaction with treatment use. The subject responded to treatment effectiveness questions (Questions 2-5) using a 0-4 Likert-type scale, where 0=None of the time and 4=All of the time. The IDEEL treatment effectiveness score was calculated as the sum of the responses from Questions 2-5 divided by the number of questions (2-5) answered, multiplied by 25, for a resultant overall score of 0-100. A positive change number represents perceived improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in IDEEL Treatment Inconvenience Score at Day 35</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>The IDEEL is a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess the subject's general satisfaction with treatment use. The subject responded to treatment inconvenience questions (Questions 6, 8-10) using a 0-4 Likert-type scale, where 0=All of the time and 4=None of the time. The IDEEL treatment inconvenience score was calculated as the sum of the responses from Questions 6, 8-10 divided by the number of questions (6, 8-10) answered, multiplied by 25, for a resultant overall score of 0-100. A positive change number represents perceived improvement.</description>

The subject responded to treatment effectiveness questions (Questions 2-5) using a 0-4 Likert-type scale, where 0=None of the time and 4=All of the time. The IDEEL treatment effectiveness score was calculated as the sum of the responses from Questions 2-5 divided by the number of questions (2-5) answered, multiplied by 25, for a resultant overall score of 0-100.</description>

Subjects were dosed in the office 1 hour ±10 minutes prior to TFBUT assessment. A shorter TFBUT indicates a higher likelihood of dry eye symptoms. A positive change indicates an improvement in TFBUT.

        <title>Change From Baseline in IDEEL Treatment Inconvenience Score at Day 35</title>
        <description>The IDEEL is a 10-item questionnaire designed to assess the subject's general satisfaction with treatment use. The subject responded to treatment inconvenience questions (Questions 6, 8-10) using a 0-4 Likert-type scale, where 0=All of the time and 4=None of the time. The IDEEL treatment inconvenience score was calculated as the sum of the responses from Questions 6, 8-10 divided by the number of questions (6, 8-10) answered, multiplied by 25, for a resultant overall score of 0-100. A positive change number represents perceived improvement.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were collected for the duration of a subject’s participation in the study (up to 90 days). AEs were reported as pretreatment and treatment-emergent. Ocular adverse events are presented for both study eye and non-study eye.</time_frame>
      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended injury, or untoward clinical signs in subjects, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the medical device/product. AEs were obtained through solicited and spontaneous comments from the subjects and through observations by the Investigator, as outlined in the protocol.</desc>
