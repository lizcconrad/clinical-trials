      To determine if the use of insulin isophane results in improved control of blood sugars
      compared to the use of insulin glargine in new onset diabetes after kidney, lung, or heart
      transplantation (NODAT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large percentage of organ transplant recipients develop de novo diabetes mellitus after
      transplantation, also called &quot;New Onset Diabetes After Transplant&quot; or NODAT. The cause of the
      diabetes appears to be commonly used anti-rejection medications, particularly calcineurin
      inhibitors and glucocorticoids.

      Management of glucose levels in NODAT often requires insulin therapy. Standard practice is to
      start long-acting insulin. However, patients with NODAT often exhibit fasting morning glucose
      levels that are relatively low compared to pre-lunch and pre-dinner glucose levels. This
      seems to make NODAT patients more susceptible to fasting, or morning, hypoglycemia on
      long-acting insulin analogues than non-transplant patients with type II diabetes. This
      phenomenon of morning hypoglycemia in NODAT often limits the up-titration of basal insulin
      resulting in suboptimal treatment of hyperglycemia later in the day. Because of this pattern,
      transplant patients may respond better to morning insulin isophane (intermediate acting) than
      to long-acting insulin glargine preparations.

      Our trial is designed to compare morning NPH insulin (isophane insulin) with conventional
      therapy of basal glargine insulin on both continuous blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c
      (glycosylated hemoglobin).
