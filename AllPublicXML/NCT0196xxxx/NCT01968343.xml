  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Trichotillomania is a psychiatric condition characterized by chronic pulling and
      plucking of one's own hair. Cognitive behavioral therapy shows promise as a treatment.
      However, there have been no randomized, controlled studies of the efficacy of group
      cognitive-behavioral therapy. Methods: We evaluated 44 subjects, whom met the criteria for a
      diagnosis of trichotillomania. Subjects were randomized to receive 22 sessions of either
      group cognitive-behavioral therapy or group supportive therapy (control).

    <measure>Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Hairpulling Scale (HPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MGH-HPS comprises seven self-report items that are scored on a Likert scale (0-4 points).22 Higher MGH-HPS scores correspond to greater severity of trichotillomania symptoms. Reference: Psychotherapy and Psychosomatic Journal 1995;64:141-5</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI consists of 21 items, scored from 0 to 3, higher scores corresponding to greater severity of depression. It is a self-report measure of depression that is widely used in research and in clinical practice. Reference: Archives of General Psychiatry 1961;4:53-63.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) Self-Report (SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS-SR is a self-report scale consisting of 54 questions addressing seven specific areas in relation to the last two weeks25: work; social life and leisure; family relationships; marital relationship; relationships with children; home life; and financial status, each corresponding to a partial score.
