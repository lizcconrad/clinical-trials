      surgery.

      Method: This study is a blinded randomized trial. 70 patients with colorectal cancer will
      undergo laparoscopic colorectal resection, and will be divided into two groups. Protocols for
      fast-track group includes skipping preoperative mechanical bowel preparation, early
      restoration of diet and early postoperative ambulation. Outcome measures, length of hospital
      stay, postoperative surgical stress response (C reactive protein) and postoperative
      complications will be compared between the two groups.
