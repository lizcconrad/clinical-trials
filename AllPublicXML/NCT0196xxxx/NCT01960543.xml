  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients with hip fracture are frail due to associated comorbidity. In these
      situations, regional anesthesia is recommended as it is associated to less postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction. However, hypotension during the process may impair ischemic
      cardiopathy and induce a cerebrovascular stroke. Selection of the right anesthetic agent and
      the administration of vasoactive drugs during the process can minimize these risks. Although
      bupivacaine and levobupivacaine share pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, the
      studies show conflicting results. The aim of this study is to investigate if there are
      clinically relevant differences between these two drugs in terms of hemodynamic parameters
      during the surgical process with special focus on the effects on regional cerebral oximetry
      and cognitive status after surgery.
