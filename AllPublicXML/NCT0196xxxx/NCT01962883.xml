  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with the purpose of determining the
      efficacy of osteopathic treatment on vestibular symptoms of the post concussed vestibular
      disturbed athlete as determined by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Balance
      Error Scoring System (BESS). Of secondary interest, this study will evaluate the osteopathic
      assessment findings of this population and side effects, positive and negative, associated
      with the osteopathic treatment provided.

      Primary Hypothesis

        1. Osteopathic treatment will have no effect on the symptoms of dizziness of the vestibular
           disturbed post concussed athlete using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory

        2. Osteopathic treatment will have no effect on the balance recovery of the vestibular
           disturbed post concussed athlete using Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)

           Secondary Hypothesis

        3. To determine the side effects of osteopathic treatment of the vestibular disturbed post
           concussed athlete

      The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with the purpose of determining the
      efficacy of osteopathic treatment on vestibular symptoms of the post concussed vestibular
      disturbed athlete as determined by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Balance
      Error Scoring System (BESS). Of secondary interest, this study will evaluate the osteopathic
      assessment findings of this population and side effects, positive and negative, associated
      with the osteopathic treatment provided.

      The study will focus on Athletes between the ages of 18-40 who have received a concussion and
      continue to suffer the sequela of symptoms, including vestibular disturbances, a minimum of
      1-month and maximum of 1-year post concussion. A sports medicine physician will screen
      potential participants for inclusion and exclusion criteria and referred to the project as
      appropriate.

      All subjects will receive an initial osteopathic evaluation and baseline BESS and DHI. There
      will be a total of 7 balance tests performed each week for the first 5 weeks and then the
      final at the 8-week mark. Dizziness inventories will be completed daily for the duration of
      the 8-week project. The control group will receive the standard of care, rest, whereas the
      experimental group will receive four osteopathic treatments in addition to rest. The
      experimental group, in addition to completing BESS testing and DHI forms will also account
      for any side effects associated with osteopathic treatments daily following treatments.

    <measure>Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subject to complete DHI form daily for 9 weeks. Change in DHI scores over time periods: baseline (day 3), time 1-4 (day 5 post treatment or equivalent in control group) and time 5 (19 days post final treatment/equivalent in control group).</time_frame>
    <description>The DHI is a subjective self or clinician administered paper test consisting of 25 questions measuring the self-perceived handicap related to dizziness (Treleaven, 2006). The DHI represents 3 subdomains associated with dizziness or unsteadiness: functional, emotional and physical (Jacobson &amp; Newman, 1990). Each Yes answer is marked as a 4, each Sometimes answer is marked a 2 and each No answer is marked 0 to which the sum of the scores demonstrates the perceived handicap (Treleaven, 2006). Scores 0-30 is indicative of a mild handicap; 31-60 indicates a moderate handicap; 61-100 indicates a severe handicap (Treleaven, 2006). Jacobson &amp; Newman (1990) found a difference of at least 18 points from pre-treatment to post-treatment findings to suggest significant change in a patient's subjective perception on dizziness handicap. The DHI has shown significant correlation between specific objective measures of balance (Treleaven, 2006).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subject to complete BESS once a week for the first 5 weeks and again week 8. Change in BESS scores over time periods: baseline, week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4 and week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>The BESS test is a short and easily administered objective clinical balance test often used in assessing and tracking recovery from athletic concussion (Iverson et al, 2008). It tests balance in a variety of stances either on solid ground or medium density foam (Guskiewicz, 2001 &amp; Iverson et al, 2008). The stance is held for 20 seconds to which error points are given based on changes to the stance such as opening the eyes; a maximum of 10 points is utilized for this study (Iverson et al, 2008). Normative values have been established for the BESS (Iverson et al, 2008) and significant correlations have been established between BESS and force-platform sway measures (Riemann et al, 2000).</description>
