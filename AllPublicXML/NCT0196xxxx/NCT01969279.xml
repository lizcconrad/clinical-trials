    <textblock>
      Although there is strong evidence that bisphosphonates prevent certain types of osteoporotic
      fractures, there are concerns that these medications may be associated with rare atypical
      femoral fractures (AFF). But the relationship between long-term bisphosphonate treatment and
      AFF is unclear. In this study, the investigators would like to analyze the long term effects
      on femur by bisphosphonate treatment.The participants are treated in the investigators
      hospital more than four years.

      Bisphosphonates have been widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Recently, long-term
      use of bisphosphonates increases the risk for AFFs in older women, according to the results
      of a population-based, nested case-control study. Unique radiographic pattern of AFF is
      reported, such as simple transverse or short oblique fracture with breaking of medial cortex
      and cortical thickness. But radiographic evaluation were performed for fracture patients in
      previous reports and the femoral condition of long-term bisphosphonate treatment patients
      before fracture is not known.

      The main objective of this study is to reveal the effects of long-term bisphosphonate
      treatment on femur.

    <description>The investigators plan to analyze 120 patients who undergo bisphosphonate treatments more than four years.
We investigate radiographic features in patients with long-term bisphosphonate treatment. We investigate bilateral femur radiographs concerning to cortical thickening and cortical hypertrophy. We also investigate age and sex matched patients without bisphosphonate treatment as a control group.
To determine the bisphosphonate treatment effects on femur, statistical analyses are performed using Spearman correlation, paired t-test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test. Finally, we conclude the effects of bisphosphonate treatment on femur.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to108 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators plan to analyze 100 patients who undergo bisphosphonate treatments more than four months. To enroll 300 participants including drop-out patients, up to 60 months is required beside 48 months treatment periods.
In this study, we plan to evaluate longitudinal changes of femur. We evaluate femur radiographs at baseline and every one year. We investigate bilateral femur radiographs concerning to cortical thickening and cortical hypertrophy longitudinally. Statical analyses are performed using Spearman correlation coefficients, paired t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test and Fisher's exact test.</description>
