  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study has evolved and expanded since its inception. Originally the intent
      was to establish the functional, molecular and genetic profile of fibroblasts from
      Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) patients as compared to carefully matched control subjects.
      While this remains among the objectives, the study has been expanded to undertake a fully
      powered cross-tissue systems genetics analysis of FMD, and now also the related
      arteriopathies spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and cervical artery dissection
      (CvAD). The overall objective is to disclose the core biologic mechanisms of these disorders.

      Specific aims

        -  Specific aim 1: To establish a library of fibroblasts, DNA, plasma and serum from
           patients with FMD, SCAD and CvAD and unaffected healthy control subjects.

        -  Specific aim 2: To perform a fully powered cross-tissue systems analysis of the key
           regulatory gene networks and disease drivers underlying FMD, SCAD and CvAD.

        -  Specific aim 3: To cross-compare the molecular and genomic profiles of FMD, SCAD and
           CvAD to establish the degree of biologic similarity among these disorders.

        Will enroll 200 FMD patients, 100 SCAD patients, and 100 CvAD patients at the Mount Sinai
        Hospital. 200 matched healthy controls will also be recruited to this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of any age and freely willing to participate. For patients &lt; 18 years of age
             consent will be via parents.

          -  Fluency in either English or Spanish.

          -  Signed, informed consent

          -  For FMD, SCAD or CvAD subjects - a clinical diagnosis of FMD, SCAD or CvAD with
             fulfillment of standard diagnostic criteria.

          -  For healthy controls - no clinical features of FMD, SCAD or CvAD and absence of any
             major ongoing systemic disease including any condition requiring hospitalization,
             immune suppression, intravenous or injected medications or that result in functional
             impairment in the performance of activities of daily living. Where possible, healthy
             controls will be unaffected family members. Healthy controls will be matched to
             enrolled FMD patients on the basis of gender and approximate age (within a 5 year
             window of another FMD subject).

          -  Patients with any solid organ or hematological transplantation, or those in whom
             transplantation is considered.

          -  Active autoimmune disease.

          -  Illicit drug use.
