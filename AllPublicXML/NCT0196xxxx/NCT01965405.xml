  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study with People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), we will use a stepped care
      model called a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to examine the
      efficacy of low- and high-intensity smoking cessation treatments for nicotine dependent PLWHA
      that incorporate the current standard of care and prize-based contingency management.
      Intervention will be administered in a community-based HIV integrated care clinic in downtown
      Detroit, which has the highest prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS and smoking in Michigan. Phase 1
      will last 4 weeks, and will involve brief intervention to help participants stop smoking. For
      phase 2, participants will be assigned to different study arms depending on whether they are
      Responders (reduced their smoking) or Non-responders (continued to smoke).

        1. Phase 1: We hypothesize that brief high-magnitude prize contingency management will
           result in greater reduction in smoking than standard of care alone.

        2. Phase 2a: We hypothesize that non-responders who are assigned to contingency management
           will be more likely to reduce their smoking throughout treatment and to abstain from
           smoking at all follow-up points.

        3. Phase 2b: We hypothesize that responders who are assigned to monitoring and
           low-magnitude prize contingency management will be more likely to maintain their reduced
           or abstinent smoking status at all follow-up time-points.

      All research related activities will take place at the Tolan Park Medical Building located at
      3901 Chrysler Service Dr, Detroit, 48201.

      Participants in Phase 1 will be randomized to one of two brief interventions based on
      standard of care guidelines (SoC): A) brief counseling and bupropion (SoC); or B) SoC plus
      brief high-magnitude prize CM (HM-CM). At the end of Phase 1, participants will be classified
      as responders or non-responders on the basis of smoking reduction/abstinence. All
      participants will continue to receive bupropion. Non-responders will enter Phase 2a and be
      randomly assigned to: A) continued counseling and monitoring support to quit smoking (MS); or
      B) MS plus prize CM for abstinence (MS+CM). Phase 1 responders will be entered into Phase 2b
      and randomly assigned to: A) no additional treatment (NAT); or B) Continued monitoring and
      low intensity prize CM (LI-CM). The primary dependent variables will include cotinine and
      carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and longest duration of abstinence from cigarettes. Seven-day
      point prevalence will be used to assess outcome at post-treatment, 6-month and 12-month
      follow-up points.

      Participants will be paid $35 for intake and $25 for each follow-up interview, which will
      occur at post-phase 1, post-phase 2, and 6-months and 12-months after treatment initiation.
      Some assessments as well as treatment sessions will be recorded to ensure data quality.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline: weekly in treatment phase 1; between 0 to 16 times during treatment phase 2 (non-responders meet 16 times; responders meet 0 or 6 times depending on group); Follow-up interviews (Post-phase 1, Post-phase 2, 6-months and 12-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine, and can be detected in urine. The presence of cotinine in urine shows recent cigarette smoking. Cotinine is measured using an instant test that give a score from 0 to 6 on a semi-quantitative scale. Declining scores show an individual has stopped or significantly reduced their smoking.</description>

    <measure>Longest Duration of Continuous Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline: Weekly through treatment phase 1; between 0 to 16 times during treatment phase 2 (non-responders meet 16 times; responders meet 0 or 6 times depending on group)</time_frame>
    <description>This is the longest period of consecutive days during treatment where the participant has not smoked. Longest duration of abstinence is calculated through self-report of smoking abstinence verified by scores on biological measures (negative scores on carbon monoxide or urinary cotinine tests).</description>

    <measure>Seven-Day Point-Prevalence</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up interviews: Post-phase 1, Post-phase 2, 6-months and 12-months after treatment initiation.</time_frame>
    <description>At each follow-up assessment, participants will be asked if they had smoked in the preceding seven days. They will also participate in cotinine and carbon monoxide testing. Negative scores are given when the participant reports no smoking and all tests are negative.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Carbon Monoxide Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline: weekly in treatment phase 1; between 0 to 16 times during treatment phase 2 (non-responders meet 16 times; responders meet 0 or 6 times depending on group); Follow-up interviews (Post-phase 1, Post-phase 2, 6-months and 12-months)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide breath carbon monoxide samples at each visit by blowing into a hand-held carbon monoxide reader. Carbon monoxide is produced when substances (such as cigarettes) are burned. Thus this test can show if an individual has been smoking recently.</description>
