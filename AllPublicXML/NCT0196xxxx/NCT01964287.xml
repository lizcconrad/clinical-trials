    <textblock>
      Based on conventional chemotherapy approach, data have indicated that the Folfirinox regimen
      is more effective and tolerate than the treatment by Gemcitabine alone in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A recent study combining gemcitabine and nab paclitaxel
      improve the objective response rate.

      Primary objective of this study is to identify the maximun tolerated dose and the recommended
      phase II dose of first line treatment combining gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel followed by
      folfirinox in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
             The definitive diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be made by
             integrating the histopathological data within the context of the radiologic data.

          2. Initial diagnosis of metastatic disease must have occurred ≤6 weeks prior to inclusion
             in the study.

          3. One or more metastatic tumors measurable metastatic lesions by CT scan of the abdomen,
             pelvis and chest, or hepatic MRI and CT scan (abdomen, pelvis and chest) without

          4. No previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or investigational therapy for the
