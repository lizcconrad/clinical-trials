        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient age ≥ 18 years.

          2. Rutherford Category 2-4.

          3. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to participate and has
             signed an Ethics Committee approved informed consent form.

          4. Documentation of significant ISR defined as &gt;50% stenosis and &gt;5 cm in length
             determined by diagnostic angiogram or duplex ultrasound.

          5. A previously deployed bare nitinol stent(s) in the femoropopliteal segment extending
             from the ostium of the SFA to 1 cm above the tibioperoneal trunk. A guidewire has
             successfully traversed the target treatment segment, or is able to cross using
             standard support catheter crossing techniques, is angiographically documented to be
             within true lumen and not placed through stent struts. Guidewire access may obtained
             via contralateral, ipsilateral or retrograde approach. If a retrograde guidewire
             approach is used to cross the target lesion, guidewire exchange and an antegrade
             approach is required prior to treatment with the Winsor Laser Catheter.

          6. One or more patent tibial vessel(s) defined as &lt;50% stenosis thoughout the segment
             with outflow to the foot.

          7. Successful treatment of any inflow lesion(s) defined as final residual stenosis &lt;30%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is pregnant.

          2. Has known uncontrollable hypercoagulable condition, or refuses blood transfusion.

          3. Any co-morbid condition that in the judgment of the physician precludes safe
             percutaneous intervention.

          4. Crossing devices other than guidewire support catheters.

          5. Type 4 or 5 stent fracture as assessed by angiography.

          6. Target lesion is located within a covered stent.

          7. Acute limb ischemia
