  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate genetic predisposition to hepatic steatosis and the expression
      of gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes in livers of obese children and adolescents.

      Hypothesis 1: Common variants recently associated with variation in plasma TG levels
      identified in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) (such as GCKR, PNPLA3) can affect
      accumulation of fat and subsequent development of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).
      Gene variants act in additive or synergistic manner with progressive liver fat accumulation
      per additional risk allele.

      Hypothesis 2: With increase in hepatic fat content NASH and fibrosis will increase.
      Furthermore, expression of lipogenic markers (SREBP1c) will increase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To establish a cohort of obese youths to prospectively analyze potential factors (genetic and
      nutritional factors) that might affect the expression and progression of NAFLD. This study
      will determine genetic markers and their ability to convey susceptibility to NAFLD in obese
      children and adolescents. Furthermore, potential mechanisms that might contribute to the
      accumulation of hepatic Triglyceride (TG) accumulation will be, for the first time, assessed
      by genotyping. Additionally, we will examine the presence of intestinal microbiome in the
      development of fatty liver through stool collection.
