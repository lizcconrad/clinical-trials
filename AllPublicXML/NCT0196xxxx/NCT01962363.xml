      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of EPI-743 in patients with Friedreich's
      Ataxia point mutations
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether treatment with EPI-743 has a
      discernible impact on visual function—including visual acuity, visual fields and color vision
      as well as on any of a number of functional and subject/clinician-rated scales relevant in
      the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia, and to determine the safety of treatment with EPI-743.
