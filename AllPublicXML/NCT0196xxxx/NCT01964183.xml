      To assess the effect of multiple doses of mirabegron to postmenopausal adult female subjects
      on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tolterodine and its metabolites.

      In addition, the safety of these products will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of two years after menopause

          -  Body weight (at screening) ≥ 40.0 kg and &lt; 70.0 kg

          -  Body mass index (BMI) (at screening) ≥ 17.6 kg/m2 and &lt; 26.4 kg/m2

          -  Healthy, as judged by the investigator/sub-investigator based on medical history and
             the results of physical examination (subjective symptoms and objective findings) and
             all tests obtained at screening and during the period from hospital admission (at
             single dosing phase) to immediately before study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received or scheduled to receive any investigational drugs in other clinical trials,
             post-marketing studies, or clinical studies within 120 days before the screening or
             during the period from the screening to hospitalization (Day −2).

          -  Donated or scheduled to donate 400 mL of whole blood within 90 days before the
             screening or during the period from the screening to hospitalization (Day −2), 200 mL
             of whole blood within 30 days before the screening or during the period from the
             screening to hospitalization (Day −2), or blood components within 14 days before the
             screening or during the period from the screening to hospitalization (Day −2).

          -  Any deviation of the laboratory tests at screening or hospitalization (Day −2).

          -  A deviation from the normal range of blood pressure, pulse rae, or body temperature at
             screening or hospitalization (Day -2) Supine blood pressure: Systolic blood pressure:
             ≥90 mmHg, ≤140 mmHg, Diastolic blood pressure: ≥40 mmHg, ≤90 mmHg Supine pulse rate;
             ≥40 bpm, ≤99 bpm Axillary body temperature; ≥35.0°C, ≤37.0°C

          -  History of drug allergies

          -  Upper gastrointestinal disease (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and stomachache) within 7 days
             before hospitalization (Day −2)

          -  Concurrent or previous hepatic disease (e.g., viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver
             injury, and hepatic impairment)

          -  Concurrent or previous heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, angina pectoris,
             and arrhythmia requiring treatment)

          -  Concurrent or previous GI disease (e.g., ileus paralytic, gastric atony, intestinal
             atony, colitis ulcerative, peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux esophagitis;
             except for a history of appendicitis).

          -  Concurrent or previous renal disease (e.g., acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis,
             and interstitial nephritis)

          -  Concurrent or previous endocrine disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism and blood growth
             hormone abnormal)

          -  Concurrent or previous cerebrovascular disorder (e.g., cerebral infarction)

          -  Previous use of mirabegron or tolterodine

          -  Excessive smoking or drinking habit
