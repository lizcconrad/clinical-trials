    <textblock>
      This research puts liver biopsy as the enrollment screening criteria and the primary efficacy
      assessment indicators. Patients at different developmental stages of hepatitis B related
      liver fibrosis are respectively diagnosed and treated by Traditional Chinese medicine to
      determine optional diagnosis and treatment plan of traditional Chinese medicine to screen the
      advantage-treated population and to establish a treatment program, which can save national
      medical resources, for clinical application of Traditional Chinese medicine Diagnosis and
      Treatment blocking and reversing hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis. The research can help to
      build automation pathological analysis and diagnosis systems and non-invasive clinical
      assessment criteria and models of liver fibrosis which can be applied in clinical. It can
      also help to realize electronic patient data collection and management, to establish patients
      management centre and follow-up database. Then it will help to improve clinical efficacy of
      being blocked and reversed chronic hepatitis B related liver fibrosis by Chinese medicine
      Diagnosis and Treatment program, to reduce the incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatitis
      B-related mortality, to prolong patients' survival and improve patients' quality of life, to
      make clinical efficacy, which is about Traditional Chinese Medicine blocking and revering
      chronic hepatitis B-related liver fibrosis, increase by 15% or more .
