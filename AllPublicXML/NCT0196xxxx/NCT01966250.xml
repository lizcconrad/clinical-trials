    <description>Electroacupuncture: Using 0.25 mm (diameter) X 0.40 mm (length) sized disposable stainless steel needles, electric stimulation will be applied with an electronic stimulator (ES-160, ITO co. LTD, Japan) 2 times/week × 4 weeks. Stimulation will be applied with the current in biphasic wave form. Acupuncture points are Jia-ji (Ex-B2, L3-L5; bilateral) as necessary points and reasonable points (according to decision of practitioner) as accessory points. Each session lasts 15 minutes.
Usual care: Physical therapy and patient education will be performed 2 times per week for 4 weeks. ICT lasts 15 minutes and Hot or Ice pack lasts 10minutes. Doctors will educate patient physiology, pathology, and epidemiology of low back pain. And also suitable postures and exercises for low back pain will be educated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose low back pain persisted or recurred after back surgery with or without
             leg pain.

          -  Patients whose pain has been persisted at least 3 weeks recently and who are necessary
             to care intermittent medical treatments (eg. medication, injection, physio therapy).

          -  Patients with pain, defined as an Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) value ≥ 50mm.

          -  Patients who are 19 - 70 years of age.

          -  Patients who agreed to voluntarily participate in this study and signed informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have been diagnosed with a serious disease that can cause low back pain
             (e.g., cancer, vertebral fracture, spinal infection, inflammatory spondylitis, cauda
             equine compression, or other disqualifying conditions).

          -  Patients with progressive neurological deficit or severe neurological symptoms.

          -  Patients whose pain causes are not resulted from spine or resulted from soft tissue
             diseases(e.g., cancer, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, gout).

          -  Patients with a chronic disease that could influences the effects of the treatment or
             the analysis of treatment results (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetic neuropathy,
             fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, epilepsy, or other disqualifying
             conditions).

          -  Patients for whom acupuncture would be inappropriate or unsafe (e.g., hemorrhagic
             disease, clotting disorders, a history of receiving anticoagulant therapy, severe
             diabetes with a risk of infection, severe cardiovascular disease, or other
             disqualifying conditions)

          -  Patients who are currently pregnant or planning the pregnancy.

          -  Patients with psychiatric diseases.

          -  Patients who are participating in other clinical trial.

          -  Patients who are unable to sign informed consent.

          -  Patients who are judged to be inappropriate for the clinical study by the researchers,
             such as inability to read and write Korean.
