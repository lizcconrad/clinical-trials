  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondyloarthritis refers to a set of inflammatory disorders that mainly afflict the spine,
      joints and ligaments. A subtype of spondyloarthritis is Ankylosing Spondylitis - now known as
      axial spondyloarthropathy - which is characterized by inflammation of the joints in the
      spinal column, and the part of the back where the spine meets the pelvis. Another subtype of
      spondyloarthritis is Psoriatic Arthritis where patients often develop raised patches of
      reddened skin. The disease can advance to one of more joints in the body resulting in pain,
      swelling and stiffness. These forms of inflammatory arthritis can become chronic and over
      time can lead to pain, disability and deformity.

      There is now evidence that patients with inflammatory arthritis that are diagnosed and
      treated earlier in the course of their symptoms may have better results. Yet although we know
      that early treatment is important, the investigators still don't know if there are factors
      that can predict how an individual patient's disease will progress over time in terms of
      losing mobility. The investigators also do not know the relationship between loosing mobility
      and the formation of bone around the spine and joints.

      The investigators are doing this study because the investigators want to learn more about
      patients with these forms of arthritis - Ankylosing Spondylitis and Psoriatic Arthritis. The
      investigators want to learn more about the factors that can predict how their disease might
      progress over time and what their response to treatment might be. The investigators would
      also like to determine the proportion of patients with these types of symptoms and describe
      the best treatment strategies for them.

      The condition to be studied is Spondyloarthritis (SpA). The investigators will gather a
      cohort of patients with variants of SpA (n = 70), including Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and
      Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) who have axial disease and fully characterize disease activity.
      Care guidelines suggest that these patients are seen at least twice within the first year
      with annual visits thereafter. Radiographs are desirable to assess disease progression, but
      are not always required. Treatment options for both PsA and AS patients include non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroid injections, disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs) and biologics (i.e. tumor necrosis factor inhibitors aka TNF inhibitors or TNFi's).
      The cohort of patients eligible for enrollment in this study would be those patients who for
      the preceding 6 weeks have not received biologic treatment such as infliximab,and who for the
      preceding 4 weeks have not received biologic treatments such as adalimumab,
      etanercept,golimumab, certolizumab pegol and other biologic therapies.

      Subjects will be evaluated 4 times over two years: at enrollment, 24 weeks, 52 weeks and 104
      weeks (with a 12 week window around each visit). Usual care for patients with SpA would
      include regular assessments of pain, function and mobility, assessments of spine and joint
      motion, joint swelling and tenderness with treatment changes at each follow up visit to
      reduce pain, improve function, address adverse events to medications and enhance spinal
      mobility. Interventions might include physical therapy, analgesics, NSAIDs, DMARDs or
      biologic therapies. The investigator would not assign specific interventions to the subjects
      of the study. All of this would be recorded.

      Specific clinical information will be gathered at each visit using validated indexes and data
      collection instruments, including disease activity [using the Bath AS Disease Activity Index
      (BASDAI) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)], function (using the Bath
      AS Functional Index (BASFI), measure joint/ligament involvement, measuring tender and swollen
      joint counts, dactylitis, enthesitis (as quantified using the Spondyloarthritis Research
      Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) enthesitis index and spine involvement (measured as range of
      movement in the spine and hips using the Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI).

    <description>(a) A secondary outcome will be the difference in peripheral blood IL-23R levels in patients whose ASDAS improves by at least 1.1 over 1 year and will be measured at the end of the first year and again at the end of the two-year study period. These patients will be referred to as &quot;responders&quot; to usual care. (We will also look at changes in level of IL-23R over 2 years in responders vs. non responders). A change of at least 1.1 is the minimally clinically important difference.
b) We will evaluate the correlation of other immune modulators and inflammatory cytokines such as, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-21 and disease activity in patients who are followed serially with standard disease activity measures (ASDAS, BASDAI), function (BASFI), and enthesitis (MASES)(1, 2).</description>
