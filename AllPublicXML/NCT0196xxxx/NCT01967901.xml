  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is becoming a global health concern that affects largely the
      elderly population. Despite advances in pharmacological and management strategies, DKD remain
      associated with high morbidity and mortality. Patients living with such chronic disease, are
      expected, on daily basis to manage their self-care activities. Patients' non-adherence to the
      treatment is thought to be the major cause for the poor control and the occurrence of
      complications. Previous researchers have shown that multidisciplinary management of chronic
      disease can improve patients' self-care and outcomes. However, none of these programs was
      centered on self-care and targeted patients with DKD. A multidisciplinary self-care
      management program could improve the outcomes of patients with DKD, and delay the progression
      of the disease.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a multidisciplinary self-care management
      program on self-care behavior, quality of life, medication adherence, glycemic control and
      renal function, in adults with DKD.

      The study will use a cross-over design. 32 adult with DKD, will be randomly recruited from
      the Vaud University Medical Center, nephrology department and will be enrolled in the program
      for 12 month. All variables will be measured at baseline, three, six, nine and 12 month. We
      will measure the patients' self-care behavior, quality of life, adherence to the
      anti-hypertensive medication taking using, the Revised Summary of Diabetes Self-Care
      Activities questionnaire, the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of life questionnaire and
      the Medication Events Monitoring System. We will assess the patients' glycemic control by
      measuring the glycated hemoglobin and the renal function by measuring the serum creatinine
      and the microalbumin creatinine ratio.

      The study will clearly show if a multidisciplinary self-care management program will improve
      the health outcomes of patients with DKD and will allow us to recommend the establishment of
      such a program.

    <description>The usual care consists of patients' follow up by their usual nephrologist and endocrinologist or general practitioner.
Self-care management consists of a the addition of a multidisciplinary self-management program that includes additional home and clinic visits and telephone follow-ups made by the self-care management nurse and clinic visits to the dietician.
In this sequence, patients will receive the usual care for 3 months. Then, they will cross-over to receive a multidisciplinary self-management for the following 6 months and then cross-over to a 3 months of usual care.</description>
