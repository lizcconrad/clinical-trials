  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the intestinal microbiota in newly diagnosed
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with that from individuals without RA.

      The first analysis will compare the proportion of filamentous bacteria in the intestinal
      microbiota between the two groups.

      The secondary objectives of this study are :

        -  A. To compare between the two groups :

        -  a. The proportion of Proteus mirabilis in the intestinal microbiota;

        -  b . The proportion of species producing peptidyl arginine deaminase (PAD ) in the
           intestinal microbiota;

        -  c . The number of species found in the intestinal microbiota.

        -  B. To evaluate bacterial translocation (from the digestive tract) in newly diagnosed RA
           patients with and healthy volunteers without RA. (Bacterial translocation is a
           phenomenon in which live bacteria or a part of bacteria (e.g. LPS teichoïc acid) cross
           the intestinal barrier and reach the bloodstream.).

        -  C. To describe the ecology of the intestinal microbiota of newly diagnosed RA patients
           (characterization of species found according to their respiratory metabolism, according
           to their bacteriological characteristics, and according to whether or not the species
           are found significantly more frequently in patients with RA than in individuals without
           RA).
