  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with
      cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the
      laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying them, and then giving the cells back to
      the patient. In a previous study the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type
      of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of
      the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors. In this
      study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells which we
      hope will be better in making the tumors shrink.

      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified
      cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause tumors to
      shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 years old and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on their tumors.

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and
           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as
           needed

        -  Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will
           undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells.
           {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the
           patient.}

        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for
           the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO-1 cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in
           the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

        -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side
           effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every
           6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2
           days.

      PRECIS

      Background:

        -  We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both and &lt;= chains of a
           murine T cell receptor (mTCR) that recognizes the NY-ESO-1 (ESO) tumor antigen, which
           can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A2 and ESO double positive tumors, anti-ESO mTCR transduced T
           cells secreted significant amounts of IFN- &gt;= with high specificity.

      Primary objective:

      - To determine whether the administration of anti-ESO mTCR-engineered peripheral blood
      lymphocytes (PBL) plus high-dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting
      preparative regimen may result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic
      cancers including melanoma expressing the ESO antigen.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-A*0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have

        -  Metastatic cancer including melanoma whose tumors express the ESO antigen;

        -  Patients must have previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred
           after receiving standard care for metastatic disease;

      Patients may not have:

      - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of cells to retroviral vector supernatant
           containing the anti- ESO mTCR genes. This mTCR targets the exact same epitope as the
           hTCR.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  On day 0 patients will receive anti-ESO mTCR gene-transduced PBMC and then begin high
           dose aldesleukin.

        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks)
           following the administration of the cell product.

        -  The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design (Simon R, Controlled
           Clinical Trials 10:1-10, 1989). The objective will be to determine if the combination of
           high dose aldesleukin, lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-ESO TCR-gene
           engineered lymphocytes is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can
           rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).

        -  A total of up to 43 patients may be enrolled (41, plus allowing for up to 2
           non-evaluable patients).

                  vitiligo).

        Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks, as
        long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less or as specified in the eligibility
        criteria.

        Note: Patients who have previously received ipilimumab and have documented GI toxicity must
        have a normal colonoscopy with normal colonic biopsies.

             radiation therapy without biopsy is the standard treatment

          2. Recurrent disease/progression after receiving all standard treatments, which must
             include the following:

               -  surgical resection, if possible;

             months

          7. Patients must be on stable dose of steroids for at least 5 days prior to baseline
             imaging

          1. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to 70 years of age.

          2. Willing to sign a durable power of attorney

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to

                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          8. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the

             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          5. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy.

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
