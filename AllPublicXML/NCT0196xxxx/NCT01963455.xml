      This study was designed to provide confirmation of safety of muscle derived cell (MDCs) for
      the treatment of stress urine incontinency (SUI) in women.

      The investigators will be assessed the 12-month safety and potential efficacy of autologous
      muscle derived cells as therapy for stress urinary incontinence. A total of 10 women in whom
      stress urinary incontinence had not improved underwent intra-sphincter injection of low doses
      30Ã—106 of autologous muscle derived cells, which will be derived from biopsies of their
      deltoid muscle. Assessments will be made at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after cell injection.
      Changes in stress urinary incontinence severity were evaluated by pad test, diary of
      incontinence episodes and quality of life surveys.
