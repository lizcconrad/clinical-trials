      A phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JVS-100 administered by retrograde
      delivery to cohorts of adults with Ischemic Heart Failure.

    <textblock>
      72 subjects with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The Phase I portion (n=12 subjects) will be open
      label. In the first cohort, six subjects will receive a single dose of 30 mg of JVS-100 with
      a minimum of 3 days between each enrollment. After seven days following the enrollment of the
      last patient of cohort 1, a safety assessment by the DSMC will be performed. Upon DSMC
      approval, the second cohort of six subjects will receive a single dose of 45 mg of JVS-100
      with a minimum of 3 days between each enrollment. After seven days following the enrollment
      of the last patient of cohort 2, a safety assessment by the DSMC will be performed. Upon DSMC
      approval, up to 60 subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive a single dose of 30 mg or
      45 mg of JVS-100 or matching placebo.
