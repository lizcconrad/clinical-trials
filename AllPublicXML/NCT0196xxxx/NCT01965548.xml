  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In blunt trauma, the spleen is most frequent injured organ in the abdomen and the most
      frequent source of bleeding in the abdomen.

      Historically, splenectomy was the treatment of choice for splenic bleeding. For
      exsanguinating patients, open splenectomy is still the proper choice of treatment if the
      spleen is a significant source of bleeding. However, for hemodynamic stable patients with
      splenic injury, non-operative management (NOM) is an alternative, assuming they have no other
      indication for surgery (peritonitis).

      Non-operative management includes observation and/or splenic artery embolisation (SAE), but
      the indications for observation and SAE varies between trauma centers. The greatest advantage
      of NOM is the preservation of splenic function.

      In the investigators hospital splenic artery embolisation was introduced in 2007. The
      investigators want to describe the treatment of splenic injuries in their hospital, to see if
      the number of splenectomies has been recduced after 2007, and to see if SAE has also been
      used in transferred trauma patients.
