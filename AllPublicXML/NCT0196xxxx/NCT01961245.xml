  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown, that in patients with very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) the additional use of non-invasive ventilation during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)
      may enhance the benefits of PR. It is assumed that the non-invasive ventilation techniques
      provides a better recovery of the respiratory pump during the night. If non-invasive
      ventilation also decreases the metabolic demands during night is unknown and is aim of this
      study. During a 3 week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program a total of 85 patients with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage IV will be recruited for this study. There will
      be a 4:1 distribution into 2 groups. 68 patients with an indication for the use of a
      non-invasive ventilation will be involved in the intervention group where non-invasive
      ventilation will be initialized. 17 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage
      IV without an indication for the use of non-invasive ventilation will be involved in a
      control group to detect the changes in nocturnal energy expenditure produced by pulmonary
      rehabilitation alone. All outcome measurements will be performed during day 1-3 and will be
      repeated after 12 days (with or without non-invasive ventilation) at day 15-17 of the
      pulmonary rehabilitation program.

      A sub-trial of this study is to validate night movement accuracy of the Dynaport activity
      monitor with the observations made by a night-vision camera in the sleep lab. This will be
      performed in study participants as well as in healthy volunteers.
