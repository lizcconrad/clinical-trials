  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth is in most cases due to iatrogenic causes, particularly drugs. The existing
      products such as saliva substitutes are often disappointing (bad taste, poor efficiency).

      Our hypothesis has considered the &quot;empirical&quot; observations made by some patients with
      xerostomia who consumed milk products to relieve the dry mouth syndrome from which they
      suffered. With this clinical observation, a closer collaboration has been undertaken with
      research laboratories specialising in food and especially milk. Through its composition, the
      dairy product in itself provides relief for the patient, due both to its physical and
      biochemical properties, which could explain these observed improvements, and elements related
      to the phenomena of consumption of food as an alternative to medication. In the latter,
      hedonism takes on a role which has not been previously assessed. Initial work undertaken with
      the department of applied research at the National Dairy Industry School (ENIL) led to the
      prototyping of a new natural milk, which is the subject of this application for development,
      to qualify and adapt a product with a &quot;health benefit&quot; in patients suffering from xerostomia.

      To further develop this project we will initiate a sequential clinical trial by groups of
      five ambulatory patients with xerostomia (patients taking antidepressants followed in
      psychiatry appointments). The clinical tests will be organised by the CIC with the
      psychiatric wards of the University Hospital of Besançon. Each group of 5 patients will test
      a similar product for 14 days. The information collected after a series of tests with a group
      of patients will be translated by changing the ENIL specifications to produce a new
      mini-series of products. This repetition will be carried out up to 3 times if necessary to
      help achieve a satisfactory product in terms of taste, texture and lubrication properties,
      which will then be tested in a randomized controlled cross-over study of the efficiency and
      acceptability of the new &quot;LactoXeros&quot; product versus a reference product (Aequasyal ®,
      Oxidized Glycerol Triester) on a group of 32 patients at the University hospital of Dijon.

      A natural way to combat xerostomia at the interface of patient diet, such as we propose,
      could help improve quality of life for patients, minimize harmful effects (infection, decay)
      and promote adherence of patients to treatments which are responsible for xerostomia.

    <description>The mouth dryness score will be evaluated using a visual analogical scale (scale increased from 0 to 10 cm). The value 0 refers to normal mouth dampness (absence of dry mouth symptoms) and value 10 represents &quot;the worst imaginable&quot; dry mouth symptoms. This score is specific, sensitive and reproducible</description>

    <description>The oral examination will be performed by a dentist. During the inspection, the Silness Loe plaque index will be measured. The appearance of the oral tissue (redness, dryness) will be assessed using an ordinal 4-point scale as follows: 0 = none, 1 mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe</description>

    <description>Patients will take the oral spray for 14 days. The Aequasyal ® Oral Spray is a solution of oxidized glycerol triesters. The oral spray is applied by spraying on the inside of each cheek, 3-4 times per day. After each administration, users are instructed to gently spread the product around the mouth with the tongue. The Aequasyal ® Oral Spray is a Class I medical device, and is CE-marked.</description>
