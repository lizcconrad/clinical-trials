  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis and septic shocks are increasingly codified. A biomarker as Lactate is very
      interesting to detect those situations. Usually, lactate used is arterial but results are
      often too slow to obtain if we want to respect Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Some
      analyzers (EKF diagnostics Lactate Scout*) can give results in 15 seconds.

      We hypothesized that capillary lactate, easy to sample, tested with this analyzer may detect
      earlier those infections states and we want to find the most accurate site to detect severe
      sepsis (capillary, venous or arterial sample).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actually, patients presenting a sepsis with arterial lactate&gt; 2 mmol.l-1 must be considered
      as criticals, and if lactate&gt; 4 mmol.l-1 as septic shock. However, results are usually slow
      to obtain, especially if we want to respect the Surving Sepsis Campaign, which preconize
      antibiotic as soon as possible (first hour).

      In admission room, arterial sample can't be easily done and usual results need more than 30
      minutes. On the contrary, using analyzers like &quot;EKF diagnostics Lactate Scout*&quot; can give
      results faster with capillary blood (15 seconds). We will compare this results with both
      veinous and arterial lactate.

        -  For primary outcome, we will determine the most accurate value of capillary or veinous
           lactate that may be able to detect critical patient suspected of infection.

        -  for secondary outcomes, we will determine if quick capillary lactate test may replace
           arterial lactate in this indication and be able to predict mortality.
