  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the efficacy of ranibizumab in combination with reduced-fluence verteporfin
      photodynamic therapy (RF-PDT) in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization
      secondary to pathologic myopia (PM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients received ranibizumab 0.5 mg combined with reduced fluence (RF) verteporfin
      PDT. Ranibizumab was first administered to patients followed after seven days by RF-PDT.
      Subsequently intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) was injected as needed (pro re nata). All
      patients were evaluated every 4 weeks for 48 weeks.

      Main Outcome Measures: Mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at 48
      weeks, reduced mean central foveal thickness (CFT) analyzed by optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) and improved macular sensitivity registered at microperimetry (MP) evaluation.

    <description>In the verteporfin PDT combination therapy arm patients were treated on day one with 0.5 mg (10 mg/ml) IVR injection and after seven days with PDT standard fluence (wavelength, 689 nm; dose, 50 J/cm2; light intensity, 600 mW/cm2 for 83 s). Ranibizumab pro re nata (PRN) could be administered with a 30-day interval if re-treatment criterion were met. Re-treatment was based on increase of intraretinal or subretinal fluid &gt; 50 μm on OCT; loss of 5 letters or more on BCVA Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart; fluorescein leakage from the CNV on FA images.</description>
