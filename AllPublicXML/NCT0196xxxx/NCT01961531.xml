      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of early and intermediate toxicity related
      to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered in a more convenient 5 fraction
      schedule using non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB) (AccuBoost System) in
      women with resected, early stage breast cancer.

      Non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB), using advanced image-guided radiation
      technology, has the potential to eliminate the disadvantages of the conventional APBI
      techniques. NIBB facilitates non-invasive partial breast irradiation without the use of
      catheters or implants. Yet by using breast immobilization and precise image-guidance, it
      reduces non-target breast tissue within the irradiated field compared with other non-invasive
      APBI techniques such as 3D-CRT. This has made NIBB an attractive approach to deliver APBI.

      We hypothesize that NIBB delivered in 5 treatments will be a more convenient, safe and
      effective modality to deliver partial breast irradiation.

      Anticipated advantages of NIBB protocol treatment include:

        -  Convenient treatment schedule

        -  Short course can allow for increased patient access to treatment

        -  Non-invasive approach

        -  Increased accuracy with precise targeting of lumpectomy cavity using advanced imaging

        -  Reduced irradiation of non-target breast tissue

        -  Reduced skin toxicity

        -  No heart or lung radiation exposure

        -  Reduced late skin or breast toxicity

        -  High rate of good or excellent cosmetic outcome

        -  High rate of ipsilateral breast tumor control comparable to other APBI techniques

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A confirmed histological diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma or DCIS;

          2. Age greater or equal to 50 years old;

          3. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months;

          4. Treated by breast conserving surgery

          5. Pathologic lymph node negative, which includes (pN0 i-, i+);

             Patients, who are at very low risk for sentinel node involvement and sentinel node
             biopsy is not performed, are eligible if the treating investigator documents
             clinically lymph node negative (cN0). These patients include:

               -  DCIS

               -  Microinvasion only

               -  Pure tubular or mucinous histology

               -  Patients â‰¥ 70yo with T1a-T1c; estrogen receptor +

          6. Pathologic tumor size

               1. less than or equal to 2 cm for invasive disease;

               2. less than or equal to 3 cm for DCIS;

          7. Estrogen receptor positive if invasive disease (DCIS can be ER negative)
