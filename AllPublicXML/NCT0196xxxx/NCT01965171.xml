  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red cell transfusions are an important part of supportive cancer therapy. The iron in the
      transfused blood may build up in the body since the human body has no way to get rid of extra
      iron. Iron tends to build up in the liver and the heart muscle. It is unknown if iron
      build-up is present many years after completing cancer therapy. It is also not known if extra
      iron causes harm to internal organs. Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
      (SJCRH) want to understand if iron build-up (called &quot;iron overload&quot;) exists in survivors of
      leukemia. They also want to know if iron overload can cause injury to your organs if it is
      present.

      Liver iron accumulation has been documented in childhood cancer survivors, however, it is not
      known if iron associated organ toxicity is contributing to the long-term morbidity that has
      been well documented among these survivors. This study will investigate the prevalence of
      iron overload and the association of tissue iron burden with markers of organ dysfunction in
      leukemia survivors. This study will determine the prevalence of iron overload among long-term
      leukemia survivors that underwent blood transfusion. This study will use blood and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) testing to determine iron overload of specified organs. Understanding
      the prevalence of iron overload could impact surveillance practices in leukemia survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To determine the prevalence of iron overload in the liver [liver iron concentration
           (LIC) &gt;3mg/g using R2* MRI measurements] and in the heart (T2* &lt;20 ms) among long-term
           leukemia survivors transfused with ≥50ml/kg of packed red blood cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To examine the relationship between hepatic, cardiac, and endocrine dysfunction and
           transfusionally acquired iron overload as defined by R2* and T2* MRI among survivors of
           pediatric leukemias.

        -  To investigate the association between serum ferritin, transferrin saturation,
           non-transferrin-bound iron, and hepcidin measurements with R2* and T2* MRI-defined iron
           overload.

      Participants will have blood work drawn after an overnight fast during a routine clinic
      visit. They will also have an electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) which are
      often a required part of their annual visit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams of the
      heart, liver, and surrounding abdominal organs will be done on all participants using a
      method of scanning that involves a closer study of these organs (called R2* MRI).

    <description>Fisher's Exact test will be performed to examine the relationship of organ dysfunction and iron overload. Then the logistic regression model will be built to evaluate the effect of the iron overload defined by R2* and T2* MRI on the risk of organ dysfunction, respectively, while controlling for the effects of craniospinal radiation and chemotherapeutic agents.</description>
