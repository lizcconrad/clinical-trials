  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicin is a TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) agonist, causing pain upon
      application. The investigators wish to determine whether mannitol blocks the effect of
      capsaicin application. As both cream bases are identical and mannitol addition is the only
      difference between the creams, if the mannitol cream is more effective in blocking the effect
      of capsaicin on the TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) receptor, the
      investigators will have established that mannitol down-regulates or blocks the TRPV1
      (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) receptor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicin cream, which stimulates the TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1)
      receptor, causing a burning sensation, will be applied to both halves of the upper lip until
      a burning sensation with 8/10 intensity on an NRS (Visual Analog Scale) scale is experienced
      or five minutes have elapsed. Following this, the capsaicin cream will be wiped off and 30%
      mannitol in vehicle cream ( isopropyl palmitate, caprylic capric triglyceride, propylene
      glycol, ceteareth 20, cetearyl alcohol, glyceryl stearate, polyethylene glycol 100 stearate,
      dimethicone, octyldodecanol, lecithin, ethylhexyl glycerin and phenoxy ethanol) will be
      applied to one half of the upper lip, and vehicle cream alone will be applied to the other
      half. Cream assignment will be randomized and neither the subject nor the person applying the
      cream will know which half upper lip has which cream. Every minute for 10 minutes, the heat
      sensation felt in each half upper lip will be measured, using a visual scale from 0 to 10. A
      repeated measures analysis of variance will compare the NRS (Visual Analog Scale) scores from
      the 30% mannitol cream, to the NRS (Visual Analog Scale)scores from the vehicle cream.
      Significance will be accepted if P less than .05.

    <description>Every minute after capsaicin cream application, subject will indicate NRS (numerical rating scale)heat score. When the score has reached 8/10 or after five minutes, the cream will be removed. The time needed to reach 8/10 heat score and the heat score achieved, or the score at five minutes will be recorded. Following application of the test creams, NRS (Visual Analog Scale) heat scores will be recorded once per minute for each side for 10 minutes.</description>
