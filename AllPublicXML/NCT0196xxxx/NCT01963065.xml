      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether babies are exposed to significant levels of
      chemicals during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). For example, other
      research studies have shown that babies are exposed to plasticizers (bisphenol A, phthalates)
      in the NICU. Plasticizers are chemicals that are used to make plastic medical equipment soft
      and flexible. The research team wants to find out whether the amount of plasticizer and other
      chemicals babies may be exposed to in the NICU makes a difference in how they grow and how
      they perform on neurologic tests.

      1. Significance Premature newborns may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic
           chemicals in the environment because of their small body size, immature hepatic and
           renal clearance mechanisms, and rapid rate of development. Approximately 8% of neonates
           in the United States require admission to a level II or III NICU following birth; thus
           over 300,000 infants annually are exposed to the chemical-intensive hospital environment
           during a developmentally vulnerable period. Neonates treated in the NICU have elevated
           risk of developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, attention deficit hyperactivity
           disorder, and autism that is only partially explained by degree of prematurity or
           severity of clinical disease. Lesions found on neuroimaging are relatively insensitive
           predictors of long-term cognitive and behavioral outcome. Moreover, many medical
           conditions associated with prematurity, such as chronic lung disease and retinopathy of
           prematurity, are incompletely predicted by gestational age at birth or severity of
           newborn illness. We hypothesize that a portion of the neurocognitive, social, and
           somatic impairments seen in NICU graduates are attributable to potentially preventable
           NICU-based exposures.

           As NICU care has matured, survival is likely for all but the most premature infants. Our
           research emphasis is therefore shifting from survival to developing methods for
           improving the long term growth and development of our patients. We believe this research
           strategy must examine the potential contribution of chemical exposures that occur during
           the NICU stay as predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome. All subjects in the proposed
           study are cared for in the NICU - therefore comparisons are internally valid. While
           findings may not be generalizable to non-NICU populations, the potential positive impact
           of this work on thousands of NICU graduates makes this work a high impact public health
           priority. We focus on very low birth weight (VLBW) infants as these infants generally
           experience much of the third trimester developmental window ex utero in the NICU.
           Studies of in utero chemical exposure indicate the vulnerability of developmentally
           immature individuals during this same developmental window. It is therefore logical to
           assess whether ex utero exposures occurring in the NICU act similarly. Additionally,
           small cross-sectional studies indicate the high exposure levels faced by NICU
           inpatients. Both through the proposed study and through continuation of this line of
           research in future studies, we plan to characterize the role of hospital-based chemical
           exposure on neurodevelopment in NICU graduates.

        2. Preliminary Studies and Innovation Substantial information on the health effects of
           community-based early life exposure, as well as the presence in the NICU environment,
           exist for the chemicals of interest in this study. Numerous materials used in NICU care,
           such as incubators, respiratory support devices, and intravenous (IV) and enteral
           feeding supplies, are made from plastics that act as vehicles of chemical exposure.
           Phthalates - chemicals used to make plastic flexible and resilient - are common in
           medical materials. Bisphenol A (BPA) and contaminating metals are also present in
           plastic materials. Silver is added to plastic IV catheter components as an
           antimicrobial. Parenteral nutrition (PN), frequently administered for long duration in
           the NICU, contains Mn. Surprisingly, there is little evidence to support the safety of
           the total dose of Mn added to PN, and a growing body of literature suggests that Mn
           toxicity may be occurring among NICU patients. Exposure to these chemicals may be
           associated with significant systemic and neurodevelopmental impairment, however, their
           impact on neurodevelopment in NICU graduates is largely unstudied.

        3. Chemical Childhood Outcome Associated with Early Life Exposure Evidence of Exposure
           Evolving evidence suggests that chemical and non-chemical stressors in the NICU may
           impact infant neurodevelopment. The built environment, ambient noise, in-hospital
           parent-child interactions, and parental stress during the NICU stay have been associated
           with altered neurodevelopment among NICU graduates. Socioeconomic factors and
           psychological functioning of the primary caregiver are also linked to childhood
           neurodevelopmental outcomes generally. These factors must therefore be considered as
           confounders and/or modifiers in any comprehensive NICU neurodevelopmental outcome
           association study.

        4. Study Goals and Plan This study will identify specific sources of chemical exposure
           among NICU inpatients and explore the association between exposure and
           neurodevelopmental outcomes. Overall, we will use the research portion of this career
           development award to identify chemical targets and neurodevelopmental assessment
           protocols for the PI's subsequent R01 application(s). The proposed study will identify
           the prevalence and dose of chemicals to which NICU inpatients are exposed and provide
           pilot data on associations with neurodevelopmental outcomes. In year four, the PI will
           use this data as the basis of her first R01 application in which she will generate a
           cohort of NICU graduates in whom exposure dose and timing are quantified and
           neurophenotypes measured in infancy and childhood. We have picked a small number of
           candidate chemicals for which exposure is known or likely, the negative
           neurodevelopmental impact of community exposure is documented, and the health
           implications for NICU-based exposure are unknown. Prior studies have documented numerous
           phthalate-containing materials in the NICU and elevated biomarkers of phthalates and BPA
           in NICU inpatients. These studies were limited by cross-sectional specimen sampling,
           patient enrollment without attention to factors likely to affect chemical metabolism
           including gestational or chronologic age and severity of illness, and small sample size.
           To our knowledge, biomarkers of NICU-exposure to Ag, Cd, and Mn have not been assessed,
           despite the documented presence of these metals in the NICU and known adverse health
           outcomes related to early life exposure. No previous study of NICU chemical exposure has
           considered the important potential confounders/modifiers of chemical toxicant impact to
           be considered in the proposed study.

      The proposed study will also develop a novel clinical exposure assessment tool, the NICU
      Exposure Checklist (NICE-Check). Using detailed biomarker analysis coupled with prospective
      assessment of contact with medical materials over the duration of the NICU hospitalization,
      we hope to define the association between the intensity of exposure to specific medical
      materials and chemical biomarker levels. This type of association was preliminarily noted but
      incompletely characterized by Green et al. in their pilot study of phthalate exposure in the
      NICU.(54) Development and validation of NICE-Check, a novel, rapid, accurate, and
      cost-effective chemical exposure assessment tool, would allow preliminary identification of
      sources of chemical exposures that could potentially be removed, and facilitate future large
      studies of hospital-based chemical exposure. This would be a particularly valuable screening
      tool for the field, as exposure biomarker testing for large numbers of chemicals is
      prohibitively expensive for most studies.

      To our knowledge, the relationship between biomarkers of exposure to chemicals in the NICU
      and specific care practices has not been explored. Additionally, the potential association
      between NICU-based chemical exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits has not been evaluated.
      Two studies assessed outcomes related to NICU phthalate exposure, but neither used exposure
      biomarkers or other validated exposure assessment methods to characterize initial exposure
      nor considered important non-chemical confounders.

      The proposed study will address these limitations and will be a comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation of chemical exposure in the NICU designed to evaluate environmental chemical
      exposure and clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population. This study will also assess
      psychosocial stressors in the NICU that co-occur with chemical exposures and could
      modulate/confound outcome assessment. This study's success will be aided by its
      interdisciplinary nature bringing together neonatologists (including the PI) and NICU staff
      (including RN leadership) with environmental health scientists (the mentor and co-mentors).
