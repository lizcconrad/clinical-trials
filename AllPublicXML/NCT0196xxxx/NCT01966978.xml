  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to assess and compare the effect of insulin detemir in
      combination with liraglutide and metformin versus insulin detemir in combination with insulin
      aspart and metformin in subjects with very uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes (A1c &gt; 10%).

      The aim of this study is to compare a GLP-1 plus basal insulin and metformin treatment
      regimen to a basal-bolus plus metformin treatment regimen in patients with very uncontrolled
      (HbA1c&gt;10%) type 2 diabetes. The investigators will compare the two regimens with respect to
      efficacy in improving glycemic control, rate of hypoglycemia, change in weight, effect on
      patient quality of life, treatment burden, physician time, as well as healthcare related
      cost. The investigators hypothesize that at 26 weeks from randomization the two treatment
      regimens will have similar percentage of patients reaching A1c levels &lt;7.0%, while more
      patients on the GLP-1 plus basal insulin strategy will achieve the composite end point of A1c
      levels &lt;7.0% without severe hypoglycemia or significant weight gain.
