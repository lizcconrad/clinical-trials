      Background The prediction of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens is a key issue in the
      management of health-care associated pneumonia (HCAP). Multiple risk factors have been
      proposed, some of which overlap with items of the pneumonia severity index (PSI). The aim of
      this study was to investigate the relationship between PSI and presence of MDR pathogens.

      Methods Patients who were admitted to a tertiary-care hospital from January 2005 to December
      2010 were screened by a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia. Patients were enrolled if they
      fulfilled the definition of HCAP by 2005 ATS/IDSA guideline.

      MDR bacteria were defined as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter species,
      those not sensitive to second and third generation cephalosporins, Acinetobacter species,
      extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli (E. coli)
      and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia),
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia), and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA).

      The criteria for HCAP is defined as follows: patients who had been hospitalized in an acute
      care hospital for two or more days within the past 90 days; residents of a nursing home or
      long-term care facility; recipients of recent intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy or
      wound care within the past 30 days; or patients who attended a hospital or hemodialysis
      clinic.

        Patients who were admitted to the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, an 800-bed tertiary care
        hospital in northern Taiwan, from January 2005 to December 2010 were screened by discharge
        diagnoses.The patients whose primary discharge diagnosis was pneumonia (International
        Classification of Diseases codes 482, 485, and 486) were selected.
