  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators hope to learn if they can prevent or lessen the symptoms of neonatal
      abstinence syndrome (NAS) in babies born to narcotic-dependent mothers by using the drug
      ondansetron in the mothers prior to delivery and their babies after delivery.

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with one half the
      mother-baby pairs to receive ondansetron and the other half of the mother-baby pairs to
      receive placebo. The pregnant narcotic-dependent mothers will receive an intravenous dose of
      study medication prior to delivery; the neonates, after their birth, will receive the same
      study medication the mother received every 24 hours for up to 5 days.

      The Investigators will follow up with the mother-baby pairs for 10 days after study drug has
      stopped and one last follow up, about 30 days after stopping study drug, to learn if the baby
      had any symptoms of NAS in that time period.

      All neonates will have a screening 12-lead EKG prior to their first dose of study medication
      to determine if QTc prolongation is present. A repeat 12-lead EKG will be done after each
      dose of study medication, approximately 2-5 hours post dose; if a neonate has prolonged QTc
      the study drug will be stopped.

      Investigators may obtain up to 9 pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples from the neonates over 5
      days when standard of care blood samples are drawn. These samples will consist of 1 to 2
      drops of blood collected on filter paper and sent to Stanford for PK analysis.

      The modified Finnegan scoring system will be used to evaluate neonates for symptoms of NAS at
      each site and it is considered standard-of-care for babies at risk of NAS. Morphine will be
      the first treatment choice before other treatment medication choices (opioid or non-opioid)
      for NAS symptoms. Each site involved has established guidelines for starting, advancing and
      weaning treatment for NAS. Any medication used to treat NAS will be recorded.

      Interim analysis: will be performed after the first 20 pregnant women and their neonates have
      been enrolled and dosed with study drug. (Interim Analysis was done on first 21 mother/baby
      pairs in May 2016).

      To protect the confidentiality of the patients (study subjects), the lead site, Stanford
      University, received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH.

             the mother and the neonate.

          -  neonate, preterm or post-term gestational age at delivery.

          -  neonate, QTc showing results greater than or equal to 480ms on any 12-lead ECG post
             delivery will stop the dosing of the study drug, but safety follow up will be done if
