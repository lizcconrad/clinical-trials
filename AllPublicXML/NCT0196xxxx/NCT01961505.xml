  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that results in a chronic inflammatory
      disorder that may affect many synovial joints, and may cause serious disability. It has been
      confirmed that Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F has effects of anti-inflammatory,
      immunosuppressive and cartilage protection. This is a prospective randomized controlled study
      to evaluated the efficacy and safety of external application with compound Tripterygium
      wilfordii Hook F in treating of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
