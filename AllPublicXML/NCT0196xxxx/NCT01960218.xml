  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether, and if so, which gas exchange parameters measured on the Shape-HF
      Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing System predict 30 and 180 day re-hospitalization in subjects
      discharged from hospitalization for an episode of acute decompensated heart failure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-specialty clinical study. This study is intended to evaluate
      the select gas exchange parameters during a short, sub-max bout of exercise using a simple
      stationary step on day of discharge to predict the subjects' readmission for acute
      decompensated heart failure.
