    <description>The laparoscopic appendectomy was performed with three trocars. Pneumoperitoneum was created using an open Hasson technique. The mesoappendix was divided using a harmonic scalpel or endoscopic tissue fusion device. The appendix was divided by placing one endoscopic loop and cut with harmonic scalpel. The specimen was removed through the umbilical port.</description>
