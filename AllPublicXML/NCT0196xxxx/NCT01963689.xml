    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>after 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory consists of 2 scales, each one containing 20 items. One of the scales evaluates state anxiety, characterized by subjective feelings of tension and apprehension, followed by autonomic nervous system responses at a given moment. Trait anxiety, assessed by the other scale, refers to a relatively stable tendency to perceive situations at threatening and react anxiously to them. The scores are divided into low, moderate, high and very high and are determined by the sum of 20 symptoms from a 5-point Likert-type scale.The range of scores is 20-80, the higher the score indicating greater anxiety for both the Trait and State Anxiety.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Esteem Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>after 60 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is a unidimensional measure of self-esteem, which has 15 statements about the assessments that the subject makes about itself. For each statement, the subject chooses one of two options: agree or disagree. The level of self-esteem is provided through a template that assigns one point for each answer in agreement and zero points for each answer in disagreement. The maximum score is 15 points and the minimum is 0 points.</description>
