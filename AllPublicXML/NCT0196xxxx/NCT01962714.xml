  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will assess whether a novel complementary and alternative
      medicines (CAM) intervention, Loving-kindness Meditation (LKM), is not meaningfully inferior
      to another group-based PTSD treatment , Cognitive Processing Therapy (Cognitive Only version;
      CPT-C) for reductions in PTSD and depressive symptoms. 170 male and female Veterans with
      current PTSD will be randomized to LKM or CPT-C. The investigators hypothesize that Veterans
      randomized to LKM will report mean reductions in PTSD and depressive symptom severity that
      are not meaningfully worse than CPT-C. The investigators further hypothesize that reductions
      in posttraumatic maladaptive beliefs will more strongly mediate PTSD and depressive symptom
      improvement for those assigned to CPT-C than those assigned to LKM.

      Aim 1: Evaluate if LKM is non-inferior to CPT-C in producing reductions in PTSD symptoms
      among Veterans with current PTSD. Aim 2: Evaluate the non-inferiority of LKM and CPT-C in
      producing reductions in depressive symptoms among Veterans with current PTSD. Exploratory
      Aim: Evaluate potential mediators of response to LKM and to CPT to provide preliminary
      information regarding whether they are consistent with the mechanisms of change
      conceptualized by each intervention to be associated with improvement in PTSD and depression.

      Methods: A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing LKM to CPT-C. In the
      proposed project 170 Veterans with PTSD will be randomized to LKM or CPT-C. Comprehensive
      assessments will be performed at baseline as well as at the end of the 12-week interventions
      and 3 and 6 months later. PTSD symptoms, depression, posttraumatic maladaptive cognitions and
      self-compassion will be assessed weekly during the treatment phase to assess temporality of
      change and to assess mediators of outcomes.
