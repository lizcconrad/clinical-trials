    <textblock>
      The BCPP study is designed to test the hypothesis that implementing an enhanced combination
      prevention package which includes provision of ART to all participants, regardless of CD4
      count or HIV disease severity, will impact the HIV/AIDS epidemic by significantly reducing
      population-level, cumulative HIV incidence in a defined geographic area over a period of 3
      years and will be cost-effective.

    <description>Scale-up of HTC services during 2 annual HTC campaigns, with a target of &gt;90% of adults having documentation of their HIV-infected status or documentation of an HIV-negative test in the preceding 12 months.
Scale-up of universal ART for all HIV-infected adults, with a target of &gt;93% of HIV positive adults receiving ART.
Scale-up of retention in care and adherence interventions, with a target of ensuring that &gt;95% of HIV-infected adults are virally suppressed with HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies per ML..
Scale-up of linkage to MC services, with a target of ensuring &gt;60% of HIV-negative men are circumcised.
Rapid strengthening of PMTCT services, with a target of &gt;90% of women initiated on indefinite ART (Option B+) during pregnancy remaining in care and on treatment at 12 months post-delivery.</description>
