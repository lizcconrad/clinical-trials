  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a pilot study of cluster randomized clinical trial of an practice intervention to
      improve the quality of care for suspected lower respiratory and and urinary tract infections
      among 60 nursing home residents with advanced dementia living in 4 facilities (2 matched
      intervention/control pairs) for 12 months. We hypothesize that 1. In the intervention
      compared to the control facilities there will be a trend towards a greater proportion of
      infections for which antimicrobials were initiated appropriately, and 2. in the intervention
      compared to the control facilities there will be a trend towards higher proxy satisfaction
      with decision-making, fewer hospital transfers, and lower antimicrobial exposure.

    <description>Provider Training: i. on-line education course and ii. algorithms and checklists. The course consists of 4 cases: 2 for urinary tract infection and 2 for lower respiratory tract infections with multiple choice questions and evidence-based feedback. To reinforce provider learning, posters displaying algorithms guiding appropriate antimicrobial initiation for infections will be placed in all nursing home units. Laminated pocket cards with the algorithms will be given to providers. Providers will complete simple checklists for each suspected infection throughout the study. B. Proxy Information: The printed material explains, in a lay fashion: i. the nature of infection in advanced dementia, ii. treatment options, iii. concerns about antimicrobial overuse, and iv. features of appropriate antimicrobial use.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Resident eligibility criteria include: 1) Age &gt; 65, 2) Dementia, 3) Global Deterioration
        Scale score of 7,59 and 4) a proxy is available who can speak in English. Features of
        Global deterioration stage 7 include: profound memory deficits (cannot recognize family),
        total functional dependence, speech &lt; 5 words, incontinence, and inability to ambulate.

        Eligibility criteria for providers in the intervention nursing homes include: Medical
        Doctor,a. nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant identified by a senior
        administrator as an individual who cares for residents with advanced dementia, and is 2.
        able to communicate in English because on-line course and algorithms are in English., and
        3. over 21 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Residents with cognitive impairment due to causes other than dementia (e.g., head trauma)
        and in short-term, sub-acute SNFs will be excluded. -
