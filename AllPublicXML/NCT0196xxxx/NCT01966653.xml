  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed before the establishment of a structured process for drug assessment,
      nitrofurantoin is now being prescribed frequently given the rise in multi-resistant
      gram-negative pathogens. Doubts remain regarding fosfomycin's long-term clinical
      effectiveness. A randomized, controlled trial is needed to explore the clinical effectiveness
      and better define the side effect profiles of both nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. This
      multi-center open trial will randomize 600 non-pregnant women at three international sites
      (200 each in Poland, Switzerland, and Israel) at increased risk for carriage of resistant
      uropathogens and with suspicion of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection to receive
      either oral nitrofurantoin 100 mg three times daily for 5 days or a single 3g dose of oral
      fosfomycin. Patients will be followed for clinical and bacteriologic response at days 14 and
      28 post therapy completion. The study hypothesis holds that nitrofurantoin will be superior
      to fosfomycin in clinical efficacy at final follow-up.

      2013 through summer 2016, this multi-center open trial will randomize 600 non-pregnant women

    <description>Clinical response is defined as either (1) clinical cure, which in turn is defined as complete resolution of symptoms with no recurrence of symptoms or signs of urinary tract infection; (2) clinical failure, defined as the need for additional, or change in, antibiotic treatment due to a urinary tract infection, OR discontinuation due to lack of efficacy; or (3) indeterminate response, defined as either persistence of symptoms without objective evidence of infection (absence of bacteriuria or pyuria) OR any extenuating circumstances precluding a classification or clinical cure/failure.</description>

    <description>Bacteriologic response is defined as either (1) bacteriologic cure, that is, eradication of the infecting strain with no recurrence of bacteriuria (&lt;10x3 cfu/mL) during follow-up; or (2) bacteriologic recurrence, defined as bacteriuria &gt;10x3 cfu/mL. However, bacteriologic recurrence without urinary tract symptoms will be designated asymptomatic bacteriuria and left untreated.</description>
