      In order to produce better more effective vaccines, it is important to understand the
      particulars of why individuals have an effective or ineffective immune response to
      vaccination. We are going to examine specific aspects of the antibody (IgG Fc glycan) made by
      healthy volunteers who receive different vaccines or who have a viral infection to understand
      the nature of an effective (or less effective) vaccine response. The results of this research
      could be used to develop adjuvants to increase/ improve vaccine response.

      Antibodies are principle mediators of immunity against infections and they can also give rise
      to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Two functional domains make up an IgG antibody - the
      Fab domain binds to a specific target, while the Fc domain can interact with receptor
      molecules to activate a pro- or anti- inflammatory state. The Fc domain of IgGs contains a
      glycan that is variable in composition and its specific sugar components are an important
      determinant of the biologic activity of IgGs in both protective and pathologic immune
      responses. New disease treatments could be developed through purposeful manipulation of IgG
      Fc glycans, but there is currently little known about how Fc glycan composition is regulated.
      We plan to study this by evaluating whether vaccination can cause changes in Fc glycan
      composition and, if so, whether signaling from helper T cells, age of the patient, and/or
      route of vaccine administration are determinants of specific modifications that are triggered
      by vaccination. Next, we will study effects that specific components within the Fc glycan
      have on immunity against the common human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza
      viruses using in vitro and in vivo models of infection. We will also study whether healthy
      adults who have been previously infected with dengue, zika or chikungunya virus generate
      distinct Fc glycoforms after vaccination compared with healthy adults who have not been
      previously infected with any of these viruses.
