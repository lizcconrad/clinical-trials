  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this exploratory, laboratory study is to evaluate whether
      noninvasive fluorescence microendoscopic imaging of tissue can assist clinicians in detecting
      dysplastic (precancerous) areas during standard surveillance. This is a study designed to
      evaluate the feasibility of using prototype imaging technology to enhance the detection of
      precancerous changes in various tissues. The results of this laboratory study will be used to
      further develop the technology for clinical application.

      The primary aim of this project will be to investigate what digital image analysis criteria
      can be used to best detect dysplasia in various types of resected tissue.
