  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging tool for monitoring functional
      and metabolic responses of biological events with specific radiotracer in vivo. The PET
      tracer [18F]Fluciclatide is an 18F radiolabeled small peptide containing the RGD
      (arginine-glycine-aspartate) tri-peptide, which preferentially binds with high affinity to
      αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. αvβ3-integrins are expressed at low levels on epithelial cells and
      mature endothelial cells but are expressed at high levels on activated endothelial cells in
      the neo-vasculature of a range of tumors and it also may regulate angiogenesis. If pazopanib
      acts mainly on active angiogenetic tumors, the quantitative uptake of [18F]Fluciclatide can
      be used to predict the effect of this antiangiogenic drug. The investigators expected the
      baseline tumor uptake in [18F]Fluciclatide to be able to predict treatment response, and
      planned a study of [18F]FluciclatidePET for patients with metastatic RCC who received
      pazopanib systemic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive treatment with pazopanib at a dose of 800 mg orally once daily.
      [18F]Fluciclatide imagings will be taken 2 times; 1) before systemic therapy (at baseline),
      2) at one week after starting of Pazopanib. However, If the target lesion on the baseline PET
      cannot be discriminated compared to the background activity, the 2nd PET will not be done.
      Response evaluation by CT will be performed at baseline, at 6 week, at 12 week and every 8
      weeks thereafter until the end of treatment. RECIST1.1 criteria for response will be applied.
      Patient will be treated with Pazopanib until there is disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent.
