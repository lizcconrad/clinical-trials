  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if yoga is an effective intervention in treating
      individuals with chronic low back pain (LBP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic LBP is a major public health problem associated with functional and psychological
      disability. Conservative interventions are often prescribed to people suffering from chronic
      LBP, but alternative interventions like yoga are not well researched. The regulator practice
      of yoga may improve pain, disability or quality of life in people with chronic LBP.

      Study participation will last approximately 24 weeks. Yoga sessions will last 12 weeks for 2
      one hour sessions per week
