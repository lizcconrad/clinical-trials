    <textblock>
      The investigators proposed study will investigate the efficacy of tablet computer distraction
      as an analgesic for the pain associated with various painful procedures in the emergency
      department. Since prior studies have shown that distraction by a parent or nurse can be an
      effective analgesic, there is reason to believe that tablet computer distraction will
      similarly reduce pain. Participants in the control group will receive a cartoon on the TV
      monitor in the patient room, while participants in the study group will receive a more
      immersive distraction of playing a game or watching a cartoon (for children too young to play
      a game) on a tablet computer. Data from this study will help inform best practices for
      administering painful procedures in a way that minimizes pain.
