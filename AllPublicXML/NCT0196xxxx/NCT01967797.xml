      The main goal of this project is to develop, implement and evaluate the 5As Team intervention
      (5AsT)for healthcare practitioners to improve their weight management patient encounters and
      improve patient health outcomes. The 5As of Obesity Management suite of tools is a robust,
      evidence-based approach to weight management, however its implementation and uptake has been
      heterogeneous in primary care.

      This project was co-created by, and will be implemented with, our partners the Southside
      Primary Care Network (SSPCN). A needs assessment on weight management by the SSPCN revealed
      the need to change provider practice to increase the number of weight management visits.
      Despite a robust didactic training session on weight management for all providers, which
      includes the 5As, the uptake in practice has been highly heterogeneous. Thus, the 5AsT
      intervention to address the implementation of the 5As of Obesity Management in clinical
      practice was developed by the collaborative team. The SSPCN consists of 25 autonomous groups
      of multidisciplinary professionals that provide service to a defined group of patients within
      the SSPCN.

      The 5As Team consists of multidisciplinary providers (Registered Nurse/ Nurse Practitioner,
      dietician, mental health worker) who work collaboratively. The intervention is a learning
      collaborative where these 12 different 5AsTs get together to work to address facilitators and
      barriers to weight management in their settings over a 6 month period. Half of the teams
      (N=12) will remain as controls and deliver usual care. They serve as a comparison group for
      the 5AsTs. This mixed methods study's primary outcomes will assess the change in provider
      practice and the effectiveness of the intervention and implementation.

      To assess the impact of 5AsT on patients, we will recruit patients presenting to the central
      SSPCN programming, We will not intervene directly on patients; we will observe the impact of
      the 5AsT and SSPCN programming on their health outcomes for a minimum of 6 months, and where
      possible for 18 months. Data collected includes demographics, weight (BMI), waist
      circumference, vital signs,and Short Form-12 (SF-12,these measures are routinely measured in
      the SSPCN), EuroQol-5 dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L), modified patient assessment of chronic
      illness (PACIC), and observed adherence to routine clinical care for guideline recommended
      laboratory monitoring (cholesterol panel, fasting glucose, HbA1c, where appropriate).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a public health problem as it is associated with many co-morbidities, decreased
      life expectancy and high health care costs. In 2008, prevalence of obesity and overweight,
      combined, in Canada was 62.1%. Supported by Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) and
      Public Health Agencies of Canada Innovation strategy, the Canadian Obesity Network developed
      a novel tool for obesity counseling and management in primary care settings know as the &quot;5As
      of Obesity Management&quot;. However, despite current dissemination strategies and extensive
      provider education in the 5As, the uptake of current practices for weight management has been
      inconsistent. Evidence suggests that treating obesity can reduce the incidence of a number of
      chronic diseases, and that obesity is not effectively managed in our current health care
      system.This project was co-created by, and will be implemented with, our partners the
      Southside Primary Care Network (SSPCN).

      The main goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a pragmatic intervention called the
      5As Team Intervention(5AsT) which acts on health professionals, forming them into a 6 month
      learning collaborative that undergoes an iterative, action based process to address
      facilitators and barriers to weight management.

      Primary Objective:

      Increase the number of weight management visits conducted by SSPCN Registered Nurses/Nurse
      Practitioners (RN/NPs).

      Primary questions:

        1. Does the 5As Team (5AsT) intervention affect the number of weight management visits
           conducted by SSPCN practitioners (RN/NP) in their SSPCN practice?

        2. Under what circumstances does the 5AsT intervention affect the number of weight
           management visits conducted by the SSPCN practitioners?

        3. Are changes in weight management visit rates sustained following the intervention
           period?

        4. What is the impact of implementation of 5AsT on practice level outcomes - on unique 5As
           Teams and the SSPCN?

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the impact of SSPCN weight management programming, with and without this 5AsT
      intervention, on patient important outcomes including: weight (BMI), blood pressure, self
      reported health status (EQ5D,SF-12), and patient-reported measures of chronic disease
      management for obesity (modified PACIC), as well as completion of appropriate laboratory
      studies (HbA1c for diabetics, fasting glucose, and cholesterol panel for age&gt;40).

      Design: This is a mixed methods, pragmatic cluster randomized trial in regular practice. The
      quantitative portion focuses on provider weight management visits, and patient-important
      outcomes above. For the patient study, 2 primary patient outcomes the study is powered for
      are BMI and SF-12, the remainder above are secondary patient outcomes. The qualitative
      portion seeks to understand the implementation process and the efficacy of the 5AsT
      intervention. Practitioners affiliated with different clinical groups will be randomized to
      intervention or control. All practitioners receive a robust didactic training program in
      weight management. The intervention group practitioners will participate in a 6 month 5AsT
      learning collaborative to address barriers to implementation of effective weight management
      strategies based upon the 5As of Obesity Management tool kit. Interested patients presenting
      to the central SSPCN programming will be recruited to participate in the study. There is no
      study intervention on the patients; the study will only observe how they are doing on their
      weight management journey in the SSPCN - whether they come from an intervention or control
      practice group. We will conduct a rigorous qualitative analysis of the intervention process
      using numerous qualitative tools to assess both the intervention itself and participant
      views. A qualitative plan has been created that outlines the use of field notes, focus groups
      and interviews to collect data and the use of Thematic Analysis and Nvivo software for
      analysis.

      Intervention: The 5As Team (5AsT) Program intervention in this study is based on behavior
      change theory. The Teams are groups of SSPCN practitioners (RN/NP, Social work, Registered
      Dietitian) who practice collaboratively in the community (N=25). The intervention group (N=12
      teams) will participate in an additional 6 month intensive learning collaborative model
      designed around the 5As of obesity management, but which addresses areas identified as
      barriers (i.e. weight bias, clinical environment, clinic processes &amp; team based care, mental
      health, counseling around emotional eating, caregiver fatigue, designing appropriate patient
      follow-up, and additional topics identified by the professionals). A clinical Champion
      identified by our partner SSPCN will be available to provide 1:1 support and coaching of the
      practitioners &amp; teams as needed. The practitioners will work collaboratively to do their own
      needs assessment, and will identify additional resources or tools that they need to overcome
      the barriers to weight management in their setting. The research team will use a Practice
      Facilitation model to provide additional resource and support to the change process for the
      practitioners.

      Setting: The SSPCN is one of the largest Primary Care Networks (PCN) in Alberta, which serves
      an ethnically and socially diverse population from 45 community family practices. The SSPCN
      centralizes programs that are not available at independent family practices. Also, each
      primary care center has a SSPCN team of personnel who reports directly to the SSPCN, and are
      responsible for delivering services to patients from that patient catchment.

    <description>SSPCN Personnel randomized to the study intervention group will be trained for a 6 month period. During training, there will be collection of field notes, 1:1 interviews and focus groups for consenting practitioners. The data will be analyzed on a weekly basis to identify themes concerning the efficacy of the intervention process and practitioner behavior change. This will be used to continually refine the intervention, and describe how and why it is/not working.
Following the 12 months (6 month intervention, 6 months of monitoring to assess sustainability) both qualitative and quantitative results will be combined to explore correlation. This will allow for more in-depth exploration of any variation in results.</description>
