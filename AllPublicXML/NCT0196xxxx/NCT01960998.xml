  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many men develop urine leakage after prostate cancer surgery. Usually it is temporary, but
      pelvic floor muscle training and exercise (including urine control strategies) have been
      shown to reduce the time to regaining urine control. This study tests an evidence-based,
      pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to telehealth format and pilot
      tested in a VA-funded pilot/developmental trial. Training is begun 1-4 weeks before surgery
      and continued 6 months after surgery. Content is accessed on a secure website in daily
      10-minute sessions which transition to weekly sessions for post-operative months 3-6. In the
      investigators' pilot study, Veterans reported that they appreciated receiving the training in
      the privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive style of the learning experience, and
      felt better prepared to deal with urine leakage and empowered with new knowledge and skills
      to help themselves. Content for both control and treatment groups includes general
      information about prostate cancer; perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care
      management. The treatment group will ALSO receive pelvic floor muscle training and bladder
      control strategies. Outcomes are measured with brief validated questions administered by the
      telehealth platform, and again at 9 and 12 months by mailed questionnaire or the telehealth
      platform.

      Many men develop urine leakage after radical prostatectomy. Usually it is temporary, but
      pelvic floor muscle training including bladder control strategies has been shown to reduce
      the severity of incontinence and reduce the time to regaining continence. This study will
      test an evidence-based pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to
      telehealth format and pilot tested in a VA-funded pilot/developmental trial. Training is
      begun 1-4 weeks before surgery and continued 6 months after surgery. Content is accessed on a
      secure website in daily 10-minute sessions which transition to weekly sessions for
      post-operative months 3-6. In the investigators' pilot study, Veterans reported that they
      appreciated receiving the training in the privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive
      style of the learning experience, and felt better prepared to deal with urine leakage and
      empowered with new knowledge and skills to help themselves.

      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of the telehealth-delivered, evidence-based,
      intervention developed in the pilot/developmental study. Participants will be randomized 1:1
      to treatment or to a control group. Content for both control and treatment groups includes
      general information about prostate cancer; perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care
      management. The treatment group will ALSO receive pelvic floor muscle training and bladder
      control strategies. Outcomes are measured with brief validated questions administered by the
      telehealth platform, and again at 9 and 12 months by mailed questionnaire or the telehealth
      platform.

    <description>The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short-Form (ICIQ-SF) is one of a series of International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaires that have been meticulously developed and tested. The ICI questionnaires are becoming the outcome measures of choice in incontinence clinical trials internationally, allowing comparability between studies. The ICIQ-SF is a brief (4 items), reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95), questionnaire that quantifies both symptom burden and impact of incontinence and has been validated in men and women.</description>

    <description>This measure, validated as a stand-alone assessment, consists of 4 questions from the EPIC, a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment tool. The EPIC was developed based on advice from an expert panel and prostate cancer survivors, expanding the 20-item University of California - Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index</description>
