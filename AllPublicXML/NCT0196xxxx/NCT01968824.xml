  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the plethora of literature suggesting that regional blockade provides adequate
      andimproved postoperative pain control, function and improved intraoperative and
      postoperative safety in proximal upper extremity surgery, little is known of its benefits for
      the treatment of forearm and distal radius fractures . The purpose of this randomized,
      prospective, study is to determine if brachial plexus blockade with general anesthesia is
      superior to general anesthesia alone in immediate and long-term pain control in patients
      undergoing operative fixation of distal upper extremity fractures.

      The purpose of this study is to compare two (2) different types of anesthesia treatments that
      are used during surgery for broken arms for post-surgery pain relief. One group will receive
      general anesthesia (state of total unconsciousness) the other group will get sedation
      (medicine injected into patient's vein that helps patient fall asleep), and a nerve block
      (injection of anesthetic drug into the nerves going to patient's arm in order to make
      patient's arm numb).

      Both forms of anesthesia are used for a variety of surgeries to the arm including shoulder
      and elbow surgeries. Currently it is thought that there are advantages and disadvantages to
      both types. The advantage of not using the nerve block in addition to general anesthesia
      (current standard or care) is that it decreases the potential risk for bleeding, infection
      and nerve injury. Alternatively, the advantage of using the nerve block with sedation
      (research-related procedure) is that it can potentially offer better post-operative pain
      control. This study will examine whether there is added benefit with the addition of nerve
      block for anesthesia for decreasing pain after surgical treatment of lower arm fractures.
