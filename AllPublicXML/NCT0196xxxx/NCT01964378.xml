  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most common symptoms associated with malignant tumor. The purpose of this
      trial is to determine whether cebranopadol is as effective in patients with cancer related
      pain as morphine sulfate prolonged release.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial comprises an enrollment period, a treatment period (titration and maintenance), and
      a follow-up period. Participants will receive either cebranopadol or morphine for 44 days.
      Initially participants will be titrated after 2 and then every 4 days to a morphine or
      cebranopadol dose that provides adequate analgesia and is tolerated. The titration period is
      planned to last 16 days. Thereafter the dose of morphine prolonged release or cebranopadol is
      to be kept stable for a further 28 days, i.e. no dose adjustments will be allowed during the
      maintenance period. This 28 day period is the maintenance period. The follow-up period is
      planned for up to 18 days after the end of last pain medication treatment intake.

    <measure>Average amount of daily rescue medication at the end of the maintenance period.</measure>
    <time_frame>The last two weeks of the expected 6 week treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Morphine sulfate immediate release 10 mg tablets will be supplied as rescue medication to trial participants. No dose adjustments of the morphine prolonged release or cebranopadol will be allowed during the maintenance period. The daily use of morphine sulfate 10 mg immediate release tablets will be documented by each participant in the trial. The primary endpoint is the average amount of daily rescue medication intake over the last 2 weeks of the maintenance period. It will be analyzed by means of a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM).</description>

    <measure>Proportion of participants with clinically relevant pain reduction at the end of the maintenance period.</measure>
    <time_frame>The last two weeks of the expected 6 week treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>For this assessment, each participant is to indicate the level of pain on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale, where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The participants enter their pain intensity in their diary on a daily basis. The pain intensity score in the 14 days prior to the final evaluation in the maintenance period will be compared with the baseline, the baseline pain intensity will be calculated based on the 3 days prior to treatment allocation.</description>

    <measure>Change in weekly mean of the daily Average Pain Intensity Score from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked: &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain on average during the last 24 hours.&quot; every day in the morning. They will score their pain intensity on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The weekly mean value of the 24 h average pain intensity will be calculated as a mean score of these daily entries of average pain intensity for each trial week.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Response rate to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be recorded daily by each participant in the morning on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). From this the weekly average 24-hour pain intensity will be calculated. The number of participants with a 0, 10, 20, 30, up to a 100% reduction in weekly mean pain intensity will be reported over each week and over the last two weeks of the maintenance period.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant with neuropathic pain (determined by the completion of the DN4 [Douleur Neuropathique] at enrollment) will rate their symptoms of neuropathic pain on Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI). Ten out of 12 questions are answered on an 11-point scale 0 (no symptom present) to 10 (worst imaginable). Two out of 12 questions are answered by selecting one of 5 possible responses. Mean scores of NPSI will be calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol-5 Dimension Health Questionnaire is a generic health related quality of life instrument. The participants will answer 5 questions on 5 dimensions of their health related quality of life: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each question has 3 possible answers reflecting 3 levels of impact on the quality of life.
Participants will also rate their current health state on the visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 = worst imaginable health state and 100 = best imaginable health state). A positive change indicates an improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical and Mental Component Scores are calculated from the responses by participants to 12 questions. These 12 questions cover 8 domains, (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role participation with emotional health problems, and mental health) that a participant was asked to rate over the last week. Questions are scored on a Likert-scale. An overall value for the physical and mental component summary is calculated. A positive change will indicate an improvement</description>

    <measure>Overall score of the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of symptoms of constipation during past 2 weeks. There are 3 subscales with 4 items on Abdominal symptoms, 3 on rectal symptoms and 5 on stool symptoms. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, where 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe. If the changes in the overall or subscale scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation.</description>

    <measure>Change in weekly mean of the daily Worst Pain Intensity Score from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked: &quot;Please rate your pain by selecting the one number that best describes your pain at its worst during the last 24 hours.&quot; every day in the morning. They will score their pain intensity on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The weekly mean value of the 24 h worst pain intensity will be calculated as a mean score of these daily entries of worst pain intensity for each trial week.
