  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot, designed to provide data regarding the feasibility and acceptability of
      conducting such a study on a larger scale. The present study is a randomized controlled
      clinical trial comparing two programs to help people manage diabetes and lose weight, one
      using a moderate-carbohydrate diet promoted by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and
      the other using on a low-carbohydrate diet (LC) and mindfulness and positive affect lifestyle
      modifications. Intervention content will include information about nutrition (American
      Diabetes Association recommended diet or carbohydrate restriction) and, in the LC group,
      emotion regulation, positive affect, and mindful eating strategies.

      Approximately individuals with type 2 diabetes will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment
      groups. Classes will occur online. Participants will be evaluated at 0, 16, and 32 weeks. Our
      main outcome of interest is HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin, a measure indicative of blood glucose
      levels and tied to diabetes severity).

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet group will receive standard ADA advice. The diet includes high-fiber foods (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), low-fat dairy products, fresh fish, and foods low in saturated fat. They will be asked to use the &quot;plate method&quot; to guide their nutritional choices.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low Carbohydrate Diet</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to follow a low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet: carbohydrate intake 20-35 grams a day not including fiber. Foods permitted include: meats, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, cream, some nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, and most other non-starchy vegetables. Because most individuals self-limit caloric intake, no calorie restriction will be recommended.
Participants will also be taught information about mindfulness and positive affect practices. The mindfulness-based curriculum will focus on the following elements: training on topics such as mindful meditation, mindful eating, awareness of fullness and hunger signals, and taste satiety. The positive emotion curriculum will include: training on topics such as noticing and savoring positive events, gratitude, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, attainable goals, and acts of kindness.</description>

             corticosteroids in the 6 months prior to enrollment or severe autoimmune disorders or
