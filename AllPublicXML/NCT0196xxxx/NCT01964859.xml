  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if investigators can change skin from one type to
      another. Specifically, investigators are interested in making normal skin into the thicker
      skin found on our palms and soles.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To change the skin identity investigators propose to take skin cells from a person's own sole
      or palm (these are called &quot;autologous skin fibroblasts&quot;), multiply them in the lab, inject
      the cells (now called a &quot;graft&quot;) back into the same person but at a different site of skin
      like the buttock, and then eventually remove the injected cells to see if they caused the
      skin to change.

      Investigators hope that information from this study will help with problems like skin
      break-down in patients with amputations and prosthetics. The skin at their stump was not
      meant to withstand the pressure and friction of prosthetics and this study is the first step
      in trying to convert stump skin to palm/sole-like skin.

    <description>Volar keratinocytes have larger area of the cytoplasm. We will quantitate the area of cytoplasm of non-volar keratinocytes to see if they increase selectively with volar fibroblasts as opposed to other fibroblasts injections or vehicle. The change in the area of cytoplasm of non-volar keratinocytes will be measured. The units of this measurement are a ratio of cytoplasmic area to total cellular area as a control.</description>

    <description>Fibrometers measure the firmness of the skin. We will measure all sites to see if the area injected with volar fibroblasts is more firm. The units of measurement is in Newtons.</description>
