  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Purposes: Cancer is the leading cause of our mortality. It threatens people's
      life and quality of life (QOL). Although the incidence of cancer is still rising, with the
      promotion of cancer screening and progression of medical technology, its survival rate is
      improving. However, the sequels from cancer or its treatment and the side effects impact the
      patients along with their lives. Breast cancer is the most incident cancer in women with high
      survival rate, continuing care after the diagnosis and treatment is much more needed. This
      study is using breast cancer as an example to establish a continuing service model. This
      study aims (1) to establish a tailored, continuing care model which emphasizes on breast
      cancer patients' function. (2) To investigate the effectiveness of the new care model
      comparing with the control. (3) To find a cutting point of bioelectrical impedance to
      identify late development of lymphedema.

      Methods: This is a randomized-controlled trial expanding for 3 years. Women being newly
      diagnosed with breast cancer and first OPD visit after operation at National Taiwan
      University Hospital will be invited to join the surveillance and care system. Exclusion
      criteria are: younger than 20 years old, stage IV, recurrent or both sides involved, with
      other cancer diagnosis, functional impairments from previous injury or operation on the
      affected upper extremity and other physical or mental problem to influence the test or
      filling the questionnaire. It is estimated there will be 100 subjects participate this study
      every year. After the initial evaluation, they will be randomly allocated to surveillance
      group (SG) or general care group (CG). Totally, in this three-year study, there will be 200
      subjects (100/group), follow-up for 0.5 to 2 years. SG will have health education brochure
      and free class from the first visit post-operatively but CG will only have the brochure.
      Moreover, SG will be screened every time when they visit the clinics. If there is any early
      sign of impairment, professional advice and counseling will be given additionally. In these
      visits, if CG raises any health-related question, they can be answered. Detailed physical
      examination to identify their impairments and QOL are at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months after
      operation for both groups. Patients' characteristics, functional status, QOL will be
      presented by descriptive statistics. T-test/Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare the
      differences between patients in two groups. Survival analysis and log-rank test will be used
      to show the prevalence of various functional impairments and test their difference. ROC curve
      will be used to find the cutting point for prediction of lymphedema.

      Expected Results: It is expected (1) to set up the education program and brochure for breast
      cancer patients. (2) to establish a continuing surveillance and care model for breast cancer
      patients and extending to all cancers. (3) Women in the new care model will have less
      impairment and higher QOL comparing with women at the same post-operative stage. (4) To find
      out the prevalence of functional impairments from the data of control group. (5) A cutting
      point of bioelectrical impedance to identify late development of lymphedema will be found.
      (6) To train the team members of cancer care and research.
