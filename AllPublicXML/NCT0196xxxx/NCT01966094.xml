  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that over 1 million people in the United States have HIV infection. While HIV
      is treatable, there are still high rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND).
      HAND is defined by low scores on memory testing. To meet the criteria for HAND, an
      HIV-infected individual has to have a low score on at least two different memory tests. It is
      estimated that 20-50% of people living with HIV have HAND. It is therefore still a common
      problem. While individuals with HAND typically improve on antiretroviral therapy for HIV,
      often this improvement is incomplete. Also, there are over 20 antiretroviral medications
      approved for HIV in the US. It is not clear if the specific choice of antiretroviral
      medication makes a difference in the improvement of HAND.

      The investigators have designed a small preliminary study in which subjects with and without
      HAND who have never been on treatment for HIV or have been off treatment for at least 6
      months are followed for the first 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy.The
      investigators will enroll a maximum of 46 subjects (23 subjects in each arm). Subjects will
      also be followed by their primary HIV medical provider. For the study, subjects will be
      followed for 48 weeks. There are three followup visits: 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks.
      Memory testing will be performed at baseline and each followup visit. Blood will also be
      taken at baseline and the three followup visits to measure changes in inflammation. A lumbar
      puncture will be performed at baseline and at 24 weeks to measure changes in inflammation and
      amount of HIV virus in the spinal fluid. There is also an optional lumbar puncture at the
      last study visit of 48 weeks

        Subjects will be identified through referrals from HIV medical providers in the Atlanta
        metropolitan area. Potential subjects will be recruited from the Grady Infectious Diseases
        clinic as well as other clinics in the metropolitan Atlanta area, which include the Fulton
        and Dekalb county health departments, the Emory Infectious Diseases clinic, as well as
        private HIV medical practices in the area.
