    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a method to detect tumor cells that are circulating in the blood
      without getting a biopsy. The investigators already know from other studies that cancer
      tumors shed a small number of cells into the bloodstream every day. These are called
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Some early studies indicate the amount and type of CTCs in
      the blood can help determine the status of the tumor itself and the way it is responding to
      treatment. In this study, the investigators will compare the number of CTCs in the blood at
      different time frames before and after surgery to remove the prostate.

      The investigators will collect a blood sample for the study when the participant has other
      blood tests drawn for their cancer treatment. The investigators will take one sample to check
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and another blood sample for CTC analysis. The
      investigators will be drawing blood at the following time points: Screening; One day after
      surgery; 7-14 days after surgery; 3-6 months after surgery; at PSA recurrence or at two
      years.
