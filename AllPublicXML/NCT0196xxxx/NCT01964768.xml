    <textblock>
      A Phase III study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of three solutions of
      different allergen extracts for diagnosis by skin prick-test:

        -  5 Grasses pollen,

        -  Birch pollen,

        -  Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus mite

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin wheal measure for each tested solution. For each allergen tested, 2 variables, positive SPT and negative SPT were defined. A SPT reaction was considered positive when the mean wheal diameter was &gt;3 mm. A SPT reaction ≤3 mm was considered negative.</measure>
    <time_frame>For each subject, the study consisted in one visit of about 60 minutes including skin prick-test and collection of blood sample for IgE determination.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>One of the secondary measurement was the wheal diameter for each allergen.</measure>
    <time_frame>SPT measurements were performed after the study visit, an expected average of 1 week.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary measurement was also the specific IgE level for each allergen.</measure>
    <time_frame>Specific IgE results were known after the study visit, an expected average of 3 days.</time_frame>
