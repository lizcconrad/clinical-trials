      Study Hypothesis: The combination of aerobic and resistance exercise training will improve
      walking speed compared to either individual intervention.

      Brief Summary:

      Sixty hemodialysis participants who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized
      to 20 weeks of supervised exercise, using either: (i) on-dialysis aerobic exercise using a
      bike ergometer; (ii) pre-dialysis leg strength training using weights; or (iii) both. The
      primary outcome is walking speed over 4-metres. Secondary outcomes will include:

      (i) short physical performance battery; (ii) health-related quality of life [EuroQOL-5D-5L];
      (iii) Dialysis recovery time; (iv) Nottingham extended activities of daily living (EADL)
      index; (v) Leg strength; (vi) body composition and anthropometry.
