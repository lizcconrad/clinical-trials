  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to compare the change in cognitive performance and psychological status of patients
      with spasticity due to Multiple Sclerosis when treated with Sativex or placebo, added to
      existing anti-spasticity therapy over a period of 48 weeks. Secondary objectives were to
      evaluate the effect of Sativex on mood and spasticity and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of Sativex.

      Eligible patients entered this 50 week multicenter, double-blind, randomised,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study which evaluated the effect of Sativex on cognitive
      performance. At each scheduled clinic visit, patients were assessed for cognitive
      performance, mood, severity of spasticity, use of investigational medicinal products and
      number of visits to a healthcare professional. Primary efficacy comparisons were made between
      scores recorded during baseline and scores recorded at the end of treatment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Treatment in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Stimulus presentation rates were adapted for use with multiple sclerosis patients. The PASAT is presented on audio compact disk to control the rate of stimulus presentation. Single digits are presented either every 3 seconds (PASAT 1) or every 2 seconds (PASAT 2), and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The test score is the sum of the total number of correct sums given (out of 60 possible) in each trial. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Treatment in Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a multiple choice self-reported inventory that is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depression. There are 21 questions or items, each having four possible responses. Each response is assigned a score ranging from zero to three, indicating the severity of the symptom. Items 1 to 13 assess symptoms that are psychological in nature, while items 14 to 21 assess symptoms that are more physical. The sum of all BDI-II item scores indicates the severity of depression. For patients eligible for this study, a score of 21 or over represents depression. The BDI-II can distinguish between different subtypes of depressive disorders, such as major depression and dysthymia. A reduction in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) in the Severity of Their Spasticity at the End of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked the following question, to be rated on a seven-point scale:
&quot;Please assess the change in your spasticity since immediately before receiving the first dose of study treatment (Visit 1) using the scale below&quot;.
The markers were: 'Very much worse', 'Much worse', 'Minimally worse', 'No change', 'Minimally better', 'Much better' or 'Very much better'.
The number of patients for each of the markers is presented at the final study visit.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver's Global Impression of Change (CGIC) in the Severity of the Patient's Spasticity at the End of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers were asked the following question to be rated on a seven-point scale:
&quot;How has the subject's spasticity changed since Visit 1?&quot; The markers were: Very much worse, Much worse, Minimally worse, No change, Minimally better, Much better, Very much better.
The number of patients for each of the markers is presented at the final study visit.</description>

    <description>Physicians were asked the following question to be rated on a seven-point scale:
&quot;How has the subject's spasticity changed since Visit 1?&quot; The markers were: Very much worse, Much worse, Minimally worse, No change, Minimally better, Much better, Very much better.
The number of patients for each of the markers is presented at the final study visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Modified Ashworth Scale Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 0-5 scale): 0= 'no increase in muscle tone' to 5= 'affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension'. The score for all 20 muscle groups were added to give a total score out of 100. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Number of Visits to a Healthcare Professional.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, patients were asked how many times they had visited a healthcare professional in the previous 12 weeks. At subsequent visits, patients were asked how many times they had visited a healthcare professional since their last study visit. The change from baseline to the end of treatment is presented. A decrease in number indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>The Number of Patients With a Treatment-emergent Flag Using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) During the Course of the Study.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were scored at each clinic visit for the following outcomes using the C-SSRS: suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviour, suicidality (including complete suicidality). Possible flags were as follows: &quot;Wish to be Dead&quot;, &quot;Non-specific Active Suicidal Thoughts&quot;, &quot;Active Suicidal Ideation Without Intent&quot;, &quot;Active Suicidal Ideation With Intent, No Plan&quot;, &quot;Active Suicidal Ideation With Intent and Plan&quot;. The number of patients with a treatment-emergent flag is presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Timed 10-meter Walk Times.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Only those patients for whom it was appropriate (i.e. ambulatory patients) were timed for how long it took to walk 10 metres. If a patient started the 10-meter walk but was unable to complete it, an estimated time for completion was calculated based on the available data. A negative difference from baseline indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the End of Treatment in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) Total Score.</title>
        <description>The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Stimulus presentation rates were adapted for use with multiple sclerosis patients. The PASAT is presented on audio compact disk to control the rate of stimulus presentation. Single digits are presented either every 3 seconds (PASAT 1) or every 2 seconds (PASAT 2), and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The test score is the sum of the total number of correct sums given (out of 60 possible) in each trial. An increase in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

        <description>The BDI-II is a multiple choice self-reported inventory that is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depression. There are 21 questions or items, each having four possible responses. Each response is assigned a score ranging from zero to three, indicating the severity of the symptom. Items 1 to 13 assess symptoms that are psychological in nature, while items 14 to 21 assess symptoms that are more physical. The sum of all BDI-II item scores indicates the severity of depression. For patients eligible for this study, a score of 21 or over represents depression. The BDI-II can distinguish between different subtypes of depressive disorders, such as major depression and dysthymia. A reduction in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>
