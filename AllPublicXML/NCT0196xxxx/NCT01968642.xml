  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The utilization of transthoracic echocardiography in the United States has been increasing.
      This has resulted in increased costs to the healthcare system. In an effort to curb excessive
      utilization of this technology, the American College of Cardiology created Appropriate Use
      Criteria to help guide clinicians to use this diagnostic imaging modality more appropriately.
      The investigators previously showed that an educational intervention can reduce the rate of
      inappropriate echocardiograms ordered by physicians-in-training. It is unknown if such an
      intervention would be successful in attending, staff level of physicians. The investigators
      hypothesize that an educational and feedback intervention will reduce the rate of
      inappropriate outpatient transthoracic echocardiograms ordered by staff cardiologists and
      internal medicine physicians.

      In response to increasing utilization of echocardiography, the American Society of
      Echocardiography along with the American College of Cardiology released Appropriate Use
      Criteria (AUC) for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in 2007, and these have been
      subsequently updated in 2011. TTE ordering patterns have been evaluated and have shown that
      between 15-30% of TTE ordered are inappropriate. The highest rate of inappropriate TTE is
      found in the outpatient environment, where routine or &quot;surveillance&quot; studies are common.
      These studies have also found that internists and cardiologists order the majority of TTE.
      The investigators previously documented that an AUC-based educational and feedback
      intervention reduced the rate of inappropriate TTE by cardiology and internal medicine
      physicians-in-training. Whether this type of intervention can improve TTE ordering of
      attending level physicians is not known.

    <description>Attending physicians in the intervention arm will receive the following multi-faceted educational intervention on transthoracic echocardiogram appropriateness: 1) a lecture at the beginning of the study period, which describes Appropriate USe Criteria (AUC) and highlights common clinical scenarios for which outpatient echocardiograms are ordered, 2) an electronic &quot;pocket cared&quot; via email that provides tips on appropriate ordering of echocardiograms, and 3) an individualized monthly feedback report that categorizes echocardiograms ordered over the preceding month. The feedback report will contain the number of echocardiograms ordered during the month and how many are classified as appropriate, inappropriate, or uncertain based on the 2011 AUC.</description>
