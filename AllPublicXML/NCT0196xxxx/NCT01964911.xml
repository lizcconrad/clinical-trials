  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive leg ulcer, also called Martorell ulcer, represents 1 to 15% of leg ulcers in
      hospital. These ulcers are painful, long to heal, and hospitalization is sometimes necessary
      for analgesia and debridement of necrotic tissue. Strong opioids are often required, and are
      responsible of many side effects. Martorell ulcer arises predominantly in women over 60 years
      of age, with history of vascular disease, and therefore with a higher risk of adverse event.
      Pain is also part of the physiopathology, inducing a vasospasm which increases ulcer
      extension and ischemia.

      This is why pain management is one of the main challenge in treatments of these ulcers.

      Continuous nerve block of lower limbs are often used during per and postoperative orthopaedic
      surgery. Few adverse events and rare serious adverse events related to local anesthesic are
      reported (respectively &lt;1% and &lt;1/1000), and few adverse events related to catheter are
      reported (&lt;1%). Its benefits have been proved on post-operative pain management and
      reeducation.

      The aim of this study is to assess analgesia provided by continuous sciatic nerve block, in
      patients with hypertensive leg ulcer, during hospitalization.

      Thirty patients will be enrolled on a 3-years period. They will receive a continuous sciatic
      nerve block with ropivacaïne 0,2%, during 7 days.

      Pain intensity will be assessed by 4 datas : numerating rating scale (NRS) at rest, during
      wound care, maximal and mean. These datas will be collected over two 3-days period : the
      first 3 days of hospitalization, in which pain treatment will be prescribed depending on pain
      intensity of the patient ; and the first 3 days of ropivacaïne treatment.

      The main evaluation criteria will be at least a 50% decrease of one of the pain NRS when
      receiving ropivacaïne.

      Time to healing, microcirculation evolution measured by Transcutaneous Oxygen Pressure
      (TcPO2), and quality of life of patients will be collected over a 6 months follow-up.

    <description>The first 3 days, analgesic treatments will be provided, as usual, depending on pain intensity (EN &lt;3/10 : non opioids, EN 3-5/10 : weak opioids, EN&gt;5/10 : strong opioids).
If NRS is still over 5/10, continuous nerve block will be proposed. Patients will receive ropivacaïne, 5 mL/h during 7 days, with possibility of one bolus before wound care, through a stimulating catheter stimulong sono®.
In association, analgesic treatments will be provided, as usual, depending on pain intensity (as during the first 3 days).</description>
