  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the project is to evaluate innovative, cost-effective, community-based
      automated hearing screening and education methods to motivate individuals with
      mild-to-moderate hearing loss to enter the hearing healthcare system.

    <intervention_name>Automated hearing test</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will take an automated hearing test that presents tones at different pitches and volumes. Participants will identify whether or not they heard the tone and receive printed recommendations for hearing healthcare follow-up. All subjects will complete the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI) questionnaire and the Hearing Beliefs Questionnaire (HBQ). Approximately 6-8 months after their initial appointment, subjects in this groups will receive a telephone call and will be asked questions related to their actions and attitudes related to hearing and hearing health care.</description>
