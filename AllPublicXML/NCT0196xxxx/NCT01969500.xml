  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to develop and pilot a mobile Self-Management of
      Schizophrenia (SOS) system that will administer interventions targeting persistent symptoms
      of psychosis, social dysfunction, and poor medication adherence, with the long-term goal of
      creating a widely-available system that can be deployed by users as needed, in their own
      environments. The hypothesis is that this intervention group will show stronger improvement
      in the areas of psychiatric systems, social function, and medication adherence compared to
      treatment as usual.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Severity of Psychotic Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of Psychotic Symptoms will be assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a widely used 30-item scale that rates severity of positive symptoms (including auditory hallucinations and persecutory ideation), negative symptoms, and mood and behavioral symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Social Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Social Functioning will be measured with the Social Functioning Scale (SFS). The SFS is a 76- item questionnaire that assesses various aspects of social functioning and generates a number of sub-scale scores including social withdrawal, interpersonal behavior, pro-social activities, and an overall score of social functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in System Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Each week from week 1 to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>System use will be measured continuously by the SOS application that will automatically collect data regarding: the percent of SOS prompts responded to, percent of self-reports completed, percent of system-prompted interventions completed, number of participant-initiated interventions deployed and completed, number of times resources were accessed via the Quick Tips function, and the number of times weekly summary reports were viewed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability and Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Usability and Satisfaction will be measured using the USE Questionnaire which was designed to measure satisfaction, usefulness, ease of use and ease of learning.</description>
