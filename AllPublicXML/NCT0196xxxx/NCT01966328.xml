      This research is studying the effect that Resolvine injection will have on patients with
      vitreomacular adhesion. The investigators propose that intravitreal injection of Resolvine速
      36% will: 1)Result in release of the vitreous adhesion to the macula in subjects with
      symptomatic vitreomacular attachment (VMA). 2)The Release of the VMA will create a measurable
      and favorable retinal change. 3) The release of vitreomacular traction may also result in
      visual acuity improvement within the short time frame of this study.

    <measure>Safety of 36% Resolvine Injection versus 9% Resolvine Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>After all patients have completed the 6 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of an active arm treated with Resolvine速 36%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter intravitreal injections, in comparison to a control arm treated with Resolvine 9%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter injections, in subjects with VMA. Cumulative adverse event rates for each arm will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an active arm treated with Resolvine速 36%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter intravitreal injections, in comparison to a control arm treated with Resolvine 9%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter injections, in subjects with VMA. Efficacy will be measured by the percent of patients whose VMA has released after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Inducement of PVD</measure>
    <time_frame>After all patients have completed the 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>These analyses will compare the efficacy an active arm treated with Resolvine速 36%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter intravitreal injections, to a control arm treated with Resolvine 9%, which may contain up to two 100-microliter injections, to assess inducement of a more extensive PVD over the study period as demonstrated by Trese Grade III or higher B-Scan Ultrasound and OCT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improved Eye Function</measure>
    <time_frame>After all patients have completed the 6 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>These analyses will assess a parameter of improved eye function as calculated by either the reduction in the retinal thickness of at least 10% over baseline at Day 0 as quantified by OCT, or an improvement in visual acuity of more than 10% over baseline at day 0 as quantified by ETDRS.</description>
