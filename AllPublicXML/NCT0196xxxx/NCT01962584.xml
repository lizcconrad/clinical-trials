      Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an established non-invasive diagnostic tool for acute and
      chronic myocarditis. Established CMR criteria for diagnosing myocarditis are edema on
      black-blood T2-weighted imaging, relative contrast enhancement seen on T1-weighted imaging
      for assessment of hyperemia, and late contrast-agent enhancement seen with inversion recovery
      late enhancement technique for visualization of myocardial fibrosis.

      Recently, tissue characterization based on calculation of myocardial T1 relaxation time (T1
      mapping) as well as T1-derived extracellular volume fraction has become available. Recently,
      reference values for myocardial T1 relaxation times at 3T for healthy volunteers were
      published for CMR. However, to date no comprehensive data for multiparametric CMR in patients
      with suspected myocarditis at 3 Tesla is available. Therefore, the purpose of this
      prospective study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of CMR at 3T in patients with
      suspected acute myocarditis using a multiparametric CMR approach including T1 mapping as
      novel tool for tissue characterization.

      CMR will be performed within 7 days after hospital admission for &quot;suspected acute
      myocarditis&quot;.
