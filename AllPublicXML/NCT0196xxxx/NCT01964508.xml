    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and its incidence is rapidly
      increasing. Palpable thyroid nodules are very common, affecting up to 5% of the general
      population. Nevertheless, only 5% of the thyroid nodules harbor malignancy, hence the obvious
      need to accurately characterize these nodules. Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration
      biopsy (FNAB) is the most important tool in assessing the nature of thyroid nodules, however,
      in up to 30% of the biopsies the results are indeterminate. In this proposal, we hypothesize
      that leftover cells in the FNAB needle may be utilized for molecular analysis with an
      established microRNA panel and distinguish between malignant and benign lesions. Despite
      established studies on the diagnostic utility of microRNAs in thyroid nodules, the effect of
      microRNAs on specific target genes involved in thyroid cancer is poorly studied. In this
      proposal we hypothesize that the microRNAs identified in our panel will affect intracellular
      pathways by regulating target genes that are involved in thyroid tumorigenesis. We present
      preliminary data that confirms that microRNA panel may identify malignancy in thyroid
      nodules. In aim 1 we will identify the expression profile of miRNAs in the different thyroid
      cancers. We will statistically quantify the threshold of miRNA dysregulation for malignancy
      on a large number of tumor and benign samples. This will serve as matrix for defining
      malignancy on the FNAB samples. In aim 2 we will establish a reliable reproducible method to
      extract RNA from cells left over in FNAB samples. Our preliminary data support the
      feasibility of the method and it has not been described previously. This will be the first
      study that will compare cytology results and microRNA panel analysis on the very same FNAB
      cells. It will mimic the exact clinical scenario that such microRNA panel can be utilized in
      the future. Finally, in aim 3 we will characterize the effect of microRNAs on target genes
      expression. We will identify possible target genes from bioinformatics databases and will
      perform quantitative measurement of mRNA level of target gene by real time PCR and
      immunohistochemistry. These studies will hopefully support the utility of microRNAs as a
      diagnostic tool to accurately identify malignancy in thyroid FNAB leftover cells and point
      out possible target genes for future therapeutic approaches. This could impact many patients,
      as thyroid cancer is the 5th most common cancer in women, and the most rapidly growing
      malignancy in both men and women.
