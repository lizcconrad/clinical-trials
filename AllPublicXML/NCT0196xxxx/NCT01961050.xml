  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an intervention aimed at reducing risk for
      alcohol-exposed pregnancies and preventing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in Russian
      children. The study will determine whether physicians, trained in a dual-focused brief
      motivational intervention and monitored for performance, can foster greater change in
      knowledge, health beliefs, alcohol use, and alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk in Russian women
      who are at risk than standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-arm, 20-site, site-randomized, controlled trial testing an intervention to
      reduce risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies in at-risk women (at-risk drinking childbearing
      age women who are heterosexually active, and not consistently using contraception). The trial
      will assess feasibility of a dual-focused (i.e. contraception use-drinking reduction) brief
      physician intervention (DFBPI) and determine whether physicians, trained in DFBPI and
      monitored for compliance, can foster greater reduction of women's risk behaviors compared to
      standard care. The intervention is specifically designed to be deliverable routinely by
      Obstetrics and Gynecology physicians(OB/GYN) to large numbers of women at women's clinics.
