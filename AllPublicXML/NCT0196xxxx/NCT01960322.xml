  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim is to pilot-test our developed intervention manual's ability to improve
      patients' adherence to medications and medical outcomes (rejection rate, liver enzyme levels)
      in participating centers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonadherence (not taking the medications as prescribed) is the most common cause of late
      acute rejection in children who have had a liver transplant, and thus is associated with
      graft loss, increased expenditures on care, and ultimately death. Researchers in this
      application developed a biomarker to identify nonadherence, calculating the standard
      deviation (SD) of consecutive immunosuppressant blood levels for each patient to capture the
      degree of variability between individual levels (higher SD = less consistent levels). By
      applying a threshold, this marker identifies nonadherent patients. A consortium of transplant
      centers is currently testing this marker through the MALT (Medication Adherence in children
      who had a Liver Transplant) study. MALT investigators now propose to take advantage of this
      existing collaboration to pilot-test an intervention to improve adherence in patients who are
      identified by this marker.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is between 11-19 years of age at enrollment.

          -  Guardian's consent, child assent (in accordance with each institution's IRB policies).

          -  The patient is prescribed tacrolimus (either brand or generic formulation).

          -  The patient has been seen in the enrolling center's clinic at least once in the last
             two years.

          -  The patient's SD of tacrolimus was &gt; 2.0 in the year prior to enrollment, with at
             least 3 levels present to make this determination.

          -  The patient and at least one guardian speaks English or Spanish at a level that allows
             her / him to understand the study procedures and consent to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient received a liver transplant less than 1 year prior to enrollment.

          -  The patient has had more than one transplant (including marrow replacement).

          -  The patient has had biopsy-proven rejection within the past six months.

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with Hepatitis C.

          -  The treating physician has instructed the patient not to obtain tacrolimus levels for
             at least one year in the past year.

          -  The guardian or child (in a developmentally-appropriate manner) do not understand the
             study procedures. This will be verified by asking both guardian and child to repeat
             the study procedures.

          -  The patient is only seen for consultation - most or all of the child's routine care is
             provided at another center (or in a community clinic).

          -  Either the patient or the guardian is actively psychotic or severely disoriented due
             to any cause, including hepatic encephalopathy (temporary exclusion) or severely
             mentally retarded as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV).

          -  The patient is not medically stable or is hospitalized.
