      Enrolled subjects will be instructed on the application of the Glad Press 'n Seal product to
      their IV dressing for use during a shower activity. Practice with application and removal of
      the product will be supervised by the PI or RA. Questions will be answered and a commercially
      purchased box of the investigational product will be given to the subject for home use.
