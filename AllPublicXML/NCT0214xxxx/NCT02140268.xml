        Inclusion Criteria:Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥18 and ≤30 kg/m2 and weigh at least 50 kg
        and no more than 100 kg. Females of non-childbearing potential must be postmenopausal
        defined as amenorrhea for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
        treatments and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range or
        documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateraloophorectomy
        or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation

        Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening, Day -1,
        and Day 14 and must not be lactating and use effective contraceptive methods to avoid
        pregnancy during the treatment period

        Male healthy volunteers with a partner of childbearing potential must agree to avoid
        fathering a child, and refrain from donating sperm, from the first day of dosing until at
        least 3 months after last dose of the investigational product, and therefore be either
        sterile or agree to use approved methods of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             principal investigator, may either put the healthy volunteer at risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the healthy volunteer's
             ability to participate in the study. History or presence of GI, hepatic or renal
             disease including GI surgery other than appendectomy or any other condition known to
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs. Loose
             stools (BSFS of 6 or 7) ≥2 days in the past 7 days before investigational product
             administration. Use of medications that are known to affect stool consistency and/or
             GI motility, including fiber supplements, anti-diarrheals, prokinetic drugs, enemas,
             probiotic medications or supplements, or salt or electrolyte supplements containing
             sodium, potassium, chloride, or bicarbonate formulations during the past 7 days before
             the investigational product administration. Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed
             medication including antacids, analgesics other than paracetamol/acetaminophen, herbal
             remedies, vitamins and minerals during the 2 weeks prior to the first administration
             of investigational product or longer if the medication has a long half-life. Use of
             drugs or substances with enzyme-inducing properties within 4 weeks prior to the first
             administration of investigational product.
