  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a study, to see how safe and effective timolol maleate 0.5% gel-forming
      solution is for infantile hemangiomas (IH) and the response of hemangiomas to timolol maleate
      0.5% . Our hypothesis is that timolol will inhibit and possibly reverse growth of appropriate
      infantile hemangiomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be assigned to open label timolol maleate 0.5%. Parents will be instructed to
      place 1 to 2 drops twice a day in the center of the hemangioma. Subjects are expected to use
      the study drug as directed every day for a 4 month period.

      Subjects will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter for a
      total of 5 months. Physical exam, photographs to compare size and color intensity, and a
      scale of improvement will be completed at each visit. Parents will complete a quality of life
      questionnaire regarding their child's hemangioma and its impact on quality of life.

      Subjects who have evidence of worsening would be removed from the study and transferred to
      the clinic for evaluation and treatment.
