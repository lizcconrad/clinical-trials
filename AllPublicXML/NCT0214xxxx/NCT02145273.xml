  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal depression is a pervasive problem that disproportionately affects low-income
      mothers. The effects of depression on mothers and their parenting result in many negative
      outcomes for children, particularly in terms of school readiness. The proposed research will
      build on a successful partnership between the University of Southern California School of
      Social Work (USC) and Children's Institute, Inc. (CII) to implement and evaluate an
      evidence-based intervention, interpersonal psychotherapy for group (IPT-G), for Head Start
      mothers with depression or dysphoric mood with the goal of reducing their depression and
      promoting positive changes for both mothers and children. The objectives of the study are:
      (1) adapt IPT-G for a Head Start population of mothers with depression; (2) implement IPT-G
      via a randomized controlled trial in Head Start centers in Los Angeles County operated by
      CII; (3) evaluate the effects of the intervention on maternal depression, parenting
      behaviors, goal-directed behavior, interpersonal relationships, physical health, and child
      behavior and school readiness; and (4) develop a manual for use of the intervention in Head
      Start and disseminate findings nationally. The study will feature 2 groups of 60 mothers
      each, randomized by Head Start site; one will receive the intervention and the other services
      as usual. Outcomes for both mothers and children will be tracked for 2 years after the
      intervention, allowing for the evaluation of short- and long-term effects. The intervention
      will be delivered by Head Start mental health workers under the supervision of Scott Stuart,
      a national trainer of the intervention. This intervention has the potential to be a low-cost,
      high-impact intervention that can be replicated to other Head Start sites across the country
      to improve the lives of Head Start children and families.
