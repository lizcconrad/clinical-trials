  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compliance is the biggest challenge in patients with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) on Home
      Parenteral Nutrition. These patients need to hydrate themselves to meet the excess fluid loss
      due to their anatomy. Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) is prescribed to all these patients.
      The investigators believe that taste of the standard ORS is the biggest reason why these
      patients are not complaint. The new ORS in the market has been prepared with this in mind.
      The investigators want to study if this new ORS will improve the compliance in this patient
      cohort.
