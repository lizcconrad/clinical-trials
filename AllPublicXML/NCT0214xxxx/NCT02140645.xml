  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify EMR-based clinical covariates and quantify their
      association with the prescribing of each specific type 2 diabetes (T2DM) medication under
      investigation. This will include an assessment of how well these covariates are captured
      through claims data proxies, and their potential to confound comparative research of T2DM
      medications.

    <time_frame>Up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>The missing EMR characteristic smoking defined as current, unknown, versus past/never smoker.
The associations between claims-based covariates and missingness on EMR characteristics were investigated by estimating a logistic regression model (and multinomial logistic regression, depending on the number of categories for the EMR characteristic) for each EMR characteristic where an indicator for missing the EMR characteristic smoking was the dependent variable and all claims-based covariates were included as independent variables.

        <title>Missing EMR (Electronic Medical Record) Characteristic: Smoking</title>
        <description>The missing EMR characteristic smoking defined as current, unknown, versus past/never smoker.
The associations between claims-based covariates and missingness on EMR characteristics were investigated by estimating a logistic regression model (and multinomial logistic regression, depending on the number of categories for the EMR characteristic) for each EMR characteristic where an indicator for missing the EMR characteristic smoking was the dependent variable and all claims-based covariates were included as independent variables.
The estimated value represented is actually prediction accuracy defined by C-statistics.</description>

          <description>The missing EMR characteristic total cholesterol defined as value in 6 months prior to and including index date.
The associations between claims-based covariates and missingness on EMR characteristics were investigated by estimating a logistic regression model (and multinomial logistic regression, depending on the number of categories for the EMR characteristic) for each EMR characteristic where an indicator for missing the EMR characteristic total cholesterol was the dependent variable and all claims-based covariates were included as independent variables.
The estimated value represented is actually prediction accuracy defined by C-statistics.</description>
