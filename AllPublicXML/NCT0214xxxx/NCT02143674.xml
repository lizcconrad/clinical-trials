      Introduction: The life expectancy and the number of people hitting the old age have increased
      in recent years. The aging process is accompanied by morphological and functional changes
      that contribute to reduced functional capacity, increase the number of falls and the
      appearance of physical limitations. Exercise promotes maintenance of functional autonomy,
      improving the physical ability of the elderly making it more independent.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of a program of muscle strengthening exercises associated
      with global stretching on balance, fear of falling and functional capacity in elderly women.

      Methods: This was a non-randomized controlled trial, in which 12 volunteers aged over 60
      years were divided into two groups: intervention group (IG, n = 7) submitted to muscle
      strengthening exercises and stretching, 2 times per week for 12 weeks, and the control group
      (CG, n = 5), not submitted to the protocol but were educated about physical exercises. Before
      and after the protocol were evaluated scores of Berg Balance Scale, the Falls Efficacy Scale
      International (FES-I) and Evaluation of Functional Autonomy Development Group for Latin
      American Maturity (GDLAM). Data were statistically analyzed within and between groups with a
      significance level of p &lt;0.05.

    <description>Each step of stretching on specific muscles was repeated three times by keeping the posture for 30 seconds, (Arnold and Kokkonen, 2007; Toraman A, Yildirim. 2010; Dai, Ware, Giuliani, 2012; Duque et al., 2013; Granacher et al., 2013). The Pectoral, Quadriceps, Paraspinal, Abdominal and Ischial tibial and sural triceps muscles were elongated.
Strength Training Muscle strengthening was performed using weights and dumbbells. The training load individually determined through the test of strength with 10 repetitions maximum. The load was reevaluated four weeks of training. The Abdominal, Paraspinal, Quadriceps and Posterior thigh muscles (hamstrings) were submitted to the intervention protocol.</description>
