  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TACE is frequently offered to patients with baseline hepatic dysfunction with the purpose of
      diminishing hepatic tumor burden while patients await transplantation. Without this
      therapeutic measure, disease may progress beyond UNOS T2 criteria required for organ
      allocation.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether transarterial chemoembolization using
      doxorubicin-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) can be used safely and effectively to treat patients
      with liver-only hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and baseline hepatic dysfunction.

             active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy and are now considered by their
             physician to be at less than 30% risk for relapse.)

         22. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: Ongoing or active

             infarction within preceding 12 months, cerebrovascular accident within preceding 12
             months, pulmonary disease impairing functional status or requiring oxygen, impairment
             in gastrointestinal function that may affect or alter absorption of oral medications
             (such as malabsorption or history of gastrectomy or bowel resection).

         23. Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because of the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             DEB-TACE, breastfeeding must be discontinued for eligibility.

         24. Psychiatric illness, other significant medical illness, or social situation which, in
             the investigator's opinion, would limit compliance or ability to comply with study
             requirements.
