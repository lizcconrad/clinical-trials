  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While surgical anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) of the knee restores passive
      stability, studies are showing consistently poor long-term outcomes. Unusually high risks of
      early-onset osteoarthritis and re-injury, and low rate of return to sport following ACLR all
      seem to be related to a chronic tendency to land stiff-legged from a jump or hop, which
      itself may be due to fear of re-injury. Decreased knee bending for force absorption
      simultaneously decreases performance level and increases risk for injury and arthritic
      changes.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to compare a current best-practice plyometric training
      program to one utilizing body weight support to increase repetition and improve performance
      in the initial phases. The investigators hypothesize that we will see larger improvements in
      absorptive capacity of the knee and better confidence in activity immediately following body
      weight support training, as well as improved retention of training effects after a two-month
      period.

    <description>Participants will undergo treatment 2 times a week for 8 weeks with plyometric exercises deemed to be consistent with best practice with a treatment volume of sets and repetitions that exceeds standard practice. Higher number of practice trials will be completed with body weight support (BWS) to reduce load. Participants will start at 30 percent of body weight and will be slowly weaned away over time.</description>
