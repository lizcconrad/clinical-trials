    <textblock>
      RV1729 is a new medicine being developed for the potential treatment of asthma and smoking
      related lung disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD). The
      objective of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics repeat doses of RV1729 in patients with COPD for 28 days.
