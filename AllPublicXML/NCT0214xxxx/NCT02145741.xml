  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label dose escalation phase I trial, 1280.15, is with the first administration of
      BI 836845 in Japanese patients with various types of advanced solid tumours. The rationale
      behind this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836845 in Japanese
      patients with advanced solid tumours as weekly intravenous administration.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients who apply any of the following exclusion criteria by the judgment of investigator

          2. Patients who do not have sufficient major organ function and meet any of the following
             test results at screening period

               -  Cardiac left ventricular function with resting ejection fraction &lt;=50% as
