  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies support an association between bottle feeding beyond 15 to 18 months of
      age and lower socioeconomic status, excessive milk intake, dental caries, iron deficiency,
      behavioral issues and obesity. Yet many parents, particularly those from low socioeconomic
      households, choose to feed their children by bottle much beyond this age. Recognizing the
      need for further educational interventions for bottle feeding, the TARGet Kids! Research
      Collaboration recently developed a 5-minute bottle weaning educational intervention for the 9
      month well-child visit. We undertook a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate its
      effectiveness involving 251 children recruited through TARGet Kids! (PMID: 20624802) The goal
      was to determine whether an office-based, educational intervention for parents of 9-month-old
      children could reduce bottle use and iron depletion at 2 years of age.

            <description>Parents in this arm received a 5 minute educational intervention on bottle cessation plus standard nutritional counseling.
Educational Intervention: Parents of children in both intervention and control groups received standardized counseling on healthy nutrition based on Canadian Paediatric Society guidelines. In addition, during the same 9-month doctors visit, parents of infants allocated to the intervention group were given a sip cup (Avent Magic CupTM) and shown how to use it. A trained research assistant told intervention group parents the risks of continued bottle use. They were also instructed to limit daily milk consumption to 16 ounces. Parents were also counseled to discontinue bottle use in the next 1 week using a step-wise protocol described on a handout to be placed on their refrigerator. Parents of infants allocated to the control group did not receive this information.</description>
