  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Terix Labs Ltd Metronidazole benzoate (400
      mg Metronidazole Per Sachet Oral Granules) is bioequivalent to 500 mg Sanofi-aventis Flagyl
      125 mg/5 ml (125 mg Metronidazole Per 5 ml Suspension) and to Zentiva Flagyl™ 400 mg Tablets
      (400 mg Metronidazole Per Film Coated Tablets).

      This study is a pilot study exploited for exploratory purposes to compare the absorption and
      disposition kinetics of three products containing metronidazole under fasting conditions.
      These products are: Metronidazole benzoate (formula A), Test product manufactured by ONE
      PHARMA, Greece. Flagyl 125 mg/5 ml (formula B), a Reference product manufactured by Unither
      Liquid Manufacturing, France and Flagyl™ 400 mg Tablets (formula C), a Reference product
      manufactured by Famar Health Care Services, Spain. The bioequivalence of a single 400 mg dose
      of products A and C, and a single 500 mg dose of product B will be assessed by comparing the
      pharmacokinetic parameters derived from the plasma concentration-time profiles for
      metronidazole.
