  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetal intra uterine death is a rare event (incidence 2/1000 births) , unexpected and
      psychologically painful for the couple and the healthcare team. In this difficult context, it
      is essential to understand the etiology of death to guide the management of subsequent
      pregnancies. Among the investigations, foetopathologic examination is essential, but the
      examination of the brain is not possible in more than half of the cases due to the cerebral
      maceration due to the incompressible delay between death and expulsion.

      The use of MRI as a diagnostic tool fetal post- mortem &quot; virtual autopsy &quot; performed before
      expulsion of the fetus is interesting because it would permit to obtain a macroscopic
      examination of the fetal brain, archivable, and a gain concerning the diagnosis. Thus, a
      normal MRI will exclude cerebral anatomical abnormality , stroke or bleeding . If MRI
      abnormalities are found , it will not only guide the foetopathologic review, but mainly to
      guide the etiology . On the other hand , it is a non-invasive tool and acceptability by the
      couple would be better than autopsy which is often refused by the couple in this difficult
      psychological context.

      In this study , MRI will be given in addition to conventional autopsy in the painful waiting
      time between the time of diagnosis of death and expulsion without delaying care . If this
      study is validated , MRI may be systematically proposed in this indication or alternative to
      autopsy when it will be refused by the parents.
