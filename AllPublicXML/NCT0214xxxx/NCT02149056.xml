      Background About 2/3 patients of coronary heart disease (CHD) are complicated with disorder
      of carbohydrate metabolism which results in hyperglycemia and subsequent abnormality of
      coagulation system and inflammation. These patients have serious coronary artery pathology,
      multiple complications and poor prognosis. Platelets and lymphocytes play important roles in
      the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. The platelet/lymphocyte rate (PLR) is one
      simple hematological index. Previous studies confirmed that PLR could predict the long-term
      mortality of non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). If simple hematological index
      could predict the prognosis of such kind of patients, it will provide new thought for early
      diagnosis and treatment in future. Therefore, the present study try to investigate if PLR
      could predict the poor prognosis of CHD patients complicated with impaired glucose tolerance
      (IGT) through calculating PLR.

      Methods/design The present study is performed with strategy of an observational and
      prospective single-centre cohort. These patients are recruited from August 2013 to August
      2014, according to the inclusion criteria of CHD complicated with IGT. CHD is confirmed with
      coronary angiography while IGT is determined according to the WHO criteria (1999). Routine
      blood test and serum glucose data of patients are acquired before hospitalization and
      surgery. According to the median of PLR after admission, the patients are divided into 3
      groups. The patients are followed up for half, 1 and 3 years, respectively. The major
      clinical endpoint is mortality. The minor clinical endpoint indices are the correlations of
      PLR with MACE (including mortality, recurrent rate of infarction and reperfusion rate of
      target vessels), recurrent infarction, re-perfusion rate of target vessel, intra-stand
      thrombogenesis, stroke and acute onset of heart failure. The correlations are analyzed with
      receiver operating characteristics (ROC) survival curve and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to
      find optimal prognosis index.

      Summary Through regression analysis of long-term follow-up of patients, it is expected to
      find optimal predicting index of prognosis. While judging whether PLR is effective, other
      possible factors for new predictor are sought in order to provide help for future study.
