  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare providers play an important role in helping patients be actively involved in
      treatment and recover from mental illness. But mental health clinicians, like other
      healthcare providers, are at risk for experiencing burnout—feeling emotionally drained from
      their work, having cynical thoughts toward patients and others, and feeling little
      accomplishment in their work. Burnout can lead to problems for the clinician including poor
      overall health, depression, and lower job satisfaction. Burnout also can impact how
      clinicians perform on the job; for example, people with high levels of burnout take more time
      off, show lower commitment to their job, and are more likely to quit or be fired. There is
      some evidence that burnout can affect the quality of care for patients, but very little
      rigorous research has tested this assumption. The purpose of our study is threefold. First,
      we will investigate how patients perceive burnout in clinicians and whether (and/or how)
      burnout impacts the care they receive. Next, we will test an intervention to reduce clinician
      burnout called Burnout Reduction: Enhanced Awareness, Tools, Handouts, and Education
      (BREATHE). BREATHE brings together tools that mental health clinicians are already familiar
      with, including relaxation and mindfulness exercises, setting boundaries, using social
      supports, and changing negative thought patterns and replacing them with more helpful ways of
      thinking. We have found this intervention effective in reducing burnout in other
      organizations, but have yet to study whether it also can improve patient outcomes. Clinicians
      (approximately 200) who participate will receive either the BREATHE intervention or training
      in motivational interviewing, which could also improve patient involvement in treatment and
      patient outcomes, but is unlikely to significantly reduce clinician burnout. We will also
      recruit up to 600 adult patients served by participating clinicians. We will survey
      clinicians and interview patients over a 12-month period after the intervention to determine
      how the intervention impacts clinician burnout and patient perceptions of care (relationship
      with the clinician, degree of autonomy in decision making), patient involvement in care, and
      outcomes (confidence in managing mental health, symptoms, functioning, and hope). Finally,
      this study will use a statistical procedure called Structural Equation Modeling to test a
      theoretical model of the relationship between burnout and patient outcomes. Findings from
      this study will show whether reducing clinician burnout can improve patient outcomes and the
      quality of care that patients receive. Our intervention will have the potential to be easily
      implemented in a variety of settings where burnout is a problem. Knowing how clinician
      burnout impacts patient outcomes, and whether improving burnout can improve patient care, can
      help improve the healthcare system.

    <measure>Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI): Emotional Exhaustion</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured with staff at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a widely-used measure of three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. The survey contains 22 statements of job-related feelings and staff were asked to read each statement and decide if they ever felt that way about their job. The item scores were averaged. Scale: 0 (Never), 1 (A few times a year or less), 2 (Once a month or less), 3 (A few times a month), 4 (Once a week), 5 (A few times a week), 6 (Every Day).

    <description>Work-Life Balance was assessed with a six-item measure adapted from an 18-item measure developed by Carlson et al. The measure assesses three types (time-, strain-, and behavior-based) and two directions (work conflict with family and family conflict with work) of balance. The outcome described here is work conflict with family. The measure consists of a series of statements regarding one's work and family situation, to which participants are asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement on a 5-point Likert-type scale: 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). The item scores were averaged.

    <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, self-report assessment. It provides a summed total score that indicates likelihood of major depressive disorder. Scores ≥10 are considered a positive screen (sensitivity 88%, specificity 88%) and also effectively measures response to treatment (&lt;5 indicate remission, of 5-9 indicate partial response, and ≥10 indicates no response). Item scores are summed and averaged (range: 0-27). Scale: 0 (Not at all), 1 (Several days), 2 (More than half the days), 4 (Nearly every day). When problems are identified, the difficulty of those problems are rated on 4 point scale (Not difficult at all to Extremely difficult).

Scale: 1 to 4 with response text dependent upon the question (e.g., 1-Poor to 4-Excellent, 1-No, definitely not to 4-Yes, definitely, or 1-Quite dissatisfied to 4-Very satisfied).</description>

    <measure>Patient Engagement-Missed Appointments</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured with clients at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient engagement was assessed by the proportion of missed appointments (when the client cancelled or did not show for a scheduled appointment divided by the total scheduled). This data was retrieved from client medical records at the agencies. Data from 3 time periods were analyzed (6 months prior to baseline through baseline, baseline to 6 months, and 6 months to 12 months). The below table illustrates the missed appointments for each time period.</description>

        <title>Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI): Emotional Exhaustion</title>
        <description>Burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a widely-used measure of three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. The survey contains 22 statements of job-related feelings and staff were asked to read each statement and decide if they ever felt that way about their job. The item scores were averaged. Scale: 0 (Never), 1 (A few times a year or less), 2 (Once a month or less), 3 (A few times a month), 4 (Once a week), 5 (A few times a week), 6 (Every Day).

        <title>Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI): Personal Accomplishment</title>
        <description>Burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a widely-used measure of three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. The survey contains 22 statements of job-related feelings and staff were ased to read each statement and decide if they ever felt that way about their job. The item scores were averaged. Scale: 0 (Never), 1 (A few times a year or less), 2 (Once a month or less), 3 (A few times a month), 4 (Once a week), 5 (A few times a week), 6 (Every Day).

        <description>Work-Life Balance was assessed with a six-item measure adapted from an 18-item measure developed by Carlson et al. The measure assesses three types (time-, strain-, and behavior-based) and two directions (work conflict with family and family conflict with work) of balance. The outcome described here is work conflict with family. The measure consists of a series of statements regarding one’s work and family situation, to which participants are asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement on a 5-point Likert-type scale: 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). The item scores were averaged.

          <title>Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) - Bonds Subscale</title>
          <description>Perceived relatedness was assessed with this short form of the patient version of the WAI and has 12 items in total. This outcome is for the bonds subscale. Clients were prompted to report on the specific clinician from whose caseload they were randomly selected. The items scores were summed and averaged (range: 4-28). Scale: 1 (Never) to 7 (Always)

        <description>Physical and mental health functioning was assessed with the Short Form 12-Item Health Survey (SF-12). The SF-12 is a health-related quality of life measure, derived from the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study survey and containing items yielding a Mental Health Component Score and a Physical Health Component Score. Higher composite scores indicate higher health-related quality of life. Items are weighted and then transformed into norm-based scores (range: 0-100).

        <description>Physical and mental health functioning was assessed with the Short Form 12-Item Health Survey (SF-12). The SF-12 is a health-related quality of life measure, derived from the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study survey and containing items yielding a Mental Health Component Score and a Physical Health Component Score. Higher composite scores indicate higher health-related quality of life. Items are weighted and then transformed into norm-based scores (range: 0-100).

        <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, self-report assessment. It provides a summed total score that indicates likelihood of major depressive disorder. Scores ≥10 are considered a positive screen (sensitivity 88%, specificity 88%) and also effectively measures response to treatment (&lt;5 indicate remission, of 5-9 indicate partial response, and ≥10 indicates no response). Item scores are summed and averaged (range: 0-27). Scale: 0 (Not at all), 1 (Several days), 2 (More than half the days), 4 (Nearly every day). When problems are identified, the difficulty of those problems are rated on 4 point scale (Not difficult at all to Extremely difficult).

        <description>Anxiety was assessed with the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). It can be scored continuously on a 0-21 severity scale and cutpoints have been established for estimating the probability of the 4 most common and clinically relevant anxiety disorders – generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Scale: 0 (not at all), 1 (several days), 2 (more than half the days), 3 (nearly every day)
