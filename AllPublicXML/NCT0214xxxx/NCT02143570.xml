  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder is a common problem among adult women. Darifenacin is an antimuscarinic
      drug that is frequently used as part of the management of the condition. However, current
      evidence backing its use is limited. This study aims to address Darifenacin's effectiveness
      in adjunct to physiotherapy in treating symptoms due to overactive bladder.
