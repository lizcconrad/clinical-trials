  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the tolerability and safety of LY3113593. Study
      doctors will see how safe it is and whether it produces side effects following a single
      injection into a vein or under the skin in healthy participants (Part A) and participants
      with chronic kidney disease treated with hemodialysis (Part B). The study will also measure
      how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream, how long it takes the body to get rid
      of the study drug and what effects the study drug has on the body.

      This is the first time that this study drug is being given to participants. This study is for
      research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition. For each
      participant, the study will last about 85 days, not including screening. Screening is
      required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.
