  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer often experience appetite loss and weight loss unintentionally. Rapid
      weight loss negatively impact on physical functioning, quality of life, and overall survival.
      Patients will be randomly assigned into two groups. An intervention with acupuncture may slow
      down or stop the progression of cancer-related anorexia and weight loss.

      The purpose of this research study is to investigate if acupuncture helps to improve appetite
      and slow down unintentional weight loss. The participants will be randomly divided into two
      groups and receive 8 sessions of acupuncture (two groups will receive different acupuncture
      points) for 8 weeks. During the study period, participants will be asked various questions
      about appetite, physical functioning, cancer-related symptoms and quality of life to
      understand changes related to body weight, as well as blood samples. The research team
      members will collect data regarding changes in appetite, body weight, body composition, and
      physical functioning.

    <description>Three different short survey forms will be used to measure appetite change. Visual analogue scale (0 indicates no appetite and 10 is the best appetite). Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire score (min-max: 4-20 and the higher the better appetite) Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment: 0-1, no intervention is needed. 9 or higher score indicates critical intervention.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Cachexia Acupuncture-A</arm_group_label>
    <description>Acupuncture-A group will receive acupuncture in a pre-determined set of the acupuncture points that are selected based on the potential mechanisms of cachexia. Intervention will be done by a licensed acupuncturist who has over 5 years of experience as an independent clinician and has experience particularly in the management of cancer related symptoms. Acupuncture treatment will consist of 8 sessions over 8 week period.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>General Acupuncture-B</arm_group_label>
    <description>General Acupuncture-B group will receive acupuncture in a pre-determined set of the acupuncture points. These points are the real acupuncture points; however, these points are not specific to cachexia management. Participants will receive the acupuncture treatment over 8 weeks (total of 8 sessions) in the same manner as the experimental group; the only difference will be the place(type) and number of points targeted.
