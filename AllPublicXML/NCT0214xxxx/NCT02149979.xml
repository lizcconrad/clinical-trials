      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using Temperature
      Controlled Laser Soldering System for soft tissue bonding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin incisions can be closed by a variety of method which create temporary approximation of
      the wound edges until natural healing process ensue and reach a phase, where it is closed and
      can sustain the daily tensile forces.

      The wound closure devices include sutures, staples, tapes, tissue adhesives. The Applied
      Physics group at the Tel Aviv University has developed a Temperature Controlled CO2 Laser
      Soldering system for soft tissue bonding.

      This system includes features that make laser soldering suitable for clinical use. The
      Temperature Controlled Laser Soldering System is composed of CO2 fiberoptic laser device,
      Infrared fiber-optic radiometer, a computerized temperature control program, propriety grip
      device (Clamps) and concentrated Human Albumin as a soldering agent.

    <description>This study had a prospective within-subject design. Patients allocated to laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure were enrolled. After the completion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgical procedure, 4 trocar port sites were randomly either sutured or laser soldered by employing the temperature-controlled laser soldering system.</description>
