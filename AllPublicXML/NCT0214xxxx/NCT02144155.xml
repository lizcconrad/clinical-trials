      The Objective of this study is to investigate the long-term efficacy of intranasal oxytocin
      in improvement of symptoms in patients with schizophrenia who have residual symptoms dispute
      being on adequate treatment with antipsychotic medication.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total score in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to 28 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The three subscales of the PANSS include the Positive scale (7 items), the Negative scale (7 items), and the General Psychopathology scale (16 items). The total PANSS score is the sum of all 30 items of which each item is scored on a 1-7 rating system (7 indicating the worst symptoms). The items on the PANSS focus on symptoms that are common in patients with psychotic disorders and include hallucinations, delusions and disorganization as well as mood disturbances.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GAF considers psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health illness. Scores on the GAF range from 1 (extremely severe) to 100 (superior functioning).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is used to evaluate changes in overall severity of illness. Scores range from 1 (not at all) to 7 (among the most extremely ill).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a global assessment to evaluate the subject's improvement or worsening from baseline. Scores on the CGI-I scale range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
