  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study protocol is to collect imaging data on embryos followed to
      blastocyst stage (Day 5-6) and correlate Eeva parameters with array - Comparative Genomic
      Hybridization (aCGH) results and ongoing pregnancy rates.

      The present study was designed to determine if there is a correlation between the Eeva System
      parameters and aCGH testing results. Embryos will be selected for transfer based on aCGH
      results and morphology. The Clinical site will have no access to the Eeva analysis at the
      time of the transfer.
