  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      anti-tumour activity of AZD9291 when given together with AZD6094 or selumetinib in patients
      with EGFR mutation positive advanced lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicentre study of AZD9291 administered orally in
      combination with novel therapeutics (AZD6094 or selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886)) to
      patients with EGFRm+ advanced NSCLC. The study has been designed to allow an investigation of
      the optimal combination dose and schedule whilst ensuring the safety of patients with
      intensive safety monitoring. There are three main parts to this study; Part A, Combination
      dose finding and Parts B and D, Dose expansion. Part C, AZD6094 dose finding sub-study in
      advanced solid tumour patients is ongoing in Japan.

      AZD9291 (osimertinib) is a potent irreversible inhibitor of both the single epidermal growth
      factor receptor sensitising mutation positive (EGFRm+) (tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]
      sensitivity-conferring mutation) and dual EGFRm+/T790M+ (TKI resistance-conferring mutation)
      receptor forms of EGFR. AZD9291 therefore has the potential to provide clinical benefit to
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring both the single
      sensitivity mutations and the resistance mutation following prior therapy with an EGFR TKI.
      AZD9291 (osimertinib) was awarded FDA accelerated approval in November 2015, followed by
      conditional approval in the EU, full approval in Japan and additional markets in 2016, for
      the treatment of patients with EGFR T790M+ NSCLC who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI
      therapy.

      Enrolment into the patient cohort that evaluated AZD9291 treatment in combination with
      MEDI4736 as 1st line treatment has been terminated due to an increased incidence of ILD-like
      events (interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis), and is no longer being evaluated in this
      study.

The choice of AZD6094 dose of 300 mg is based on results from preclinical and clinical studies. Clinical testing of the 300 mg OD dose will enable better assessment of impact of lower AZD6094 exposure on overall tolerability and hepatotoxicity risk as well as exploration of the efficacy and overall safety profiles with a dose meaningfully lower than the current dose of 600 mg OD.</description>

          2. Aged at least 18 years (20 years for Japan)

          3. Histological or cytological confirmation diagnosis of EGFRm+ NSCLC. Confirmation from
             a previous archival sample that the tumour harbours an EGFRm+ known to be associated
             with EGFR TKI sensitivity.

          4. Radiological documentation of disease progression while on a previous continuous
             treatment with an EGFR TKI (on the last treatment administered prior to enrolling in
             the study)

             Part B cMET+ve patients:

               -  No prior treatment with a 3rd generation TKI: at least one prior line of therapy
                  with 1st or 2nd generation EGFR TKI, but not a 3rd generation (T790M-directed)
                  EGFR TKI.

               -  Prior treatment with a 3rd generation TKI: at least one prior line of therapy
                  with a 3rd generation (T790M-directed) EGFR TKI for EGFRm or T790M+ NSCLC.

             Part B cMET-ve patients:

               -  T790M directed EGFR TKI patients only: their immediate prior therapy before entry
                  into this study must be a T790M directed EGFR TKI.

               -  ≥2nd line cohort: patients must have progressed while on treatment with an EGFR
                  TKI (T790M directed EGFR TKIs are permitted). Other prior lines of therapy may
                  have been given.

             Part D cMET-ve patients:

             No prior treatment with a 3rd generation TKI, T790M negative:

             Patients must have received at least one prior line of therapy with 1st or 2nd
             generation EGFR TKI, but not a 3rd generation (T790M directed) EGFR TKI.

          5. cMET status: Prior to study entry, local confirmation of tumour cMET status is
             acceptable, a central result will be confirmed retrospectively. If a local test is not
             available, central confirmation of tumour cMET status must be obtained prior to study
             entry.

             T790M status: Local confirmation of tumour T790M status is acceptable, a central
             result will be confirmed retrospectively. If local testing is performed with the
             Cobas® EGFR Mutation Test, the central confirmation is not required.

          6. At least one lesion, not previously irradiated, not biopsied during the screening
             period, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter
             (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥15 mm) with CT or MRI which is
             suitable for accurate repeated measurements

          7. WHO performance status 0-1 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and minimum
             life expectancy of 12 weeks

          8. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures, must not be breast feeding
             and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of child-bearing
             potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria (summary):

          -  Treatment with an EGFR TKI within approximately 5x half-life of the first dose of
             study treatment. Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents or other
             anticancer drugs for the treatment of advanced NSCLC from a previous treatment regimen
             or clinical study within 14 days of the first dose of study treatment. Patients
             currently receiving (or unable to stop use) medications or herbal supplements known to
             be potent inducers of CYP3A4 (at least 3 weeks prior). For AZD6094 patients currently
             receiving (or unable to stop use at least 2 weeks) prior to receiving the first dose,
             medications known to be strong inhibitors of CYP1A2. Prior AZD9291 dosing in the
             present study. Prior or current treatment with AZD6094 or another cMET inhibitor (if
             allocated to AZD9291 + AZD6094). Radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for
             palliation within 1 week of the first dose of study treatment, with the exception of
             patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field
             of radiation which must be completed within ≥4 weeks of the first dose of study
             treatment. Major (or anticipated major) surgical procedure (excluding placement of
             vascular access) or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of the first dose of
             study treatment. Currently receiving treatment with warfarin sodium.

          -  With the exception of alopecia and Grade 2, prior platinum-therapy related neuropathy,
             any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy and/or pre-study biopsies greater than

          -  Past medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), drug-induced ILD, radiation
