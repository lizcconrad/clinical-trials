  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An association between arterial aneurysms and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been
      described previously. MMPs regulate extracellular structural proteins and tissue remodeling.
      Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is involved in the regulation of MMP
      activity. The aim of this work was to study the relationship between the levels of MMPs and
      NGAL and arterial aneurysms.

      In a multicenter, open label, parallel groups, prospective study, patients with aneurysmal
      disease were divided into two groups: Group I (with ruptured aneurysm) and Group II (with
      non-ruptured aneurysm). Healthy volunteer patients were also enrolled and represented the
      control group (Group III).

      The investigators enrolled 307 patients (Group I: 107, Group II: 200) with arterial aneurysm:
      49 popliteal, 31 common femoral, 2 superficial femoral, 29 common iliac artery, 3 common
      carotid and 193 abdominal aorta. Finally, 11 healthy volunteer patients (9 males and 2
      females, age range 40-70 year-old, median 56) were enrolled in Group III.

      Elisa test and Western blot analysis revealed greater levels of immunoreactive MMP-9 and NGAL
      in all patients with ruptured aneurysms, both central and peripheral aneurysms, and in the
      aneurismal vessels.

      These results provide important advances in the understanding of the natural history of
      arterial aneurysms. MMPs and NGAL play a role in development of arterial aneurysms and they
      may represent molecular markers for the prevention of aneurysmal rupture

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the analysis of MMPs levels in plasma and tissues in patients with
      aneurysmal lesions identified several patterns of protease activity. Levels of both MMP-9 and
      NGAL were increased in aneurismal vessels, while the patterns of MMP-9 and NGAL expression
      was very high in all patients with ruptured aneurysm, both central and peripheral. These
      results show: 1) the chronic and degenerative nature of the aneurysmal lesion which is
      associated with increased levels of inflammatory proteinases, like MMP-9; 2) the apparent
      pivotal role of MMP-9 and NGAL in the pathophysiologic processes which lead to the final
      stage of natural history of aneurysms; and 3) the ubiquitous distribution of MMP-9 and NGAL.
      The pattern increased expression of MMP-9 and NGAL appears to be specific for aneurysmal
      arteries and it is not dependent on the anatomic site of the lesion.
