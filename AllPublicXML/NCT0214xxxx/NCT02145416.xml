      This is a single arm, single centre imaging study which will be offered to all consecutive,
      eligible patients receiving radical chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for anal cancer within
      Oxford University Hospitals.

      Investigations

        -  Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI)

        -  Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI MRI)

        -  MRI scan designed to measure the T1 or produce T1-weighed images (T1 MRI)

        -  MRI scan designed to measure the T2* or produce T2*-weighed images (T2* MRI)

        -  Perfusion computed tomography (pCT)

        -  Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT)

      Study Design: Observational

      Target Population: Patients undergoing radical CRT for anal cancer in Oxford University
      Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust.

      Duration on study: Patients should be on study for a maximum of 5 months.

      Patient care post-trial: Follow up as per local standard.

      No. of Study Site(s): Single Centre, United Kingdon (UK)

      End of study: Last Patient, last assessment of response. Patients should be on study for a
      maximum of 5 months.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To use PET SUV data in a radiotherapy in silico modelling exercise to determine if dose sparing of active pelvic bone marrow (PBM) is possible without compromising target coverage by radiation.</measure>
