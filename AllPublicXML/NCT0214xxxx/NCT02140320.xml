    <textblock>
      RV1729 is a new medicine being developed for the potential treatment of asthma and smoking
      related lung disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD).

      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics
      of single doses of RV1729 and repeat doses of RV1729 for up to 28 days.
