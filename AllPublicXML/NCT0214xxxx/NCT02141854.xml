    <measure>Standardized Baseline-Adjusted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Area Under the Effect Curve From Time Zero to 12 Hours PostDose (FEV1 AUEC0-12) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (predose, baseline), Week 12 and was performed at the following times relative to the administration of study drug (±5 minutes): 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A subset of patients performed postdose serial spirometry. Data from these assessments were used to analyze the primary endpoint of baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at week 12 using the trapezoidal rule based on actual time of measurement. It was standardized by dividing it by the number of hours between the start time of dose administration and the end time of the last nonmissing FEV1 measurement. The baseline FEV1 was the average of the 2 predose FEV1 measurements (30 and 10 minutes predose). If 1 of these was missing, the nonmissing value was used; if both were missing, baseline was treated as missing. Baseline-adjusted FEV1 was calculated as postdose FEV1 after subtracting the baseline FEV1 value.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Morning Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (predose, baseline), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Trough FEV1 is a morning spirometry taken predose and pre-rescue bronchodilator. The baseline for predose FEV1 was defined as the average of the 30-minute and 10-minute predose measurements obtained at the randomization visit (Day 1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Average of the Daily Morning Trough Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over the 12 Week Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Days -6 to Day 1 (predose, baseline), Day 1 (postdose) daily until Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Morning PEF tests were performed before administration of study drug or rescue medications (data were excluded if the time of PEF measurement was more than 5 minutes after the dose time). The patient recorded the highest value of 3 measurements obtained in the patient diary.
The baseline PEF was the average value of recorded (nonmissing) morning assessments over the 7 days prior to randomization on Day 1. For efficacy analyses of weekly average morning PEF measurements, values were the averages based on available data for that week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Average of the Total Daily Asthma Symptom Score Over the 12-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Days -6 to Day 1 (predose, baseline), to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The total daily asthma symptom score is the average of the daytime and nighttime scores as recorded in the patient diary.
Daytime Symptom Score:
0=No symptoms
1=Symptoms for 1 short period
2=Symptoms for 2+ short periods
3=Symptoms for most of the day - did not affect normal daily activities
4=Symptoms for most of the day - did affect normal daily activities
5=Symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities
Nighttime Symptom Score (determined in the AM):
0=No symptoms
1=Symptoms causing me to wake once (or wake early)
2=Symptoms causing me to wake twice or more (including waking early)
3=Symptoms causing me to be awake for most of the night
4=Symptoms so severe that I did not sleep Baseline was the average of recorded scores over the 7 days before randomization. The change from baseline in the weekly average over weeks 1 to 12 was analyzed using an mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Average of the Total Daily (24-hour) Use of Albuterol/Salbutamol Inhalation Aerosol Over the 12-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Days -6 to Day 1 (predose, baseline), up to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recorded the number of inhalations of rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI) each AM and PM in the diary. The average number of daily inhalations over the 7 days before the randomization visit was the baseline value. The weekly average was based on the available data for the 7 days before each analysis week.
The change from baseline in the weekly average of total daily (24-hour) use of albuterol/ salbutamol inhalation aerosol (number of inhalations) over weeks 1 to 12 was analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Probability of Remaining in Study At Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Week 12 of the Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of probability of remaining in the study at Week 12 used the time to patient withdrawal for worsening asthma, defined as the number of days elapsed from the date of randomization to the date of withdrawal due to worsening asthma. Patients who were lost to follow-up, who had not withdrawn due to worsening asthma by week 12, or who had withdrawn due to reasons other than worsening asthma were right-censored at the date of last assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire With Standardized Activities (AQLQ(S)) Score at Endpoint for Patients &gt;=18 Years Old</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (predose, baseline), end of trial (up to week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ(S) (September 2010 version; patients aged ≥18 years) was self administered by the patients at the investigational center at the randomization visit and at Week 12 or end of trial. The questionnaire is a tool to measure the impact of asthma on a patient's quality of life (physical, emotional, social, and occupational) with a recall period of 2 weeks. The AQLQ(S) was administered only to patients 18 years and older. The 32 individual questions in the AQLQ were equally weighted. The overall AQLQ score was the mean of the responses to each of the 32 questions, and ranged from 1 to 7. A score 7.0 indicated that the patient had no impairments due to asthma and a score of 1.0 indicated severe impairment.
Positive change from baseline scores indicate improved quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time to 15% and 12% Improvement From Baseline in FEV1 Postdose on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of the Treatment Period (predose and postdose)</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was the average of the 2 predose FEV1 measurements (30 and 10 minutes predose) on Day 1. If one of these was missing, the other measurement was used as baseline value. If both were missing, the baseline trough FEV1 was treated as missing.
Time to target improvement (15% or 12%) was defined as the time elapsed from the time of first dose to the first time the target improvement in FEV1 was achieved. If an exact target increase was not achieved at a measured timepoint, then the time was estimated by linear interpolation between the timepoint when target was reached and the timepoint immediately before. Patients who did not achieve the target improvement were censored at the time of last serial spirometry assessment.
Values of NA indicate the values could not be estimated which happened when the estimated probability of not achieving target is more than 50%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences (TEAE) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12 of the Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

        <title>Standardized Baseline-Adjusted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Area Under the Effect Curve From Time Zero to 12 Hours PostDose (FEV1 AUEC0-12) at Week 12</title>
        <description>A subset of patients performed postdose serial spirometry. Data from these assessments were used to analyze the primary endpoint of baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at week 12 using the trapezoidal rule based on actual time of measurement. It was standardized by dividing it by the number of hours between the start time of dose administration and the end time of the last nonmissing FEV1 measurement. The baseline FEV1 was the average of the 2 predose FEV1 measurements (30 and 10 minutes predose). If 1 of these was missing, the nonmissing value was used; if both were missing, baseline was treated as missing. Baseline-adjusted FEV1 was calculated as postdose FEV1 after subtracting the baseline FEV1 value.</description>

        <description>The total daily asthma symptom score is the average of the daytime and nighttime scores as recorded in the patient diary.
Daytime Symptom Score:
0=No symptoms
1=Symptoms for 1 short period
2=Symptoms for 2+ short periods
3=Symptoms for most of the day - did not affect normal daily activities
4=Symptoms for most of the day - did affect normal daily activities
5=Symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities
Nighttime Symptom Score (determined in the AM):
0=No symptoms
1=Symptoms causing me to wake once (or wake early)
2=Symptoms causing me to wake twice or more (including waking early)
3=Symptoms causing me to be awake for most of the night
4=Symptoms so severe that I did not sleep Baseline was the average of recorded scores over the 7 days before randomization. The change from baseline in the weekly average over weeks 1 to 12 was analyzed using an mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire With Standardized Activities (AQLQ(S)) Score at Endpoint for Patients &gt;=18 Years Old</title>
        <description>The AQLQ(S) (September 2010 version; patients aged ≥18 years) was self administered by the patients at the investigational center at the randomization visit and at Week 12 or end of trial. The questionnaire is a tool to measure the impact of asthma on a patient’s quality of life (physical, emotional, social, and occupational) with a recall period of 2 weeks. The AQLQ(S) was administered only to patients 18 years and older. The 32 individual questions in the AQLQ were equally weighted. The overall AQLQ score was the mean of the responses to each of the 32 questions, and ranged from 1 to 7. A score 7.0 indicated that the patient had no impairments due to asthma and a score of 1.0 indicated severe impairment.
Positive change from baseline scores indicate improved quality of life.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time to 15% and 12% Improvement From Baseline in FEV1 Postdose on Day 1</title>
        <description>The baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was the average of the 2 predose FEV1 measurements (30 and 10 minutes predose) on Day 1. If one of these was missing, the other measurement was used as baseline value. If both were missing, the baseline trough FEV1 was treated as missing.
Time to target improvement (15% or 12%) was defined as the time elapsed from the time of first dose to the first time the target improvement in FEV1 was achieved. If an exact target increase was not achieved at a measured timepoint, then the time was estimated by linear interpolation between the timepoint when target was reached and the timepoint immediately before. Patients who did not achieve the target improvement were censored at the time of last serial spirometry assessment.
Values of NA indicate the values could not be estimated which happened when the estimated probability of not achieving target is more than 50%.</description>

        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>
