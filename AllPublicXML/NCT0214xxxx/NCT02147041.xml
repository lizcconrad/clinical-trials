      The aim of this study is to examine the therapeutic effect of green tea extract on obese
      women and the correlation analysis between traditional Chinese medicine syndrome and obese
      related hormone peptides.

      Obesity has become a noticeable and worldwide public health problem recently. According to
      the WHO survey in 2005, 1.6 billion and 400 million adults were found overweight and obese,
      respectively. In Taiwan, there are more than 30% found overweight in the national survey in
      2009. Compare with the ones done in 1999 and 2005, a rising trend of the prevalence of
      obesity is found. Furthermore, the incidence and prevalence of obesity are also increasing
      worldwide, especially in the developing and newly industrialized nations. In addition,
      obesity is related to some chronic diseases, like diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and
      cardiovascular diseases, which are major lethal health concerns in Taiwan and many developing
      countries. Taken together, obesity emerges as an important issue lately. The aim of the study
      is to evaluate the therapeutic effect and safety of green tea extract on demographic
      characteristics and obesity-related hormone peptide of obese women and to establish an
      obesity Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes questionnaire, which will undergo well
      assessing of reliability and validity. Second, we intent to utilize the TCM syndromes and
      Quality of Life (SF-12, WHO) questionnaire to 200 obesity women for the correlation analysis
      of TCM syndromes, obesity related hormone peptides and quality of life. The results of this
      study are expected to assess the effect and safety of green tea extract on obese women and
      improve the scientific diagnosis of TCM with a quantitative measurement by this
      questionnaire.
