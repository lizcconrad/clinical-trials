  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether individual cognitive functional therapy
      (CFT), when compared to group exercise classes is effective in reducing pain and disability
      in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre randomised study with 6 month, 12 month and 36 month follow up will be used.
      Patient with non- specific chronic low back pain will be assessed for eligibility. The
      patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be randomised to receive either the individual
      CFT or the group classes consisting of education and exercise. Participants' pain,
      disability, socio-economic status, beliefs, fear, catastrophizing, self-efficacy, general
      health, stress levels, as well as number and cost of treatments will be evaluated using a
      range of outcome measures at the start and on completion of the treatment. Patients will
      receive another copy of the questionnaires in the post at 6 month, 12 months and 36 months
      after treatment to reassess clinical outcomes. If a participant does not respond to
      follow-up, they will be telephoned to ask if they wish to complete the questionnaires.

    <description>The intervention being tested has four main components: (1) a cognitive component, for each patient, their vicious cycle of pain will outlined in a diagram based on their findings from the examination and the Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire; (2) specific movement exercises designed to normalize maladaptive movement behaviours; (3) targeted functional integration of activities in their daily life previously, reported to be avoided or provocative by the patient; and (4) a physical activity and lifestyle programme.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group Exercise Classes</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>6 classes will take place in total. The class has 3 components each week. First, a 30 minute talk and discussion on chronic pain, and some tips for participants. Second, a 40 minute exercise circuit, involving aerobic exercise, and gentle stretching and strengthening exercises. Finally, a 5 minute relaxation/mindfulness session will take place at the end. The total time involved is approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Individual Cognitive Functional Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) is a novel, patient centred behavioural intervention which addresses multiple dimensions in non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). It combines a functional behavioural approach of normalising provocative postures and movements while discouraging pain behaviours, with cognitive restructuring of the NSCLBP problem.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Group Exercise Classes</intervention_name>
    <description>Each class involves a combination of education, exercise and relaxation/mindfulness. The education topics include pain and the nervous system, posture and ergonomics, exercise and relaxation and sleep. The exercise component includes 10 stations of a combination of aerobic, strength and flexibility exercises. These will be walking/jogging on the spot, mini-squats, sit to stands, wall push ups, bridging, step-ups and a combination of leg and low back stretches. The relaxation/mindfulness component will take place at the end of each class and will involve breathing and relaxation of the body.</description>
