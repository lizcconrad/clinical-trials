  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine how well two types of treatment follow up work
      compared to one another:

        1. standard community follow up

        2. medication monitoring plus tailored case management follow up.

      A child's participation will involve 3 months of treatment consisting of medication and
      psychological, behavioural, and academic interventions tailored to their individual needs.

      Following this treatment, the child will be randomly assigned to receive two years of either
      community follow up or medication monitoring plus tailored case management follow up
      delivered by the study team. During both types of follow up, at 6 month intervals, the parent
      and child will be asked to complete interviews with our study personnel and comprehensive
      assessments pertaining to ADHD symptoms and various other areas of functioning.

      Parents will also be asked to obtain information from the child's teacher regarding the
      child's functioning at 6 month intervals during the school year.

    <description>All children entered into this study will be prescribed medication for their ADHD symptoms (usually a long-acting stimulant). Based on the individual needs of the child and family, they could receive the following interventions - Academic and organization skills, social skills training and parent training. Participants randomized to this group will meet with the study clinicians 4 times a year for medication monitoring and adjustment. This group will also receive a monthly call from a case manager who will explore the child's academic, social and emotional functioning. Depending on the needs of the child and family, the case manager may offer 1 to 5 intervention sessions with the child (e.g. social skills, anger management), the family (e.g. family counselling), and the school (e.g. consultation with the teacher).</description>

    <description>The Parent Training Program: The parent training program is designed to increase parental understanding of ADHD; establish attentive, positive interactions, and solve problems collaboratively. Eight weekly group sessions lasting about 2 hours each will be conducted by trained psychologists, social workers, or clinical nurses. Homework assignments and detailed summary sheets will be used to promote technique acquisition and generalization.</description>

    <description>Social Skills and Anger Management Training: The social skills training program is based on understanding yourself and others, and being able to understand things from the other's perspective. The program uses direct instruction, modelling, behavioural rehearsal, feedback, and social reinforcement. The following are covered: joining in, understanding emotions, dealing with anger, using self-control, responding to teasing / bullying, and staying out of fights.</description>

    <description>The medication prescribed is usually a long-acting stimulant that is carefully titrated to the child's optimal dose (normally that dose above which further improvement is not seen and side effects are manageable). Once optimal dose is reached, children are followed at regular once per three month visits for medication monitoring. In this group the child can be referred for a medication reevaluation and adjustment as many times as is needed.</description>
