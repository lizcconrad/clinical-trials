      This study (Protocol No. E6011-J081-002) is a single-center, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) study to evaluate mainly the safety and
      tolerability of a single subcutaneous administration of E6011. A total of 32 subjects will be
      randomized into four cohorts (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg groups). Of eight subjects per cohort,
      six subjects will receive the single subcutaneous E6011 administration and two subjects will
      receive the single subcutaneous placebo administration.

      This study consists of Screening Period, Observation Period, In-patient Period, and Follow-up
      Period. Screening assessments will be performed within 28 to 2 days before starting the study
      treatment, and Observation Period assessments will be performed on a day before starting the
      study treatment to confirm the eligibility of study subjects. The eligible subjects will be
      randomized into either E6011 arm or placebo arm using the drug allocation list prepared by
      the random code statistician. Each subjects dosing interval will be at least a 30-minutes.
