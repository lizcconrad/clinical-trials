  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients presenting with Type A and Type B1, B2 thoracolumbar fractures, there is a lack
      of evidence demonstrating similar outcomes between patients treated with percutaneous pedicle
      screws and those treated openly. It has been demonstrated that percutaneous pedicle screw
      fixation has fared well for patients in the short term; however, it is unclear whether the
      outcomes are equivalent or inferior/superior compared to open treatment.

      The authors seek to establish a high-level evidence base to determine clinical patient
      outcomes, radiographic outcomes, as well as cost-effectiveness data in comparing
      thoracolumbar burst fracture patients treated with percutaneous pedicle screws, open
      treatment, and brace treatment. Additionally, the authors seek to establish data relating to
      patient occupational data, complications, and need for further surgery (revision/removal of
      hardware), as well as short-term variables relating to hospital visit (length of stay,
      estimated blood loss, time under fluoroscopy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients from ages 18 and older who present to Allegheny General Hospital with an
             acute thoracolumbar fracture will be considered eligible for the study (i.e. &lt;3 weeks
             from trauma date).

          -  Minor fractures around the fracture site or compression fractures will be permitted if
             they do not require treatment

             100 mile radius from the greater Pittsburgh area for consent and follow-up purposes

          -  Patients who cannot safely undergo brace treatment due to comorbidities such as
             obesity, pulmonary injury, elderly status, reliability, and multitrauma

          -  Patients must have Type A or Type B1,B2 thoracolumbar fracture (must be able to
