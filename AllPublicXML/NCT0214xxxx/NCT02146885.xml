  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first step in any clinical intervention against obesity involves sustained lifestyle
      changes. Researcher can use these strategies to beneficial the effects of weight and on
      cardiovascular risk. The researcher develope methods for assessing the effectiveness use
      optical technology to make such assessments, specifically in the area of fatty tissue can
      predict the effectiveness of the intervention in causing weight reduction and treating
      metabolic disease.

      Optical technologies under development at the Beckman Laser Institute.

      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging is a method for studying absorption and scattering
      (optical properties) of tissue in humans. It is related to near-infrared spectroscopy , but
      allows for more quantitative and thorough measurements. The researcher use Diffuse Optical
      Spectroscopy to measure fatty tissue, water, blood concentration level during weight loss
      program to determine the effect of sustained changes in weight or relapses.
