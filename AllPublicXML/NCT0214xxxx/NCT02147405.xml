      Background:

      - Sometimes people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can have new or worsening symptoms
      soon after starting HIV medications. Often these symptoms are caused by immune reconstitution
      inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Researchers want to study why and how people develop IRIS and
      how best to prevent and treat it.

      Objectives:

      - To learn the causes and effects of IRIS,and how to best manage it.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 and older with HIV and low CD4 counts,, about to start HIV medicines; or those
      already taking HIV medicines with symptoms thought to be related to IRIS.

      Design:

        -  Participants not on ART will have screening blood tests for CD4 count, HIV viral load
           and genetic testing.

        -  After the screening blood tests and before starting HIV medicines., participants will
           return for more than 1 visit for the following:

      &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;- review of medical history&lt;TAB&gt;

      &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;- physical and eye exams

      &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;- blood, urine, and tuberculosis (TB) tests

      &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;- electrocardiogram (EKG)

      &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;- chest x-ray

        -  apheresis: a blood drawing procedure where blood is removed from a vein, white blood
           cells are separated and collected, and the rest of the blood is returned to the person
           using another vein

        -  - PET scan - a procedure where a small amount of radioactive material is injected in a
           vein. The participant then lies on a table that slides into a scanner which takes images
           of the body.

      &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;- lymph node biopsy

      &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;- stool collection by swab

        -  After completion of the above, HIV medicines will be started.

        -  Follow-up visits will be at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after starting ART, then every 12
           weeks. Some of the tests above may be repeated.

        -  Participants already on HIV medicines who may have IRIS will be screened over a 4 week
           time period to see if they really are experiencing IRIS. The screening process will
           include all of the items listed above. Follow-up visits will be at Weeks, 4, 8, 12 and
           then every 12 weeks.

        -  The study will last 1 year for both groups but may be extended to 2 years (3 additional
           appointments) for some participants.

      Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV infection represents a paradoxical,
      frequently inflammatory, immune response after initiation of antiretroviral (ART) therapy.
      The immunopathogenesis of IRIS remains elusive partially due to a lack of tissue sampling and
      a lack of detailed screening, including imaging, for subclinical opportunistic infections in
      many studies. Most pathogenesis studies to date have been performed in peripheral blood with
      a few notable exceptions of cryptococcal IRIS studies in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      samples were obtained and evaluated.

      This is a 2-arm natural history study intended to evaluate the incidence, predictors and
      pathogenic mechanisms of IRIS in HIV-1 infected adults (age &gt;18 years). A ART Naive arm will
      enroll 100 patients who are ART-naive with CD4+ T cell counts &lt;100 cells/mm(3). These
      participants will initiate ART according to the clinical standard of care. Any opportunistic
      infections (OIs) or AIDS-defining illnesses identified prior to, during screening or at any
      point during the study, will also be treated according to standard of care. The IRIS arm will
      enroll 20 participants who are ART-treated and meet criteria suspicious for IRIS (Appendix
      D), with any CD4+ T cell count. The ART Naive arm will be followed for 48 weeks, with an
      optional extension up to week 96. The IRIS arm will be followed for 48 weeks after enrollment
      if the IRIS event is confirmed, also with an optional extension up to week 96. In both arms,
      subjects must have adequate venous access and will undergo collection of whole blood by
      phlebotomy, leukapheresis, lymph node biopsy, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
      tomography (FDG-PET/CT) at designated study visits.

             weeks.

             study requirements and give informed consent.

          7. Willingness to allow storage of blood or tissue samples for future research

          8. Willingness at time of screening to undergo study procedures (phlebotomy, apheresis,
             optional FDG-PET/CT and lymph node biopsy*)

         10. Participants should have a primary care physician or will need to agree to have one
             established by 24 weeks on study.

               -  In the event of an estimated reversible inability to consent, patients may enroll
                  via a legally authorized representative (DPA) if they have the ability to assign
                  a DPA. For these participants, baseline lymph node biopsy will not be performed
                  however the week 4-8 lymph node biopsy may be performed if the participant
                  regains the capacity to consent prior to that time.

        IRIS ARM INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Documentation of HIV-1 infection. Results from outside facilities will be accepted for
             enrollment.

          2. Meet criteria suspicious for IRIS (Must meet 4/5 following criteria):

             I. Initiation (reintroduction or change) in antiretroviral therapy/regimen

             II. Evidence of:

               1. an increase in CD4+ cell count defined as greater than or equal to 50cell/mm(3)
                  or a greater than or equal to 2 fold rise in CD4+ cell count, and/or

             III. Symptoms and/or signs consistent with an infectious/inflammatory condition.

             IV. Theses symptoms and/or signs cannot be explained by a newly acquired infection,
             the expected clinical course of a previously recognized infectious agent, or the side
             effects of antiretroviral therapy itself.

             V. The infectious/inflammatory condition must be attributable to a specific pathogen
             or condition.

             *Criteria IV or V may not be met for suspected IRIS definition.

          3. Residence within the wider Washington D.C. area (within a 100-mile radius from the NIH
             Bethesda campus). **Participants from outside of the 100 mile radius may be enrolled

          9. Participants should have a primary care physician who will initiate the referral.

               -  In the event of an estimated reversible inability to consent, patients may enroll
                  using a legally authorized representative (DPA) if they have the ability to
                  assign a DPA. lymph node biopsy will not be performed in these occasions.

        SUBJECT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

          2. Pregnancy will be an exclusion criterion for study entry given the intense nature of
             the protocol regarding blood draws, apheresis, biopsies and FDG-PET/CT imaging.

          3. Inadequate venous access for phlebotomy and apheresis procedures as assessed by the
             study team.

          4. Women who are breastfeeding.
