  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metastatic lesions may be very different from the primary tumor because of intrinsic
      tumor heterogenity, clonal selection through metastatic process and following previous
      cytotoxic treatments. Metastatic tumor harboring actionable targets or signaling pathways may
      respond to inhibitory agents directed against specific aberrations irrespective of tumor
      origin. In the MetAction study, patients will receive therapy based on molecular aberrations
      in the metastatic lesions, actionable target identification (ATI), rather than on
      histological tumor type.

      The ATI rate in an unselected metastatic patient population is uncertain, and response rates
      associated with ATI based targeted therapy have hardly been reported. In this perspective,
      The MetAction study is essentially a feasibility study aiming to tailor metastatic cancer
      therapy based on genomic profiles.

      Recognizing the rapidly increasing number of drugs targeting specific molecular aberrations
      in cancer, it is necessary to define rational strategies to make such treatment available to
      Norwegian cancer patients.These targeted drugs are extremely costly and have significant side
      effects, although presumably to a lesser extent than many of the classic cytotoxic drugs
      available. Thus, in the interest of the patient in question and the society in general, it is
      important to give the right drug to the right patient and to the presumably right time in the
      disease course.

      Hitherto, most of the drugs in question are given in the palliative setting, i.e. to patients
      with disseminated metastatic disease. The metastatic lesion may be very different from the
      primary tumor, and hence, it is rational to analyze the tumor to be treated, the metastatic
      lesion(s), for the presence of molecular aberrations, rather than basing treatment decisions
      on molecular features known to be present in a particular tumor type or in the primary tumor.
