    <textblock>
      This is a treatment guideline for HLA-Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) using a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. This regimen, consisting of
      fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and low dose total body irradiation (TBI), is designed for the
      treatment of patients with advanced and/or high risk diseases.

               -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), marginal zone
                  B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, which have progressed within 12 months of
                  achieving a partial or complete remission.

               -  Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, mantle-cell lymphoma, prolymphocytic leukemia are
                  eligible after initial therapy if chemotherapy sensitive.

               -  Refractory leukemia or MDS These patients may be taken to transplant in aplasia
                  after induction or re-induction chemotherapy or radiolabeled antibody.

               -  Bone marrow failure syndromes, except for Fanconi Anemia

               -  Myeloproliferative syndromes

          -  Adequate organ function is defined as:

               -  Cardiac: Absence of decompensated congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled
                  arrhythmia and left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 35%. For children that are
                  not able to cooperate with MUGA and echocardiography, such should be clearly
                  stated in the physician's note

               -  Pulmonary: DLCO &gt; 30% predicted, and absence of O2 requirements. For children
                  that are not able to cooperate with PFTs, a pulse oximetry with exercise should
                  be attempted. If nether test can be obtained it should be clearly stated in the
                  physician's note.

               -  Liver: Transaminases &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal and bilirubin &lt; 3 x upper limit
                  of normal

          -  If recent mold infection e.g. Aspergillus - must have minimum of 30 days of
             appropriate treatment before BMT and infection controlled and be cleared by Infectious
             Disease.

          -  Second BMT: Must be &gt; 3 months after prior myeloablative transplant.

          -  Patients must be ineligible for autologous transplantation due to prior autologous
             transplant, an inadequate autologous stem cell harvest, inability to withstand a
             myeloablative preparative regimen, or clinically aggressive/high risk disease.

          -  Patients are eligible for transplantation if there is no evidence of progressive
             disease by imaging modalities or biopsy. Persistent PET activity, though possibly
             related to lymphoma, is not an exclusion criterion in the absence of CT changes
             indicating progression.

          -  Patients with stable disease are eligible for transplantation if the largest residual
             nodal mass is &lt; 5 cm (approximately). For patients who have responded to preceding
             therapy, the largest residual mass must represent a 50% reduction and be &lt; 7.5 cm
             (approximately).

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Evidence of HIV infection or known HIV positive serology

          -  Current active serious infection

          -  Unless in post-chemotherapy and radioimmunoconjugated antibody induced aplasia, when
             he/she would be eligible, patients with acute leukemia in morphologic relapse/
             persistent disease defined as &gt; 5% blasts in normocellular bone marrow OR any % blasts
             if blasts have unique morphologic markers (e.g. Auer rods) or associated cytogenetic
             markers that allows morphologic relapse to be distinguished are not eligible.

          -  CML in refractory blast crisis

          -  Large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease that is progressive on
             salvage therapy. Stable disease is acceptable to move forward provided it is
             non-bulky.
