      Evaluate the clinical performance of existing wearers of hydrogel toric lenses when refitted
      with Avaira toric silicone hydrogel contact lenses over 1 week of wear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 60-subject, single masked, bilateral, parallel study design comparing the fitting
      characteristics of enfilcon A toric lenses against the subjects habitual hydrogel toric
      lenses (omafilcon A, ocufilcon D or methafilcon B wearers). Subject's habitual toric lenses
      will be evaluated at the first visit and then re-fitted with a pair of Avaira toric lenses.
      After 1 week of daily wear, subjects will return for a second and final evaluation.
