      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in reducing incidence
      of graft-versus-host disease in patients who have undergone donor stem cell transplant.
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG may be effective at preventing for graft-versus-host disease
      caused by a donor stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients treated with a
      probiotic (Lactobacillus GG [Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG])-containing diet compared to those
      not assigned to receive probiotic have a lower incidence of grade 1 upper gastrointestinal
      (GI) or grade 2-4 lower GI acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (aGVHD) using Center for
      International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) scoring than those not prescribed
      a probiotic.

      II. To determine if HSCT patients treated with a probiotic-containing diet compared to those
      not assigned to receive a probiotic have a: a) lower rate of organ-specific acute aGVHD
      (intestinal tract, skin, liver); b) lower rate of moderate or severe chronic GVHD (National
      Institutes of Health [NIH] consensus scoring) at 6 months and 1 year post transplant; c)
      shorter duration of immunosuppressive therapy (normalized for age and degree of human
      leukocyte antigen [HLA] match); d) lower rate of bacterial and/or opportunistic infection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell patients treated with a probiotic
      compared to those not assigned to receive a probiotic have differences in: a) composition and
      proportion of the major gut bacterial phylotypes in stool (to be analyzed for changes pre-
      and post-initiation of probiotics and for association with development of aGVHD); b) measures
      of inflammation as assessed by cytokine or receptor production (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8,
      tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, TNF-receptor 1, interferon-gamma, IL-2R, IL-10); c)
      qualitative measures of immune reconstitution as determined by sequential measurements of
      conventional T cells, regulatory T regulatory, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells; d)
      antibody class/subclass production; e) biomarkers associated with GVHD-elafin, regenerating
      islet-derived 3 alpha (Reg3a), suppressor of tumorigenicity-2 (ST2), hepatocyte growth factor
      (HGF); and/or urinary tryptophan metabolites; f) markers of gut barrier function including
      blood levels of endotoxin and microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 1 year.

      ARM II: Patients receive no intervention.
