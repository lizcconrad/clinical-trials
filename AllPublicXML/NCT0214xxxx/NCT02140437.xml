  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is designed to investigate whether the addition of fulvestrant 500mg to
      anastrozole is better than anastrozole alone as first-line endocrine therapy for advanced
      breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anastrozole is the standard first-line endocrine treatment for patients with hormonal
      receptor positive advanced breast cancer. It has been proven that the addition of fulvestrant
      250mg can enhance PFS of anastrozole monotherapy according to SWOG0226 study. However, the
      optimal recommended dose of fulvestrant for patients with advanced breast cancer is 500mg
      worldwide according to CONFIRM study. The investigator designed this research to investigate
      whether high dose fulvestrant can further improve efficacy of anastrozole monotherapy.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent

          2. Histologically confirmed breast cancer

          3. Luminal A-like breast cancer (primary or metastatic tumor), defined as: ER-positive,
             PR-positive (&gt; 20%), Her-2 negative and Ki67 &lt;14%.

          4. Advanced breast cancer is eligible:

               -  Endocrine therapy-naive patients with locally advanced disease, who are not
                  suitable for radical surgery or radiotherapy (the decision made by the
                  multidisciplinary breast cancer team). Prior first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy is
                  acceptable. or

               -  Patients with recurrent or metastatic disease, who have not received adjuvant
                  endocrine therapy or who have been 2 years or longer after stop of adjuvant
                  endocrine therapy. Patients who had disease progression from first-line cytotoxic
                  chemotherapy are allowed.

          5. At least one lesion (measurable and / or non-measurable) can be assessed at baseline,
             and is suitable for repeated assessments with CT and/or MRI.

          6. Postmenopausal women, defined as any one of the following criteria (as defined in the
             NCCN's menopause definition):

               -  previous bilateral oophorectomy

                  chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and
                  follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol in the postmenopausal range.

               -  If taking tamoxifen, or toremifene and age &lt; 60, then FSH and E in the
                  postmenopausal range

          7. ECOG 0, 1 or 2.

          8. Patients with good compliance.

             ULRR (with liver metastases).
