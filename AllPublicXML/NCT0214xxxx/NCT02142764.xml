    <textblock>
      Most experts in the field consider Multiple Sclerosis as the main auto immune disease of the
      central nervous system. In spite of many works, the data in the literature concerning the
      antigens targeted by the CD8+ T-Cell response are still contradictory and insufficient.

      30 patients distributed in 3 groups of 10 patients with specific inclusion criteria will
      participate in this trial:

        -  10 MS patients in early disease onset,

        -  10 MS patients under Natalizumab treatment

        -  and control group of 10 patients with other neurological diseases.

      The aim of this clinical trial is to detect the CD8+ myelin specific T-Cells in the blood of
      Multiple Sclerosis patients.
