  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, prospective, multi-center, open-label study to assess the effectiveness
      and safety profile of epoetin beta (Recormon®) for treatment of symptomatic anemia in adult
      participants associated with low/intermediate-1-risk MDS. After screening, eligible
      participants will be treated with epoetin beta as recommended in the approved label and
      international guidelines for the use of epoetin in MDS participants and the dosage will be
      adjusted on the basis of erythroid response.

    <description>Participants will receive epoetin beta at an initial dose of 30,000 International Units (IU) per week administered subcutaneously (SC). Response will be firstly evaluated at Week 4 and the subsequent dose will be based on the response: if hemoglobin level reaches greater than or equal to (&gt;/=)12 grams per deciliter (g/dL) at any time, epoetin beta will be discontinued until hemoglobin levels are less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 10 g/dL; if the hemoglobin level increases less than (&lt;) 1 g/dL from screening level and hemoglobin level ˂12 g/dL, a 60,000 IU per week epoetin beta will be administered SC until Week 12; if the hemoglobin level increases &gt;/=1 g/dL from screening level and hemoglobin level ˂12 g/dL, a 30,000 IU per week epoetin beta will be continued until Week 12.</description>
