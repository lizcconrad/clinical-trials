  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
      harbor rearrangements of the MLL gene, which are detected either by cytogenetic or
      fluorescent in situ hybridization evaluation at the time of diagnosis. A protein called DOT1L
      plays an important role in the malignant process in these leukemias. EPZ-5676 is a molecule
      that blocks the activity of DOT1L, and is therefore being evaluated in the treatment of
      patients with MLL-rearranged leukemias.

      This is a Phase 1b study of EPZ-5676 in pediatric patients. The study will have two phases.
      The first phase will assess escalating doses of EPZ-5676 in order to determine the maximally
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EPZ-5676 as a 28-day continuous IV
      infusion. Once the MTD and/or RP2D is established, a second phase of the study will further
      evaluate the safety of EPZ-5676 and assess the anti-leukemia activity.
