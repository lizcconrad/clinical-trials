  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroimaging is becoming increasingly common to investigate the neural networks underlying
      eating behaviour and food preference in normal-weight and obese humans. It has been observed
      that obese in comparison to lean individuals display altered activation patterns in networks
      of brain areas involved in reward, emotion and cognitive control. Interestingly, obese
      individuals who are capable of losing weight appear to have a stronger connectivity between
      areas related to food value and to the control of eating behaviour. The same areas are also
      associated with healthy food choices. It has been suggested that activation in the prefrontal
      control areas indirectly modulate valuation-related activity. Based on this, brain-related
      intervention strategies to support weight loss and long-lasting weight maintenance are of
      particular interest. Hence, we first want to examine the effect on eating behaviour of
      neurofeedback training-induced up-regulation of functional connectivity between reward- and
      impulse-related brain areas as a pilot, and second we want to examine up-regulation of the
      activity of prefrontal control brain areas.

      Primary objective: We want to investigate whether the training-induced up-regulation of the
      dorsal prefrontal cortex inhibits eating behaviour.

      Study design: A parallel design. Half of the participants will learn to up-regulate activity
      of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), while the other participants will participate
      in sham-training sessions. Adherence to experimental conditions will be assigned randomly,
      based on the participants' enrolment in the study, balanced by gender and binge eating
      classification.

      Study population: 50 overweight and obese (BMI 25-40 kg/m2), but otherwise healthy
      individuals, 18-65 years old.

      Intervention: All participants will participate in a screening day, followed by one
      neurofeedback session day and a follow-up day. During the neurofeedback session, participants
      will undergo a 45 min real-time-fMRI-brain-computer-interface scan in order to learn to
      up-regulate dlPFC activation.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

        1. The ability to up-regulate dlPFC activity.

        2. Respective effects on eating behaviour. Nature and extent of the burden and risks
           associated with participation: Participants will be scanned once (fMRI). Functional MRI
           is a safe and non-invasive technique.

    <description>Networks involved in eating behaviour can be modified by neurofeedback training. We will perform a neurofeedback task using the technology of fMRI-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). BCI approaches based on real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) allow voluntary regulation of brain regions. For the rtfMRI, a well-established setup will be used which translates the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of a specific brain region of interest into a visual signal (e.g. moving bar) in real time using brain voyager® and matlab. The study will include 1 training-sessions In the up-regulation condition subjects will learn to up regulate their dlPFC. In the sham-condition subjects are get the same instructions, however they will receive sham feedback.</description>
