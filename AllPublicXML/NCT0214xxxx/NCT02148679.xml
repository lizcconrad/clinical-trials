  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three center, randomized, single-blind, attention controlled trial of 12 weeks
      total duration designed to determine the safety and efficacy of home-delivered
      sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD)-compliant meals in older
      adults (age &gt;= 65 years) following discharge from a hospital admission for acutely
      decompensated heart failure. 66 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 stratified fashion by
      gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (&lt; vs. ≥ 50%).

      107 subjects yielded 66 randomized subjects.

      Study subjects will receive either pre-prepared, home-delivered DASH/SRD-compliant meals or
      attention control for 4 weeks after hospital discharge. The three study sites will be
      Columbia University Medical Center, the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Health System, and the
      University of Michigan Health System. Investigators will be blinded to group assignment, food
      diaries, and urinary electrolyte measurements until the completion of the study

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) summary scores for health-related QOL in patients with chronic HF</measure>
    <time_frame>from study enrollment to 4 weeks post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The KCCQ, a self-administered 23-item instrument, assesses physical limitations, symptoms, self-efficacy, social interference, and overall QOL in HF patients. The KCCQ summary score ranges from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better QOL. The KCCQ summary score independently predicts clinical outcomes such as hospitalization and mortality in outpatients with HF, including those recently hospitalized for acute decompensation. It is a reliable and valid measure in HF patients that is more sensitive to change than other measures of QOL, and is especially responsive in patients with multiple comorbidities. A change in KCCQ score of 5 points is clinically significant and correlates with changes in clinical status, physical function, and outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety Monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week post discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Renal function and electrolytes will be assessed at baseline and 1 week post-discharge during a safety visit, in which vital signs and targeted physical examination for volume status will allow adjustment of diuretics as clinically indicated. The dietary intervention will be stopped in any patient who develops new or worsened renal impairment as defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of ≥50%, hyperkalemia (K &gt;5.7 mmol/L), syncope, or other serious adverse event deemed by the investigators to be related to study participation (note participants are inherently at high risk for rehospitalization or mortality, ~20-25% over the 4-week intervention period of the study, ~30-35% over the total 12-week term of the study). Patients randomized to food delivery will have study food intake suspended if hospitalized and resumed at discharge if no safety concerns as defined above.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary Endpoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary endpoints will include DASH/SRD adherence as measured by 3-day food diary and urinary electrolyte measures (24-hour urinary sodium and potassium). Food frequency questionnaire to establish baseline dietary intake will be obtained at baseline and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanism-related endpoints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanism-related endpoints will include changes from baseline to 4 weeks in clinic and 24-hour blood pressure, noninvasive measures of ventricular function and ventricular-arterial coupling, blood/urine measures of neurohormonal activation, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation, blood volume measurements (subset n=20), and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA profiling (subset n=20)</description>
