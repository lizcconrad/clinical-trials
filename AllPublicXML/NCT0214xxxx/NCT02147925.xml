    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of liraglutide combined with metformin
      in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared
      to sitagliptin and insulin glargine in combination with metformin.

      This is a 26-week, randomized, open-label, active controlled, parallel group, multi-centre
      trial.To compare the change of intrahepatic lipids (IHL) as measured by magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy(MRS) or MRI estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) as measured by MRI
      IDEAL IQ (Iterative Decomposition of water andfat with Echo Asymmetryand Least-squares
      estimation) in type 2 diabetic patients with non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease after a
      26-week treatment of liraglutide, sitagliptin or insulin glargine per day combined with
      metformin.The primary endpoint will be defined by intrahepatic lipids (IHL) as measured by
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or MRI-PDFF as measured by MRI IDEAL IQ.
