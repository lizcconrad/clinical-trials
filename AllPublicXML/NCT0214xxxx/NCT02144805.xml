      Objective: To compare short-term and long-term effects on myometrial thickness in women
      sutured by single- or double-layer technique by closure of cesarean uterine incision. The
      study is a randomized clinically controlled study.

      Design:Follow-up by ultra sound of a randomised controlled trial. Surgical technique was
      blinded for the investigator.

      Setting: An obstetric department in a tertiary referral hospital, 2008-2013. Participants:
      Healthy nulliparous scheduled for elective caesarean section randomly assigned to closure of
      the uterine incision by single- or double layer techniques.

      Intervention: A modified version of the Misgav-Ladach surgical technique was used. The women
      were examined by abdominal ultra sound before discharge from the maternity ward, and by
      vaginal ultra sound and hysterosonography minimum five month post partum.

      Main outcome measure: Thickness of the remaining myometrium corresponding to the former
      cesarean uterine incision measured by ultra sound.
