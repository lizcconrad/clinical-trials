  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 1-2 study is to explore the applicability of supplementing standard
      methotrexate/6-mercaptopurine (MTX/6MP) maintenance therapy of children with non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma with 6-thioguanine (6TG).

      The investigators hypothesize that addition of 6TG to 6MP-based maintenance therapy of
      patients with high TPMT activity will mimic the more favourable thiopurine metabolism of
      patients with low TPMT activity and ultimately reduce relapse rates.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MTX/6MP maintenance therapy is challenged by treatment related liver toxicity, failure to
      achieve the target treatment parameter in all patients, and lack of direct parameters for
      monitoring treatment efficacy or even intensity. Patients with low activity of thiopurine
      methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of 6MP, have lower levels of
      liver toxic metabolites (MeMPs), higher levels of the major active metabolites (TGNs), and
      reduced relapse rates. Most patients (90%) have high TPMT activity. Nearly all patients with
      high TPMT activity and high MeMP levels experience elevated liver enzymes. Increasing the 6MP
      dose in patients with high TPMT activity, to intensify therapy, will mainly lead to further
      increase in the MeMP level. A novel approach compensating the adverse thiopurine metabolism
      of the majority of patients is warranted.

    <description>This is the only treatment arm; all eligible patients will receive standard methotrexate/6-mercaptopurine (6MP/MTX) maintenance therapy supplemented with 6-thioguanine (6TG).
Patients are enrolled when they have 12 to 3.5 months remaining of their maintenance therapy. After dose reduction in 6MP to 2/3 of the current dose 6TG therapy is initiated with a starting dose of 2.5 mg/m2/day. The 6TG dose will hereafter be increased at 2.5 mg/m2/day every 14 days until a max. of 12.5 mg/m2/day is reached or until the thiopurine metabolite profile (Ery-TGN/Ery-MeMP) has been increased by at least a factor 5.</description>

    <description>All eligible patients will be supplemented with 6-thioguanine in addition to the standard therapy with 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate.
In case of significant myelo-/hepatotoxicity all therapy will be paused. If patients develop VOD they will be excluded from further 6TG therapy.</description>
