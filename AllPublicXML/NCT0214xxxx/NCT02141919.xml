      The goal of this phase II clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the completely
      non-invasive treatment option of stereotactic radiation therapy for the treatment of biopsy
      proven and growing small renal tumors.

    <textblock>
      Current treatment options for primary renal cancer include surgery or ablative techniques—all
      are invasive or minimally invasive options. The completely noninvasive treatment option of
      stereotactic radiation therapy (SABR), which has become standard of care in many cancer
      sites, has not been explored for primary renal cancer. With multiple technological advances,
      it is now feasible to safely treat a moving intra-abdominal tumor such as that in a kidney.
      This proposed clinical trial evaluates the efficacy of SABR in treating patients with early
      renal cancers. Growing renal masses will first be biopsied to confirm the diagnosis of renal
      cancer. Patients will then undergo treatment with SABR of 3-5 fractions completing within
      three weeks. Treatment response will be evaluated using sequential MRI scans and a second
      tumor biopsy one year after treatment. Monitoring of treatment toxicity and kidney function
      will also be performed.
