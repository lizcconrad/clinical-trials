  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EndoChoice's FUSE System enables a wider view range via 1-2 additional cameras (depending on
      the model). These optical properties are to be examined and reviewed in this trial (mainly
      usability and safety)

      EndoChoice Full Spectrum Optical Technology (FSOT) in gastrointestinal endoscopy enables a
      330 degree field of view. FSOT powers EndoChoice's FDA, CE and AMAR (Israeli medical device
      authority) approved Endoscopic systems (Gastroscope and Colonoscope). The intent of this
      study is to evaluate the safety, performance and usability of additional versions of FSOT-
      powered gastroscopes and colonoscopes.
