  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a complex and multifactorial disease representing a major public health challenge.
      Indeed, overweight and obese people carry a major risk of developing insulin resistance and
      type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has been demonstrated that polyphenols could be used to
      counteract some of the mechanisms involved in the generation of insulin resistance. The model
      of overfeeding represents a very good study model of the metabolic complications of obesity,
      since it has been shown to induce a transient state of insulin resistance in the human.

      The purpose of this research is to study the effects of a overfeeding (+50% of daily caloric
      needs over 31 days) with or without polyphenols supplementation (2g/days over 31 days) on
      insulin sensitivity measured in the setting of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and on
      post prandial partitioning of exogenous lipids after a test meal.

      During 31 days, the volunteers will consume chocolate bars, chips, chocolate breads and cola
      in addition to their usual diet and will be supplemented with 2g of grape polyphenols extract
      or with placebo.
