    <textblock>
      This study aims to prove that at a dose of 1 mg Haloperidol possesses a high success rate in
      controlling established postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the first 24 hours
      following administration similar to the standard of care ondansetron 4 mg.

      Patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia may experience several complications in
      their postoperative period. Nausea and vomiting are some of the more common of these
      complications. Several medications can be used for prevention of these specific
      complications, but treatment remains more cost-efficient.

      Haloperidol is anti-psychotic which, at low doses, can prevent the occurrence of nausea and
      vomiting. Its usefulness for prophylaxis has been demonstrated in several studies. However,
      its use for treating established postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) has not been
      properly studied.

      In a prospective randomized clinical trial involving adult patients undergoing elective
      surgery under general anesthesia, investigators will enroll 120 patients, and compare the
      effect of a dose of 1 mg Haloperidol versus Ondansetron 4 mg and document the varying degrees
      of success in treating nausea and vomiting as well as possible side effects.

      Investigators expect to observe that Haloperidol is as effective as treatment with
      Ondansetron.
