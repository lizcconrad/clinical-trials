  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keeping individuals with knee osteoarthritis physically active is critically important.
      Exercise is effective at reducing pain while improving physical function. However some
      exercises can overload the knee, and as a result, worsen knee pain and health of the knee
      joint. Yoga offers a foundation of static postures that improve muscle strength and joint
      flexibility. Using sophisticated technology that allows us to calculate the loads inside the
      knee, the investigators have selected yoga exercises that do not overload the knee joint. The
      investigators have designed a yoga exercise class that is ideal for people with knee
      osteoarthritis. The purpose of the study is to investigate whether these yoga exercises
      increase muscle strength and reduce knee pain in women with knee osteoarthritis. In addition,
      the investigators aim to show that these yoga exercises will also improve knee loads during
      activities, mobility and heart health. The investigators will ask 50 women with knee
      osteoarthritis to participate in a 12 week yoga exercise intervention, that requires
      attendance to 3 classes each week. The investigators will test strength of the leg muscles,
      pain, knee joint loads, mobility and cardiovascular health before and after the 12 week yoga
      exercise intervention.

      This study is an uncontrolled intervention study with repeated measures. The intervention is
      a 12-week supervised exercise class featuring biomechanically sound exercises for people with
      knee osteoarthritis. Measures of strength of the knee muscles, pain, biomechanics during
      walking and yoga, mobility and cardiovascular health will be included. Strength will be
      measured on a dynamometer. Pain will be assessed with questionnaires. Walking and three yoga
      postures will be observed using motion capture system integrated with force measurements from
      the floor. Mobility will be assessed during walking, stair-climbing and chair standing tasks.
      Cardiovascular health will be measured during a submaximal bicycle task.

        <description>Participants will be asked to partake in a complete kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic analysis of gait and static postures using floor-embedded force plates, a 9-camera motion capture system, and a wireless electromyography system. Knee adduction moment (KAM; Nm/kg), normalized electromyography to a percentage of their maximal effort (%MVIC), and muscular co-activation (%) are the variables of interest.</description>
