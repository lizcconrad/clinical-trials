    <textblock>
      We are proposing to conduct a randomized, controlled trial of newborns in the maternal infant
      care areas at Tampa General Hospital. Participants who are determined eligible for the study
      (classified to have ankyloglossia via the HATLFF and either a Class III or IV maxillary
      labial frenum) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A or Group B. Group A
      will receive a sham procedure for intervention #1 and a lingual frenotomy procedure for
      intervention #2. Group B will receive a lingual frenotomy procedure for intervention #1 and a
      sham procedure for intervention #2. Newborns that continue to have difficulty with
      breastfeeding after both interventions will undergo intervention #3, a labial frenotomy, and
      breastfeeding will be monitored afterwards.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized control studies which aims to contribute data to a previous study
      on the effects of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) on breastfeeding, and to also provide new
      information on the effects of maxillary lip-tie on breastfeeding. Participants who are
      determined eligible for the study (classified to have ankyloglossia via the HATLFF and either
      a Class III or IV maxillary labial frenum) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:
      Group A or Group B. Group A will receive a sham procedure for intervention #1 and a lingual
      frenotomy procedure for intervention #2. Group B will receive a lingual frenotomy procedure
      for intervention #1 and a sham procedure for intervention #2. Newborns that continue to have
      difficulty with breastfeeding after both interventions will undergo intervention #3, a labial
      frenotomy, and breastfeeding will be monitored afterwards. These results will be analyzed to
      determine when lingual frenotomies, labial frenotomies, or both are necessary to improve
      breastfeeding pain and LATCH scores.

      The study aims to prove that the simple and low risk frenotomy procedure should be considered
      as treatment for both ankyloglossia and maxillary lip-tie, preventing breastfeeding
      complications as well as many other future problems such as with speech and self esteem. It
      is hypothesized that the use of frenotomies as treatment for ankyloglossia and maxillary
      lip-tie will improve breastfeeding success for breastfeeding couplets with newborns with both
      ankyloglossia and maxillary lip-tie. It is expected to see an increase in LATCH score to &gt;7
      for breastfeeding sessions and a significant decrease in scoring on the pain scale after
      frenotomy intervention, while it is expected to see little change in LATCH and pain scale
      assessment scores after sham procedures. Overall data is not expected to vary significantly
      between Group A and Group B. It is also hypothesized that a lingual frenotomy alone will be
      sufficient to improve breastfeeding success without the need to also conduct a labial
      frenotomy.

    <description>All participants will receive both the lingual frenotomy and sham procedure. Group A infants will receive lingual frenotomy for intervention #1 and a sham procedure for intervention #2. Newborns that continue to have difficulty with breastfeeding after both interventions will undergo intervention #3, a labial frenotomy.
Lingual frenotomy: tongue will be elevated, expose frenulum with a grooved director or 2 cotton tipped applicators, and then incise frenulum tissue with a straight scissor.
Sham/placebo procedure: infant brought into a procedure room and kept there for as long as the average experimental procedure would take (~5 minutes).
Maxillary labial frenotomy: 0.1 ml of 1% lidocaine will be injected into the area, upper lip lifted, frenum stretched, and a laser, (iLaseTM 940 ± 15 nm) or scissors, will be used to release its attachment to the level of the periosteum.</description>
