  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is increasingly common, especially in countries such as UK and Australia.
      There is currently no accepted routine clinical therapy to cure peanut allergy. Recently
      studies have looked at desensitising people with peanut allergy by giving them small daily
      doses of roasted peanut. Although this therapy works for some people, its effects are not
      generally long lasting and it is associated with many side effects during protocol, resulting
      in a significant rate of drop-outs.

      Pilot data suggests that boiled peanut is less immunogenic than roasted peanut, and may
      therefore provide a safer way of inducing desensitisation in patients who are allergic to
      roasted peanut, by first inducing tolerance to boiled peanut.

      Study hypothesis: Increasing doses of boiled peanut can induce desensitisation to roasted
      peanut, in peanut-allergic individuals.
