    <textblock>
      Postoperative bleeding is a common consequence after heart surgery which can significantly
      impact outcomes and costs . When bleeding occurs, reliable postoperative blood evacuation of
      the pleural, mediastinal and pericardial spaces with chest tubes is imperative to facilitate
      pulmonary reexpansion and mediastinal decompression as the patient recovers. When
      postoperative blood evacuation is inadequate, complications from retained blood can result.
      Clinically, retained blood may be recognized acutely or sub acutely. The acute clinical
      presentation is usually blood and fresh thrombus around the heart or lungs presenting as
      tamponade or hemothorax. The subacute clinical presentation is bloody pleural or pericardial
      effusions. These effusions are often driven by the breakdown of remaining thrombus. Once
      retained blood occurs, subsequent procedures may be needed to remedy it. Interventions to
      remove postoperative pericardial and/or pleural fluid or blood and reoperations due to
      bleeding are captured under a composite termed Retained Blood Syndrome, or RBS. The need for
      treatment and interventions for these conditions represents an impediment to patient recovery
      and involves both resource and economic consumption for a heart program and the healthcare
      system at large.

      A recent review of the literature indicates that additional procedures for RBS are
      demonstrated in approximately 15% to 20% of patients after heart surgery. In a prospectively
      collected US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 2010, RBS could be demonstrated in
      17% of patients. In this analysis, mortality was doubled from 4% to 8%, length of stay was
      increased by 5 days, and average costs were 55% higher. Patients with RBS, therefore,
      represent an increased at-risk population for complications and costs.

      Postoperative obstruction of conventional chest tubes with blood and other fibrinous material
      in the setting of postoperative bleeding contributes to RBS. In a study of postoperative
      cardiac surgery patients at the Cleveland Clinic, 36% of patients were found to have evidence
      of chest tube obstruction. Active Clearance with PleuraFlow has been shown to prevent chest
      tube clogging, and reduce RBS.

      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate the effectiveness of the PleuraFlow System, a
      commercial Class II (US), Class IIb (Canada, Europe, and Australia), in the management of
      blood evacuation after cardiac surgery.

      This is a prospective multicenter observational registry with a retrospective control. The
      registry has two tracks. One track--ALL-ACT-- is for sites enrolling a consecutive cohort of
      all cardiac surgery patients (Track A). The second track--VAD-ACT-- is for sites enrolling
      patients post ventricular assist device (VAD) surgery (Track B). There are two conditions for
      participation in this registry:

      First, sites are required to provide anonymized matched historical data elements from a
      cohort of cardiac surgery patients done over the preceding 12 to 24-month period (Phase 0).
      These retrospective data elements will be used as baseline information for the purpose of
      comparative analyses (control group) with the prospective data sets collected during the
      prospective enrollment phase (treatment group).

      Second, sites are required to participate in a roll-in phase (Phase 1). The purposes of the
      roll-in phase are to allow the users at participating sites to familiarize themselves with
      the use of the product with Active Clearance Technology; to implement clinical use protocols
      provided by ClearFlow, Inc. to all commercial users as part of product training, and; to
      demonstrate consistency and compliance with the clinical use protocols.

      Phase 0 and phase 1 can be executed in parallel. Participating sites may start prospective
      enrollment (Phase 2) after completion of phase 0 and 1.

      Investigators shall report PleuraFlow-related serious injuries to Sponsor as soon as becoming
      aware of the injury and no later than 48 hours.

      Investigators shall report deaths to both the Sponsor and Regulatory authorities in
      compliance with their applicable State, Country and conditions imposed by the reviewing
      Ethical Committee. The three main guidance documents for reporting recall and vigilance
      procedure of medical devices are, 21 CFR, Part 806, MEDDEV 2.12/1 rev8 Guidelines on a
      Medical Devices Vigilance System, and Health Canada Medical Device Regulations SOR/98-282.

      Vanderbilt University will create a REDCap database specific to this study and administer it.
      The Vanderbilt database study administrator will control database access, oversee data entry
      and data transfer from each participating site. Database manager will monitor the REDCap
      database and ensure data completeness and security. The database manager will maintain
      contact will the data entry personnel from each site and ensure whether data capture is
      occurring and determine the number of patients expected to be enrolled in the Registry at the
      end of the study period. Sponsor will not have access to REDCap once the study is complete.
      The REDCap database is secure and HIPAA compliant.

      Descriptive statistics for categorical variables will be reported as percentages, and
      continuous variables will be reported as mean Â± standard deviation (SD). Categorical
      variables will be compared using the chi-square test. Continuous variables will be compared
      using a Student's t-test as appropriate.

      Database study administrator will coordinate the generation of data reports and statistical
      outputs. Sponsor will not have access to REDCap once the study is complete.
