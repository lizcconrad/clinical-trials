  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis has been associated with an increasing risk for atherosclerosis. The investigators
      investigated whether surrogate markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, vascular dysfunction
      and myocardial dysfunction are impaired in patients with psoriasis compared to normal
      controls ,coronary artery disease patients and untreated hypertension subjects. The
      investigators also examined the effect of treatment with biological vs no biological agents
      on vascular and LV function in psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare patients with psoriasis with age and sex matched normal
      controls as well as patients with angiographically documented CAD and patients with untreated
      hypertension (HYP) used as positive control groups

      Patients with psoriasis (PS) will be randomized to receive an anti-tumor necrosis-a (TNF-a)
      ,an anti- interleukin 12/23 regimen or a cyclosporine regimen.

      The anti-TNF-agent, Etanercept will be given at a dose 50mg twice weekly for 12 weeks and
      after then once weekly.

      The anti-IL12/23 regimen, Ustekinumab will be given at a dose 45 mg at the first visit, at 4
      weeks and every 12 weeks if body weight is up to 90 kgr. For body weight &gt;90kgr dose will be
      adjusted accordingly.

      Cyclosporine will be administered at a dose 2.5-3mg/kgr daily.

      At baseline , after 12 weeks and one year of treatment, the investigators will measure:

        1. pulse wave velocity (PWVc) augmentation index (AI) central systolic blood pressure
           (cSBP) (Complior, Alam Medical and Arteriograph,TensioMed)

        2. flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery (FMD)

        3. carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) by ultrasonography

        4. coronary flow reserve of the LAD (CFR) by Doppler echocardiography

        5. E'/A of mitral annular velocities ,LV longitudinal (GLS -%),strain, and strain rate
           (LongSr-l/s), peak twisting (Tw -deg),peak twisting (Tw-deg/sec)velocity,untwisting at
           mitral valve opening (unTw) and untwisting (unTw) velocity using speckle tracking
           echocardiography .

        6. Perfused boundary region (PBR)of the sublingual arterial microvessels (ranged from 5-25
           microns) using Sideview Darkfield imaging. (Microscan, Glycocheck) .The PBR in
           microvessels is the cell-poor layer which results from the phase separation between the
           flowing red blood cells (RBC) and plasma.The PBR includes the most luminal part of
           glycocalyx that does allow cell penetration. Increased PBR is considered an accurate
           index of reduced endothelial glycocalyx thickness because of a deeper RBC penetration in
           the glycocalyx.

        7. Fetuin serum levels, markers of oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde (MDA) serum
           levels, protein carbonyls aw well as thrombosis and inflammation biomarkers

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with psoriasis

          -  Age and sex matched patients with CAD, with untreated hypertension and healthy
             subjects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  for psoriasis patients were presence of wall motion abnormalities and ejection
             fraction ≤ 50%, psoriatic arthritis, history of acute coronary syndrome, familial
             hyperlipidemia, insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease or asthma, moderate or severe valvular heart disease, primary cardiomyopathies
             and malignant tumors. CAD was excluded in psoriasis patients by absence of clinical
             history, angina and reversible myocardial ischemia, as assessed by dobutamine stress
             echocardiography or thallium scintigraphy

          -  regarding the group of CAD patients, we only included patients without history of ST
             elevation myocardial infarction in order to exclude the presence of transmural scar
             compromising myocardial function indices. Thus, CAD patients with wall motion
             abnormalities and ejection fraction of ≤ 50% were excluded. In addition, exclusion
             criteria, were history of acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation within
             the last year, familial hyperlipidemia, insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, moderate or severe valvular heart disease,
             primary cardiomyopathies and malignant tumor

          -  in normal controls, CAD was excluded by the presence of normal ECG, absence of
             clinical history and absence of reversible ischemia by means of treadmill test or
             dobutamine stress echocardiography
