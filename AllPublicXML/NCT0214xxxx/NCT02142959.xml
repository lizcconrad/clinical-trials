  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation dermatitis is experienced by almost all patients (up to 95%) receiving radiation
      therapy for cancer. Radiation dermatitis can be a serious condition because, in addition to
      its direct physical complications and the resulting impact on overall quality of life, it can
      also be a dose-limiting toxicity requiring changes to the prescribed course of radiation
      therapy. The most common strategy employed in an attempt to prevent or minimize radiation
      dermatitis involves moisturization of the irradiated area, use of a mild soap to keep the
      area clean, and minimizing exposure to potential mechanical irritants, such as scratching and
      rough clothing. However, this strategy has been shown to lack clinically significant
      efficacy. Consequently, there is a clinical need for new treatments that are effective in
      protecting against radiotherapy-induced oxidative stress and the subsequent development of
      radiation dermatitis.

      Based on data from previous studies in animals and humans, Reata believes that omaveloxolone
      (RTA 408) Lotion may effectively prevent and mitigate radiation dermatitis in oncology
      patients undergoing radiation therapy.

      This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group trial will study the
      efficacy, tolerability and safety of two concentrations of omaveloxolone (RTA 408) Lotion (3%
      and 0.5%) versus vehicle in patients with breast cancer for whom radiation therapy is
      recommended.
