  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It causes more than one
      million deaths every year. Researchers want to gather tissue samples from people with lung
      and thymic cancers to understand the disease better. This may lead to new ways to diagnose
      and treat it.

      Objective:

      - To collect tissue samples for use in the study of lung cancers.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults over age 18 with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, extra pulmonary
      small cell cancer, pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, and thymic epithelial tumors.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.
           They will be asked about how they perform their daily tasks.

        -  Participants may be asked to give urine and blood samples. They may give a saliva sample
           if they cannot give blood. They will also give a sample of their tumor from a biopsy
           they had. They may also be given the option to undergo a biopsy.

        -  Participants may have MRI, CT, and/or PET scans of the body. They will lie in a machine
           that takes pictures of the body.

        -  After visits to the Clinical Center end, researchers will contact participants by phone
           every year to check on their health.

      PRECIS

      Background:

        -  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, accounting for more
           than one million deaths every year.

        -  Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are involved in initiation and progression of
           NSCLC. Some of these alterations are seen in normal and preneoplastic cells as well,
           suggesting a sequential development from normal epithelial cells to cancer, through a
           multistep process, usually coincident with cigarette smoking.

        -  This natural history protocol is an extension of our Molecular Profiling protocol to
           enable tissue collection for more in-depth proteomic and genomic analyses to understand
           tumor biology and treatment response.

        -  A cohort of patients enrolled in this natural history study is likely to enroll in the
           IRB approved protocol for end-of-life in-patient hospice and rapid autopsy following
           death (13-C0131). Longitudinally collected tumor tissue from these patients, including
           from several metastatic sites at autopsy will be a unique resource to understand tumor
           evolution.

        -  There will be opportunity to embark upon a wide array of studies in the future with the
           longitudinally collected tissue samples tagged with clinical information from patients.

      Objectives:

      - To allow sample acquisition for use in the study of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), extrapulmonary small cell cancer (ESCC), pulmonary
      neuroendocrine tumors (PNET), and thymic epithelial tumors (TETs).

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC, SCLC, ESCC, PNET, and
           TET.

        -  Patients consulted in the Clinical Center without a definitive diagnosis, but clinically
           considered likely to have a thoracic malignancy of the above histologies, pending
           further tissue acquisition and/or pathology review.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

      Design:

        -  This is a bio-specimen collection and natural history protocol in which samples will be
           collected from patients with NSCLC, SCLC, ESCC, PNET, and TET.

        -  Eligible patients undergoing screening for or participating in NIH protocols or eligible
           patients treated elsewhere and referred from other oncologists will be referred for
           participation in this study.

        -  Upon providing informed consent, patients will undergo sample acquisition procedure,
           which may include a tumor biopsy, blood, urine, abnormal body fluid and a cheek swab
           collection.

        -  An accrual ceiling of 2000 subjects is planned over an accrual period of 10 years.
