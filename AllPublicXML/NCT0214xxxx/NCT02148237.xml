  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine preliminary effects of home-based individual breastfeeding
      consultation with and without cash incentives to increase breastfeeding (BF) duration among
      low-income Puerto Rican mothers enrolled in a Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
      Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect sizes of
      home-based individual breastfeeding consultation alone and combined with financial incentives
      to increase breastfeeding (BF) duration among low-income Puerto Rican mothers. These
      interventions will be tested in a Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which
      capitalizes on the current goals of WIC and on the current practice of using incentives to
      support BF - factors that are likely to increase potential for sustainability and
      dissemination of the intervention. We will follow a three phase strategy. During the
      Formative Phase we will consult WIC staff, Puerto Rican postpartum mothers, and experts in
      BF, behavioral health incentives, and WIC populations and settings to develop intervention
      and research manuals. During the Implementation Phase, we will pilot the interventions and
      research procedures. We will randomly assign 60 Puerto Rican women who initiate BF to:
      Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) or TAU with financial incentives (also known as Contingency
      Management; (CM). A bilingual breastfeeding counselor visits participants at home for problem
      solving issues around breastfeeding. Participants also receiving CM will receive cash
      incentives if they show breastfeeding. We will conduct assessments at baseline, 1, 3, and 6
      months postpartum, measuring BF duration, BF exclusivity, BF self-efficacy, and infant weight
      gain. In the Evaluative Phase, we will examine monthly recruitment, consent, and enrollment
      rates, as well as attendance and retention rates for the interventions and for research
      participation (i.e., feasibility and acceptability).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of breastfeeding</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Observe breastfeeding (BF) behavior looking for one of the following indicators of successful BF in the infant: audible swallowing, a regular suck/swallow/breathe pattern, or visible milk in the infant's mouth after they are not latched anymore. For a mother who pumps milk, observation of pumping combined with observation of the resulting milk being fed to the infant will be observed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant weight</measure>
    <time_frame>1-month, 3-month, and 6-month postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>An infant will be weighed at each assessment time point using a portable Health O Meter Infant Scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Coercion assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly group meetings, assessments after delivery, 1-month postpartum, 3-month postpartum, and 6-month postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The Coercion Assessment Scale (CAS) is a 11-item questionnaire that measures perceived coercion to participate in research. The items examine pressures emanating from WIC staff and the research assistant. An initial support for the instrument's internal consistency, factor structure, and discriminative validity has been provided.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Postnatal Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>After delivery, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) is a 10-item questionnaire that identifies patients at risk for perinatal depression. The EPDS was found to be sensitive and specific, especially sensitive to change in the severity of depression over time. The scale can be completed in about 5 minutes and scoring is very simple.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Breastfeeding self-efficacy scale</measure>
    <time_frame>After delivery, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Breastfeeding self-efficacy scale (BSES) is a 39-item questionnaire to measure maternal confidence in new BF mothers. The scale has demonstrated its predictive validity showing a positive correlation between BSES scores and infant feeding patterns at 6-week postpartum. The scale has been also useful to identify new mothers with low BF confidence at high risk for premature weaning. The scale has been translated into Spanish and replicated its validity and reliability with Puerto Rican mothers.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>This is a brief 10-item inventory to assess the acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention It will be conducted with the 20 participants in the CM condition.. The questionnaire will include an item that (if applicable) asks why the participant did not complete the study.</description>

    <description>Participants in Treatment as Usual (TAU) will receive standard breastfeeding (BF) services from the WIC program and participate in research assessments. Standard services include an on-site and home-visiting lactation consultant, occasional one-on-one peer counseling, and an enhanced food package for BF women.</description>

    <description>These participants will receive usual WIC care. The frequency, duration, content, and size of the meetings and participation requirements will be the same as for the TAU group, except that this group will also receive contingency management (CM). Members will demonstrate breastfeeding and receive cash incentives weekly if they breastfeed.</description>
