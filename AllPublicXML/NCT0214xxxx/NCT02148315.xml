      New York State schools were randomly assigned to receive school gardens and associated
      curriculum or to serve on the wait list control group that received gardens and curriculum at
      the end of the 2-year study. Baseline data were collected in Fall 2011. Garden interventions
      began in Spring 2012. Follow-up data were collected at 6, 12, 18 months following baseline
      data collection.
