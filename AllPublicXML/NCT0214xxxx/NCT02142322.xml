    <description>Modified FOLFOX6 regimen consists of oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 and FA 100 mg/m2 given as a 2 hour intravenous infusion, followed by 5-FU 2.4 g/m2 given as a continuous infusion over 46 hour, repeated every 2 weeks. Patients receive 4 cycles of neoadjuvant modified FOLFOX6 followed by curative radical surgery with D2 dissection and 4 cycles of adjuvant modified FOLFOX6.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously untreated patients with pathologically proven advanced gastric
             adenocarcinoma with regional LN metastasis are eligible for this study (clinical
             stage: cT2-4 and N+). At least one measurable regional lymph node metastasis according
             to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v. 1.0) [17] is required.
             Other eligibility criteria include age between 18 and 75 years, Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, no prior chemotherapy or
             radiotherapy, and adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function (absolute
             neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1.5ⅹ109/L, platelet count ≥ 100ⅹ109/L, total bilirubin ≤
             1.5ⅹupper limit of normal [ULN], serum transaminases ≤ 2.5ⅹULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤
             2.5ⅹULN, serum creatinine ≤ 1.5ⅹULN or actual or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50
             mL/min).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include clinical stage T1 tumors, clinical or radiologic evidence
             of distant metastasis, intestinal obstruction or impending obstruction, active tumor
             bleeding, interstitial pneumonitis or symptomatic pulmonary fibrosis, peripheral
             neuropathy of National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) grade ≥1,
             pregnant or breastfeeding patients, and other serious diseases.
