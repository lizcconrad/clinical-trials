  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of nocturnal oxygen therapy during a
      stay at moderate altitude on exercise performance of patients with chronic obstructive lung
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate to severe COPD living below 800 m, will be recruited to participate in
      a randomized cross-over field trial evaluating the hypothesis that exercise capacity during a
      2 day sojourn at moderate altitude is improved by nocturnal oxygen therapy via a nasal
      cannula. Outcomes will be assessed during 2 days in Zurich (490 m, low altitude baseline),
      and during 2 days at St. Moritz Salastrains (2048 m).
