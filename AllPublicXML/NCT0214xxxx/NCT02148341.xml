      This study determines if a community of practice of clinicians and quality improvement
      specialists can be used to implement a national quality initiative known as Hospital to Home
      (H2H). This quality initative is designed to reduced readmission rates for patients with
      heart failure or heart attack by improving the transition of care upon discharge.

    <description>Medical Centers assigned to this arm will recieive the communtiy of practice facilitation. In this process we will contact existing members of the community of practice (called the Heart Failure Network) at the facility as well as attempt to identify new providers and other staff at the facility with an interest in improving heart failure care. The facilitation includes: describing the national H2H program, providing talking points and strategies for local providers to obtain support from their local facility to initiate local projects related to H2H, providing a forum for successful sites to describe how they initiated projects to sites yet to initiate projects.</description>
