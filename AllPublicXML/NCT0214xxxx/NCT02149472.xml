  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major obstetric haemorrhage (MOH) remains a cause of significant maternal morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. By identifying women with a higher a priori risk of major haemorrhage
      during their pregnancy or early during postpartum haemorrhage extra measures to prevent MOH
      can be taken.

      In this study the investigators aim to identify haemostatic parameters that during the course
      of haemorrhage are responsible for the on-going towards major bleeding. By doing this,
      cut-off points can be defined for future interventions aiming to stop this bleeding process
      in an early stage. Traditional coagulation parameters are currently not useful for clinical
      decision making, because of long turn around times. Therefore the added value of available
      coagulation 'point of care' tests will be evaluated during obstetric haemorrhage.These
      Point-of-Care (POC) tests could lead to a goal-directed haemostatic therapy for obstetric
      haemorrhage.

      A cohort of 9.500 pregnant women will be followed during their pregnancy and delivery. From
      all women a bleeding score will be obtained during their pregnancy by means of a validated
      questionnaire. The predictive value of this bleeding score for the occurrence of major
      obstetric haemorrhage will be evaluated.

      If postpartum haemorrhage develops (blood loss) &gt; 1000 cc, blood samples will be drawn for
      conventional haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles. The pathway between minor bleeding
      and major bleeding will be elucidated. Interchangeability and comparability of conventional
      haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles will also be evaluated.

      The overall goal of the investigators is becoming more able to predict major obstetric
      haemorrhage in an early stage of postpartum haemorrhage and define thresholds for
      goal-directed hemostatic therapies.

        All pregnant women in participating hospitals are asked for their informed consent (n =
        9.500). All women will complete a bleeding score generating questionnaire duing their
        pregnancy. Only from women developing postpartum haemorrhage &gt; 1000 cc blood samples will
        be drawn (n = 600) during the course of postpartum haemorrhage for evaluation of changes in
        haemostatic parameters and ROTEM profiles.

        3 months postpartum a nested case cohort study will be performed to compare the incidences
        of underlying bleeding disorders in the haemorrhage and non-haemorrhage group. This outcome
        will also be related to the obtained bleeding scores during pregnancy.
