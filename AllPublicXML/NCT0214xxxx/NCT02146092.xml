  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After any surgery, there is a chance of complications. After lung surgery to remove tumours,
      there is a particularly high chance of a person developing an infection or needing help
      breathing, called post operative pulmonary complications. Currently, the risk of these
      complications is reduced through the completion of light physical and deep breathing
      exercises and walking around as soon as possible after surgery. Another possible way of
      helping these patients is to use a small device called an Incentive Spirometer to encourage
      and measure deep breathing. This study wants to compare how often postoperative pulmonary
      complications happen after major lung surgery between a group completing the exercises alone
      and a group using the Incentive spirometer in addition to the exercises. It is hoped that the
      combined therapy will reduce the amount of time patient must stay in hospital, have fewer
      complication events and have fewer patients re-admitted back into the hospital after they go
      home, so that patients overall have better outcomes.

      This study is a prospective blinded randomized control trial (RCT) where two arms will be
      assembled. Consenting eligible patients will be randomized to either the physiotherapy +
      incentive spirometry (PT+IS-intervention) arm or physiotherapy only (PT-control arm).
      Patients will be randomized with an equal (1:1) chance of being allocated to either the PT
      (control) arm or PT+IS (intervention) arm. Both the treating surgeon and data interpreter
      will be blinded to the intervention.

Pneumonia requiring treatment with antibiotics

    <description>Standard physiotherapy includes routine physiotherapy care as per current institutional standards. This consists of two daily visits by the physiotherapist. During the visits, the patient will be taught deep breathing and will be instructed to practice it 10 times every hour. They are also shown shoulder movements and lung expansion exercises. They will receive a sheet summarizing the exercises for future reference. The patient is discharged from physiotherapy when they are ambulatory, on room air, and able to clear their respiratory secretions independently, although they will be asked to continue the exercises on their own until 30 days from surgery.</description>

    <description>Patients in the Incentive Spirometry arm will receive standard physiotherapy care in addition to training and use of an incentive spirometer. The physiotherapy care includes routine care as per current institutional standards.
They will also receive an incentive spirometer on the first postoperative day and will be taught how to use it with an accompanying instructional sheet for later reference. Teaching will emphasize slow deep breathing, sustained vacuum pressure, and gradual increase in difficulty. Patients will be instructed to use the spirometer 10 times every hour until 30 days after surgery.</description>
