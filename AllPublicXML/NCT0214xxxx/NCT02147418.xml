  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the oropharynx (middle, side and back walls of the throat; back of the tongue; soft
      palate, and tonsils), or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), has been on the rise
      in the United States. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been recognized in many of these
      cancers, and testing for HPV has contributed to the higher reported rates of OPSCC. In this
      study, our goal is to develop a new test that can detect certain HPV proteins in the blood or
      saliva to help improve detection of OPSCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While secondary screening strategies have successfully reduced the rate of HPV-positive
      cervical cancers, an effective screening modality for HPV-OPSCC does not exist. A central
      problem in the early diagnosis of HPV-OPSCC is the relative inaccessibility of the tonsillar
      crypts, where oncogenic infections are thought to originate. Unlike the relatively smooth
      surface of the cervix which permits mechanical sampling with Pap tests and which can be
      evaluated visually for evidence of dysplasia, much of the tonsillar epithelium is found below
      the surface in a complex network. As a consequence, any screening modality cannot depend upon
      direct access to malignant lesions. What is needed is a minimally invasive, diffusible or
      circulating marker of HPV-OPSCC, and a means to collect and detect it.

        The patient population will consist of adults presenting to the Division of Otolaryngology
        - Head and Neck Surgery at the University of New Mexico with previously untreated OPSCC.
        Both HPV-positive and HPV-negative malignancies will be collected as the study and control
        groups, respectively. In addition, saliva samples will be collected from patients
        presenting with benign conditions as a further negative control.
