      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the induction of immune responses against CV9104
      administered by conventional intradermal injection or with a needle-free intradermal
      injection device and to assess the safety and tolerability of CV9104 administered by
      conventional intradermal injection versus injection with a needle-free intradermal injection
      device versus no injection.

      This study is the second clinical trial of the RNActive® vaccine. It is composed of 6
      RNActive® drug product components, coding for 6 antigens that are overexpressed in PCA
      compared to healthy tissue. Each of the 6 prostate specific antigens that are encoded by
      CV9104 are capable of inducing adaptive immunity.

      Needle-free injection systems, like the Tropis® device for i.d. injection, overcome the
      disadvantages related to needle- and syringe-based i.d. injections. Tropis® is currently used
      in different vaccine clinical trials around the world. The use of Tropis® for i.d. delivery
      of CV9104 has been approved by BfArM.
