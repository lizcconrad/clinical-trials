  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending single study. It is
      hypothesised that at least dose of DS-1093a will be safe and tolerable over a 2-week
      treatment period and will result in increases in reticulocyte count and haemoglobin
      concentrations in healthy male volunteers

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects, aged 18-45 years.

          -  Willing to use a reliable method of contraception during the trial, and for 4 months
             afterwards

          -  Sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the trial and any hazards of
             participating in it. Ability to communicate satisfactorily with the Investigator and

          -  Willingness to give written consent to participate after reading the information and

             Investigator or his delegate.

          -  Willingness to give written consent to have data entered into The Overvolunteering
             Prevention System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal medical history, physical findings, electrocardiogram
             (ECG), or laboratory values at the pre-trial screening assessment that could interfere
             with the objectives of the trial or the safety of the volunteer.

             hypertension, seizures, kidney disease or liver disease, including known or newly
             discovered Gilbert's syndrome) sufficient to invalidate the volunteer's participation
             in the trial or make it unnecessarily hazardous.

          -  Impaired endocrine, thyroid, hepatic, respiratory or renal function, diabetes
             mellitus, coronary heart disease, or history of psychotic mental illness.

             medicines.

          -  Presence or history of significant hypersensitive or allergic reaction to any drug,

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription
             medicine within the previous 3 months, or unwilling to abstain from participating in
             other clinical trials during the study and for 3 months after receipt of the final

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV 1 &amp; HIV 2.

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol during the 2 years before the first dose of trial
             medication.
