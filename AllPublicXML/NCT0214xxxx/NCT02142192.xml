  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity of natalizumab
      (BG00002) 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) administered to participants with relapsing multiple
      sclerosis (RMS). The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of
      natalizumab SC injections and to evaluate the efficacy of natalizumab SC injections on
      relapses and on new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions.

    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Persistent anti-natalizumab antibodies are defined as 2 positive anti-natalizumab test results separated by at least 6 weeks, with at least 1 positive test result occurring at or after the Week 24 Visit.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of participants with clinical relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This may include new or enlarging T2 lesion(s), as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Clinical relapse is defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the neurologist.</description>
