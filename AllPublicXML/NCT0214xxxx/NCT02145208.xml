      The study will include an implantation of the TIND device and 4 follow up visits up to 12
      months after the implantation.

      After screening , eligible patients will undergo an an implantation procedure (operative),
      using the TIND device.

      Implantation will be performed according to the Instructions For Use.

      Between the 5th - 7th days, the TIND will be retrieved through a rigid cystoscope sheath,
      under direct vision. Before retrieval the subject will be asked for subjective discomfort
      evaluation and level of urgency in the past days after device insertion, about any AE and
      then the device will be retrieved.

      The next visits will be at 4 weeks (post device retrieval), 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months
      post implantation with an optional extension of follow up period (up to 36 months). In the
      visits the following will be assessed: Uroflow and residual urine volume tests, AE recording,
      IPSS, and Questions on sex performing capability and ejaculation filled out by the subjects,
      in the local languages.
