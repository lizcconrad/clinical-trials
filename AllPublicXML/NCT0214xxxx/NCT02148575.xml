      The purpose of this study is to test a psycho-educational intervention, Managing Cancer Care:
      A Personal Guide (MCC), that is intended to improve patients' knowledge of palliative care
      and to facilitate its timely integration into self-management of their breast cancer. The MCC
      will be tested with patients with Stage I-IV breast cancer at baseline, one, and three months
      following enrollment. The intervention group will receive the MCC, and the attention-control
      group will receive a symptom management toolkit. Participants' family caregivers will also be
      enrolled to provide information on patients' self-management. Investigators hypothesize that
      users of MCC, as compared to attention-control participants, will demonstrate improved
      knowledge, feelings, and behaviors related to self-management of their cancer care. This
      innovative research can help to establish palliative care as a mainstay of self-management
      interventions that target serious illnesses.

    <description>Participants in the Symptom Management Group will be given a symptom management toolkit that provides information on the most commonly experienced symptoms and side effects of cancer treatment, including fatigue, nausea, and sleep problems, among others. Each chapter includes information on when and why the symptom may occur, how the symptom can be managed, and when to call a provider.</description>
