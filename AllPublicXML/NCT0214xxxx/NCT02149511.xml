      In patients with chronic spinal cord injury, imaging of the spinal cord and brain above the
      level of the lesion provides evidence of neural degeneration; however, the spatial and
      temporal patterns of progression and their relation to clinical outcomes are uncertain. New
      interventions targeting acute spinal cord injury have entered clinical trials but
      neuroimaging outcomes as responsive markers of treatment have yet to be established. We aim
      to use MRI to assess neuronal degeneration above the level of the lesion after acute spinal
      cord injury. In our prospective longitudinal study, we enroll patients with acute traumatic
      spinal cord injury and healthy controls. We assess patients clinically and by MRI at
      baseline, 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months 24 months and 60 months, and controls by MRI at
      the same timepoints. We assess atrophy in white and brain matter and we use cross-sectional
      spinal cord area measurements to assess atrophy at cervical level C2/C3. We use
      myelin-sensitive magnetisation transfer (MT) and longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) maps to
      assess microstructural changes associated with myelin. We also assess associations between
      MRI parameters and clinical improvement.
