  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lower back pain (CLBP) is a significant health care issue in the United States and
      the world. CLBP contributes to decreased quality of life, decreased function and increased
      utilization of health care resources. The causes of CLBP tend to be multi‐factorial.
      Arthropathy of the lumbar facet joints is thought to be a common etiology (15‐45%).
      Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) of the medial branch nerve of the facet joint is a
      well‐established treatment modality used to decrease facet joint pains. However, a wide range
      of temperature is being used (70‐90 degrees Celsius). In addition, the optimal temperature
      that provides the best patient outcomes with the least side effects is not well established
      in the pain management literature.

      This study will determine if lumbar facets medial branches RFA at 90 degrees Celsius provides
      more overall pain relief (i.e., percent of improvement), when compared to ablation at 80
      degrees Celsius with no additional adverse events. Furthermore, ablation of the lumbar facets
      nerve supply at 90 degrees Celsius will provide better improvement in the functionality
      level, general mood and quality of life as measured by VAS ( Visual Analog Scale) pain score,
      Pain Disability Index (PDI), McGill Pain questioner scores and Beck Inventory (BI) scores as
      those receiving the ablation at 80 degrees Celsius. Also, it is associated with less opioid
      consumption, no additional unwanted adverse events and/or complications along with less need
      to repeat RFA procedure over one year period.

             requirements.

             the knee that failed to conservative therapy.

          -  Subjects who have chronic back pain attributed to lumbar facet joints arthropathy
             based on clinical evaluation (paraspinal tenderness and/or facet loading test in the
