      Primary Objectives:

      To assess the efficacy of intravitreal administered Eylea in preventing visual loss in
      subjects with a retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED) subtype of neovascular
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) measured by mean change in BCVA at Month 12 compared
      to Baseline.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea
           in subjects with the PED subtype of neovascular AMD for a period of 1 year

        2. To assess the effect of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea on Central
           Subfield Thickness (CSFT), Central Subfield Volume (CSFV), and PED height and volume.

        3. To assess the effect of repeated intravitreal administration of Eylea on vision related
           quality of life in subjects with PED study type of neovascular AMD assessed using the
           NEI/VFQ-25 questionnaire
