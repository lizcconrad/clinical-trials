  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed in 131 adult patients undergoing transurethral, urological or lower
      limb surgery under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia. Patients were stratified
      according to age: 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and 71-80 years. The spinal component of
      the anesthetic was established by bolus administration of up-and-down doses of 0.75% plain
      bupivacaine, determined by Dixon's method. The degree of motor block after intrathecal
      administration of each concentration was evaluated by the modified Bromage and Hip motor
      function score. The EC50 were estimated from the up-and-down sequences using the method of
      Dixon and Massey and logistic regression. Other endpoints were included on the basis of
      sensory block level, duration of motor blockade, hypotension, and vasopressor requirements.
