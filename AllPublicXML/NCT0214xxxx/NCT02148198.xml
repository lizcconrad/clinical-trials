  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will assess the effect of 1g, 2g and 5g doses of NWT-03 on systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure in a cross-over designed study in healthy adults with normal, high
      normal and mild hypertension. Based on results from this study, one dose will be selected for
      a placebo controlled parallel study assessing a single dose of NWT-03 on systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure and endothelial function in a similar population.
