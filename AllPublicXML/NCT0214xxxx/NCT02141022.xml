  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the efficacy of computer-based cognitive exercises as a means of
      cognitive remediation in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) who are beginning the disease
      modifying pharmacotherapy Gileyna.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gilenya represents the most recent advance in MS disease-modification therapy (DMT) and shows
      promise for neuroprotection, a feature relevant to the progressive neurologic damage
      associated with the disease. Cognitive impairment accompanies MS in 40-60% of cases and when
      present, additional symptomatic treatment combined with DMT is required. To date no
      symptomatic pharmacologic therapy has shown a consistent benefit on MS associated cognitive
      dysfunction. However, non-pharmacologic approaches show promise. With recent technical and
      scientific advances, cognitive training is rapidly evolving to become the most effective
      intervention for the cognitive impairments associated with a wide range of neurological
      conditions. However, these training programs have not yet been studied in MS.

      This study will be a randomized open-label clinical pilot trial to compare a plasticity-based
      and adaptive cognitive remediation (PACR) program to an active control (ordinary computer
      games) in 20 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) starting Gilenya therapy. Primary outcome
      measures will be used as preliminary indicators of effect, with improvements on program
      task-related measures and changes in cognitive measures. Secondary outcome measures will
      determine the feasibility of the use of these programs in patients with MS, as indicated by
      compliance and patient-reported experience.

    <description>PACR Program Use: To use PACR, the participant navigates to the PACR study web site. The participant then logs into the PACR (using a study provided screen name and study identification number). A game-like experience begins, where the participant is presented with games in a set order. Each game consists of targeted exercises that contain the core science stimuli and tasks. The scheduling mechanism ensures that a participant progresses through the exercises in a defined order, generally moving from more simple (early sensory processing) exercises to more complex (multimodal, cognitive control) exercises over the course of the three-month experience.</description>

    <description>Active Control Program Use (Ordinary Computer Games): The active control program is composed of 13 ordinary computer games matched to the PACR condition overall. This condition is designed to be a face-valid approach to cognitive remediation. The control condition is also designed to account for nonspecific treatment effects, including placebo response, interactions with research personnel, and experience with computers and computer-related activities, and any halo or expectation effect on study assessments.</description>
