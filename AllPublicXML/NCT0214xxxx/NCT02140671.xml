      Following on from a 10 year study conducted in Finland this study is designed to test the
      validity and sustainability of an enhanced asthma management model for the UK.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The British Lung Foundation (BLF) aims to work with the governments in the four UK nations to
      launch an asthma initiative designed to improve asthma management and outcomes. The project
      incorporates key learning from a 10 year programme in Finland designed to improve asthma care
      and cap healthcare costs for paediatric and adult populations.

      The Finland programme focused on accurate diagnosis, training and education of healthcare
      professionals and patients and early use of anti-inflammatory therapy. The programme
      successfully improved medication compliance, reduced asthma hospital admissions, reduced
      asthma-related benefit claims and reduced the overall cost of asthma to the Finnish
      Government.

      To test the validity and sustainability of an enhanced asthma management model for the UK,
      the BLF proposes to undertake a pilot initiative in England. The pilot will focus on:
      improving diagnostic accuracy through analysis of GP asthma registers; increasing asthma
      education among healthcare professionals; assessment of risk and control of patient's asthma;
      supportive self-management and education of people with asthma.

      It is anticipated that the pilot will lead to measureable and significant improvements in
      asthma management, including:

        -  Reduced number of severe exacerbations (asthma hospitalisation, A&amp;E attendance and oral
           steroid rescue)

        -  Improved diagnostic accuracy (and reduction of diagnostic doubt)

        -  Improved implementation of recognised asthma guidelines, including appropriate step wise
           management of patients

      The pilot will also aim to increase the proportion of patients on the asthma register with an
      asthma management plan and a recorded asthma control test therefore supporting higher levels
      of control, and will promote peer-to-peer health care professional asthma education and
      knowledge sharing to establish an asthma-training legacy.

      The pilot model will be sustainable and reproducible across England and the devolved nations
      (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Whilst the core aspects of an agreed national model
      will be rolled out across the pilot site, it will be tailored and refined through local
      collaboration (primary care, secondary care and commissioners) to help attain local targets
      in line with regional differences, needs and priorities.

      Results from the pilot will be reported 15 months after project initiation on site
      (July/August 2014)

    <description>An exacerbation is defined (in line with the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guidelines) as: acute oral steroids, out of hours or Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) attendance for asthma, or hospitalisation for asthma.
Rationale for selecting exacerbations as the primary outcome:
They are the time of greatest risk to patients and greatest resource use
Exacerbations are defined by routinely held data, such as drug prescriptions (oral steroids and out of hours and A&amp;E attendance), hence are reliable when captured in primary care
Exacerbations reflect current control and future risk; a reduction in exacerbations indicates an improvement in asthmatic inflammation control and improved use of anti-inflammatory therapy</description>

        The patient questionnaire will be subject to local refinement in line with local needs,
        targets and priorities but will assess -

          -  Asthma Control e.g. ACT, or ACQ or RCP3

          -  Lifestyle - i.e. smoking status

          -  Comorbidities

          -  Patient perceived adherence

          -  Side effects

        The practice and patient reports will be used to characterise the patient in terms of risk
        and control. They will give a complete picture of the patient's asthma and will be used to
        identify patients for diagnostic assessment, medical management and education. Patients
        will then be stratified into Group 1 (patients with asthma) or Group 2 (Patients identified
        for further diagnostic assessment and/or with diagnostic doubt).
