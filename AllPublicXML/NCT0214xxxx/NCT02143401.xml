      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of navitoclax when given
      together with sorafenib tosylate in treating patients with solid tumors that have returned
      (relapsed) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Navitoclax and sorafenib tosylate may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of navitoclax and
      sorafenib tosylate (sorafenib) in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Dose escalation
      cohort) II. To better characterize the toxicity profile of the combination of navitoclax and
      sorafenib. (Dose expansion cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify any activity of this treatment combination in patients with metastatic cancer.
      (Dose escalation cohort) II. To seek preliminary evidence of activity of this treatment
      combination in patients with hepatoma. (Dose expansion cohort)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib induces apoptosis that
      can be detected by peripheral blood biomarker analysis. (Dose escalation cohort) II. To
      assess peripheral blood biomarkers and pharmacokinetics in a more homogenous population.
      (Dose expansion cohort) III. To determine whether treatment is associated with Mcl-1 down
      regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Dose
      expansion cohort) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion whether pretreatment tumor cell
      levels of Mcl-1 predict response to this regimen through serial biopsies. (Dose expansion
      cohort)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of navitoclax.

      Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (days 1-28 course of 1
      only) and sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <description>To assess changes in each antigen, dot plots will be constructed with H-score on the Y axis and pre-or post-treatment status on the X axis, looking for patterns of change that emerge.

    <description>The relationship between pretreatment Mcl-1 expression and clinical response will be examined in a post hoc and exploratory fashion. To assess the relationship between Mcl-1 and response the H score (0-300) vs. response will be graphed. Chi-squared tests will be used to assess significance of relationships between these dichotomous variables and response. In addition, associations between molecular markers and time-to-event variables (progression-free-survival [PFS]) will be illustrated graphically using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests in an exploratory fashion.</description>

    <description>Will be summarized descriptively and plotted along time by dose levels and as a whole. The changes of the serum levels of cleaved and total CK18 at each time point against pre-treatment baseline will be correlated with toxicity and clinical endpoints. The relationships between cleaved and total CK18, caspase 3 and cytochrome c at various time points and dose levels will be explored in longitudinal data analysis. Tissue expression of Mcl-1 will be correlated with serum levels of cleaved and total CK18 at different time points and clinical toxicity and tumor response.</description>
