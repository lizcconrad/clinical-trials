  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One purpose of this study is to test whether adding metformin will limit some of the unwanted
      effects of clozapine, compared to not adding metformin. Metformin is a medication that is
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of type-2
      diabetes. Studies have found that people with type-2 diabetes often lose some weight when
      they take metformin, however the FDA has not approved metformin for weight loss, so for this
      study the use of metformin is investigational. This study will test whether metformin can
      help people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders lose weight.

      Another purpose of this study is to test whether adding fish oil will improve the benefit of
      clozapine and/or limit some of the unwanted effects of clozapine, compared to not adding fish
      oil. Fish oil is a medication used to reduce levels of some fats (triglycerides) in blood.
      Some studies have found that adding fish oil reduces psychosis (voices, suspiciousness).
      However the FDA has not approved fish oil for reducing psychosis, so for this study the use
      of fish oil is investigational. This study will test whether fish oil can help people with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders have less psychosis. Fish oil is not an
      antipsychotic medication.
