  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canada continues to see an unrelenting stream of new HIV diagnoses, with a disproportionate
      burden among gay, bisexual, and other MSM in major centers such as Toronto. Pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) with oral, daily tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC, Truvada速) is a novel
      biomedical approach to HIV prevention shown in the iPrEx trial to be safe and efficacious in
      reducing HIV acquisition by 44% among MSM, when provided in a comprehensive package of HIV
      prevention interventions including counseling, testing/treatment of sexually transmitted
      infections (STIs), and condoms. There is now widespread mobilization to assess the
      feasibility of PrEP roll-out worldwide, with urgent calls for 'demonstration projects'
      addressing real-world PrEP implementation issues.

      PREPARATORY-5 is Canada's first PrEP demonstration project, and will examine real-world PrEP
      implementation issues including acceptability, effectiveness, impact on sexually transmitted
      infections, and strategies for supporting adherence outside the clinical trial setting. The
      investigators have also established a comprehensive community-based research program
      investigating the role of community-based organizations in PrEP implementation and delivery.
