  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the initial efficacy, safety and tolerability of n-acetylcysteine
      as a pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence. A rigorous, inpatient human laboratory study
      will be conducted in which the subjective, physiological and reinforcing effects of cocaine
      are evaluated during maintenance on placebo and n-acetylcysteine.

    <measure>Number of Times Cocaine Was Selected in the Presence of a Monetary Reward Alternative</measure>
    <time_frame>One test per cocaine dose level per intervention for each participant over his/her approximate 2 week inpatient admission.</time_frame>
    <description>The reinforcing effects of cocaine were determined using a modified progressive ratio procedure (Stoops et al., 2010) in which subjects made 6 choices between available each available cocaine dose and money (US$0.25). Reinforcing effects are measured for each cocaine dose during both buspirone and placebo maintenance.</description>

    <measure>Peak Score on Sedative Subscale of the Adjective Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects completed this measure at 15 minute intervals for 45 minutes after sampling each cocaine dose under both n-acetylcysteine and placebo maintenance conditions.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed 16 items that loaded into the Sedative Subscale of the Adjective Rating Scale. The items were rated 0-4 on a Likert-type scale and the sum for the 16 &quot;sedative&quot; items was summed to yield the Sedative Subscale score. The maximum score for this scale was 64, the minimum was 0. Higher values represent greater subjective effects on this item. Peak scores were calculated from multiple assessments for each cocaine dose under both n-acetylcysteine and placebo conditions.</description>

The maximum score for this scale was 64, the minimum was 0. Higher values represent greater subjective effects on this item.
