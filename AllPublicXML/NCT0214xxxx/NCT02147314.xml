      This evaluation will evaluate a new system from YOFiMeter, known as YOFiLife Blood Glucose
      Monitoring System with YOFiMeter glucometer. YOFiLife includes a web- based data system known
      as the Web Portal and smart phone apps for the iPhone and Android. The new YOFiMeter is
      similar to other glucometers with the exception of built in test cassettes, lancet cassettes
      with enhanced communications and data reviewing options.

      This evaluation will also collect data from a YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer reference
      glucometer. The YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer will be used as the &quot;gold&quot; standard with
      all results compared to the YSI results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single evaluation to assess both the Yofimeter system accuracy in the hands of the
      intended users, as well as other aspects to support lay use, such as labeling assessment and
      usability. The company is presenting diabetics who monitor their blood glucose with new
      technological innovations aimed at improving their daily lives (e.g., a unique blood glucose
      monitor, Web Portal applications and &quot;smart phone&quot; applications).

      Each subject selected for the comparison evaluation will perform their own fingerstick and
      test on their subject device following device instructions. A trained technician will perform
      a fingerstick on the subject immediately after and perform the test on the same device.
      Separate results will be recorded by subject and technician. A trained technician will take
      another blood sample, within as short of a time as practicable, for a glucose assay on the
      YSI 2300 Stat Plus Glucose Analyzer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is the subject currently self-testing for blood glucose levels?

          2. Is the subject able to provide legal, written informed consent?

          3. Is the subject willing to have fingersticks for blood glucose determination?

          4. Does the subject show an ability and willingness to follow directions of the
             Investigator and staff?

          5. Is the subject 18 years of age or older?

          6. Does the subject have a hematocrit value in the range of 20-60?

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Does the subject demonstrate a lack of compliance as determined by the Principal or
             Lead Site Investigator and/or staff?

          2. Is the subject currently participating in another clinical study of an investigational
             device or drug?

          3. Is the subject unwilling or unable to provide concurrent blood glucose level
             determinations with the YOFiMeter whenever blood glucose levels are determined at the
             Investigator's site?

          4. Is the subject, or a family member, employed by a company that develops or markets
             blood glucose level determining devices?

          5. Does the subject have any other condition or finding, which in the opinion of the
             investigator would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with
             the subject participating in and completing the protocol?

          6. Is the subject unwilling or unable to provide Informed Consent (IC)?
