  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site (up to 5 sites), single-blinded, randomized trial. Up to 88
      subjects will be enrolled and randomized to one of four treatment groups (4 Groups of 22
      subjects), and will receive study treatments based on their assigned treatment group.
      Following study treatments, follow-up visits will occur at 90, 180 and 365 days from each
      subject's last study treatment.

      Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA) and Patient Self-Assessment (PSA) scores, assessing
      severity of erythema, will be obtained prior to study treatment to confirm subject
      eligibility. Enrolled subjects will receive up to three dual-depth treatments to affected
      areas of the midface (cheeks, chin, forehead, glabella and nose) each treatment provided
      approximately 2 weeks apart. Groups A and B will receive low-density treatment, and Groups C
      and D receive high-density treatment. Groups A and C will receive 2 treatments. Groups B and
      D will receive 3 treatments. Protocol amended Sept 2014: Groups A and C will receive 1
      treatment; Groups B and D will receive 2 treatments.
