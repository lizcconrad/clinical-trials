  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular Graft Versus Host Disease (OGVHD) is a serious potential complication of allogeneic
      bone marrow transplants. The usual treatment is topical cyclosporine but when the treatment
      is initiated the damage to the lacrimal glands has already taken place.

      The present study aims to prevent OGVHD in reduced-intensity allogeneic hematopoietic
      transplants by using topical cyclosporine immediately after the engraftment has been achieved
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient will start using topical cyclosporine immediately after engraftment has taken
      place (around day 14-18 after the cell infusion) and will continue to receive it for one
      year.

      All &gt;18 year old patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants performed with a reduced
      intensity conditioning regimen at our center are potential candidates for the study.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of topical cyclosporine in prevention of
      ocular versus graft disease when its use is indicated immediately after the engraftment has
      occured.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular graft versus host disease is manifested by dry eye syndrome and disruptions in corneal integrity. The study will asses the efficacy of topical cyclosporine for preventing OGVHD manifestations</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after engraftment</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will start using ocular topical cyclosporine at the day of engraftment (around 14-16 days after cell infusion) and will continue to use it for one year.
The following landmarks will be evaluated:
First evaluation of a new patient with the ophtalmologist: The patient will be evaluated by a qualified ophtalmologist before the allogeneic stem cell transplant with the following tests: Corneal integrity (yes or no), Schirmer test (mm), tear break up time (seconds).
Immediately after engraftment has occured (around 14-16 days after cell infusion) the patient will start using topical cyclosporine and will continue to use it for one year.
There will be monthly evaluations with Schirmer test to asses tear quiality and detect dry eye syndrome.
Every three months the patient will have a complete optalmologic evaluation as describe before</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse of hematologic disease prior to 12 months of ocular cyclosporine use</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplant prior to 12 months of continous ocular cyclosporine use will be evaluated for signs and symptoms of ocular GVHD and will be discarded from study because it is expected that systemic cyclosporine will also be suspended.</description>
