    <textblock>
      One of the main goals of the respiratory physical therapy is to help people who are suffering
      from accumulating of secretions in their airways and lungs.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients are often hospitalized with an Acute
      Exacerbation of their medical condition.

      Those patients usually get only the standard medical care during the acute phase and don't
      get respiratory physical therapy treatment.

      The study's main aim is to investigate if respiratory physical therapy treatment in addition
      to standard medical care during the acute phase, can improve the respiratory and medical
      condition and reduce hospitalization stay.

      In order to do so we will compare three groups of COPD patients during acute exacerbation;
      two groups will get one out of two respiratory physical therapy techniques; manually or
      Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilator (IPV) in addition to standard medical care and the third
      group will get standard medical care alone.
