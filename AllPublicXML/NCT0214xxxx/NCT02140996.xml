  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In epithelial cancer, MUC-1(mucin-1) overexpression is thought to disrupt E-cadherin
      function, leading to anchorage-independent tumor cell growth and metastases. Elevated levels
      of MUC-1 expression have been found in patients with epithelial cancers of breast, ovarian,
      colon and lung. Furthermore, overexpression of MUC-1 is independently correlated with adverse
      clinical phenotypes, metastases and resistance to chemotherapy. In animal models, suppressing
      the expression of MUC-1 reduces the rates of growth and metastasis and increases the
      sensitivity of the cancer to chemotherapy-induced cell death.

      In this study, an adenoviral Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector encoding a fusion protein in which
      the hMUC-1 epithelial antigen is attached to the CD40L (CD40 ligand). The preclinical results
      have also shown that two subcutaneous Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector injections can induce
      immunity through activation of dendritic cells and promotion of antigen specific B cells or
      antigen specific CD8 effector T cells which suppresses the growth of hMUC-1 tumor cells in
      100% of the vaccinated mice without Interleukin (IL) 2 stimulation being required, this
      suggests that the Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector prime-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L protein boost has the
      potential to be an effective vaccine in epithelial tumors. Therefore, the safety and
      tolerability of the Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L vector vaccine will be tested in this phase I
      non-randomized open label dose escalation trial for men or women with metastatic or recurrent
      epithelial cancers of the lung, breast, ovary, prostate and colon.

    <description>Traditional 3+3 dose escalation scheme is employed for this trial. This trial has 6 cohorts with 3 subjects for each cohort. Subjects in the 1st cohort will receive the lowest planned dose of the vector, 1 x 10^9 VP. If no patient in the 1st cohort experiences Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), a 2nd cohort will receive 1 dose of 1x10^10 VP. Similarly, if no DLT occurs in the preceding cohorts, the dose escalation will continue with the 3rd cohort receiving 1 dose of 5 x 10^10 VP and the 4th cohort receiving 1 dose of 1x10^11 VP. Following completion of the 4th cohort, the toxicity of adding 1 or 2 booster injections at 7 and 21 days following the 1st vector injection will be tested in the 5th and 6th cohorts. The dose of each of the 2 or 3 vector injections administered in the 5th and 6th cohorts will be the top dose tolerated in the first 4th cohorts. If DLT is encountered in the first 3 patients in cohorts 5 or 6, then additional patients will be added to each of these cohorts.</description>
