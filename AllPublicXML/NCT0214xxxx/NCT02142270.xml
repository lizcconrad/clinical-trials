      Background The burden of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in Africa is unknown. Our aim is to
      assess the epidemiology of SCD in Africa. Methods The sub-Saharan Africa SCD study is a
      prospective, multicenter, community-based registry monitoring all cases of cardiac arrest
      occurring in victims &gt; 15 years old. Investigators will use the definition of established SCD
      if an unexpected death without obvious extracardiac cause, occurred with a rapid witnessed
      collapse, or if unwitnessed, occurred within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms; probable SCD
      if an unexpected death without obvious extracardiac cause occurred within the previous 24
      hours. After approval from institutional boards, Investigators will record demographic,
      clinical, electrocardiographic and biological variables of SCD victims (including survivors
      of cardiac arrest) in several sub-Saharan African cities. All deaths occurring in residents
      of districts of interest will be checked for past medical history, circumstances of death,
      and autopsy report (if possible). Investigators will also analyze the employment of
      resuscitation attempts during the timeframe of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in various patient
      populations throughout countries. Conclusion This study will provide comprehensive,
      contemporary data on the epidemiology of SCD in sub-Saharan Africa and will help in the
      development of strategies to prevent and manage cardiac arrest in this region of the world.
