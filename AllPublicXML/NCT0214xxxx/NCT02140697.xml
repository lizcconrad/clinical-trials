      Obesity is a major health issue worldwide; there is a constant raise in obesity related death
      each year. In vitro and animal studies elucidated Hippophae rhamnoides L. Leaf Extract as a
      novel anti-obesity agent. However, the efficacy and safety of Hippophae rhamnoides L. Leaf
      Extract supplementation on body weight regulation in humans are lacking.

      The investigators performed a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Hippophae rhamnoides L. Leaf Extract on body
      fat. The investigators measured Body Fat Mass, Percent Body Fat, Fat Free Mass, weight, and
      body mass index.
