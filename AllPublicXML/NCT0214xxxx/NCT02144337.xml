  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the feasibility of a physical activity intervention called the Steps
      To Active Kids (STAK) programme in children aged 9 - 11 years with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
      (T1DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The STAK programme promotes physical activity in children who have a chronic condition, low
      levels of physical activity, are overweight or who lack confidence to take part in physical
      activity. The intervention involves an Activity Diary, circuit training, pedometer step
      counting, daily physical activity monitoring and goal setting to promote long-term increases
      in physical activity and its associated health benefits. This randomised single-centre
      feasibility study will test whether the STAK programme is feasible for children with T1DM, in
      terms of acceptability, attractiveness and compliance and a qualitative process evaluation
      will aid the assessment of feasibility.

    <description>Steps To Active Kids (STAK) programme (6 weeks) includes: StreetDance DVD designed to be completed at home (4 weeks in total). A dance routine is taught over 4 weeks with new elements introduced each day. Activity diary aims to encourage children to record daily activities in a logbook and to educate children about physical activity. Step counter: Children are given a pedometer and encouraged to record steps in the activity diary and to set personal goals to increase their steps. Weekly group activity sessions for 4 - 6 weeks. Involve a circuit of activity stations varying in intensity. The group sessions are designed to be fun and non-competitive. Children can record their scores at each station and monitor their own progress.</description>

Scores are summed to form a total score for physical activities (possible range 41-123). Higher values represent higher physical activity (i.e., better outcome).</description>

The 19-item CSAPPA scale measures children’s perceived adequacy, predilection and enjoyment towards physical activity. Each item is scored from 1 to 4 and total CSAPPA scores range between 19 – 76 with higher scores indicative of greater self-efficacy (i.e., better outcome).
Total score calculated as the sum of all sub-scales (CSAPPA adequacy + CSAPPA predilection + CSAPPA enjoyment)</description>

The measure comprises a behaviour subscale and a worry subscale.
Total score calculated as the sum of both sub-scales (PHFS Behaviour + PHFS Worry).
Scores range from 0-104. Higher score indicates greater fear of hypoglycaemia (i.e., worse outcome).</description>

          <description>11 items on the PHFS-behaviour subscale assess the behaviours that parents may engage in as a result of fear of hypoglycaemia (e.g., ‘avoid having my child being alone when his/her sugar is likely to be low’). Items refer to diabetes management behaviours parents may perform to reduce the chance of hypoglycaemia, the tendency to keep blood glucose levels high to avoid hypoglycaemia and behaviours aimed at avoiding the negative consequences of hypoglycaemia.
Scores range from 0-44. Higher score indicates more hypoglycaemia avoidance behaviours (i.e., worse outcome).</description>

Items on the worry subscale assess worry about hypoglycaemia occurring when the child is alone or when there is no food or drink available, worry about the child having an accident or physical injury, and worry about the child being unable to function normally. Scores on the worry subscale range from 0-60. Higher score indicates greater worry (i.e., worse outcome).</description>
