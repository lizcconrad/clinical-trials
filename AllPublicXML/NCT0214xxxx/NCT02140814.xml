  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of administering niacinamide to
      patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, to develop methods to assess the
      biological efficacy of niacinamide, and to perform a preliminary exploration of its clinical
      effect on kidney cyst growth and kidney function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3. Vitamin B3 is found in many foods including yeast, meat,
      fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, beans, and cereal grains. Recent studies in mice have
      shown that niacinamide, at high doses, may slow kidney cyst growth from polycystic kidney
      disease (PKD).

      By doing this study, the researchers will determine if a larger, long-term study to test
      whether niacinamide slows progression of PKD is justified.
