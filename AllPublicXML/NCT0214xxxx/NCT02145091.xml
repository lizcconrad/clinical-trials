  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled study investigating the acute and persisting
      effects of psilocybin on meditation, spirituality, health, well-being, prosocial attitudes,
      and brain functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use questionnaires and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
      examine the acute and persisting effects of psilocybin on brain function, meditation,
      spirituality, and psychology. The majority of the study procedures -- including screening,
      preparatory meetings, placebo and psilocybin sessions, and a large battery of behavioral and
      psychological measures -- will be conducted at our laboratory at the Behavioral Pharmacology
      Research Unit (BPRU) on the Johns Hopkins Bayview campus. The brain imaging procedures will
      be conducted at F.M. Kirby Research Center at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI).

    <description>Participants will complete two all-day study sessions, the first with placebo and the second with a moderately-high dose of psilocybin.
Preparation will include two days of screening and 8 hours of session preparation over at least 2 days, before the first all-day session. Follow-up will consist of an interview and MRI scan one day after each all-day session, a questionnaire follow-up 2 months after each all-day session, and a final follow-up 12-18 months after the second all-day session.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will complete three all-day study sessions, the first two with placebo and the third with a moderately-high dose of psilocybin. The majority of participants (over 90%) will be assigned to either one or two all-day sessions. A small minority of participants (less than 10%) will be assigned to three all-day sessions.
Preparation will include two days of screening and 8 hours of session preparation over at least 2 days, before the first all-day session. Follow-up will consist of an interview and MRI scan one day after each all-day session, a questionnaire follow-up 2 months after each all-day session, and a final follow-up 12-18 months after the third all-day session.</description>

    <description>This is an optional arm consisting of two sessions where either placebo, a very-low dose of psilocybin, or a moderately-low dose of psilocybin will be administered. During each session, participants will undergo MRI scanning shortly after the administration of each dose. Study sessions may occur over one or two days. Participants who have previously completed an all-day session with psilocybin in this study will be eligible to volunteer for this arm.</description>
