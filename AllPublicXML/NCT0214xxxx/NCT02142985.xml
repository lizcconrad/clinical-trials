  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular filling is the main treatment of hypovolemia. Hypovolemia diagnosis can be difficult
      in some situations and need to be confirmed with other investigations such as semi invasive
      cardiac output measurement based on the Flo-Trac receptor and the Vigileo monitor.

      Venous oxymetry based on the ScvO2 values represent a valuable way to predict responsivness
      to fluid filling maneuver in patients with hemodynamic instability.

      Vascular filling represent the milestone of the treatment of hypovolemia. Its main objective
      is to restore vascular volume and correct perfusion issues preventing the deleterious
      consequences of prolonged shock.

      Hypovolemia diagnosis is easy to made in obvious clinical situations such as hemorrhagic
      shock, deshydratation..., but there still many diagnostic difficulties regarding latent
      hypovolemia especially if associated with left ventricular dysfunction.

      In this situations, diagnostic of hypovolemia is hard to made and other investigations are
      needed.

      Central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary occlusion artery pressure (PAPO) are the mainly
      used parameters for indicating vascular filling but actually many studies underline their low
      liability in this situation.

      Many other non invasive and semi invasive techniques are under investigations, such as the
      cardiac output measure from the pulse wave detected from an arteria radial catheter via a
      specific receptor (Flo-Trac Edwards) connected to a monitor (Vigileo) and that did not need
      calibration.

      After vascular filling, outcome measurment is needed to evaluate the efficacity of the
      treatment.

      Outcome measurment based on hemodynamic criteria is still insufficient. In fact, tissue
      hypoxia persists if the cardio - respiratory system did not adapt to the metabolic needs,
      that's why a pathway based on therapeutic objectives like venous oxymetry is needed.

      Theorically, a filling maneuver is beneficial if associated with a ScvO2 amelioration. It
      reflects the amelioration of cardiac output and predicts the positive responsivness to the
      filling test.
