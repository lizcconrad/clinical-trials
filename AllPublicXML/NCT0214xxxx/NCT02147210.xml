  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal purpose is the study of the regulation of the expression of ephrin-B1 by
      immunofluorescence in kidney biopsies of patients with Chronic transplant glomerulopathy
      (CTG) compared to biopsies prior to the CTG, in same patients. Level of fluorescence in CTG
      biopsy will be the experimental reference value.

    <textblock>
      Chronic transplant glomerulopathy (CTG) is a specific lesion of kidney transplantation and a
      poor prognostic factor affecting transplant survival. Diagnosis remains only microscopic and
      lesions are irreversible. Recent studies prove that there is a strong correlation between CTG
      and antibody mediated rejection (AMR) with a possible link with chronic aggression of the
      endothelial cell. However, for unknown reason, all AMR does not lead to a CTG. Our recent
      data on mice demonstrated that ephrin-B1 is expressed in the glomerular endothelial cells and
      knockout mice for the gene encoding ephrin-B1 develop progressively ultrastructural
      glomerular lesions close to modifications observed in CTG, as well as proteinuria and chronic
      renal failure, suggesting that ephrin B1 could participate to CTG. Moreover, in a preliminary
      study on human kidney transplant biopsy we observed decrease in ephrin-B1 immunofluorescence
      on glomerulus when CTG, even in low grade. These data, and ultrastructural modifications in
      Knock Out (KO) mice suggest that early regulation of kidney expression of ephrin-B1 in the
      glomerulus may occur during the process leading to the CTG as antibody-mediated kidney
      rejection (AMR).

      The purpose of the study is to determinate if ephrin-B1 expression is modified in CTG.

        Biopsies from patients corresponding to eligibility criteria (see below) will be selected
        from the list of kidney transplant patients followed up in the Toulouse University
        Hospital. They will be divided into two groups matched for age, sex and time of kidney
        transplantation (n = 30 for each group). Iterative biopsies are conserved in the collection
        of tissue samples of the CHU
