  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Losing weight before undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery may reduce liver fat
      content and size thereby improving surgical outcomes. This study aims to investigate whether
      a 2-week or 6-week pre-operative liquid formula low-calorie diet (LCD) reduces liver fat
      further than a conventional food diet prior to RYGB using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      The hypothesis is that the 2-week and 6-week liquid formula LCD will reduce liver fat further
      than the conventional food pre-operative diet.
