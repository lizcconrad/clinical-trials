        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have clinically diagnosed Dry Eye or Sj√∂rgren's syndrome.

          -  Good general health (defined by medication use that has not changed within the last
             month and the absence of medical conditions that are deemed confounding to the data as
             determined by the PI)

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Willing to spend time for the study; approximately 30 minutes for a visit

          -  Either gender

          -  Any racial or ethnic origin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any prescription ocular medication (such as but not limited to, glaucoma
             medications and Restasis) used within 14 days of the screening visit or started prior
             to the measurement visit(s).

          -  Current eye disease, infection or inflammation that affects the surface of the eye
             such as, but not limited to blepharitis and ocular allergy.

          -  Past eye surgery, such as, but not limited to, refractive surgery. Subjects who have
             had cataract surgery less than one year ago.
