  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When children suffer from a critical-illness, the investigators focus on resuscitating and
      saving lives. Once these children leave the pediatric intensive care unit, very little is
      known about what happens to them - how long it takes for them to recover, how families cope,
      and what factors that impede their recovery. The specific objective of this research project
      is to evaluate how children and their families recover after a critical illness.

      Research Hypotheses: Following a critical illness in children, 1) the rate and degree of
      health and functional recovery is influenced by the following factors: age, pre-admission
      co-morbid status, critical illness severity, discharge functional status, and time to
      initiating acute rehabilitation; 2) functional recovery is influenced by caregiver burden and
      health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL).

      The Specific Objective of this study is to evaluate the trajectory of health and functional
      outcomes in children following a critical illness, define poor functional recovery, and
      evaluate predictors of poor recovery.

      The Research Questions for this study are: 1) What are the health and functional outcomes in
      children affected by a critical illness, at 3 and 6 months following Pediatric Intensive Care
      Unit (PICU) discharge? 2) What defines poor functional recovery? 3) What are predictors of
      poor functional recovery in critically ill children? 4) What are the most important and
      relevant outcomes in critically ill children, from the patient and caregiver's point of view?

      Setting: Two Academic Pediatric Centres in Canada - McMaster Children's Hospital and London
      Health Sciences Centre.

    <description>Functional Health Status will be measured using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework (www.who.int/icidh/). In addition to the primary outcome measurements, the following will be assessed: Caregiver burden using the Pediatric Inventory for Parents; and Health Related Quality of Life using KIDSCREEN. The following secondary outcomes of interest will also be measured: Short-term PICU outcomes (i.e. duration of ventilation, length of stay, severity of organ dysfunction, morbidities attributable to delayed mobilization); mortality, health care utilization, and Pediatric Cerebral performance category and Pediatric Overall Performance scores in the 6 months post PICU discharge.</description>

    <description>Qualitative methodology will be used in this study to understand what is important to patients and families following survival from a critical illness, and if our selected outcomes of interest for this study are aligned with what patients and families consider meaningful and important. Patient and caregiver interviews will be conducted for this purpose in the 6 months following PICU discharge</description>

        In order to enrol children at potential risk for the outcomes of interest, and avoid
        &quot;healthier&quot; participants with short PICU stays, we considered the following: the patient
        should have: a) a minimum age (when one is expected to be ambulatory/mobilizing), and b) a
        threshold severity of illness. In order to understand how different subsets of PICU
        populations are affected by critical illness, we chose not to restrict the selection of
        patients to a specific diagnosis, nor did we exclude patients with underlying functional or
        cognitive abnormalities at baseline. This study will evaluate the epidemiology of recovery
        in a general critically ill pediatric population over time.
