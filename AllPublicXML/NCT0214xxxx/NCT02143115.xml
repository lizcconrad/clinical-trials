  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the findings of virtual (CT-colonography) with findings
      of optical colonoscopies to determine if virtual colonoscopy is suitable for colorectal
      cancer surveillance.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare, both clinically and from a cost-effectiveness
      perspective, virtual or CT-C (CT-Colonography) to standard CT scan and optical colonoscopy
      (OC). Virtual colonoscopy is a combination of a radiologic evaluation of the abdomen and
      pelvis with intra-colonic imaging. Previous research supports the concept that CT-C may be an
      effective substitute for the current OC and address limited compliance for surveillance for
      CRC survivors. Post-operative CRC surveillance strategies are effective, but depend upon
      patient compliance which is less than desired. Improved adherence is linked with greater
      cost-effectiveness as well as better clinical outcomes. CT-C possesses potential advantages:
      convenience as a single test, less risk, possibly patient preference and lower total costs.
      Costs would be reduced through direct (provision of fewer optical colonoscopies) and indirect
      means (reduction in time lost from work by patient and chaperone, etc.). When extrapolated
      across the roughly 200,000 OCs performed annually in the US for this indication reduced
      utilization of even 50% in a high unit cost procedure like OC would yield substantial savings
      without a reduction in clinical quality.
