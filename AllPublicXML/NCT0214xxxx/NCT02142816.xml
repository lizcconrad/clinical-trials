  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeting the amount of fluid given to measurements of the patients own fluid status during
      major abdominal surgery has been linked with improved speed of recovery of gut function and
      reduced length of hospital stay, mortality and complications.

      Pleth variability index (PVI) offers a noninvasive, risk and pain free alternative to more
      invasive forms of monitoring to direct how much fluid to give.

      The study aims primarily to measure and compare how much fluid is given when guided by PVI
      compared to the established techniqueÍ¾ oesophageal doppler during major abdominal surgery.

      The study will compare 40 patients undergoing major elective abdominal surgery. Patients will
      receive intraoperative fluid guided by either oesophageal doppler or PVI. Secondarily, the
      study will examine biochemical markers, length of hospital stay and how frequently
      complications occur
