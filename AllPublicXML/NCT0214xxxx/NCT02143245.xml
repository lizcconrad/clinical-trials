  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of retrieving tissue samples via an
      x-ray guided needle that is inserted into the infected tissue in the shoulder. The procedure
      using the guided needle is called a synovial biopsy versus an open tissue biopsy, which is
      done at the time of surgery. By doing the synovial biopsy prior to a revision surgery, the
      investigators hope to avoid more invasive intervention if it is not needed. Some patients may
      appear to have an infection but once the biopsy is taken and the results are read, there may
      not be an infection and therefore no need for a revision surgery.

    <measure>diagnostic accuracy of percutaneous synovial biopsy</measure>

    <description>To assess the diagnostic accuracy of percutaneous synovial biopsy (test procedure) for detection of implant-related intraarticular shoulder infections (IISI), in comparison to direct macroscopic synovial biopsy, from either arthroscopic or open procedures (the reference standard).
To address the primary objective, standard diagnostic accuracy statistics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio) will be derived, comparing lab results from percutaneous synovial biopsy specimen collection to those of the reference standard test (open/arthroscopic).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous shoulder surgery including hemiarthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty or
             reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, or internal fixation for shoulder fractures

          2. Suspicion of infection, including acute fever and complaints of pain and/or stiffness
             post operatively

          3. Revision shoulder surgery for patients described in (1)

          4. Provide consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. signs or symptoms of bacteremia or sepsis requiring urgent treatment, which would
             preclude the possibility of synovial biopsy

          2. Unable to speak or read English/French

          3. Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent
