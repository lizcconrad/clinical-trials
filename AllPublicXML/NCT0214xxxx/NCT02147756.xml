    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare structural changes in the skin caused by the CO2RE
      device versus the Repair.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CO2RE is a fractional CO2 system that enables, precise, effective and simultaneous
      treatment of the skin's surface, middle, and deep dermal levels then seamlessly performing
      traditional CO2 resurfacing and laser excision of lesions with precision-control over the
      intensity, pattern, and depth of ablation.

      RePair is a 10,600nm fractional CO2 laser system that targets aging and sun-damaged skin with
      microscopic laser columns that penetrate deep into the skin to expedite the body's remodeling
      of collagen.

    <description>The histological performance of the RePair and CO2RE devices post single treatment will be evaluated at different time points in healthy subjects scheduled for abdominoplasty procedure.
Subjects will be randomly assigned to three different time-points of laser treatment: immediately, 1 week or 4 weeks prior the scheduled abdominoplasty.</description>

    <description>Fractional CO2 laser system that utilizes a sealed off, all metal carbon dioxide gas tube that is Radio Frequency (RF) excited and air cooled, emitting light at a wavelength of 10.6 μm with programmable pulse duration and frequency. The system has a programmable 2 axis scanning laser beam device that allows the physician to select the skin area coverage from a selection of predetermined patterns in different sizes based on the skin area to be treated. The versatility of the fractional CO2RE system enables precise, effective and simultaneous treatment of the skin's surface in the middle, and deep dermal levels.</description>

    <description>Fractional CO2 system that comprises an infrared laser controlled by an embedded processor and a handpiece that directs the laser treatment. The device laser has a wavelength of 10.6μm and its tissue chromophore is water. It delivers multiple low energy pulses in microscopic spots as the handpiece glides over the skin surface. The selected energy determines the depth and width for each microscopic treatment zone (MTZs).</description>

    <description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to three different time-points of laser treatment: immediately, 1 week or 4 weeks prior the scheduled abdominoplasty. Subjects will be required to attend between 2 to 3 visits depending on the interval between the treatment and the abdominoplasty procedure. One side of the abdomen will be treated using the CO2RE device and the other side with the RePair device. The investigator will also leave an untreated area (control).
Punch biopsies will be obtained before or during the abdominoplasty procedure from the two treated areas (CO2RE and RePair) and one control (un-treated) areas (on the abdominoplasty area) for histological evaluation.</description>
