    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response at Day 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response defined as a decrease of at least 3 points in Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) score. The HBI consists of only clinical parameters (general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass, and complications): The first 3 items are scored for the previous day. Patients with Crohn's disease who scored 3 or less on the HBI are very likely to be in remission. Patients with a score of 8 to 9 or higher are considered to have severe disease.</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life (EuroQol) 5 Dimensions 3 Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) Index Score: Change From Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and consists of 2 components:
The EQ-5D-3L Index Score has five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with 3 levels of severity for each dimension ('no problems', 'some problems', and 'extreme problems'). The level of severity reported on each of the EQ-5D-3L dimensions determines a unique health state. Health states are converted into a weighted health state index. These weights lie on a scale on which full health has a value of 1 and dead has a value of 0.
The EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS) is a 20-cm scale with endpoints labeled &quot;best imaginable health&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health&quot; anchored at 100 and 0, respectively.
A positive change represents an improvement in HRQoL. Mean Baseline and mean change from Baseline to Week 12 in the EQ-5D-3L Index Score are presented.</description>

    <measure>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality-36 (IBDQ-36) Questionnaire Overall Score: Change From Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IBDQ-36 is used to assess the HRQoL related to bowel symptoms. The IBDQ-36 overall score is calculated as the sum of thirty-six items, each scored on a 1 to 7 likert point scale, and ranges from 7 to 252. The highest score indicates the best HRQoL related to bowel symptoms. A positive change in IBDQ-36 overall score indicates an improvement in HRQoL due to inflammatory bowel disease. Mean Baseline and mean change from Baseline to Week 12 in the EQ-5D-3L VAS are presented.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Impact Scale for Daily Use (D-FIS): Change From Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The D-FIS is used to measure the impact of fatigue on the daily lives of persons. The D-FIS overall score was calculated as the sum of eight items, each scored on a 0 to 4 point scale, and ranges from 0 to 32. A higher score indicates a higher impact of fatigue on daily life. A negative change in D-FIS Overall Score means an improvement in HRQoL due to fatigue. Mean Baseline and mean change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life (EuroQol) 5 Dimensions 3 Levels Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) Index Score: Change From Baseline to Week 12</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and consists of 2 components:
The EQ-5D-3L Index Score has five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with 3 levels of severity for each dimension ('no problems', 'some problems', and 'extreme problems'). The level of severity reported on each of the EQ-5D-3L dimensions determines a unique health state. Health states are converted into a weighted health state index. These weights lie on a scale on which full health has a value of 1 and dead has a value of 0.
The EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS) is a 20-cm scale with endpoints labeled &quot;best imaginable health&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health&quot; anchored at 100 and 0, respectively.
A positive change represents an improvement in HRQoL. Mean Baseline and mean change from Baseline to Week 12 in the EQ-5D-3L Index Score are presented.</description>

        <description>The IBDQ-36 is used to assess the HRQoL related to bowel symptoms. The IBDQ-36 overall score is calculated as the sum of thirty-six items, each scored on a 1 to 7 likert point scale, and ranges from 7 to 252. The highest score indicates the best HRQoL related to bowel symptoms. A positive change in IBDQ-36 overall score indicates an improvement in HRQoL due to inflammatory bowel disease. Mean Baseline and mean change from Baseline to Week 12 in the EQ-5D-3L VAS are presented.</description>

          <title>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Quality-36 (IBDQ-36) Questionnaire Overall Score: Change From Baseline to Week 12</title>
          <description>The IBDQ-36 is used to assess the HRQoL related to bowel symptoms. The IBDQ-36 overall score is calculated as the sum of thirty-six items, each scored on a 1 to 7 likert point scale, and ranges from 7 to 252. The highest score indicates the best HRQoL related to bowel symptoms. A positive change in IBDQ-36 overall score indicates an improvement in HRQoL due to inflammatory bowel disease. Mean Baseline and mean change from Baseline to Week 12 in the EQ-5D-3L VAS are presented.</description>

        <description>The D-FIS is used to measure the impact of fatigue on the daily lives of persons. The D-FIS overall score was calculated as the sum of eight items, each scored on a 0 to 4 point scale, and ranges from 0 to 32. A higher score indicates a higher impact of fatigue on daily life. A negative change in D-FIS Overall Score means an improvement in HRQoL due to fatigue. Mean Baseline and mean change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>
