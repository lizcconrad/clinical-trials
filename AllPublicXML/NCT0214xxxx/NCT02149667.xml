      Sponsor is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of its total hip arthroplasty (THA) components marketed in the European Union
      (EU) . These types of studies are required by regulatory authorities for all THA devices that
      do not have medium to long-term clinical evidence available at the time of gaining approval
      to market in the EU. This study has been designed in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev 2.
