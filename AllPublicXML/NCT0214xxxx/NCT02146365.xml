      One possible mechanism of protection from pneumococcal disease with a killed whole cell
      vaccine is by altering the carriage of pneumococcus germs in the nose and throat of those who
      get the vaccine. This study will look at nasal swabs from toddlers who received a killed
      whole cell pneumococcal vaccine (PATH-wSP) in VAC-010 and compare them to nasal swabs from
      toddlers of the same age who did not receive the PATH-wSP vaccine. This information will be
      used to help further develop the PATH-wSP vaccine. The research will be done in Kenya at one
      site in Kisumu (KEMRI). The study will enroll healthy Kenyan toddlers (12-15 months of age)
      who are participating in the VAC-010 study (N=250) and whose parents provide consent for this
      study. In addition 50 healthy Kenyan toddlers of similar age who did not participate in the
      VAC-010 study will also be enrolled.

      The toddlers will be followed for 6 months and will have 5 study visits. During those study
      visits each toddler will have their nose and back of their throat swabbed. The material from
      the swab will be analyzed for the presence and type of pneumococcal and other germs. At the
      last visit, one blood sample (5 ml or approximately 1 tsp) will be obtained.

      There will be no direct benefit to the participants other than direct and immediate medical
      care as needed.

      Parents of all participants will provide written informed consent.
