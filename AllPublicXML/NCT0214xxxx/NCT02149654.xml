      Purpose To characterize the safety and clinical benefit of the Engager Transcatheter Aortic
      Valve Implantation System in a real world environment.

      Design Prospective non-randomized, non-interventional, multicenter, single-arm, post-market
      study.

      250 Patients will have the Engager bioprosthesis implanted. Patients will be followed at 1
      month, 6 months, and 12 months after the procedure. The recruitment period will be
      approximately 12 months, so the total study duration will be 24 months.

      The study objective is to characterize the safety and clinical benefit of the Engager
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation System in a real world setting.

      The primary endpoint of this study is all-cause mortality at 30 days or during index
      hospitalization.

      Secondary endpoints of this study are:

        -  Device success according to VARC2 is defined as:

        -  absence of procedural mortality (all-cause mortality at discharge, 30 days or during
           index hospitalization), AND

        -  correct positioning of the Engager bioprosthesis in the proper anatomic location, AND

        -  Engager bioprosthesis performing as intended (no prosthesis-patient mismatch and mean
           aortic valve gradient &lt; 20 mmHg or peak velocity &lt; 3 m/s, AND no moderate or severe
           regurgitation).

        -  Composite early safety (at 30 days) according to VARC2 includes the following

             -  Changes in Quality of Life as measured by the EQ5D questionnaire at baseline,
                discharge, 30 days, 6 months and 1 year

             -  Length of stay during index hospitalization (ICU and general ward)

             -  Incidence of re-hospitalization at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year

      Subject population All patients with severe aortic stenosis requiring treatment, who are
      selected by a heart team to be treated electively with the Engager Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Implantation System are eligible to be included in this study.

      Treatment The Engager Transcatheter Aortic Bioprosthesis will be implanted using the Engager
      Transcatheter Delivery System. The bioprosthesis is delivered transapically on a catheter
      during a beating heart procedure.

    <description>The Engager Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation System is indicated for use in patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis requiring aortic valve replacement and are at high or extreme risk for operative mortality or comorbidity judged by the heart team to pose an absolute or relative contraindication for conventional aortic valve replacement. The system is intended for use in patients with a life expectancy of at least one year following TAVI. The intended performance of the system is to provide relief of aortic valve obstruction without inducing significant regurgitation, thereby restoring effective hemodynamic function of the diseased aortic valve. The intended purpose of the system in this clinical study is in line with the intended purpose in the Instructions for Use.</description>
