  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled trial will examine the efficacy of reducing the number
      of chest tubes used in the postoperative cardiac surgery patient. Typically used are three
      chest tubes - two in the mediastinum and one in the pleural space, if opened. The
      investigators propose that removal of the pleural tube will not impact the rates of
      clinically significant pleural effusions post cardiac surgery. Patients will be randomized
      into two groups - one receiving the standard three chest tubes (standard), and the other
      receiving only mediastinal drains (experimental). The primary outcome will be rates of
      post-operative pleural effusions as determined by defined interventions, including insertion
      of a chest tube, thoracentesis, or return to the operating room for primary evacuation of
      pleural effusion or hemothorax. Secondary outcomes include length of hospital stay, length of
      mechanical ventilation, postoperative respiratory status, and presence/size of pleural
      effusions, as well as readmission for pleural effusion.

    <description>Standard treatment will be defined as current practice whereby two mediastinal chest tubes are used for drainage, as well as an additional pleural tube if the pleura is opened during surgery. As part of current standard practice, the pleural and mediastinal spaces will be suctioned during the achievement of hemostasis prior to the insertion of chest tubes.</description>
