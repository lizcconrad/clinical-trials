  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that adding carfilzomib to standard conditioning regimen for
      allo-HCT for advanced or high-risk hematologic malignancies will decrease post-transplant
      relapse and treatment-related mortality by decreasing severe GVHD, leading to overall
      improvement in transplant outcomes.
