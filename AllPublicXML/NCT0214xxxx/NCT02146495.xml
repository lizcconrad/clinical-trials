  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome characterized by extensive chronic pain. Today, the main
      theory argues the origin of the pain is &quot;central sensitization&quot; which is en amplification of
      processing and transferring neuronal signals. Patients usually suffers a wide range of
      symptoms: extensive pain, chronic fatigue disorders of sleep (having trouble falling asleep,
      fragmented sleep and early awakening) , mood disorders and cognitive damage. To treat the
      sleep disorder, the pain and the depuration with Fibromyalgia patients is a complex clinical
      challenge that usually requires combination of different medicines (short term analgesic +
      long term analgesics + anti-depressives and so on). Patients are also referred to other
      treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), occupational therapy treatment,
      phycisal therapy, alternative medicine and so on.

      Another such non-medical treatment is to try and modifies the patterns of activity of the
      patient's brain. One approach that draws attention in the last few years is EEG based
      neuro-feedback (NF). EEG NF is a closed circuit brain computer Interface (BCI) in which the
      patient gets a feedback from his or her own brain that signifies a certain mental state. The
      brain-patient feedback allows to train patients in performing a voluntary change of a
      dedicated brain area, such as pain related areas. In this study we intend to assess the
      effect of two different EEG-NF protocols targeting different brain areas as compared to
      placebo (sham) NF and drug therapy on pain and sleep quality measures in fibromyalgia
      patients.
