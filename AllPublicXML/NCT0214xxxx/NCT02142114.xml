  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a smaller needle size reduces discomfort
      suffered by patients both during and following intravitreal injections. It is the
      investigators belief that using a smaller size needle will help patients to be less fearful
      of intravitreal injections and more amenable to treatment. This study will also evaluate the
      effect of needle size on post injection intraocular pressure, to see if smaller needles may
      reduce wound leak and increase the intraocular pressure following injection.

      The investigators hypothesize that subject eyes injected with the smaller size needle will
      result in greater patient comfort both during and after their injection as compared to the
      eye injected with the larger needle. The investigators objective is to reduce any discomfort
      felt by patients who receive intravitreal injections. The investigators also hypothesize that
      the smaller needle will result in higher post injection pressures, and another objective is
      to determine if this can affect patient comfort and increase the risk of glaucomatous optic
      nerve damage.

    <description>Following each session of injections, the patient will be asked to fill out a short questionnaire regarding the comfort levels of the two needle sizes. Also, all subjects will be followed up by phone within 48 hours to assess any post-injection pain.</description>

    <description>As a secondary end point, pre and post injection intraocular pressure measurements will also be taken prior to each intravitreal injection by tonopen, as well as at 1-, 3-, 10-, and 30- minutes post-Intravitreal injection.</description>

    <description>Consented patients receiving monthly bi-lateral injections of the same dose of ranibizumab will have one eye injected with a 30 gauge needle and the other eye injected with a 32 gauge needle. Bi-lateral injections may be performed on the same day or with one week of each other, depending on the subject preference and their normal injection regimen. On the first visit following enrollment in the study, the eye to receive the injection from the 30 or 32 gauge needle will be determined randomly. The other eye will be injected with the other needle size (may be that day or within 1 week of the 1st injection). When the patient returns for their next set of bi-lateral injections, the eyes receiving the 30 and 32 gauge needle injection will switch.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

               -  Age &gt; 18 years

               -  Subject's normal therapeutic regimen calls for them to receive two sessions of
                  bilateral injections of the same volume of ranibizumab within the next year.

               -  Disease related considerations: None.

               -  Other considerations: Subjects who must be able to report pain scores during and
                  up to 48 hours following an intravitreal injection. Also, subjects must consent
                  to at least 5 intraocular pressure checks per eye for each injection procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          -  Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception. The following are considered
             effective means of contraception: surgical sterilization or use of oral
             contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction
             with spermicidal gel, an intrauterine device, or contraceptive hormone implant or
             patch.

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated

          -  special classes of subjects (vulnerable subjects), such as fetuses, pregnant women,
             children, institutionalized mentally disabled, or others, especially those whose
             ability to give voluntary informed consent may be in question.
