      Specific Aim 1: To determine patient compliance with a GIST surveillance program Hypothesis:
      Patient compliance with a GIST surveillance program will be low.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if EUS features of GIST, particularly maximum size, change
      significantly during a surveillance program.

      Hypothesis: EUS features of GIST, particularly maximum size, will not change significantly
      during a surveillance program.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine if EGD measures of GIST size correlate well with EUS measures of
      GIST size.

      Hypothesis: EGD measures of GIST size will correlate well with EUS measured of GIST size.
