  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to observe the perioperative course of sublingual microcirculatory
      alterations in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using cold blood
      compared with cristalloid cardioplegia. Additionally the impact of changes in hemodynamic
      parameters, blood gas, laboratory findings and standart therapy for intra and early
      postoperative period was studied. Intubation time, ICU stay, hospital stay, ICU readmission,
      morbidity and mortality were recorded.

      The microcirculatory measurements were obtained in both groups in the sublingual mucosa using
      Cytocam imaging. The probe was handheld. Different precautions were taken and steps followed
      to obtain images of adequate quality and to ensure good reproducibility.

      Images were made after induction of anesthesia (t0), before CBP 5 minutes after heparine
      (t1), 5 minutes after CBP beginning (t2), during CBP 10 minutes after crossclamp beginning
      (t3), after crossclamp ending when heart begins to beat (t4), after CBP 10 minutes after
      protamine (t5).

      Additional images were made before (tc0) and after (tc1) vasoactive medication; before (tv0)
      and after (tv1) volume administration; before (tb0) and after (tb1) blood administration,
      (FFP, PLT).

      At each timepoint adequate focus depth and contrast were noticed. Three steady images of 6
      seconds were acquired and recorded on a device controller based on a powerful medical grade
      computer which is used for image storage and analysis.

      Additionally macrocirculatory measurements were obtained at the same timepoints. Hemodynamic
      variables, temperature, blood gas, INVOS, StO2, laboratory findings and standart therapy were
      recorded. Additionally intubation time, ICU stay, hospital stay, ICU readmission, morbidity
      and mortality were studied.
