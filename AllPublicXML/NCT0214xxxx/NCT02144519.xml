  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators long-term goal is to advance the adoption and successful implementation of
      policies that promote PA and nutrition in after school programs (ASP) nationwide. The
      investigators objective here is two fold. First, the investigators will test the
      effectiveness of two promising strategies designed to 1) increase the amount of PA children
      accumulate while attending an ASP and 2) promote changes in the nutritional quality of the
      snacks served. This represents a fundamental step in establishing practice-based guidelines
      (best practices) for the uptake and achievement of public health policy goals (CA and
      Harvard). Second, the investigators will examine the barriers and facilitators to
      implementing these strategies. The expected outcome of this study is evidence supporting best
      practices for ASPs to employ to meet policy goals.

      The investigators will use a 3-year delayed treatment, cluster randomized controlled trial
      design with 20 ASPs that serve mostly low-income and minority children (approximately 1300
      children ages 6-12yrs) in Columbia, SC and address the following specific aims: Aim 1.
      Evaluate the impact of a staff-level intervention, a professional development training
      program focused on core competencies to promote physical activity, on children's physical
      activity levels; Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of a site-level intervention, a snack
      modification program that includes a discount buying program, on the quality of snacks served
      and consumed; and Aim 3. Evaluate the implementation of the staff-level and site-level
      interventions and identify organizational, staff, and setting characteristics that influence
      the process of implementing these strategies.

    <measure>Change in Percentage of Children Meeting Physical Activity Policy</measure>
    <time_frame>Spring of Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the number of children meeting the physical activity policy of 30 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The primary physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior outcome was derived via accelerometry. All children attending an ASP on unannounced measurement days had an opportunity to wear the ActiGraph GT3X+. The accelerometers were distilled using 5-second epochs. When children arrived to a program, they were fitted with an accelerometer and the arrival time was recorded (monitor time on). Before a child departed from a program, research staff removed the belt and recorded the time of departure (monitor time off). Children wore the monitors for their entire attendance at the ASPs. Cutpoint thresholds associated with moderate and vigorous activity were used to distill the PA intensity levels and sedentary behavior. Children were considered to have a valid day of accelerometer data if their total wear time (time off minus time on) was â‰¥60 minutes.</description>

          <description>All children attending an ASP on unannounced measurement days had an opportunity to wear the ActiGraph GT3X+. The accelerometers were distilled using 5-second epochs. When children arrived to a program, they were fitted with an accelerometer and the arrival time was recorded (monitor time on). Before a child departed from a program, research staff removed the belt and recorded the time of departure (monitor time off). Children wore the monitors for their entire attendance at the ASPs.</description>

        <title>Change in Percentage of Children Meeting Physical Activity Policy</title>
        <description>We will assess the number of children meeting the physical activity policy of 30 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The primary physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior outcome was derived via accelerometry. All children attending an ASP on unannounced measurement days had an opportunity to wear the ActiGraph GT3X+. The accelerometers were distilled using 5-second epochs. When children arrived to a program, they were fitted with an accelerometer and the arrival time was recorded (monitor time on). Before a child departed from a program, research staff removed the belt and recorded the time of departure (monitor time off). Children wore the monitors for their entire attendance at the ASPs. Cutpoint thresholds associated with moderate and vigorous activity were used to distill the PA intensity levels and sedentary behavior. Children were considered to have a valid day of accelerometer data if their total wear time (time off minus time on) was â‰¥60 minutes.</description>
