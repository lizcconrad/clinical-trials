  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the challenges of stem cell therapy is to understand the fate of the injected stem
      cell. By labelling various stem cells with radioisotopes their fate (homing) can be
      demonstrated. In this study, we will develop and refine the existing techniques of stem cell
      labelling to various subtypes of stem cells namely- freshly aspirated bone marrow cells,
      cryopreserved bone marrow cells, g-csf mobilized peripheral blood stem cells and umbilical
      cord cells. After testing the labelling efficacy and viability, these cells will be injected
      in to the coronary arteries of patients with myocardial infarction who have undergone a
      successful revascularization either by angioplasty or thrombolysis. Homing of stem cells will
      be demonstrated by nuclear scan after the procedure. We are adapting techniques used to label
      cells for detection of infection and bleeding using nuclear scans for in vivo scanning. Also
      we are using Technetium instead of FDG which has very little radioactivity allowing us to
      work with the current cardiac labs with out having to reconstruct the labs with special
      shielding for radioactive compounds. Real benefit of stem cells then can be explored after
      demonstrating the proper homing.

      Phase One: Four Different types of stem cells will be tested ( Freshly aspirated Bone marrow
      cells, cryopreserved cells, umbilical cord cells, Stem cells mobilised from bone marrow by
      g-csf, mesenchymal cells), and the efficacy of labelling documented and effect on viability
      noted. 3 samples of each type will be tested and the results will be documented. Different
      cells are being tried to test the efficiency of the labelling technique in different types of
      cells. This will provide the protocols for all future labelling studies. This will be
      conducted in collaboration between the stem cell department, nuclear medicine department and
      nuclear cardiology department.

      Phase Two (Clinical Study):

      This will be the pilot clinical study done alongside with the phase one study, and will enrol
      10 patients with Recent Myocardial infarction ( within 3 months) . A small fraction of
      patient's own bone marrow stem cells will be labelled with Technetium 99m HMPAO. The labelled
      cells will be administered via the intracoronary injection along with the unlabeled stem
      cells. The localization of the radio-labelled stem cells in the myocardium will then be
      detected using the conventional Gamma camera.
