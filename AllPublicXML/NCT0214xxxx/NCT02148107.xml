  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the objective of this MRD trial to investigate pharmacokinetics, pharmcodynamics,
      safety and tolerability of rising doses BI 691751 over a treatment period of 14 days to
      support the further clinical development of this LTA4H-inhibitor. Special emphasis will be
      given to detect potential effects of BI 691751 on heart rate.

             (pulse rate), 12-lead ECG (electro cardiogramm), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might prolong the QT/QTc
             interval

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking during inhouse-confinement

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more 30 g per day for males)

             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms in males) or any other relevant ECG finding at
             screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Vulnerable subjects, e.g. subjects kept in detention, soldiers, employees of the
