      -  This epidemiological trial will determine whether the implementation of a PBM program is
           safe and effective in terms of clinical outcome compared to a pre-implementation cohort

        -  Primary endpoint is a composite outcome comprising in-hospital myocardial infarction,
           stroke, acute renal failure, death of any cause, pneumonia and sepsis until discharge
           from hospital in patients before and after implementation of the PBM program.

        -  Secondary endpoints are the length of stay on the intensive care unit, total hospital
           stay and the quantitative utilization of allogeneic RBC units, platelet concentrates,
           other blood products (e.g. fresh frozen (therapeutic) plasma), coagulations factors, and
           cell saver systems during hospital stay.

        -  The primary aim is to prove non-inferiority of the intervention (PBM) group when
           compared with the control group stratified by center.

      Background: The transfusion of allogeneic red blood cell units might be associated with
      increased morbidity and mortality due to infectious, immunological, pulmonary and
      thromboembolic complications. However, transfusion practice currently varies significantly
      between hospitals and even between physicians and Patient Blood Management programs have not
      been implemented nationwide in Germany yet. Patient Blood Management (PBM) concepts aim to
      identify and optimize patients at risk of allogeneic blood transfusions, to promote
      blood-sparing techniques and restrictive transfusion practices. A rational use of red blood
      cell concentrates and safe clinical transfusion practice is mandatory. The purpose of the
      German PBM network is to evaluate the safety of a standardized, evidence-based Patient Blood
      management concept.

      Study Design and Methods: This epidemiological study is a follow-up of a study that is
      already being carried out in four German university hospitals. This new prospective,
      multi-centre trial comprises approximately 20 different hospitals of varying size and levels
      of patient care. A patient-centred, evidence-based Patient Blood Management program will be
      enrolled in each of these hospitals reforming the care of adult patients undergoing any type
      of surgery. This PBM program includes the following three main pillars: 1) preoperative
      optimization of hemoglobin levels in high-risk patients with anaemia, 2) standardization of
      transfusion practice and transfusion triggers according to evidence-based guidelines and 3)
      alternatives to transfusion of allogeneic RBC concentrates and blood-sparing techniques (like
      routine use of cell saver systems, point-of-care diagnostics, optimized coagulation
      management, restrictive blood sampling).
