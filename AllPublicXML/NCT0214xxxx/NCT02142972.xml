      The aims of this study are to investigate whether pelvic pain and low back pain disability
      are associated with postpartum depression and to compare the prevalence between women without
      Low back pain and disability and women with Low Back Pain (LBP) and disability every
      trimester, and correlate postpartum Depression and some clinical and biopsychosocial
      variables: subgroups of LBP, disability, pain intensity, pain widespread and nationality, in
      a cohort of Spanish women at 2 months postpartum.

      295 pregnant women will formed the cohort, during all pregnancy and two months after
      delivery. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to evaluate depressive symptoms
      at 2 months postpartum. The LBP will be evaluated based on self-administrated questionnaire,
      and the patients with LBP will be classified in to lumbopelvic groups according to mechanical
      assessment of the lumbar spine, pelvic pain provocation tests, standard history, pain
      intensity on visual analogue scale, spread of pain through pain drawings and Oswestry index
      was used to evaluated the disability. Logistics regression analysis will performed to explain
      the predictors of depression.

    <description>Depressive Symptoms is assessed through the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (translation - Spanish). It´s a 10-item self-report scale specifically designed to screen for postpartum depression. The scale rates the intensity of depressive symptoms present within the previous 7 days. A cutoff score of ≥10 in the tests is to be used for screening purposes in primary care. When selecting this threshold the sensitivity for detection of major depression increased to almost 100% and the specificity to 82%. The participants filled it in at the first visit and two months postpartum.</description>

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to assess pain intensity (0-100 mm, where &quot;0&quot; corresponded to &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; to the worst imaginable pain).All participants were evaluated during all their pregnancy: in the first trimester (for 12 to 16 weeks), in the second trimester (for 22 weeks) and in the third trimester (for 36 weeks)</description>

    <measure>Low back pain disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of pregnant up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disability is measured with the Oswestry Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) to compare the prevalence between women without LBP and disability and women with LBP pain and disability every trimester. All participants were evaluated of low back disability during all their pregnancy: in the first trimester (for 12 to 16 weeks), in the second trimester (for 22 weeks) and in the third trimester (for 36 weeks).</description>

    <measure>Pain drawing area</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of pregnant up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed detailed pain drawings representing a human body (American Academy in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. 2001) to assess pain location (lumbar, pelvic and symphysis pubis). To score the spread of pain, these human body views are uniformly divided into a total of 220 squares, each measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm. .</description>
