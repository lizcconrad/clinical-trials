      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate of Trametinib when
      administered orally to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of on tumor response will be determined using the International Myeloma Working
      Group uniform response criteria by analyzing changes in serum and urine values of monoclonal
      protein immunoglobulin kappa and lambda free light chain and ratio, microglobulin, lactate
      dehydrogenase, hemoglobin and C-reactive proten.

        plasma cells and/or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma required.) c Evidence of end-organ damage
        that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder, specifically,
        one or more of the following: (i) Hypercalcemia: serum calcium &gt;11.5 mg/100 mL (ii) Renal
        insufficiency: serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL (iii) Anemia: normochromic, normocytic with a

             electrophoresis (ii) If neither serum nor urine M-protein meet the criteria above,

             as a female who has not been in natural menopause for the previous, consecutive 24
             months, or undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophortectomy. Women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 24 hours before the
             initiation of TMTB therapy.
