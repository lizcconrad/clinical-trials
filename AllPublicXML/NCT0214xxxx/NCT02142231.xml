    <textblock>
      Test anxiety is a well-known phenomenon in general population, but only few scientific
      advances have been made in order to fully understand and prevent this circumstance.

      The number of students which use neuro enhancement to improve their performance and to
      prevent test anxiety, is increasing. A US-survey estimated that almost 7% of students in US
      universities have used prescription stimulants against anxiety, and that on some campuses, up
      to 25% of students had used them in the past year.

      Acupuncture might act as an alternate. Several trials could demonstrate, that different forms
      of acupuncture could relieve symptoms of pre-exam anxiety syndrome significantly and that
      this therapy was highly safe. In special, the investigation of single point effects in test
      anxiety could be of general interest. The acupuncture point with the most convincing evidence
      up to date is Heart 7. Yet, its effectiveness has mainly been chosen in combination with
      other acupuncture points and not as single remedy in test anxiety. Therefore we establish a
      trial investigating the immediate needling effects at Heart 7 on the reduction of test
      anxiety.

      Therefore qe implemented a validated stress test, the Trier Social Stress Test TSST, which is
      known to provoke serious stress responses in healthy subjects. 24 medical students with test
      anxiety in there history will be randomised to two interventional groups (verum acupuncture
      and laser acupuncture), being treated and then pass this test. Main outcome is the increase
      of cortisol in saliva, which is the standardized measure of stress response used in this
      paradigm.

    <description>Subjects and Therapists are blinded. Instead of a real Laser Acupuncture device (able to elicit physiologic responses) them is given a sham-laser device only radiating non-energetic red LED-light. Without palpation, therapists treat the acupoint Heart 7, on both wrists, each for 1 minute, with additional 18 minutes of resting time after.</description>

    <description>Therefore a laser irradiation is faked, approaching a nonfunctioning laser pen, which has been deactivated by the manufacturer (3B Scientific GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Only red light is emitted. To further emphasize the imaginary power of this sham procedure, visual and acoustic signals accompany the red light emission. Patients are treated at the same acupuncture points as in the acupuncture group for one minute without skin contact. The resting time after treatment is 18 minutes.</description>
