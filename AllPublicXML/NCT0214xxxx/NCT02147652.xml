  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of agitation include abuse or aggressive behaviour toward self or others,
      appropriate behaviour performed with inappropriate frequency, or behaviours that are
      inappropriate according to social standards. In the later stages of dementia agitation can
      contribute significantly to patient distress and caregiver stress, and has been associated
      with poor quality of life. Previous research studies have shown some evidence that
      personalized music played in daily care situations reduces agitation. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effects of personalized music therapy via headphones on agitation
      during hygiene care (grooming).

      This study will involve 60 in-patients of the Geriatric Psychiatry ward of Toronto
      Rehabilitation Institute. The study would take place over the span of 2 weeks and would
      involve listening to personalized and either non-personalized or no music during daily
      hygiene care (grooming). Enrolment is completely voluntary and all personal data obtained
      will remain confidential.

    <description>Changes in agitation as measured by the Pittsburgh agitation questionnaire and &quot;as needed&quot; psychotropic medications for agitation required during hygiene care will be quantitatively assessed. Statistical analyses will be performed to compare levels of agitation and use of &quot;as needed&quot; psychotropic medications for agitation with personalized music therapy with headphones and non-personalized music intervention or usual care.</description>
