    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of natalizumab (BG00002,
      Tysabri®) in the study population (Russian participants with relapsing remitting multiple
      sclerosis). The secondary objectives are to look at evaluation of severity of relapse,
      hospitalization and steroid use requirement; Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),
      functional tests, quality of life self-assessment questionnaires including the short form
      health survey self-assessment questionnaire (SF-36) and multiple sclerosis impact scale 29
      (MSIS-29), evidence of MRI disease activity, participants free of disease activity (clinical
      activity and/MRI activity) and anti JC Virus (JCV) antibody evaluation.

    <measure>Changes from baseline in nine hole peg test (9HPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>A brief, standardized, quantitative test of upper extremity function. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice. The participant is seated at a table with a small, shallow container holding 9 pegs and a wood or plastic block containing 9 empty holes. On a start command when a stopwatch is started, the partipant picks up the 9 pegs one at a time as quickly as possible, puts them in the 9 holes, and, once they are in the holes, removes them again as quickly as possible one at a time, replacing them into the shallow container. The total time to complete the task is recorded</description>

    <measure>Changes in Timed 25 foot walk from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>A quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. It is the first component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) to be administered at each visit. The participant is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the participant has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the participant walk back the same distance. Assistive devices may be used</description>

    <measure>Changes in cognition as assessed by the Symbol digit modalities test (SDMT)</measure>

    <description>A simple substitution task that gives the examinee 90 seconds to pair specific numbers with given geometric figures. Examinees can give either written or spoken responses, making the test well suited for use with individuals who have motor disabilities or speech disorders. Because it involves only geometric figures and numbers, the SDMT is relatively free of cultural bias and can be administered to individuals who do not speak English.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be natalizumab naïve.

          -  Must have a documented diagnosis of a relapsing remitting form of MS as defined by the
             revised McDonald Committee criteria (Polman et al., 2011)

          -  Must have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year:

          -  Must be stable in disability for at least 30 days prior to enrollment to the study

          -  Must be stable in symptomatic management of the disease, specifically spasticity,

          -  Must be considered by the Investigator to be free of signs and symptoms suggestive of
             Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) based on medical history, physical
             examination, or laboratory testing.

          -  Must be willing to discontinue and remain free from concomitant immunosuppressive or
             immunomodulatory treatment (including IFN-beta and Glatiramer Acetate) while being
             treated with natalizumab during the study.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

        Medical History:

          -  Onset of a relapse within 50 days prior to first infusion.

          -  Considered by the Investigator to be immunocompromised, based on medical history,
