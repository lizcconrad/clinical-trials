    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study that will be conducted in healthy volunteers. Multiple
      cohorts of volunteers will receive ascending (increasingly higher) oral doses of AG-348 daily
      for 14 days to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of AG-348, the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of AG-348, and the pharmacodynamic profile of AG-348
      with specific biomarkers assessed in the blood.
