      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a habit reversal based
      treatment programme (THICS, Woitecki &amp; Döpfner, 2014) compared to an intervention aimed at
      the activation of resources (STARK, Perri et al., 2014) for children and adolescents with tic
      disorders. This habit reversal treatment programme was developed at the Department of Child
      and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Cologne and has already been
      evaluated in a pilot-study (Woitecki &amp; Döpfner, 2011, 2012). The activation of resources
      treatment programme was also developed at this Department and is currently evaluated in
      different studies. Effects are expected in both interventions, but a larger effect is
      expected in the THICS treatment
