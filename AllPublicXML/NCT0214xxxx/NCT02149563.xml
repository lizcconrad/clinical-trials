      The major objective of the present study is to examine the influence of normobaric hyperoxia
      treatment on the symptoms of patients diagnosed with depression members of Clalit Health
      Services. The investigators hypothesize that normobaric hyperoxia treatment will improve the
      symptoms of patients with depression.
