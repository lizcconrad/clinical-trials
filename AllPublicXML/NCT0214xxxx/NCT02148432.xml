    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism(VTE) is the third most common cardiovascular complication among
      hospitalized patients, and can even cause death. VTE often occurs in intensive care patients
      and there had been many efforts to prevent such complication. The American College of Chest
      Physicians (ACCP) had published evidence-based clinical practice guideline for VTE
      prophylaxis.

      This study focuses on how VTE prophylaxis is being performed in both medical and surgical
      ICUs in a single University hospital, and sees the differences in such prophylactic patterns.
