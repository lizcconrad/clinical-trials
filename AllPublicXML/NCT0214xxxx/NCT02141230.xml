    <textblock>
      Following results from the first survey that forms part of the EU RMP for Alli® (RMP survey
      1; WEUSRTP3350), several amendments to the information included on the pack carton for Alli®
      (orlistat 60 mg) were recommended. The main finding from RMP survey 1 was that a large
      proportion of Alli® users had a body mass index (BMI) less than (&lt;)28 kg/m2 . (Note: the
      European indication for Alli® is adults 18 years and older with a BMI&lt;28 kg/m2.) The
      proportion of respondents overall who reported possible contraindications to Alli® use was
      relatively low. The following changes to the pack labeling were agreed and have been
      implemented: : (1) a statement, highlighting the product is only for those with a BMI of 28
      or above was added to the front of the pack; (2) wording of the BMI statement on the back of
      the pack was strengthened; (3) contraindications were highlighted in bold text; (4) the
      statement that Alli® is not for use by those under 18 years of age was modified for clarity.
      In addition, a pharmacy reminder card was made available to retail pharmacists to improve
      awareness of the prescribing information for Alli®. The survey will assess whether compliance
      with the authorized indication and contraindications among purchasers of Alli® has been
      improved after one year of marketing the revised pack labeling.
