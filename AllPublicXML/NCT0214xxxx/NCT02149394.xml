  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of ice popsicle compared with water at
      room temperature in relieving thirst in the immediate postoperative period . The hypothesis
      of the study is that ice has 20% greater efficacy than water to relieve thirst in the
      immediate postoperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that ice is effective in relieving thirst in surgical patients, because, by
      stimulating the oral receptors sensitive to cold, ice decreases the need to ingest large
      volumes of liquids to satisfy thirst. This way, the risk of bronchoaspiration due to gastric
      fullness is avoided and discomfort with dry mouth is reduced. Preliminary evidence,
      therefore, indicates that the use of ice chips have greater efficacy than water at room
      temperature in relieving thirst. However, there is no scientific evidence from controlled
      studies with results that can be generalized with respect to a safe volume and adequate
      frequency of ice administered to reduce thirst in the immediate postoperative
      period.Considering that the gold standard for the study of a symptom is based on individuals'
      perceptions and their reports, this study is justified in order to assess the effectiveness
      of ice compared with water at room temperature in relieving thirst in the immediate
      postoperative period.

    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>5 evaluations of thirst intensity every 15 minutes during the first hour postoperatively.
Thirst intensity was measured within the range from 1 to 10 in 1.0 intervals as reported by patients when orally required &quot;how thirsty are you now?&quot;according to the visual analogue scale. Zero means not thirsty at all and ten the worst thirst sensation that the patient have ever had.</description>

    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>5 evaluations of thirst intensity and satiety every 15 minutes during the first hour postoperatively. Thirst intensity was measured within the range from 1 to 10 in 1.0 intervals as reported by patients when orally required &quot;how thirsty are you now?&quot;according to the visual analogue scale. Zero means not thirsty at all and ten the worst thirst sensation that the patient have ever had.according to the visual analogue scale. Satiety was characterized as intensity of thirst = zero (0).</description>

    <description>The concealment of allocation was performed through the use of individual opaque envelopes numbered externally in sequence, containing information of the group randomly defined. This step was carried out by a researcher who did not take part in data collection.Thirst intensity was measured within the range from 1 to 10 according to the numeric visual analogue scale.The experimental group received an ice popsicle made of 10 mL mineral water.The ice popsicles were made according to the predetermined volumes and packed in the freezer of the anesthetic recovery room at the institution researched. The block of ice was supported by a stick, allowing the patients to control the intensity of cold conferred by the ice for their comfort.</description>
