      This is an open label, phase I trial, testing the combination of Tremelimumab and MEDI3617 in
      patients with metastatic melanoma.

      Description Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to
      receive tremelimumab and MEDI3617.

      After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:

      The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. The
      investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that can be
      administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have
      melanoma, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of
      the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been
      enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.
