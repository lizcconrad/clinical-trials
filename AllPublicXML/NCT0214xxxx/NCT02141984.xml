    <textblock>
      Approximately 600 pediatric patients prescribed Humira Injection in usual practice according
      to the approved Korean product label will be registered into this observational study.
      Baseline data will be obtained at enrollment including demographics, underlying diseases and
      complications especially in regard to purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, and chest
      X-ray. At routine visits for Humira Injection administration, which will occur according to
      usual medical practice, concomitant medication information and adverse events information
      will be collected for up to 70 days after the last administration of Humira.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse Events (AEs) were collected from informed consent to within 70 days following the last scheduled administration of Humira (up to 22 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either related, possible, probably not, not related, or unassessable. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <description>Active Joint Count will be assessed and collected by participating investigators in routine medical practice. Sixty-eight joints were assessed by physical examination. Active joints are defined as joints with positive results for tenderness, swelling, pain on passive motion, or limitation of passive motion. Higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>
