  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current research shows that dairy protein accelerates infant weight gain, which is a risk
      factor for later on obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, dietary protein from other
      sources haven't been studied yet. This longitudinal study will compare two complementary
      feeding regimens with dietary protein mainly from 1) meat; 2) dairy on infant growth, body
      composition and gut microbiome from 5 to 12 months of age in formula fed infants. Healthy
      infants at approximately 5 months of age will be randomized to either a meat protein, or a
      dairy protein group with complementary protein mainly from meat or dairy. Infants will
      consume one of these diets for 7 months (6-12 months of age) and infant growth, body
      composition, growth biomarkers and gut microbiome will be measured to compare between groups
      and over time.
