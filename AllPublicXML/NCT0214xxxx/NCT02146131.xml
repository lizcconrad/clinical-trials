      The purpose of this study is to compare the yield of two methods for obtaining a lung tissue
      sample: Procedure #1: standard fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) with fluoroscopy, and Procedure
      #2: ultrathin bronchoscope procedure with fluoroscopy and radial endobronchial ultrasound
      (R-EBUS). These two procedures are similar in that they both: (1) enable your doctor to look
      inside your lungs with a device called a bronchoscope, and (2) Use fluoroscopy, which is a
      technique that uses X-rays to see your lungs.

      This will give the doctor an opportunity to use either of the bronchoscopy methods described
      above and compare the tests to see if R-EBUS provides better results than standard
      bronchoscopy.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a solid lung lesion 2-5cm identified on chest CT with the intention to
             undergo bronchoscopic evaluation. If the lesion is partially solid (ie there is a
             ground glass component) then the solid portion must make up &gt;75% of the lesion and
             measure at 2-5cm.The decision to pursue biopsy will be made by the treating physician
             and agreed upon by the patient. This will include patients determined to have an
             intermediate risk of malignancy (5-65%) and those non-surgical candidate with higher
             risk lesions in need of diagnosis for alternative treatment. OR

          2. Patients with a solid lung lesion 2-5cm identified on chest CT that are surgical
             candidates with a high probability of cancer (&gt;65%) will be referred for surgical
             evaluation. If the lesion is partially solid (ie there is a ground glass component)
             then the solid portion must make up &gt;75% of the lesion and measure at 2-5cm. If the
             patient refuses surgery or if the surgeon requests a definitive diagnosis prior to
             surgery the patient will have the option to be included in this study. All sites will
             use the same online calculator to document probability of malignancy.

          3. Are at least 22 years old,

          4. Lack Bleeding disorders, and

          5. Are able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a pure ground-glass opacity identified on chest CT

          2. Patients with endobronchial involvement seen on chest CT.

          3. Patients who refuse to participate,

          4. Are less than 22 years of age,

          5. Lack fitness to undergo flexible bronchoscopy as determined by the bronchoscopist
             prior to procedure, and

          6. Are unable to provide informed consent

          7. Pregnant
