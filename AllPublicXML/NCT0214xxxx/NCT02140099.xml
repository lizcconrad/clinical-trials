  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent risk behaviours, such as violence and substance use, are prevalent public health
      concerns in Canada. Further, these behaviours often co-occur, and are associated with poor
      mental health. However, the majority of prevention programs focus on preventing single issues
      and do not consider mental health, and also neglect the importance of relationships when
      promoting positive youth development. To address this gap, the Centre for Addiction and
      Mental Health (CAMH) Centre for Prevention Science designed the Fourth R Healthy
      Relationships Plus Program, a small group program focused on the promotion of positive mental
      health and the reduction of violence and substance use, via the development of improved
      communication, interpersonal and help-seeking skills. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the Fourth R Healthy Relationships Plus program using both outcome (randomized
      controlled trial design with follow-up at pre-test, post-test, and 4, 8 and 12 months) and
      process evaluation tools.

      The primary study hypothesis is that participation in the Fourth R Healthy Relationships Plus
      program will be associated with positive growth in treatment participants' psychological
      well-being from pre-test to 12-month follow-up, as compared to control participants. In
      secondary analyses, the study will explore if treatment participants report less substance
      use, peer violence, bullying and dating violence at 12-month follow-up than control
      participants. Since certain person-level (e.g., sex, personality, executive functioning) and
      program-level (e.g., implementation quality) variables may moderate treatment-outcome
      relationships, these associations will also be explored. The final hypothesis is that
      treatment participants will report better attitudes, knowledge and assertive communication at
      post-test compared to control participants, and that these improvements will mediate the
      association between program participation and 12-month outcomes.
