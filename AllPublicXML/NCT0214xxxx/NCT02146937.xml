    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single site, single arm Phase II study to evaluate the combination of
      bicalutamide plus finasteride in men with MRI detectable significant prostate nodules
      followed on active surveillance.

      This research is being done to determine the negative re-biopsy rate as determined by
      MRI/TRUS fusion guided biopsy targeting the dominant nodule site defined by pre-treatment MRI
      following three months (90 days) of combination bicalutamide plus finasteride.

          3. Eastern cooperative group (ECOG) performance status ≤2

          4. Documented histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate (minimum 12 core
             prostate biopsy completed within 90 days of screening)

          5. Very low-risk prostate cancer as defined by:

               -  Gleason score ≤ 6

               -  PSA density ≤ 0.15 ng/mL/mL

               -  PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL

               -  Clinical tumor stage T1 (cT1) (i.e., no palpable nodule by digital rectal exam)

          2. Prior use of bicalutamide

          3. Prior use of finasteride within the past year

          4. Prior or ongoing systemic therapy for prostate cancer including, but not limited to:

               -  Second generation antiandrogens (e.g., enzalutamide, ARN-509)

               -  Immunotherapy (e.g., sipuleucel-T, ipilimumab)

               -  Chemotherapy (e.g., docetaxel, cabazitaxel)

          5. Evidence of serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric or other
             condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that could interfere with patient
             safety or provision of informed consent to participate in this study.

          6. Any psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that could
             potentially interfere with compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.

          7. Abnormal bone marrow function [absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&lt;1500/mm3, platelet
             count &lt;100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL]

          8. Abnormal liver function (bilirubin, AST, ALT ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal)

          9. Abnormal kidney function (serum creatinine ≥ 2 x upper limit of normal)

         10. Abnormal cardiac function as manifested by NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III
             or IV heart failure or history of a prior myocardial infarction (MI) within the last
             five years prior to enrollment in the study.
