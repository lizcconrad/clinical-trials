      This phase I trial studies the best dose of vemurafenib when combined with whole brain
      radiation therapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with v-raf murine
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutation-positive melanoma and brain metastases.
      Radiation therapy is an effective treatment for patients with brain metastases. Patients with
      multiple metastases are typically treated with WBRT. For patients with a few metastases, SRS
      alone can be used. Vemurafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Combining radiation treatment with vemurafenib for melanoma
      patients with brain metastases may result in improved local control and prolonged survival.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vemurafenib when combined with WBRT or
      SRS and determine a recommended phase II dose of vemurafenib to be used with WBRT or SRS in
      patients with brain metastases from melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine local control rates of the brain metastases in each arm. II. To determine the
      rates of developing of new brain metastases in each arm. III. To determine the response of
      extracranial disease. IV. To determine the overall survival rate and progression free
      survival rate. V. To determine the safety and tolerability of each arm.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vemurafenib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms
      based on the number and size of brain metastasis.

      All patients receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning 3-5 days before the
      start of radiation therapy and continuing in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM A: Patients undergo WBRT once daily (QD) for 10 doses.

      ARM B: Patients undergo SRS (gamma knife, tomotherapy, cyberknife, or megavoltage linear
      accelerator [LINAC] radiation therapy) on day 1.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up on weeks 5 or 7, 9 and 13, and
      then on months 4, 6, 9, and 12.
