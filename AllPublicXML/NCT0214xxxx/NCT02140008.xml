  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) are well established in pediatric anesthetic practice. The
      pediatric i-gel and the self-pressurised air-Q (air-Q) are new supraglottic airway devices
      for children. The i-gel is made of a soft, gel-like elastomer with a noninflatable cuff. The
      air-Q is a new single-use device that may optimise the airway seal while reducing the
      potential for postoperative complications such as sore throat. The overall structure of the
      air-Q SP is identical to the original air-Q, except with regard to the inflatable cuff. The
      aim of this randomized trial was to compare the clinical performance of the i-gel and the
      air-Q SP.
