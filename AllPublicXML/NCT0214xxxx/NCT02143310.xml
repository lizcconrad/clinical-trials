    <textblock>
      Electronic Vapour Products (EVPs) is a relatively new class of consumer products that are
      otherwise known as electronic cigarettes devices/systems. These may look like conventional
      cigarettes but do not contain tobacco.

      The 'vapour' produced by such devices typically consists of humectants (propylene glycol or
      glycerol), nicotine, water, and flavours.

      This trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an e-vapour product over two years.
