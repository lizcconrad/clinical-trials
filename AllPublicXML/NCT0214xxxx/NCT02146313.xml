  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of DMUC4064A administered
      by intravenous (IV) infusion every three weeks (q3w) to cancer participants. The study will
      employ a traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of DMUC4064A against platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Once a q3w recommended Phase 2
      dose (RP2D) is identified, two expansion cohorts (one in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
      and another in unresectable pancreatic cancer) may be evaluated to further characterize the
      safety and activity in these populations.
