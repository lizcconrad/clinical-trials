  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Several clinical studies show high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders in Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), that suggest common underlying pathogenetic mechanisms
      of COPD and depressive disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of aerobic
      exercise, proposed in the context of pulmonary rehabilitation, in a sample of COPD depressed
      patients without psychopharmacological treatment, through the correlation of some
      psychopathological variables and physical/pneumological parameters.

      Methods:

      The investigators have designed an observational longitudinal trial. The trial will be
      prospective 6-weeks randomized clinical study to evaluate the impact of aerobic exercise on
      depressive symptoms in 154 patient affected by COPD and depression, assessed by Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The investigators will also monitor anxiety, quality of life
      and neurocognitive function.

      Outcome measures:

      The investigators compare the variation of HDRS total score, as primary outcome measure, in
      two groups (A, B) of COPD depressed patients matched for: COPD status; depressive status;
      age; gender. Only the participants randomized in study group A will receive a 6-weeks aerobic
      exercise intervention.

      Statistical analysis:

      All tests are two-tailed and a p value 0.05 was considered significant. The difference
      between the two groups will be evaluated with Student's T test for normally distributed data,
      and with Mann-Whitney's U test, for those with not normal distribution. The normality of
      distribution will be evaluated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Any correlations among the
      variables under evaluation will be assessed by Spearman r correlation. Variables will be
      compared using the Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables.

      Discussion:

      There is a strong correlation between physical activity and mental health. Several data have
      suggested that aerobic exercise shows significant effects, comparable to pharmacotherapy and
      to psychotherapy, on reducing depressive symptomatology. The goal of our study is to propose
      an effective intervention to reduce the risk of severe depression in this special population,
      evaluating the variation of HDRS total score after the aerobic exercise intervention.
