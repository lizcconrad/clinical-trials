  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute consumption of dietary nitrate has been shown to improve exercise capacity in
      athletes, healthy adults and subjects with peripheral vascular disease. Many COPD patients
      have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate
      consumption, in the form of beetroot juice, might increase incremental shuttle walk test
      (ISWT) distance in COPD subjects.

      Acute consumption of dietary nitrate (as beetroot juice) has been shown to improve exercise
      capacity in athletes, healthy adults and subjects with peripheral vascular disease. Many COPD
      patients have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate
      consumption might increase incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance in COPD subjects
      compared to a matched, low-nitrate drink.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial.

      Resting blood pressure, phlebotomy and ISWT are performed. Following completion, each subject
      is randomized to consume beetroot juice or placebo. 3 hours later, the same assessments are
      repeated by the same people. After a 7d washout, the entire protocol is repeated with the
      crossover beverage.
