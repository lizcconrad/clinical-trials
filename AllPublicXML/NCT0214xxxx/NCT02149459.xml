  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent brain tumours are extremely aggressive and despite optimal treatment, median
      survival is less than two years. One of the standard treatment options in this situation is
      radiation therapy. Currently there is intense scientific interest concerning the abnormal
      energy metabolism in cancer cells. All cells require energy in order to function, obtaining
      'fuel' molecules such as glucose and fatty acids from the blood stream. Brain tumours exhibit
      &quot;metabolic reprogramming&quot;, meaning that their energy requirements and utilization of fuel
      molecules are quite different from normal cells. Brain tumour cells are exquisitely dependant
      on glucose as a source of energy. Animal studies have shown that when these tumours are
      deprived of glucose they are very sensitive to radiation therapy.

      In this clinical trial the investigators combine radiation therapy with a low-carbohydrate
      diet, in patients with recurrent brain tumours. In addition, subjects will receive medication
      with metformin, a drug usually used to treat diabetes. Metformin inhibits glucose metabolism
      within cancer cells, and additionally has reported intrinsic anti-cancer activity. Subjects
      will undergo advanced imaging and hormonal studies before, during and after the trial in
      order to obtain maximal translational-scientific impact.

      The hypothesis:

      The metabolic changes induced by the combination of a moderately-low carbohydrate diet
      combined with supplementary MCT and metformin therapy will selectively starve tumor cells.
      While normal brain cells are capable of deriving energy from ketone bodies during glucose
      restriction, tumor cells remain largely glucose-dependent for energy due to oncogene induced
      down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. While the tumor cells are in this 'vulnerable'
      state they will be less able to repair the damage induced by ionizing radiation.

      Short-term implementation of the metabolic intervention (i.e. combined diet and metformin
      therapy) prior to, during, and after hypofractionated (2 week) radiation therapy is expected
      to increase tolerability, increase compliance and avoid the chronic metabolic complications
      associated with extreme carbohydrate restriction diets.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willingness and ability to participate in diet/metformin intervention for the 8 week
             period.

          -  Patients must have a previously histologically or cytologically confirmed glioma
             (astrocytic or oligodendroglial supratentorial tumors grades 2, 3 or 4 according to
             the WHO 2007 classification 82) that has been previously treated with fractionated
             radiation therapy and now shows evidence of recurrence. There is no limit regarding
             the number / type of previous therapies that the patient has received for glioma,
             aside from exceptions mentioned below. If the brain tumor is in an eloquent location
             (e.g. brain stem) a clinical diagnosis is sufficient.
