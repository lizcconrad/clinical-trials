      This study is carried out to determine the merit and reliability of extensive intraoperative
      peritoneal lavage as a preventive strategy

      Hypothesis: EPL significantly improve the overall survival of patients by reducing the risk
      of peritoneal recurrence

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Surgery is the
      mainstay treatment for cure. Peritoneum is a common site of recurrence and the prognosis in
      patients with peritoneal recurrence is dismal. Hence, prevention is essential to patient's
      outcomes. In patients with serosal invasion, about half experience peritoneal recurrence
      within first 2 years after surgery, even after curative surgery. Peritoneal metastasis is
      caused by the implantation of free cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity exfoliated from the
      primary tumor before or during curative surgery. It is well known that cancer cells spillage
      could occur during surgery due to manipulation or even after lymph node dissection. If we can
      remove these free exfoliated cancer cells on the peritoneal lining, we may reduce the risk of
      tumor recurrence.

      Recently, a study has demonstrated a dramatic reduction of peritoneal recurrence with
      extensive peritoneal lavage (EPL) in patients who underwent curative resection of gastric
      cancer. EPL was performed after the curative operation . The peritoneal cavity was washed
      with normal saline which is then followed by the complete aspiration of the fluid. This
      procedure was done 10 times using 1 liter of normal saline. The method was based on the
      'limiting dilution theory' in which the method can dilute the number of free cancer cells to
      minimal hence reduce the risk of tumor implantation. In this study, among patients with
      microscopic peritoneal metastasis, peritoneal recurrence developed in 40% of patients with
      EPL and surgery, compared to 89.7% in patients with surgery alone. EPL carries minimal risk
      to patients. It is simple and inexpensive, and it is not time consuming. Hence, it may be an
      effective strategy for treatment of gastric cancer.
