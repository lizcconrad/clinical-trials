  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Timing of the first and last meconium stool is critical for oral feeding tolerance and proper
      gastrointestinal function. The time until premature infants pass their first meconium ranges
      from 1 hour to 27 days (median: 43 hours). Obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract by
      tenacious, sticky meconium frequently leads to gastric residuals, a distended abdomen and
      delayed food passage Recent data support the concept that complete rapid evacuation of
      meconium plays a key role in feeding tolerance . If duration to full enteral feedings is
      extended, the probability to acquire infections due to intravenous access for parenteral
      nutrition increases and hospital stay of the infant prolongates. Previously two prospective
      trials focusing on the problem of delayed meconium evacuation in preterm with different
      therapeutic pharmacological approaches were published by our group. None of the applied
      therapies appeared to be effective or had a beneficial effect- quite the contrary one agent
      (Gastrografin) was supposed to have severe negative side effects. Therefore we were looking
      for an alternative, non-invasive, holistic solution for the problem of delayed meconium
      excretion. Osteopathic treatment with the emphasis on the relationship of the structural and
      functional integrity of the body and with its variety of therapeutic manual techniques seemed
      to be remedy. Treating the abdomen of premature infants with visceral osteopathic techniques
      might be more effective to mobilize meconium from small bowel and deep parts of the colon.
      Therefore we hypothesized that repeated visceral osteopathic treatment accelerates meconium
      evacuation in premature infants, and thereby enhances feeding tolerance in this population.

    <description>Primary outcome parameter was specified as complete meconium excretion. The time to complete meconium evacuation was defined as day of life on which the last meconium was passed. The nursing staff assessed the quality of stools as &quot;meconium&quot; (black, thick, sticky) or &quot;non meconium&quot; by appearance and documented data into the electronic patient documentation system.</description>
