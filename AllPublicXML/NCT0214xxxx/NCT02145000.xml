  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, trial with two groups of
      infants receiving vaccine or placebo to assess the efficacy and safety of BRV-PV. Three doses
      of BRV-PV containing ≥ Log10 5.6 FFU/Dose of each serotype G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9 will be
      administered at 4 week intervals between doses. The first administration will occur at 6-8
      weeks of age.

      We hypothesize a difference in vaccine efficacy of three doses of BRV-PV vaccine vs. placebo
      against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in healthy infants in Niger.

      Active surveillance for gastroenteritis episodes will be conducted throughout the trial.
      Surveillance for adverse events will be carried out among all children from the time of first
      vaccination and 28 days post-Dose 3. Surveillance for all serious adverse events, including
      intussusception and death, will be conducted on all participants until they each reach two
      years of age.

      To assess the effect of prenatal nutrition supplementation on infant immune response to the
      BRV-PV vaccine, study villages in the immunogenicity sub-cohort will be randomized in a 1:1:1
      ratio to provide pregnant women with daily iron-folate, multiple micronutrients or a
      lipid-based nutrition supplement. Infants of participating women, if eligible at 6-8 weeks of
      age, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive three doses of vaccine or placebo and enter
      the main trial as part of the immunogenicity sub-cohort.
