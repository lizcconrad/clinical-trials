      A Phase I, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability, PK and
      Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity when given as a monotherapy of Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab
      in combination with MEDI4736 in Japanese Patients with Advanced Solid Malignancies, and when
      given as a monotherapy of tremelimumab in Second- or Third-line Treatment of Japanese
      Subjects with Unresectable Pleural or Peritoneal Malignant Mesothelioma

      Primary objectives Part A: To investigate the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab when
      given to Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies and define the dose(s) for
      further clinical evaluation.

      Part B: To investigate the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab in combination with
      MEDI4736 when given to Japanese patients with advanced solid malignancies and to define the
      dose(s) for further clinical evaluation.

      Part C: To investigate the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab when given to Japanese
      patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma.
