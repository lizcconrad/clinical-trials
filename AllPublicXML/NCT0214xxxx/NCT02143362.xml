    <description>Stopped Closed-loop target controlled infusion of cisatracurium and propofol 30 minutes before awaken test.
In dexmedetomidine group,dexmedetomidine infusion rate will be reduced to 0.1 μg•kg-1•h-1. In control group ,normal saline infusion will be given with the same infusion rate as dexmedetomidine group .
Call patients' name and require them to move both feet every 30 seconds after patients recovered normal respiration.
Patients will be considered to be awake when recover normal respiration and make responsive to verbal commands correctly .
Patients will receive initial anesthesia after finish awaken test.</description>
