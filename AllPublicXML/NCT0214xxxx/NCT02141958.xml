  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of a
      novel oral formulation of Fenretinide to adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, once-daily for
      21 days (treatment cycle). This study will include up to three (3) dose levels with minimum 7
      day breaks in between treatment cycles. For each dose level, blood samples will be collected
      for exploratory pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis have an innate imbalance of essential fatty acids, with
      increased arachidonic acid (AA) levels, decreased docosahexanoic acid (DHA) levels, and
      elevated AA/DHA ratio. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that this lipid imbalance is
      a primary effect in CF, playing a major role in the infection-inflammation vicious cycle that
      leads to respiratory failure. Fenretinide, a derivative of vitamin A, was shown to correct
      the AA/DHA imbalance in lungs and blood plasma in specific animal model of CF, resulting in
      reduced lung inflammation and decrease in the severity of pulmonary infections with
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

      This is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 3 increasing oral doses of Fenretinide
      compared to placebo, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Fenretinide in adult CF patients
      chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A single cohort of 16 clinically stable
      adult patients will be randomized to either Fenretinide or placebo, in a 3:1 randomization
      scheme (12 active, 4 placebo).
