        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma

          -  Subject has unresected stage lllB to IVM1c melanoma regardless of prior therapy

          -  Subject who is not eligible for or cannot access ongoing talimogene laherparepvec
             clinical trials

          -  Candidate for intralesional therapy (ie, disease is appropriate for direct injection
             or through the use of ultrasound guidance) defined as one of the following:

          -  for a subject not previously treated with talimogene laherparepvec:

          -  at least 1 injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal melanoma lesion ≥ 10 mm in
             longest diameter, or

          -  multiple injectable melanoma lesions that in aggregate have a longest diameter of ≥ 10
             mm

          -  for a subject previously treated with talimogene laherparepvec:

          -  at least 1 injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal melanoma lesion must be
             present (no minimal size criteria)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Adequate organ function determined within 35 days prior to enrollment

          -  Serum LDH levels less than or equal to 1.5 ULN within 35 days prior to enrollment

          -  For a subject who previously received talimogene laherparepvec in another clinical
             trial, subject must have ended treatment for reason(s) other than disease progression
             or intolerability to talimogene laherparepvec

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically active cerebral metastases. Subjects with up to 3 (neurological performance
             status of 0) cerebral metastases may be enrolled, provided that all lesions have been
             adequately treated with stereotactic radiation therapy, craniotomy, gammaknife
             therapy, with no evidence of progression, and have not required steroids, for at least
             two (2) months prior to enrollment.

          -  Greater than 3 visceral metastases (this does not include lung metastases or nodal
             metastases associated with visceral organs). For subjects with less than or equal to 3
             visceral metastases, no lesion &gt; 3 cm, and liver lesions must meet RECIST criteria for
             stable disease for at least 1 month prior to enrollment.

          -  Bone metastases

          -  Primary ocular or mucosal melanoma

          -  History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis,

          -  Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression

          -  Active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of HSV-1 infection (eg, herpetic
             keratitis or encephalitis)

          -  Requires intermittent or chronic systemic (intravenous or oral) treatment with an
             antiherpetic drug (eg, acyclovir), other than intermittent topical use

          -  Currently receiving treatment with another investigational device or drug study
             besides talimogene laherparepvec, or less than 28 days since ending treatment with
             another investigational device or drug study(s)

          -  Other investigational procedures while participating in this protocol are excluded

          -  Known to have acute or chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection

          -  malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for ≥
             3 years before enrollment and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by the treating
             physician

          -  adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of
             disease

          -  adequately treated breast ductal carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease

          -  prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer

          -  adequately treated urothelial papillary noninvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ

          -  Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products or components to be administered
             during dosing

          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease
             (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the investigator
             or Amgen medical monitor, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or
             interfere with the protocol evaluation, procedures or completion

          -  Female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant during
             protocol treatment and through 3 months after the last dose of talimogene
