    <textblock>
      Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily quetiapine extended release (XR) in
      patients with schizophrenia switched from other antipsychotics which were suboptimal due to
      insufficient efficacy or insufficient tolerability.

      Methods:

      This was a 12-week, open-label study conducted in the Chinese population in Taiwan.
      Quetiapine XR was administrated at 300 mg on day 1, 600 mg on day 2 and up to 800 mg after
      day 2. From day 8 until the end of the study, the dose of quetiapine XR was adjusted within
      400-800 mg per day, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patients.

    <measure>Safety Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs) will be recorded throughout the study to assess the tolerability of quetiapine XR, including AEs spontaneously reported by the patients or observed by the staff.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's vital signs and body weight will be measured at screening and every visit schedule (week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12). An electrocardiogram and laboratory measurements including hematology and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) will be performed at enrolment and week 12.</description>

    <measure>Another efficacy assessment-CGI-S</measure>

    <description>Another efficacy endpoint was the difference from baseline to the end of study in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score in the participants.</description>

    <measure>other safety assessments-the measure is a composite for EPS</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Other scales used to evaluate the extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) associated with the previous antipsychotics or quetiapine XR were Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes-Akathisia Rating scale (BARS) and Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). The use of anticholinergic medications during the treatment period will also be recorded.</description>

    <description>Patients had schizophrenia and fulfilled the criteria including having a score of 4 (moderate) or greater on any of the 7 items of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Positive Symptom Subscale and needed to switch from previous antipsychotics due to insufficient efficacy or insufficient tolerability (N=61). They will receive the intervention of administration of quetiapine XR.</description>

    <intervention_name>Administration of quetiapine XR</intervention_name>
    <description>The treatment was initiated with a 7-day cross-titration period. Previous antipsychotic medication was maintained at the original dose from day 1 to day 3; then reduced to 50% of the original dose from day 4 to day 7 and discontinued on day 8. Meanwhile, the patients started quetiapine XR with daily dose at 300 mg on day 1, 600 mg on day 2 and up to 800 mg after day 2. From day 8 until the end of the study, the dose of quetiapine XR was adjusted within 400-800 mg per day, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the patients.</description>
