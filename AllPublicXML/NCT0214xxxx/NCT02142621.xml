  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of extreme preterm birth. It
      impacts 10,000-15,000 infants in the US annually, including approximately 50% of infants with
      birth weight &lt; 1000g. BPD is associated with multiple long-term adverse outcomes including
      chronic cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental impairments. Infants with severe BPD, defined
      as a need for ≥ 30% inspired oxygen and/or mechanical respiratory support at 36 weeks
      postmenstrual age (PMA), suffer the greatest burden of these chronic sequelae. Recurrent
      episodes of hypoxemia and prolonged exposure to supplemental oxygen are linked to the
      development of these impairments. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) contributes to these
      mechanisms by exacerbating pulmonary inflammation and inducing bronchospasm. Unfortunately,
      clinically available methods to diagnose GER in infants are unreliable. Moreover, acid
      suppressive agents are both ineffective and carry high risk of serious life-threatening
      morbidity. Simple transpyloric feeding has promise, but has not been evaluated in BPD.

      This study will pilot N-of-1 trials to assess whether transpyloric feeds reduce airway
      complications of GER and and whether this methodology can aid in identifying individual
      infants with severe BPD who are likely to benefit from prolonged use of transpyloric feeds.

      Aim 1. To determine for each enrolled infant with severe BPD whether transpyloric compared to
      gastric feeds reduce the number of daily intermittent hypoxemic events (primary outcome) and
      improve a validated BPD severity score (secondary outcome).

      The investigators hypothesize that 80% percent of enrolled infants will have significantly
      fewer daily intermittent hypoxemic events with transpyloric compared to gastric feeds and
      will have this feeding method formally recommended.

      Aim 2. To pool results from multiple N-of-1 trials to determine whether transpyloric compared
      to gastric feeds reduce airway complications of GER in infants with severe BPD.

      The investigators hypothesize that transpyloric compared to gastric feeds will be associated
      overall with a 15% reduction in number of daily intermittent hypoxemic events.
