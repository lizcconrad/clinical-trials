        Inclusion Criteria:- 1. Healthy male and female volunteers aged ≥18 years to ≤50 years
        (inclusive) with suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venepuncture 2. Females could
        be of non-childbearing potential and child bearing potential Females of non-child bearing
        potential should be Post-menopausal, documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization
        by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation.
        Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and must
        not be lactating, using one of the following effective methods to avoid pregnancy during
        the treatment periods, must have an established use of oral, injected, or implanted
        hormonal methods of contraception, placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or
        intrauterine system, use a barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive cap
        (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal. Male healthy volunteers with a partner
        of childbearing potential must agree to avoid fathering a child, and refrain from donating
        sperm, from the first day of dosing until at least 3 months after last dose of
        investigational product, and therefore be either sterile (with the appropriate
        post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate) or agree to use, one
        of the following approved methods of contraception: a male condom with spermicide; a
        sterile sexual partner or use by female sexual partner of an acceptable form of effective
        contraception (see above) 3. Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥18 and ≤30 kg/m2 and weigh at
        least 50 kg and no more than 100 kg Exclusion Criteria: 1.History of any clinically
        significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, may
        either put the healthy volunteer at risk because of participation in the study, or
        influence the results or the healthy volunteer's ability to participate in the study.
        2.History or presence of GI, hepatic or renal disease including GI surgery other than
        appendectomy or any other condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution,
        metabolism or excretion of drugs. 3.Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical
        procedure or trauma within 4 weeks of the first administration of the investigational
        product. 3 History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing allergy/hypersensitivity,
        as judged by the principal investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a
        similar chemical structure or class to AZD1722 or cefadroxil. 4. Has received another new
        chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been approved for marketing) or has
        participated in any other clinical study that included drug treatment within at least 30
        days of the first administration of investigational product in this study. 5. Loose stools
        for ≥2 days in the past 7 days before investigational product administration. Use of
        medications that are known to affect stool consistency and/or GI motility, including fibre
        supplements, anti diarrheals, prokinetic drugs, enemas, probiotic medications or
        supplements; or salt or electrolyte supplements containing sodium, potassium, chloride, or
        bicarbonate formulations during the past 7 days before randomization
