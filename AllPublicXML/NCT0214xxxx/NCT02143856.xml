    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the amount of compound present in the blood (relative
      bioavailability) after a single oral administration of GLPG1205 given as a capsule
      formulation in fasted versus fed conditions in male healthy subjects.

      Also, the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of GLPG1205 given as a capsule
      formulation under fasted and fed conditions will be assessed.
