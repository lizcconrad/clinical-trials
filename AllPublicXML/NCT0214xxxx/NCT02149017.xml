  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of SNUBH-NM-333(18F), a new diagnostic
      radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of amyloid plaques, in Alzheimer's disease patients and
      healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform whole-body and brain kinetic modeling of SNUBH-NM-333(18F) and
      optimize the image acquisition procedure.

      Five young healthy subjects will be participated in Whole-body positron emission tomography
      /computed tomographic (PET/CT) scans from the midfemoral position to the head after
      approximately 5-10 mCi of SNUBH-NM-333(18F) injection. For brain PET/CT amyloid imaging,
      another five young healthy subjects will be scanned dynamically during windows of 0-180 min
      after injection of SNUBH-NM-333(18F), with arterial sampling.

      The investigators will compare different analysis methods of compartmental modeling and
      standardized uptake value ratios and determine the optimal acquisition window. And then 10 AD
      patients and 10 elderly healthy controls will also be participated in brain amyloid imaging
      to compare SNUBH-NM-333(18F) brain retention in AD patients versus healthy elderly.
