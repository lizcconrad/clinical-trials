  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of cell free DNA(cfDNA), unlike tissue biopsy, presents a new tool for the
      monitoring and treatment of cancer. The investigators have developed a differentiated
      sequencing assay, Digital Sequencing Technology (DST) that enables detection of rare genomic
      abnormalities with ultra high-specificity and sensitivity. The investigators assay is able to
      eliminate the error and distortion created by sample-prep and sequencing processes in
      standard NGS(next-generation sequencing ) workflows and produce near-perfect representations
      of all rare variants.

      The investigators have shown that in sequencing a comprehensive cancer panel of 80kbp in 0.1%
      cancer cell line titration samples, standard Illumina SBS(sequencing by synthesis ) generates
      many high-quality false positive variant calls in the range of 0.05-5%, while the
      investigators assay resulted in highly sensitive and completely error-free variant calls
      across the entire panel.

      This work indicates the remarkable potential of using the investigators assay in deep
      analysis of cfDNA, thereby allowing researchers and clinicians to comprehensively and
      non-invasively monitor the genetic dimension of cancer throughout the body.
