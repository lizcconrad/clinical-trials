  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, multinational, two-arm, open-label clinical
      trial to investigate a first-line treatment of participants with human epidermal growth
      factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. The study will enroll patients
      with HER2-positive, unresectable, locally advanced breast cancer (BC) if they have recurrent
      disease or progressive disease (PD) despite primary multi-modality therapy, and/or metastatic
      BC if they have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Eligible
      participants at up to approximately 40 sites in the Asia-Pacific region will be randomized in
      a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab emtansine (Arm A) or trastuzumab plus docetaxel (Arm B).
      All study drugs will be administered at in-clinic visits occurring every three weeks during
      the treatment phase. Trastuzumab plus docetaxel was chosen as the comparator in the control
      group (Arm B), as it represents a common first-line treatment option used in this patient
      population in China and other Asia-Pacific countries.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of clinical data cut-off (up to 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, on the basis of investigator assessments. Progression was defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Safety: Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of clinical data cut-off (up to 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

Grade 3 was defined as severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. Grade 4 was defined as life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of clinical data cut-off (up to 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) determined on the basis of investigator assessments with the use of RECIST v1.1. Tumor assessments were performed with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. CR: disappearance of all target lesions; PR: &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Objective Response Rate (OR) = CR + PR.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <description>DOR was defined as the time from the date of initial confirmed PR or CR to the date of disease progression or death within the study. CR: disappearance of all target lesions; PR: &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Disease progression was defined according to RECIST, v1.1 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 mm or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered trastuzumab plus docetaxel Q3W. Participants could remain on study treatment until investigator assessed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or Sponsor study termination occurs, whichever occurs first.
Trastuzumab: For the first three-week cycle, trastuzumab was administered IV at 8 mg/kg. For subsequent cycles, trastuzumab was administered IV at 6 mg/kg Q3W.
Docetaxel: Docetaxel was administered IV at either 75 milligrams/square meter (mg/m^2) or 100 mg/m^2 Q3W.</description>

Trastuzumab: For the first three-week cycle, trastuzumab was administered IV at 8 mg/kg. For subsequent cycles, trastuzumab was administered IV at 6 mg/kg Q3W.
