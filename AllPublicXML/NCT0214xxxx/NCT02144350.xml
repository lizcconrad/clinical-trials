  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to prospectively study the feasibility and clinical impact of
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy in acute hospitalized moderate to severe ulcerative colitis flares
      as an adjunct to standard medical treatment. Specifically, we will investigate the impact of
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy on clinical response/remission and serum and mucosal inflammatory
      markers. The investigators expect that hyperbaric oxygen therapy will improve patient
      responsiveness to steroids and avoid progression to second line therapy during
      hospitalization.

    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Impact of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on clinical response/remission to medical therapy as measured by the partial Mayo score at study day 5. Clinical remission will be defined as a partial Mayo score of less than or equal to 2 with no individual sub-score exceeding 1 point. Clinical response will be defined as a decrease in partial Mayo score greater than or equal to 2 points with a decrease in rectal bleeding sub-score of greater than or equal to 1 point, or an absolute rectal bleeding sub-score of 0 or 1.</description>

    <measure>Hyperbaric Oxygen Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after hyperbaric oxygen treatments</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of barotrauma, seizures, or claustrophobia with hyperbaric oxygen therapy will be monitored to ensure there are no safety concerns with this intervention. Patients will be assessed before and after each treatment session for any complications related to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This will be done daily until all 10 treatments are completed.</description>
