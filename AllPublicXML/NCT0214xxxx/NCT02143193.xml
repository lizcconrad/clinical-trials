  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare standard methods of stabilizing a newborn's temperature after birth
      with mother-infant skin-to-skin contact for stabilizing newborn temperature. The study will
      look at the effects of each warming method on the timing of newborns' initial bath and the
      effects on newborn initiation and percent weight loss by discharge.

      The study will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to test a clinical intervention
      at TriHealth Good Samaritan Hospital. Study participants will be randomized to the
      intervention group (IG), which will implement mother-baby Skin-to-Skin (STS) immediately
      after vaginal birth, or to the control group (CG), which will receive standard care for
      newborn and mother immediately after vaginal birth.

      This study will test the hypothesis that mother-baby STS contact implemented immediately
      after delivery for a minimum of the newborn's first 60 minutes and with a resumption of STS
      (if a 15-minute break in STS occurs at some point after the first hour) until the newborn's
      temperature stabilizes after the initial bath will result in:

        1. Improved newborn temperature stability and thermoregulation for newborns whether breast
           or formula-fed.

        2. Initiation of effective breastfeeding behavior within 90 minutes of birth and the
           addition of at least one more breastfeeding within four hours of birth for breastfed
           newborns.

        3. Avoidance of newborn weight loss of 10% or greater.
