    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      single subcutaneous dose of ASP2408 in non-elderly healthy adult male subjects. The
      pharmacodynamics of ASP2408 is also being evaluated.

      This clinical study will be conducted as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending
      subcutaneous dose study. As shown in the table below, the study will be conducted using 3
      cohorts, to which a total of 24 subjects will be randomly assigned (18 subjects receiving
      ASP2408 and 6 subjects receiving placebo). Each cohort will consist of 8 subjects, who will
      be randomly assigned to either the ASP2408 group or the placebo group at the ratio of 3 to 1.

      Each subject will need to be hospitalized until Day 8 (start date of study drug
      administration will be regarded as Day 1) and will be observed until Day 90. The investigator
      or subinvestigator will carefully observe each subject for any sign or symptom of adverse
      events.
