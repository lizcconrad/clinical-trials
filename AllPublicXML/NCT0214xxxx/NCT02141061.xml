      This study is a double-blind crossover study in female healthy volunteers to compare the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of a single dose each of two different formulations of Proellex
      for oral administration. Each formulation will be designated as either Treatment A or
      Treatment B. A total of 12 subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to
      receive either Treatment A or Treatment B as their first assigned treatment. After a 7-day
      washout period subjects will receive the alternative treatment. On the day of each treatment
      subjects will remain in the clinic overnight and undergo 72-hour pharmacokinetic assessment
      at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours after
      administration of study drug.

    <description>To determine and compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of each of two formulations of 12 mg Proellex administered orally to female healthy volunteers. On the day of each treatment subjects will remain in the clinic overnight and undergo 72-hour pharmacokinetic assessment at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours after administration of study drug.

    <description>To determine and compare the safety of a single dose of each of two formulations of 12 mg Proellex administered orally to female healthy volunteers. After the completion of the study; incidence of adverse events, mean change from baseline of laboratory values (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis), mean change from baseline of vital signs will be assessed. Vital signs and adverse events will be recorded at each visit.</description>
