    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common surgeries performed per year in the United
      States, accounting for over 600,000 surgeries. The procedure is commonly performed under
      light sedation and local anesthesia. Bupivicaine, a long acting local anesthetic, has been
      used to allow extended pain relief for 8-10 hours after carpal tunnel release. Exparel, a
      liposomal bupivicaine formulation, has been documented to provide pain relief for up to 72
      hours post-operatively. By decreasing post-operative pain through the use of a long-acting
      local anesthetic, the use of narcotic pain medications may be decreased and patient
      satisfaction scores may increase.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare bupivicaine and liposomal bupivicaine
      with respect to post-operative pain control, narcotic usage, and patient satisfaction after
      carpal tunnel release.
