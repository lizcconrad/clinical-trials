      Part 2 of the study will assess the effect of 2g of NWT-03 (an egg-white protein hydrolysate)
      on systolic and diastolic blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation in a crossover designed
      study in healthy adults with mild hypertension.

             80-99 mmHg).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the below criteria;

          1. Are less than 35 and greater than 75 years of age,

          2. Females are pregnant, lactating or wish to become pregnant during the study. Female
             subject is currently either of:

               1. non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
                  including any female who is post-menopausal or any female who is surgically
                  sterilized (via documented hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation). (For
                  purposes of this study, postmenopausal is defined as one year without menses), OR

               2. child bearing potential, the subject is eligible to enter and participate in this
                  study if she is not lactating and has a negative urine pregnancy test at the
                  screening visit, visit 2 and upon completion of the study at visit 7. The subject
                  must also agree to one of the following methods of contraception:

                    -  Complete abstinence from intercourse two weeks prior to administration of
                       study drug, throughout the clinical trial, until the completion of follow-up
                       procedures or for two weeks following discontinuation of the study
                       medication in cases where subject discontinues the study prematurely.
                       (Subjects utilizing this method must agree to use an alternate method of
                       contraception if they should become sexually active and will be queried on
                       whether they have been abstinent in the preceding 2 weeks when they present
                       to the clinic for the Final Visit.) or,

                    -  has a male sexual partner who is surgically sterilized prior to the Screen
                       Visit and is the only male sexual partner for that subject or,

                    -  sexual partner(s) is/are exclusively female or,

                    -  Oral contraceptives (either combined or progestogen only) with
                       double-barrier method of contraception consisting of spermicide with either
                       condom or diaphragm. (Women of child-bearing potential using an oral
                       contraceptive in combination with a double-barrier method of contraception
                       are required to continue to use this form of contraception for 1 week
                       following discontinuation of study medication).

                    -  Use of double-barrier contraception, specifically, a spermicide plus a
                       mechanical barrier (e.g. male condom, female diaphragm). The subject must be
                       using this method for at least 1 week following the end of the study or,

                    -  Use of any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the
                       highest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year. The subject must
                       have the device inserted at least 2 weeks prior to the first Screen Visit,
                       throughout the study, and 2 weeks following the end of the study.

          3. Are hypersensitive to any of the components of the test product,

             Chronic kidney disease (CKD), gastrointestinal disorder, endocrinological disorder,
             immunological disorder, metabolic disease or any condition which contraindicates, in
             the investigators judgement, entry to the study,

          5. Having a condition or have taken a medication that the investigator believes would
             interfere with the objectives of the study, pose a safety risk or confound the
             interpretation of the study results; to include diuretics, blood pressure medication
             and medication interfering with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), such as
             ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors or aldosterone
             receptor inhibitor,

          6. Are taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 2 weeks of baseline
             visit or for the duration of the trial,

          7. Suffer from diabetes mellitus, either type I and type II,

          8. Consume more than the recommended alcohol guidelines i.e. &gt;21 alcohol units/week for
             males and &gt;14 units/week for females,

          9. History of illicit drug use,

         10. Use of nasal decongestants and other over-the counter or herbal preparation within 2
             weeks of baseline visit and for the duration of the trial,

         11. Heavy intake of coffee (i.e. more than 4 cups daily) within 2 weeks of baseline visit
             and for the duration of the trial,

         12. Individuals who, in the opinion of the investigator, are considered to be poor
             attendees or unlikely for any reason to be able to comply with the trial,

         13. Subjects may not be receiving treatment involving experimental drugs,

         14. If the subject has been in a recent experimental trial, these must have been completed
             not less than 60 days prior to this study. An exception will be made where subjects
             have participated in part 1 of the study,

         15. Have a malignant disease or any concomitant end-stage organ disease.
