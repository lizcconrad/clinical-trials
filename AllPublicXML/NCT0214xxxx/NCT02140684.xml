  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the absolute and relative effectiveness of managing real-life asthma
      with and without the use of NIOX MINO® and NIOX Flex® to measure exhaled nitric oxide (eNO)
      as a marker of underlying airway inflammation to guide appropriate management. As exhaled
      nitric oxide responds rapidly to environmental changes and can act as a marker of underlying
      inflammation it is proposed that incorporating eNO monitoring into routine asthma management
      treatment allows strategies to be more accurately tailored to the patients needs, increasing
      the probability of good asthma control.
