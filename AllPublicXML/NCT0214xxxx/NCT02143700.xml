  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition involving an impairment
      in functionality and in the execution of activities of daily life. The hypothesis of this
      study is to examine the relationship between cognitive status and clinical profile
      (respiratory, sleep quality, nutritional status) in patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease in two different moments: exacerbation or stable situation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a pathology with a systemic impact with a
      progressive evolution that is characterized by the presence of chronic airflow obstruction.

      Patients with COPD may have problems with cognitive functioning, either globally or in single
      cognitive domains, such as information processing, attention and concentration, memory,
      executive functioning and self-regulation.

      Several studies have determined the prevalence of cognitive impairment in COPD compared to
      healthy control subjects, reaching very high levels, 36% of COPD patients with mild cognitive
      impairment compared with 12 % non- COPD subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive impairment will be measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a test designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are going to complete the Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index. This is a self-rating questionnaire with seven subscores that result in a global score between 0 and 21.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The accelerometer Armband is going to be used for activity monitoring. It measures the intensity of the activity during 12 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutritional state</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mini Nutritional Assessment has been designed and validated to provide a single, rapid assessment of nutritional status in elderly patients in outpatient clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes. It is composed of simple measurements and brief questions that can be completed in about 10 min</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life associated with health is going to be measured with two questionnaires: the EuroQol-5 questionnaire and the Health Questionnaire St. George</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cough</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Leicester Cough Questionnaire-acute is a validated cough-related health status questionnaire designed for patients with chronic cough.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comorbidities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Comorbidities are going to be measured with the Charlson comorbidity index. The Charlson comorbidity index predicts the ten-year mortality for a patient who may have a range of comorbid conditions, such as heart disease, AIDS, or cancer (a total of 22 conditions). Each condition is assigned a score of 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the risk of dying associated with each one.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are going to completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale composed of statements relevant to either generalized anxiety or depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive flexibility of patients is measured using the Trial Making Test. This test explores visual-conceptual and visual-motor tracking, and it is a frequently used neuropsychological test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced vital capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Forced vital capacity is going to be measured with a spirometer as recommended by the American Thoracic Society</description>
