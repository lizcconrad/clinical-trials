      Renal denervation can be carried out for heart failure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are theoretical reasons why renal denervation might be beneficial for patients with
      chronic heart failure. It is not known whether they would suffer large drops in blood
      pressure which might compromise safety.

      This pilot study required patients to remain in hospital for one week during which they had
      careful monitoring of blood pressure with the ability to halt the trial if any patient
      suffered any dangerous effect such as a large drop in blood pressure. It also monitored blood
      pressure after discharge for six months.

    <description>Renal denervation had been reported to cause a 30 mmHg fall in blood pressure when used in hypertension. Although in principle renal denervation might be favourable for physiology in chronic heart failure, numerous theoretical possibilities exist for the procedure causing deterioration in clinical status, including the possibility of a large fall in blood pressure.
A deterioration in symptomatic status or occurrence of an event such as presyncope or syncope would be considered a primary outcome event.</description>
