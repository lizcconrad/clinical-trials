  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of births with sickle cell disease (SCD) occur in Africa and 90% are
      thought to die before the age of five. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only drug approved by the FDA
      for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. Although HU is used to treat small numbers of
      patients in Africa, cost, fear of toxicity, and lack of awareness and availability limit its
      use. The leukopenia that may be seen with HU raises the possibility of increased
      susceptibility to infection. Risk stratification - i.e., identification of patients most
      likely to benefit- could focus therapy and provide confidence that the risk:benefit ratio is
      favorable. Several clinical measures of future risk are well defined and findings on modifier
      genes in the US, primarily related to fetal hemoglobin (HbF), have further improved risk
      prediction. Whether the genetic variants predict severity in Africa is not known. The
      investigators have established a SCD cohort in Ibadan, Nigeria. In the first phase of this
      research the investigators will implement clinical risk examinations and assess the
      relationship between clinical characteristics (including levels of HbF) and known genetic
      markers. As a proxy for a birth cohort, the investigators will compare the frequency of the
      genetic markers in adult patients (i.e., &quot;survivors&quot;) to children. In the second phase the
      investigators will randomize 40 high risk adult patients to fixed low dose HU or no HU
      treatment in a crossover design and monitor hematologic and physiologic parameters to
      document hematologic effects and safety. This work will lay the basis for a large-scale trial
      to document safety and efficacy.
