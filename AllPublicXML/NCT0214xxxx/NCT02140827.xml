  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of colorectal disease. The success of
      colonoscopy depends on high-quality bowel preparation by patients. Inadequate bowel cleansing
      reduces the cecal intubation rate, and the polyp detection rate (PDR). It also increases
      costs, mostly due to repeated procedures. The quality of bowel cleansing has remained
      suboptimal even though numerous different products and regimens have been tested and compared
      in no fewer than six meta-analyses. Therefore, a completely different approach to improve
      bowel cleansing is welcome.

      Here the investigators assume that instant messaging program (Wechat) delivery the detail and
      FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) of bowel preparation instructions would improve the quality
      of the bowel preparation. The Wechat program has some advantages, 1. Wechat supports over 400
      million users, nearly half of the mobile subscribers population in China; 2. Wechat provided
      a real time communications including voice messages, pictures and text exchange timely;
      3.Compare with telephone, Wechat is economical of both time and money; 4. Compare with bowel
      preparation instructional software and litera or cartoon educational booklet, Wechat is more
      interactive and responsive.

The bowel preparation was considered inadequate if (1) inadequate visualization on colonoscopy defined by Ottawa score≥6; (2) the colonoscopy was cancelled because of poor bowel preparation; (3) incompleted colonoscopy because of inadequate bowel preparation (the Ottawa score was rated as 14 when patients with failed colonoscopy because of inadequate bowel preparation).</description>
