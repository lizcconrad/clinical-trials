    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, 2-arm phase IIb trial that will compare the
      efficacy and safety of Lenalidomide maintenance after Bortezomib/Melphalan/Prednison (VMP)
      induction to VMP without maintenance (Placebo). In addition the trial will assess the
      treatment of Revlimid/low dose Dexamethasone (Rd) as Salvage after VMP without sufficient
      response (less than PR) in an observational arm. Key eligibility criteria include patients
      with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and who are 65 years of age or older or are not
      candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Patients with
      poor performance status or serious coexistent medical conditions will be excluded from this
      study. After registration all patients receive 6 cycles VMP (modified according to Mateos et
      al.). Patients who receive at least a PR and completed VMP can be randomized to either
      Lenalidomide 10 mg/d continuously maintenance or to placebo. Randomization will be stratified
      according to the quality of response after VMP induction (PR vs. VGPR + stringent complete
      remission [sCR] + CR). Patients that are not able to complete VMP due to toxicity but reached
      at least a PR after a minimum of four cycles of therapy should immediately proceed to
      randomization. Blinded phase continues until progression or end of study. After unblinding,
      patients who received placebo should be treated with Rd.

      Patients that do not reach PR after induction with VMP or are progressive during treatment
      with VMP should not be randomized, but switched to the observation arm and treated with Rd
      immediately. The study treatment ends with the confirmed progression on maintenance treatment
      (Lenalidomide or placebo) for patients that reached PR with induction treatment, or with the
      confirmed progression on second-line therapy with Revlimid® and Dexamethasone for patients
      that did not reach PR on induction treatment. All patients will be followed up every 3 months
      after end of study treatment, until end of study. The study ends two years after Last Patient
      In (i.e. randomization for maintenance) if sufficient events for the primary endpoint were
      received, but not later than 8 years after trial initiation (whatever comes first).

        -  To compare response rates of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo

        -  To compare overall survival probabilities between patients treated with Lenalidomide
           maintenance and patients without maintenance treatment

        -  To compare the safety of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo

        -  To compare the QoL of VMP and Lenalidomide maintenance versus VMP and placebo

        -  To assess the safety and efficacy of Rd for poor responders on VMP

          6. Female of childbearing potential (FCBP) † must:

               -  Understand the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child

               -  Understand the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks
                  before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study
                  treatment, dose interruption and 28 days after the end of study treatment

               -  Be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures and agree to use
                  two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete
                  abstinence from heterosexual contact during the following time periods related to
                  this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while
                  participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days
                  after study treatment discontinuation. The two methods of reliable contraception
                  must include one highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier)
                  method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods if
                  needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional effective
                  methods of contraception:

                    -  Highly effective methods*:

                         -  Intrauterine device (IUD)**

                         -  Progesterone only hormonal contraceptive (birth control pills,
                            injections, implants)*

                         -  Tubal ligation

                         -  Partner's vasectomy

                    -  Additional effective methods:

                         -  Male condom (partner)

                         -  Diaphragm

                         -  Cervical Cap

               -  (*)Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with
                  multiple myeloma taking Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone, combined oral
                  contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a patient is currently using combined
                  oral contraception she should switch to one of the effective method listed above.
                  The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4 to 6 weeks after discontinuing
                  combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be
                  reduced during co-treatment with Dexamethasone.

               -  (**)Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated
                  with an increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular
                  vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in
                  patients with neutropenia.

               -  Be informed about and understand the potential consequences of pregnancy and the
                  need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy

               -  Agree to have two medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity
                  of 25 mIU/ml (milli-International Units per milliliter) prior to starting
                  Lenalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days
                  prior to the start Lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed
                  within 24 hours prior to the start of Lenalidomide. The patient will receive
                  Lenalidomide only after the study doctor has verified that the results of these
                  pregnancy tests are negative. She must understand the need to commence the study
                  treatment as soon as study drug is dispensed following the second negative
                  pregnancy test. This requirement also applies to FCBP who practice complete and
                  continued abstinence.

               -  Must understand the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing in the
                  frequency as follows: FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have
                  pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then
                  every 28 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at day 28 following
                  study drug discontinuation. If menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy
                  testing must occur weekly for the first 28 days and then every 14 days while on
                  study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study drug
                  discontinuation. This requirement also applies to FCBP who practice complete and
                  continued abstinence.

               -  Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and
                  for at least 28 days after study drug discontinuation.

        A FCBP † is a sexually mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral
        oophorectomy or who has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive
        months (i.e., who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

        Male subjects must:

          -  Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a
             pregnant female or a FCBP

          -  Understand the need for the use of a condom and agree to use condoms even if he has
             had a vasectomy, if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of
             childbearing potential , while taking study drug, during any dose interruptions and
             for 28 days after stopping study therapy.

          -  Agree to notify the investigator immediately, if pregnancy or a positive pregnancy
             test occurs in his partner during study participation.

          -  Agree to abstain from donating semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 28 days
             following discontinuation of study drug.

        All subjects must:

          -  Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for at least
             28 days following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

          -  Agree never to give Lenalidomide to another person and to return all unused study drug
             to the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:
