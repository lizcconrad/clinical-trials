    <measure>Medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after stroke onset</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence at 3 months. Adherence is defined as continuation of prescribed medications (antiplatelet, warfarin, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and diabetic agent) at discharge except those stopped according to health care provider instructions. Subjects were contacted by research personnel at the coordinating center 3 months after stroke onset. Subjects who reported discontinuing prescribed medication were asked whether they chose to stop prescribed medication or were instructed to do so by a physician.</description>

    <measure>Medication adherence at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after stroke onset</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence at 6 months. Adherence is defined as continuation of prescribed medications (antiplatelet, warfarin, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and diabetic agent) at discharge except those stopped according to health care provider instructions. Subjects were contacted by research personnel at the coordinating center 6 months after stroke onset. Subjects who reported discontinuing prescribed medication were asked whether they chose to stop prescribed medication or were instructed to do so by a physician.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after stroke onset</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence at 12 months. Adherence is defined as continuation of prescribed medications (antiplatelet, warfarin, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and diabetic agent) at discharge except those stopped according to health care provider instructions. Subjects were contacted by research personnel at the coordinating center 12 months after stroke onset. Subjects who reported discontinuing prescribed medication were asked whether they chose to stop prescribed medication or were instructed to do so by a physician.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication persistence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after stroke onset</time_frame>
    <description>Medication persistence at 3 months. Persistence is defined as continuing a therapy or class of therapy from discharge to the 3 months follow-up. Subjects prescribed an individual medication at discharge but who were not taking that medication at follow up were defined as &quot;nonpersistent&quot;. Persistence for the specified medication classes (antiplatelet, warfarin, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, or diabetic agent) was defined in the same way; however, subjects were considered persistent if there was a switch to another medication within the same class.</description>
