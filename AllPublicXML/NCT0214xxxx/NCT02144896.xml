  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial function of the skeletal muscle vasculature declines with advancing age. Although
      aerobic exercise training is commonly prescribed to combat loss of endothelial function in
      the elderly, the rate of compliance to training programs is low. Contrary to aerobic exercise
      training, stretching exercise is widely performed in elderly patients to increase muscle
      flexibility and to prevent muscle atrophy induced by immobilization. However, it remains
      unknown as to whether regular stretching of the calf muscles using ankle dorsiflexion
      splinting improves muscle blood flow. The purpose of the proposed work is to test the
      hypothesis that performance of ankle dorsiflexion splinting improves endothelial function and
      lower leg muscle blood flow in older adults. Ankle dorsiflexion splinting will be performed
      on the randomized leg for 30 minutes, 5 times per week for 4 weeks. Leg vascular measures
      will be performed on the splinted and non-splinted legs prior to and at the end of the 4-week
      intervention.

      Older adults will be recruited in this study. Vascular function will be assessed before and
      after the 4-week ankle splinting intervention. To examine the acute effects of splinting,
      vascular measures will also be obtained before and immediately following 30 min of ankle
      splinting. All procedures will be performed at the Integrative Cardiovascular Physiology
      Laboratory at the University of Florida.

      Participants will have one leg randomly assigned to using a splint to stretch the calf
      muscles 30 min per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks, while the contralateral non-splinted leg
      will serve as an internal control.
