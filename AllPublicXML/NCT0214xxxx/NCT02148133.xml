  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      eltrombopag in Japanese moderate or more severe aplastic anemia (AA) subjects with a platelet
      count &lt;30,000/ microliter who are refractory to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)-based
      immunosuppressive therapy (IST), who have relapsed after ATG-based IST, or who are ineligible
      for ATG-based IST.

      Eltrombopag is expected to improve trilineage blood cells and decrease transfusion frequency
      based on the result from the previous study in patients with severe AA. This study will use
      the hematologic response rate, defined as the proportion of subjects showing improvement in
      at least one of the three blood cell lineages or a decrease in blood transfusion volume, as
      the primary endpoint.

      Twenty patients will be enrolled in the study. Treatment with eltrombopag will be started at
      25 milligram (mg)/day and increased by 25 mg/day every 2 weeks according to the platelet
      count up to 100 mg/day. Response assessment will be performed at 3 months after starting the
      study treatment (Week 13). Subjects in whom the treatment is assessed as effective will be
      continued with the study treatment. Subjects in whom the treatment is assessed as effective
      (when meeting any of the response criteria) at 6 months after starting the study treatment
      (Week 26) may enter the extension phase and continue the treatment with eltrombopag. The
      primary endpoint is the hematologic response rate at Week26.
