    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure test-retest reliability and validate the star shaped
      test of manual dexterity. The purpose of this is to see if there is any significant learning
      effect, and if the test can discriminate between individuals who are at their normal skill
      level, and when they are stressed and/or fatigued. The test is designed to test hand to eye
      coordination and precision control. This is done by following a star shaped track with a pair
      of a surgical scissors. this is done 10 times, 5 times clockwise and 5 times counter
      clockwise. Each time the scissors come into contact with the border of the track, an error is
      counted. Overall completion time is recorded. As a randomized crossover study, we will have
      20 test subjects complete the test 4 times. Each test will be conducted with a pause of two
      breaks between the tests. Before each test, the test subjects are randomized to: no
      intervention, physical fatigue prior to testing, distractions during the test or both
      physical fatigue prior to testing and distractions during the test. All participants will
      complete a test with all four interventions. Furthermore, a test-retest trial will be
      conducted on 4 test-subjects. Each subject will complete the test two times with no
      interventions, with two days apart.

    <description>Prior to completion of the star shaped manual dexterity test, the test subject is asked to stand up still and hold a 2.5-kg weight with the dominant arm fully extended as long as possible without moving. Maximum endurance time is recorded. After this, the test subject completes the the star shaped manual dexterity test and time and number of errors are recorded.</description>

    <description>On a piece of wood, a piece of metal (dimensions 22 cm x 22 cm) is mounted. In the center of the metal plate, is a star shaped track. The star has 6 points and the track is 9 mm wide. It measures 15,3 cm from the tips of opposing arms of the star. With a surgical scissor in his dominant hand, the test subject is instructed to follow the star shaped track ten times, five times clockwise and five times counter clockwise. Contact with the border of the track is counted as an error. A computer software program automatically registers completion time and number of errors. The test is conducted in an undisturbed environment.</description>
