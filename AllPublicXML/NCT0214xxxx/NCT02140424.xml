    <textblock>
      This is an observation study of girls ages 10-16 years with type 1 diabetes and age- and
      race-matched controls. The investigators will be examining blood and urine hormone levels as
      well as measures of bone density including DXA and high-resolution peripheral quantitiative
      computed tomography. The investigators hypothesize that youth with type 1 diabetes will have
      slower bone accrual and impaired bone microarchitectural integrity compared with non-diabetic
      controls. The investigators hypothesize that poor bone accrual will be associated with
      sub-optimal glucose control as well as lower levels of insulin-like growth factor 1.

    <measure>Rate of bone mineral accrual</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral mass and density will be measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and 12 months. Percent change over time will be calculated and then compared in subjects with type 1 diabetes and matched control subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cross-sectional comparison of bone microarchitectural parameters in patients with diabetes vs. controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Bone microarchitecture will be assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Parameters measured will include cortical compartment density, cortical thickness, cortical porosity, trabecular density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness.</description>

    <measure>Change bone microarchitectural parameters in patients with diabetes vs. controls</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bone microarchitecture will be assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at 0 and 12 months. Parameters measured will include cortical compartment density, cortical thickness, cortical porosity, trabecular density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness and percent change over 12 months will be calculated. Percent change will be compared in patients with diabetes and matched controls.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Association of glycemic control with bone mineral accrual</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemic control will be assessed by hemoglobin A1c measurements at study visits and as part of routine diabetes care. An average hemoglobin A1c over the time of observation will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Association of glycemic control with bone mineral accrual as measured by DXA will be examined via regression analysis.</description>
