      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of raptor/rictor-mammalian target
      of rapamycin (mTOR) (TORC1/2) inhibitor MLN0128 when given in combination with bevacizumab in
      treating patients with glioblastoma, a type of brain tumor, or a solid tumor that has spread
      and not responded to standard treatment. TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Bevacizumab may also stop the progression of tumors by blocking the growth of new blood
      vessels necessary for tumor growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D) of daily
      oral MLN0128 (TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128) when administered with bevacizumab in patients with
      advanced solid tumors including recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).

      II. To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of the combination of MLN0128 and
      bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination of MLN0128 and
      bevacizumab, as determined by response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS).

      II. To assess tolerability throughout study therapy with MLN0128 and bevacizumab, including
      beyond the MTD interval with the following measures of cumulative treatment-related
      toxicities: frequency of toxicities leading to missed doses or delays; percentage of cycles
      given or not within 7 days of their scheduled times; percentage of actual planned dosage
      administration; percentage of patients that discontinue study drugs due to treatment related
      toxicity.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of MLN0128 in combination with bevacizumab
      in patients with recurrent GBM by evaluating the plasma and CSF concentrations of MLN0128 in
      the absence and presence of bevacizumab.

      II. To perform archival tumor analysis for markers of dysregulated cell signaling that may
      predict response to mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy such as
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (expression by immunohistochemistry [IHC] and
      amplification by fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]), phosphatase and tensin homolog
      (PTEN) (expression by IHC and deletion by FISH), phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase B (AKT),
      p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding
      protein 1 (4EBP), p-mTOR and p-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (Erk) in patients with
      recurrent GBM.

      III. To analyze select phosphorylated proteins (ERK, AKT, mTOR, 4EBP1, glycogen synthase
      kinase 3-beta [GSK3beta], ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kDa, polypeptide 2 [p70S6K], rS6)
      from tumor biopsies obtained at baseline and after treatment with MLN0128 from endometrial
      and ovarian cancer patients enrolled in stage 2.

      IV. To analyze circulating plasma levels of angiogenic growth factors before, during and
      after treatment with MLN0128 and bevacizumab V. To perform genetic mutation analysis and
      proteomic analysis of tissue from biopsies of endometrial and ovarian cancer patients
      including analysis of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma
      viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic
      subunit alpha (PIK3CA), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1) and PTEN.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MLN0128.

      Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and bevacizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then annually
      thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of recurrent
             glioblastoma or an advanced solid tumor in which bevacizumab has shown benefit in
             specific disease population and for which standard or curative measures do not exist
             or are no longer effective

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for non-GBM tumors and by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology
             (RANO) criteria for GBM

          -  For stage 1 (all patients) and dose expansion (stage 2) endometrial and ovarian cancer
             cohorts, participants are allowed following unlimited prior therapy; for stage 2 GBM
             participants, no more than 2 prior relapses are allowed; for these patients, relapse
             is defined as progression following initial therapy (i.e. radiation +/- chemo if that
             was used as initial therapy) or a subsequent therapy; the intent therefore is that GBM
             patients enrolling onto stage 2 had no more than 3 prior therapies (initial and
             treatment for 2 relapses); if the patient had a surgical resection for relapsed
             disease and no anti-cancer therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the patient
             undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered to constitute 1 relapse

               -  NOTE: for participants who had prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical
                  diagnosis of glioblastoma will be considered the first relapse; therefore, these
                  participants may have had more than 3 prior therapies

          -  Patients must have recovered from clinically significant toxicity of prior therapy to
             grade =&lt; 1 or pre-treatment baseline; the following intervals from previous treatments
             are required prior to day 1 of study therapy:

               -  12 weeks from the completion of radiation for recurrent GBM unless there is
                  surgical diagnosis of recurrence or a new lesion that was not previously radiated

               -  6 weeks from a nitrosourea chemotherapy

               -  3 weeks from a non-nitrosourea chemotherapy

               -  4 weeks from an investigational agent (not Food and Drug Administration [FDA]

               -  2 weeks from administration of a non-cytotoxic, FDA-approved agent (e.g.,
                  erlotinib, hydroxychloroquine, etc.) (or 5 half lives, whichever is shorter)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (=&lt; 5 x upper limit of normal [ULN] if
             liver metastases are present)

          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 50
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine level above institutional normal based

             bevacizumab administration; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also

             bladder; patients with prior malignancies must be disease-free for &gt;= three years
             prior to registration

          -  Solid tumor patients must be off corticosteroids prior to registration; if GBM patient
             is receiving corticosteroids, patient must be on a stable or decreasing dose of
             corticosteroids for at least 5 days prior to baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             or computed tomography (CT); if steroids are added or the steroids dose is increased
             between the date of the screening MRI or CT and the start of treatment, a new baseline

          -  Stage 2 endometrial and ovarian cancer patients must have at least one lesion amenable
             to biopsy; this determination will be made by a member of the interventional radiology
             team or surgical associate investigator and an associate investigator; this
             requirement is not necessary for patients in stage 1

          -  Solid tumor patients in stage 2 must have a diagnosis of papillary serous,
             endometrioid or clear cell endometrial carcinoma or, high grade serous, clear cell,

             inducers should be considered with caution; alternative treatments that are less
             likely to affect MLN0128 metabolism, if available, should be considered; if a subject
             requires treatment with 1 or more of the strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors and/or
             inducers, the principal investigator should be consulted

          -  Concurrent use of herbal supplements and other non-traditional medications; all herbal
