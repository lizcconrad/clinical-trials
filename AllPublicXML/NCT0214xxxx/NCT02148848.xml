  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoral neck fracture in the elderly is one indication for initiating osteoporosis treatment.
      Bisphosphonates remain the first line therapy; however, many orthopaedic surgeons concern
      regarding their effects on fracture healing process. Therefore, therapy is usually delayed
      for a period of time. To the best of our knowledge, there is no scientific data to support
      whether bisphosphonate treatment should be given immediately after the surgery or it should
      be delayed.

      This study aims to compare functional recovery between early- and late administration of
      bisphosphonate in patients who received hemiarthroplasty following femoral neck fractures.
