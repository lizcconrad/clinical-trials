  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the efficacy of a tailored behavioral lifestyle modification
      program to support cardiovascular health in postpartum women with excessive gestational
      weight gain. This program will include a mobile health texting component postpartum to
      support changes in nutrition and physical activity. The investigators will randomize women
      into either the control arm (usual care) or the intervention (usual care + mobile health
      program postpartum). The women will be recruited during their 3rd trimester once they have
      been identified as gaining too much weight according to the 2009 IOM guidelines during
      pregnancy.

    <description>Behavioral intervention. Women with excessive weight gain in pregnancy will be recruited in their 3rd trimester. They will begin with a 5 week group session on weight management. After they deliver the baby, they will begin receiving text messages supporting behavior change they learned in their 3rd trimester. They will follow up at 6 weeks postpartum and 4 months postpartum.</description>
