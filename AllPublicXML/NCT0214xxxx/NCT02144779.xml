  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is evaluating the effect of a standardized communication intervention in the
      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) on long-term distress of family members of children in
      the PICU for 5 days or longer. The study hypothesis is that intervention families will have
      lower (better) acute stress disorder scores when their child is discharged from the PICU and
      lower (better) post-traumatic stress disorder scores at 3-month follow-up, as compared to the
      control group families. The investigators will recruit 220 families (110 in each of the
      control and intervention groups). Families who are randomized to the intervention group will
      receive routine visits from members of the PACT (palliative care) team at least three
      times/week to address psychosocial needs, keep families informed about their child's health
      status, and offer emotional and instrumental support and resources. Families in the control
      group will receive usual care in the PICU. The intervention will end whenever the child is
      discharged from the PICU, which usually happens within 3 weeks of enrollment. The
      investigators will assess family outcomes at discharge from the PICU and 90 days after study
      enrollment. The investigators will conduct two additional activities to learn more about the
      processes of care for those in both the intervention and control groups. First, during the
      intervention, the investigators will recruit 30 families (15 in each group) and ask
      permission to audio-record the family care conferences to assess communication styles and
      gain greater insight into the differences in practice with or without the participation of
      the intervention team. The investigators will obtain additional consent from participants in
      these family conferences who are not otherwise enrolled in the study. Second, after
      completion of the 3-month follow-up interview, a sub-sample of a different 30 families
      (again, 15 in each group) will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews to debrief
      about their experience in the study and the intervention (for those in that group). This will
      be a one-time interview scheduled within 60 days of recruitment for this part of the project.
