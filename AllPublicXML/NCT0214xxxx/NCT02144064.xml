      Objective To determine maternal and fetal outcomes in women with Unexplained RPL managed with
      aspirin or unfractionated heparin (UFH) plus aspirin during pregnancy.

      Design: prospective clinical controlled study. Setting: high-risk pregnancy unit- Benha
      university hospital. Methods: Pregnant women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage attending
      high-risk pregnancy unit. 200 selected patients with previous unexplained recurrent
      miscarriage are divided into 2 groups: group A (n = 100) receive low-dose aspirin (81 mg once
      daily orally) plus heparin (5000 IU) every 12 h with the ﬁrst positive pregnancy test while
      group B (n = 100) receive no thing .

      Main outcome measures: Maternal outcomes included thromboembolic and haemorrhagic
      complications and pregnancy-induced hypertension .Prematurity, intrauterine growth
      restriction and neonatal death were considered as maternal and fetal complications

      This prospective comparative, controlled clinical study is conducted at Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology, Benha University Hospital, and a private center, from June 2012 .
      After approval of the study protocol by the Local Ethical Committee and obtaining written
      fully informed patients' consents. All patients are interviewed about their medical,
      personal, family, obstetrical and thrombosis history. All patients included in study complain
      of three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions.

      All patients (n=200) are in good general health without previous history of Diabetes Mellitus
      or thyroid dysfunction or cardiac disease. Patients with Thrombocytopenia (&lt;100000/ml),
      bleeding tendencies, ectopic pregnancy, past history of vascular thrombosis ,uterine
      anomalies and multiple gestation are excluded from the study.

      complete blood picture, urine routine examination, blood sugar, blood grouping, Bleeding
      Time, Clotting Time, Prothrombin Time, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time, Hepatitis B
      Surface Ag, Hepatitis C Virus screening are offered to all patients and findings noted as
      soon as they conceived. All patients are given routine Folic Acid, Iron and Calcium
      supplementation orally daily during antenatal period (whether conceived spontaneously or with
      treatment

      200 selected patients with previous unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss are divided into 2
      groups:Group A (n = 100) are put on Inj. UFH (Cal-heparin) 5000 U subcutaneous twice daily
      plus Aspirin 81 mg/day (Juspirin) with the ﬁrst positive pregnancy test, Inj. UFH is given
      either into anterior abdominal wall or anterior aspect of thigh subcutaneously. While group B
      (n = 100) receive no thing
