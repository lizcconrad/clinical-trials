  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate safety, tolerability of cafusertib combination with low dose cytarabine
      (LD-Ara-C) in Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory AML that are not eligible for
      conventional or intensive treatment. The dose of cafusertib will be escalated to determine
      the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cafusertib in
      combination with LD-Ara-C in AML patients. At the same time, pharmacokinetic characteristics
      and preliminary efficacy of cafusertib will be observed in AML patients. To determine the
      recommended dosage regimen for phase II.
