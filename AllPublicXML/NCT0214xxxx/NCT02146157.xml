  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in approximately
      104 subjects (52 per group) to evaluate the effectiveness of an herb and mineral combination
      product on fasting serum glucose levels in subjects with impaired fasting glucose. The study
      consists of 5 visits: a Screening visit, followed by a Baseline visit (at which eligible
      subjects will be randomized to product to consume throughout the 12-week supplementation
      period), followed by Supplementation period visits at 3, 6 and 12 weeks after baseline.
