  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polar lipids have a specific chemical structure: they are an essential component of human
      cell membranes, play a major role in the nervous system and also influence the metabolic
      pathways including the cholesterol metabolism.

      Polar lipids are used in food-processing industry for their emulsification properties. The
      most famous emulsifier is soya lecithin but milk also naturally contains natural emulsifiers
      such as polar lipids. Milk polar lipids are rich in sphingomyelin and they may have
      beneficial effects on lipid metabolism in the context of metabolic diseases of nutritional
      origin.

      The purpose of this research is to study the variation of sphingomyelin content at the
      ileum's end after the consumption of different doses of milk polar lipids, and consequences
      on the intestinal absorption and metabolism of fatty acids and cholesterol.

      The subjects will be taking three different test meals varying by their milk polar lipids
      content.

      It is a bi-centric study with a centre in LYON (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine
      Rhône-Alpes) and CLERMONT-FERRAND (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne).
