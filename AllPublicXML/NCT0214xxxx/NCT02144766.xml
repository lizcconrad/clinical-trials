  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study was to investigate the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      myocardial dysfunction and injury resulting from noncardiac injury in children and whether or
      not anti-inflammatory treatment with caudal block prevents pro-inflammatory
      cytokines-associated myocardial dysfunction and injury following noncardiac surgery.
