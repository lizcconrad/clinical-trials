    <textblock>
      The results of fastact2 show that chemotherapy plus erlotinib significantly prolonged PFS and
      OS of patients with NSCLC. However, outcome of the combination therapy are similar to those
      reported in several trials of single-agent EGFR TKIs. So which is the optimal first-line
      treatment for patients who harbored a sensitive EGFR mutation? The investigators need a
      head-to-head study to reply.
