  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotensive Anesthesia is a type of regional anesthesia performed routinely at our hospital.
      This type of anesthesia reduces the average arterial pressure. Benefits include reduced
      bleeding and lower risk of blood clots.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of intravenous fluids administered with
      hypotensive anesthesia on your blood volume. With this parameter we will be able to
      understand how much of your blood is lost because of bleeding and how much of the drop is
      related to dilution.

      Study hypothesis: Hemodilution associated with intravenous fluid substitution during
      hypotensive anesthesia results in decreased postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) levels

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent technology allows the measurement of patients' total blood volume with 98% accuracy
      within 90 minutes or less. This is key to understanding the effect of hypotensive anesthesia
      on patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The drop in blood pressure enhances the
      dilutional effect of intravenous fluid given during the procedure. Increases in TBV could
      result in decreases of postoperative hemoglobin. Understanding the effect of hypotensive
      anesthesia on postoperative hemoglobin levels and TBV will enhance our understanding of
      postoperative blood management and transfusion triggers.

    <description>An indicator dilution technique was used to measure the blood volume, plasma volume and red cell blood volume. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998, the BVA-100 blood volume analyzer (Daxor Corp.) is a semi-automated system for blood volume analysis. Prepared standards and injectates were used. The injectate consists of 31I-labeled HSA (370- 1,295 kBq [10-30 mCi]) in saline.
Measurement was performed directly before surgery in the holding area and 6 hours after surgery.
Each time, before injection of the tracer a baseline sample was taken. After injection of the tracer via standard i.v. line, the first sample was drawn from an arterial line after 12 minutes waiting time. Afterwards every 6 minutes a sample was taken. In a whole 5 samples were sent for analysis to Daxor® Corp.. Each sample is counted in duplicate.</description>
