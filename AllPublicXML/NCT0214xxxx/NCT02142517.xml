  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains a challenge even at specialized centers, and
      also affect significantly the surgical outcomes . The incidence of POPF after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy among different studies, ranging from 5 to 30%.Morbidity and
      mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy are usually related to surgical management of the
      pancreatic stump. The safe pancreatic reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy continues
      to be a challenge at high volume centers. The variety of reconstruction is a reflection of
      the lack of ideal one.Duct to mucosa and invagination are two classic PJ techniques. Many
      studies compared both techniques, but their surgical outcomes still unclear.The aim of the
      study was to assess the effectiveness and surgical outcomes of both techniques of PJ after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      Consecutive patients who were treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy at Gastroenterology Surgical
      Center, Mansoura, Egypt Exclusion criteria included any patients with locally advanced
      periampullary tumour, metastases, patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients
      underwent pancreaticogastrostomy (PG), patients with advanced liver cirrhosis (Child B or C),
      malnutrition, or coagulopathy.

      All patients were subjected to careful history taking, clinical examination, routine
      laboratory investigation abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ,
      and abdominal computerized tomography .

      The patients were randomized into two groups: Group I: patients underwent duct to mucosa PJ.
      Group II: patients underwent invagination PJ.

      The primary outcome was POPF rate.Secondary outcomes were operative time, operative time
      needed for reconstruction, length of postoperative hospital stay, postoperative morbidities

    <description>Duct to mucosa PJ was performed by a two layer end to side PJ. The pancreatic capsule and jejunal serosa were anastomosed by interrupted silk suture 3/0 to form the outer layer in both the anterior and posterior wall of the anastomosis. Jejunostomy was done matched to the pancreatic duct diameter. The inner layer duct to mucosa was performed in eight to twelve stitches with 5/0 prolene. A pancreatic duct stent was inserted during anastomosis to allow easy and accurate suture placement, ensure adequate pancreatic duct exposure, and protect the opposite wall from being inadvertently held by needles then it was removed at the end of anastomosis.</description>

The pancreatic capsule and jejunal serosa were anastomosed by interrupted silk suture 3/0 to form the outer layer in both the anterior and posterior wall of the anastomosis. Jejunostomy was done matched to the pancreatic stump diameter. The inner layer was performed with 5/0 prolene between pancreatic parenchyma and mucosa. The duct was taken posteriorly and anteriorly to jejunal mucosa. A pancreatic duct stent was inserted during anastomosis and removed at the end of taking the stitches. Reconstruction was completed by end to side hepaticojejunostomy (retrocolic) and gastrojejunostomy (GJ) (antecolic) end to side manually.</description>
