  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn if differences seen in scans before surgery
      match differences seen when looking at tumor samples with pathology and genetic tests. In
      this study we will use Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] and Positron Emission Tomography
      [PET] scans. No direct clinical benefits will come from the results of this study.

    <description>by evaluating spatially explicit phenotypic clusters based on a combination of perfusion, diffusion and metabolic tumor profiles (maps) in both ovarian tumors and metastatic peritoneal/omental implants of patients with HGSOC undergoing primary debulking surgery (PDS).</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The analyses involving the bioinformatic algorithms will be handled by the Bioinformatics Core. Previously validated bioinformatic algorithms (5, 13, 38) will be used to determine the clonal compositions of the imaging-based phenotypically distinct clusters of HGSOCs, and phylogenetic trees based on allelic frequencies of mutations and copy number aberrations of the primary ovarian tumor and matched metastatic implant will be constructed for each case</description>

    <description>Study participants will have 1 scan within the 7 days immediately preceding surgery (PET/CT as standard of care and MRI as a research exam). MRI and PET/CT scanning procedures will be identical to those used in routine clinical examinations of the abdomen and pelvis.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  â‰¥18 years of age on the day of signing the informed consent.

          -  Histologically confirmed or suspected stage III or IV high-grade serous ovarian
             cancer.

          -  Scheduled to undergo primary debulking surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant patients

          -  Patients who because of general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic
             status unrelated to the presence of ovarian cancer cannot give valid informed consent

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo MRI including patients with
             contraindications to MRI such as the presence of cardiac pacemakers or non-compatible
             intracranial vascular clips, claustrophobia, inability to lie flat for the duration of
             the study etc.

          -  Patients with a metallic hip implant or any other metallic implant or device in the
             pelvis that might distort local magnetic field and compromise quality of MRI/

          -  Radiotherapy to the abdomen or pelvis within 6 months of the screening visit. Subjects
             with a current diagnosis of epithelial ovarian tumor of low malignant potential
             (borderline carcinomas) are not eligible

          -  Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer or a past history of endometrial
             cancer, unless all of the following conditions are met:

          -  Stage not greater than IB

          -  No more than superficial myometrial invasion

          -  No vascular or lymphatic invasion

          -  No poorly differentiated subtypes, including serous, clear cell, or other FIGO Grade 3
             lesions.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor are
             excluded. Patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to their initial
             debulking are excluded. Patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for
             breast cancer.

          -  With the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies as
             noted above, subjects with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) any evidence
             of the other cancer present within the last 3 years are excluded.

          -  Unresolved bowel obstruction.

          -  History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or lab abnormality that might
             confound the results of the study, interfere with patient's participation for the full
             duration of the study.

          -  Absence of target lesions (&gt; 2.0 cm) on staging CT

          -  Patients unlikely to be optimally debulked at surgery (tumor implants in difficult to
             reach places [i.e. falciform ligament or porta hepatis], suprarenal retroperitoneal
             lymphadenopathy)
