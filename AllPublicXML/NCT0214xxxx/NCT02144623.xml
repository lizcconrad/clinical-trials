  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial includes patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the most common kind of
      malignant lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies directed against cluster of differentiation antigen
      20 have improved treatment results in different forms of lymphomas; however in chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia treatment with monoclonal antibodies is less effective, and it has been
      suggested that this is depending on a lower expression of the cluster of differentiation
      antigen 20 protein on the chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.

      Valproate, an anticonvulsant drug, has been shown to increase the cluster of differentiation
      antigen 20 expression, and the rationale in this study is that an increasement of cluster of
      differentiation antigen 20 would make treatment with monoclonal antibodies in patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia more effective.
