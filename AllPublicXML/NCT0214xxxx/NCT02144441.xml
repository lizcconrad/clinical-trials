    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility of implementing a clinician-supported patient
      self-managed inpatient insulin intervention. It will: assess the number of eligible patients
      presenting over time; assess patients' willingness to enroll; assess patients' ability to
      successfully complete the intervention; examine occurrences of hyperglycemia and
      hypoglycemia; and assess patients' satisfaction with inpatient diabetes care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) in the past 72 hours.

          -  Current HUP locations are Founders 12, Founders 14, Silverstein 11, and Rhoads 1.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Type-1 or type-2 diabetes mellitus requiring home basal-bolus insulin therapy
             administered via subcutaneous injection (not pump).

          -  Patient manages own basal-bolus insulin therapy at home without assistance, including
             measuring own blood glucose (at least at mealtimes) and administering own subcutaneous
             insulin.

          -  Patient is willing to use the following insulin products: rapid-acting insulin aspart
             via insulin pen (NovoLog) and long-acting insulin glargine via vial and syringe
             (Lantus).

          -  Most recent hemoglobin A1c was measured within past 6 months and was &lt;7.5%.

          -  Active order for in-hospital basal-bolus or sliding-scale insulin.

          -  Patient is willing and able to record their self-measured blood glucose results, doses
             of insulin that they self-administer, a food journal, and exercise log.

          -  Clinical care team agrees with study inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inpatient order for insulin via subcutaneous infusion (i.e., pump) or intravenous

          -  Inability to perform the activities required by the trial.

          -  Primary reason for admission was hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis,
             hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, a psychiatric condition, acute alcohol
             poisoning, or acute drug ingestion.

          -  Order for a newly-prescribed or increased dose of a previously-prescribed
             corticosteroid.

          -  Enteral or parenteral nutrition.

          -  Expected length of stay &lt;48h, as determined by treating physician.

          -  At risk for self-harm, as determined by 1-to-1 status placement.

          -  Pregnant, as recorded on medical record.

          -  Cannot understand, speak, and read English.

          -  Patient does not wish to utilize Novolog and Lantus while in the hospital.

          -  Prior enrollment in this trial.

          -  Do not resuscitate status.

          -  Inability to give written informed consent.
