        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities. Trial-related

             activities to determine suitability for the trial

          -  Male, age below 6 years at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Patients with the diagnosis of haemophilia B (FIX (coagulation factor IX) activity
             level below or equal to 2%) based on medical records or central laboratory results

          -  Previously untreated or exposed to FIX containing products less than or equal to 3
             exposure days (5 previous exposures to blood components is acceptable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of FIX inhibitors (defined by medical records)

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product or related products

          -  Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as first dose
             administered of trial product

          -  Receipt of any investigational medicinal product within 30 days before screening

          -  Congenital or acquired coagulation disorder other than haemophilia B

          -  Any chronic disorder or severe disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             might jeopardise the patient's safety or compliance with the protocol

          -  Patient's parent(s)/LAR(s) (legally acceptable representative) mental incapacity,
             unwillingness to cooperate, or a language barrier precluding adequate understanding
             and cooperation
