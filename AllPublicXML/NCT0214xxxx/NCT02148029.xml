  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite standard care, 25%-50% of patients with clots in the deep veins of the arms and legs
      progress to chronic post-clot problems resulting in significant disability, loss of
      productivity, and healthcare costs. Reverse flow in the veins from an organizing clot is the
      primary cause of post-clot problems. Veins with early clot breakdown have a lower incidence
      of reverse flow. The investigators have observed that clot breakdown is enhanced by increased
      blood flow and that moderate arm and leg exercise result in increased venous blood flow.
      Hence, the investigators predict that a supervised exercise program in patients with deep
      vein clots could increase leg vein blood flow, accelerate clot breakdown, and decrease the
      risk of post clot problems. The primary hypothesis is that increased blood flow across the
      clot (induced by supervised exercise) will increase clot breakdown and decrease severity of
      post clot problems. The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of standard
      therapy compared to progressive exercise training in patients with leg deep vein clots.

    <textblock>
      Standard anticoagulation therapy for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) reflects the current
      short term focus on preventing pulmonary embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT. Despite standard
      care, 25% to 50% of patients with DVT progress to the chronic post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)
      resulting in significant disability, loss of productivity, and healthcare costs. The
      investigators postulate that a supervised exercise program in patients with acute DVT could
      increase lower extremity venous flow, accelerate thrombus resolution, and thereby decrease
      the risk of PTS. If the patient is unable to perform exercises, NMES (neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation) will be used to induce contraction of the muscles of the lower
      extremities.

      Aim 1 will test whether a 3-month exercise program has long-term clinical benefits in acute
      DVT. The primary outcome measures will be Villalta score for PTS and VEINS-QOL score (Venous
      Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study-QOL) for venous quality of life at 2 years
      of follow-up. Aim 2 will evaluate whether exercise therapy in patients with acute DVT
      enhances thrombus resolution. Aim 3 will assess the relationship between PTS, venous
      hemodynamics and exercise capacity.
