    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether micafungin is as efficacious as the current
      standard of fluconazole, to compare the safety of the two drugs in the treatment of proven
      neonatal candidiasis.

      It is also designed to further elucidate the pharmacokinetics of the two products in the
      growing and developing neonate and premature infant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidemiology of candidiasis is rapidly changing; recent estimates are that nearly 50% of
      Candida bloodstream isolates are non-albicans Candida species requiring the use of treatments
      active against them.

      Because of the high risk associated with candida infection in premature babies and
      fluconazole prophylaxis is now recommended in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) with a
      high incidence in fungal infections. As candida infection is difficult to prove and requires
      an urgent treatment, in particular to avoid central nervous system (CNS) infection, treatment
      is often started in high risk patients when the infection is only suspected, i.e. on clinical
      arguments without waiting for positive cultures (10% of cases).

      Fluconazole has not been approved for use in the treatment of neonatal candidiasis. In
      contrast, the efficacy of echinocandins for the treatment of invasive candidiasis has been
      suggested by pre-clinical and clinical studies.

      Related to Micafungin, the available data suggest that only dosages that are greater than
      what currently recommended in infants (2 to 4 mg/kg/day) may ensure adequate coverage of the
      CNS, given that ability of low dosages of micafungin to penetrate the cerebrospinal
      compartment and to diffuse in the cerebrospinal fluid is deemed suboptimal.

      The doses that will be administered are higher that currently used in order to optimize
      efficacy, and the concept of a loading dose that will be used for both drugs in this project,
      is present in antifungal treatment strategies for adults, but it has never been applied to
      infants and preterm neonates.

Fluconazole will be administered at a loading dose of 25 mg/kg on the first day and followed by a maintenance dose of 12 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg once daily, depending of corrected gestational age (GA) at the beginning of treatment:
12 mg/kg/day for neonates corrected GA (GA + postnatal age) &lt; 30 weeks
20 mg/kg/day for neonates corrected GA (GA + postnatal age) ≥ 30 weeks

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Neonates and infants between 24 up to 42 weeks gestational age AND with a post-natal
             age of 48 hours of life up to day of life (DOL) 120 at the time of culture
             acquisition.
