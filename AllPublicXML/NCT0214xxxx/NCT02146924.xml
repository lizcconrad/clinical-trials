      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cellular immunotherapy in
      treating patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Placing a modified gene into
      white blood cells may help the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the activity and safety of adoptive therapy using ex vivo
      expanded memory T cells that are enriched and genetically-modified to express a cluster of
      differentiation (CD)19-specific, hinge optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Arm 1:
      CD19R(EQ)28zeta/truncated human EGFR [EGFRt]+ central memory T cells [TCM]; Arm 2:
      CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ naive and memory T cells [TN/NEM]) shortly following a lymphodepleting
      preparative regimen for adults with poor prognosis CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      II. To determine the Phase II recommended dose (RP2D).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To study additional antitumor activity endpoints of
      CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TCM and CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TN/NEM. II. To explore the efficacy of
      infusional cetuximab to eliminate transferred CD19R(EQ)CD28zeta/EGFRt+ TCM and
      CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ TN/NEM.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      ARM I: Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treating physician's discretion 3-10 days
      before the T-cell infusion. Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing
      Tcm-enriched T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients who have evidence of disease,
      whose tumor(s) continue to express the appropriate antigen target may receive an optional
      second infusion of CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells after 28 days.

      ARM II: Patients receive lymphodepleting regimen per treating physician's discretion 3-10
      days before the T-cell infusion. Patients receive CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing
      Tn/nem-enriched T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients who have evidence of disease,
      whose tumor(s) continue to express the appropriate antigen target may receive an optional
      second infusion of CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/nem-enriched T cells after 28
      days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, weekly for 1
      month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years.
