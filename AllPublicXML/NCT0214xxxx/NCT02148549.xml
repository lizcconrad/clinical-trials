      FOLFIRINOX regimen was recently presented at an international oncology meeting and represents
      a new standard regimen in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. FOLFIRINOX is one of
      the high response rate treatment regimen , the investigators considered as a promising
      treatment as neoadjuvant chemotherapy . On the other hand , incidences of grade 3 or 4
      neutropenia , febrile neutropenia and diarrhea were significantly higher in the FOLFIRINOX
      group compared with gemcitabine group. Therefore, it was decided to consider the balance of
      safety and efficacy as a preoperative chemotherapy, the investigators use the FIRINOX regimen
      by eliminating LV and bolus 5-FU, and irinotecan reduced to 150mg/m2 of 180mg/m2 from
      FOLFIRINOX regimen

      FOLFIRINOX regimen. The investigators also evaluate the optimal treatment schedule of FIRINOX
      therapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, optimal duration between surgery and chemotherapy, R0
      resection rate, and resection rate for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.
