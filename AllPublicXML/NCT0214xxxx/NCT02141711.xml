    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      TAK-438 in healthy, non-Japanese men male subjects following a randomized, double blind,
      placebo controlled, sequential panel, multiple-dose schedule.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. TAK-438 is being tested to find a safe
      and well-tolerated dose. This study looked at pharmacokinetic (effect of the body on the
      drug) and pharmacodynamic properties (effect of the drug on the body) as well as look at lab
      results and side effects in people who took TAK-438. This study was designed as a randomized,
      sequential-panel, multiple repeat dose study.

      The study population consisted of 4 Cohorts with 12 participants in each Cohort; with 9
      participants randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-438, and 3 participants to receive
      placebo. Participants in each Cohort received a single dose of study drug once daily after a
      10-hour fast. The starting dose was 10 mg followed by administrations of 20, 40, and 30 mg.

      This single-centre trial was conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to participate
      in this study was up to 37 days. Participants made 2 visits to the clinic for screening, one
      11-day period of confinement to the clinic, and 2 further visits after the confinement
      period. All participants were contacted by telephone 7 days after last dose of study drug for
      a follow-up assessment.
