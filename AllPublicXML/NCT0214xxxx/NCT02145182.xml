        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject male or female, 18 years or older

          -  Subject with dialysis dependent renal failure (initiated more than 2 months prior to
             transplant)

          -  Subject is to receive a first kidney transplant from a standard criteria donor (SCD)
             or expanded criteria donor (ECD) deceased donor with a DGF risk score using the Irish
             scale of ≥ 25% (to be determined prior to surgery and before randomization)

          -  Subject able to provide written informed consent

          -  Subject must be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the study protocol

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (serum beta-hCG) and must be practicing an effective, reliable, and medically approved
             contraceptive regimen at the time of consent and for up to 5 months following
             discontinuation of treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject to receive a multi-organ transplant

          -  Subject to receive kidney(s) from donors &lt; 6 years of age

          -  Subject to receive a living donor kidney

          -  Subject is highly sensitized (high risk to develop acute antibody-mediated rejection
             [AMR]) to the donor (as determined by local center practice). Testing to determine
             high risk may include but is not limited to Flow cytometric cross match, single
             antigen bead testing and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity

          -  Subject has received a previous transplant

          -  Subject is participating in another investigational study

          -  Subject has a body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2 at screening

          -  Subject will be the recipient of an A, B, O Blood Glycoproteins (ABO)(blood type)
             incompatible kidney (A2 donors to B and O recipients will be allowed if the site has
             the ability to confirm A2 subtype)

          -  Subject will receive a kidney from a donation after cardiac death (DCD) donor

          -  Subject has a predicted Irish model risk of DGF &lt; 25%

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use a
             medically acceptable form of contraception

          -  Subjects with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or active hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection

          -  Subjects with active bacterial or other infection which is clinically significant in
             the opinion of the Investigator

          -  Subjects with a history of splenectomy

          -  Subjects with unresolved meningococcal disease

          -  Subjects with an unresolved systemic bacterial or fungal infection

          -  Subjects with known or suspected hereditary complement deficiency (for example, but
             not limited to: atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [aHUS], paroxysmal nocturnal
             hemoglobinuria [PNH])

          -  Subject has a current malignancy or a history of any malignancy (within the past 5
             years), except non-metastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix that has been treated appropriately

          -  Subject has a history of or is believed by the Investigator to have used an illicit
             drug(s) and/or abused alcohol within 3 months prior to screening

          -  Subject has a psychiatric or physical illness that in the opinion of the Investigator
             would interfere with the ability of the subject to participate in the study
