        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and on stable treatment for a period of 90
             days prior to screening with metformin as monotherapy. Stable is defined as unchanged
             dose

          -  Male or female, age between18-64 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing
             informed consent

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 20.0-35.0 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

          -  HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) between 6.5-10.0% (both inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any glucose lowering agent(s) other than metformin in a period of 90
             days before screening. An exception is short-term treatment (less than or equal to 7
             days in total) with insulin in connection with intercurrent illness

          -  Recurrent severe hypoglycaemia (more than 1 severe hypoglycaemic event during the last
             12 months) or hypoglycaemic unawareness as judged by the investigator or
             hospitalisation for diabetic ketoacidosis during the previous 6 months

          -  Blood or plasma donation within the past month or more than 500 mL within the last 3
             months prior to first semaglutide dosing
