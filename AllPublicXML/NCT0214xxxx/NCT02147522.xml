      Study Hypotheses (Ho) and Research Questions (RQ):

        -  Ho1. AHH will significantly improve patient depression treatment acceptance/adherence
           and depression symptoms vs UC at 6 and 12 months post-baseline.

        -  Ho2. A Helping Hand (AHH) will significantly improve and sustain patient self-care
           management in Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease (SEMCD) and Quality of Life vs
           UC at 6 and 12 months post-baseline.

        -  RQ1. What is the association between depression symptoms and concurrent chronic illness
           self-care management over time by group?

        -  RQ2. Will AHH reduce hospitalizations and Emergency Room visits and improve clinic
           appointment-keeping?

        -  RQ3. Will patient care satisfaction and reported barriers to self-care management vary
           by study group?

        -  RQ4. What factors are identified via qualitative assessments of patients, promotoras,
           Department of Health Services (DHS) medical and social work providers, and DHS
           clinic/organizational leadership regarding satisfaction with, sustainable uptake of, and
           suggested modifications of the AHH promotora delivery model?

        -  RQ5. What potential technology applications would enhance promotoras delivering
           patient-centered self-care training and resource navigation, communicating and
           integrating care with DHS, and disseminating AHH?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression, plus other chronic illness such as diabetes, coronary heart disease and
      heart failure is common among low-income, culturally diverse safety net care patients.
      Unfortunately, many of these patients are uncomfortable about either asking their doctor
      questions about their illness and treatment options and their illness self-care or informing
      their doctors about their treatment preferences. Lack of strong engagement with medical
      providers occurs because patients believe they lack the knowledge to ask questions or to
      understand and follow recommended self-care and their concern that their medical provider
      lacks understanding of their treatment preferences. These factors often result in patient
      worry, poor adherence to prescribed treatment, and worsening illness status and even early
      death. The study will be conducted by a university, the Los Angeles County Department of
      Health Services (DHS) and a community health worker organization research team. The study
      will be conducted within two DHS Patient-Centered Medical Home clinics, with each patient
      having a designated primary care team of physician, nurse, social worker and medical
      assistant. Study patients with major depression and other illnesses face numerous self-care
      management barriers: managing concurrent symptoms (depression, pain, anxiety etc.) and
      cultural influences (depression stigma, diet), difficulty in navigating primary and specialty
      doctor and treatment plans, while at the same time experiencing daily social and economic
      stress. The randomized comparative effectiveness study plans to recruit 350 patients with
      major depression and a concurrent chronic illness (i.e., diabetes, heart failure, coronary
      heart disease) from two DHS PCMH community health centers. To enhance patient-centered
      research community partnerships, patients will be provided A Helping Hand (AHH) in which a
      community organization- based promotora aims to activate patient-centered depression
      self-care training and practical assistance to: a) improve and personalize major depression
      self-care (e.g., medication or psychotherapy preference, treatment adherence, fatigue, pain,
      diet, activity, stress management, family/caregiver communication); b) activate
      patient-provider communication, clinic appointment keeping and treatment coordination; and c)
      and facilitate patient navigation and receipt of needed community resources. AHH aims to
      improve patient self-care management and patient-provider care management relationships among
      underserved low-income patients, who must simultaneously cope with major depression and
      chronic co-morbid physical illness. Study objectives aim to determine: 1) whether community
      health worker promotora care management training improves patient-centered outcomes, such as
      self-care need and management, treatment adherence, symptom improvement, and care
      satisfaction over the usual team care; 2) depression symptom improvement; and 3) patient
      hospitalizations and ER visits frequency.

    <measure>Response Rate - 50 Percent or Greater Reduction in Patient Health Survey-9 (PHQ-9) Score Since Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>6- and12-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9, which establishes provisional depressive disorder diagnosis as well as grades depressive symptom severity, will be obtained from all study subjects at recruitment and during the four waves of data collection (up to 12 months). The PHQ-9 scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day), with possible scores ranging from 0 to 27, with cut points of 5,10,15, and 20 representing the thresholds for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression. A validated Spanish version of the PHQ-9 will be used. Clinically meaningful improvement of depressive symptoms was assessed as a â‰¥50% score reduction since baseline assessment.</description>

    <description>The Physical Component Summary (PCS) is a norm-based score standardized to the general U.S. population with a mean of 50, and a SD of 10. Scores range from 0 to 100, a higher score indicating better physical health.</description>

    <description>The Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease (SEMCD) contains 6 items that are common across chronic diseases: symptom control, role function, emotional functioning and communicating with physicians, rated in a scale 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (totally confident). The score for the scale is the mean of the six items. Higher number indicates higher self-efficacy.</description>

        <description>The PHQ-9, which establishes provisional depressive disorder diagnosis as well as grades depressive symptom severity, will be obtained from all study subjects at recruitment and during the four waves of data collection (up to 12 months). The PHQ-9 scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day), with possible scores ranging from 0 to 27, with cut points of 5,10,15, and 20 representing the thresholds for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression. A validated Spanish version of the PHQ-9 will be used. Clinically meaningful improvement of depressive symptoms was assessed as a â‰¥50% score reduction since baseline assessment.</description>

      <desc>The study intervention provided only educational sessions, thus no serious and other non-serious adverse events were collected or assessed systematically. However, we documented event information revealed by family member of participants, if any.</desc>

          <title>A Helping Hand (AHH)</title>
          <description>Participants received PCMH depression care services from their respective county health clinic providers plus the AHH intervention. Promotoras provided 6 weekly in-person or via-telephone intervention followed by 3 monthly telephone sessions aimed at reducing the burden and strain on patients, families, and care providers by assessing, enhancing, and facilitating patient depression and co-morbid illness self-care management, and activating patient communication with clinic medical providers.</description>

          <title>Usual Care (UC)</title>
          <description>Participants received DHS Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) clinic usual care from their respective county health clinic providers.
PCMH model has available DHS medical providers and social workers for depression care and refer patients when indicated to community mental health clinics. Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) is available in some of participating clinics.</description>
