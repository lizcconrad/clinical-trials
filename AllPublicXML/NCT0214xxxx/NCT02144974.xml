  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total pelvic exenteration (TPE) is a rare operation, which is the only possible curative
      intervention to treat central residual or recurrent tumors of the vulvar, vaginal, cervical,
      or uterine malignancies after initial surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Several
      options for pelvic floor and vaginal reconstruction have been described. The transverse
      musculocutaneous gracilis (TMG) flap has been introduced for breast reconstruction as a free
      flap. The investigators adopted the pedicled TMG flap for reconstruction after TPE.

      Between November 2011 and February 2014, twelve patients underwent TPE and reconstruction
      with unilateral (6 patients) or bilateral (6 patients) pedicled TMG flaps. Five patients had
      vaginal reconstruction with bilateral TMG flaps. The investigators describe the operative
      procedure and the outcome of the operation in these patients.
