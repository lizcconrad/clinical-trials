      Background to main study question: Cardiac complications are a common cause of morbidity
      after non-cardiac surgery. Patients with perioperative myocardial injury (both MI, and lower
      levels of cardiac troponin elevation) experience higher short-term and long-term mortality.
      They are also at substantially increased risk of additional cardiac and non-cardiac
      complications. It is therefore plausible that myocardial injury adversely affects quality of
      life. This study will compare postoperative health-related quality of life of patients who
      did or did not experience perioperative myocardial injury (defined by troponin-I &gt; 0.07ng/ml)
      after non-cardiac surgery

      Study Design: Pilot prospective cohort study (n = 300). Population: Consecutive patients
      undergoing non-cardiac, non-transplant surgery at UHN.

      Background to secondary study questions:

        1. Clinically based risk stratification tools used in non-cardiac surgery (e.g., Revised
           Cardiac Risk Index) are of moderate utility and assign patients only to broad risk
           categories. This study will examine the usefulness of pre-operative biomarkers (BNP,
           HbA1c, and others) in supporting cardiac risk stratification and will address the
           question: Is there a set of preoperative criteria that can accurately inform the
           decision to monitor troponin postoperatively?

        2. Intra-operative physiological derangement measured with the Surgical Apgar Score
           correlates with morbidity and mortality 3-months postoperatively. This study will
           examine the relationship between the Surgical Apgar Score; continuous non-invasively
           monitored intraoperative metrics of hemoglobin concentration and occult hypovolemia
           (Pleth Variability Index) with the Masimo Radical-7 Pulse Co-Oximeter; and the primary
           and secondary outcomes. This aspect of the study will address the question: Can readily
           available intraoperative physiological data inform the decision to monitor troponin
           postoperatively?

        3. Quality of Recovery-40 Score evaluates (in the recovery room and at 24 hours
           postoperatively) the patient's subjective experience of their recovery from surgery.
           This metric is correlated with quality of life 3-months postop. This study will evaluate
           correlation between Quality of Recovery-15 Score, a valid and more efficient means of
           measuring recovery, and the primary and secondary outcomes.

        4. Approximately 2/3 of patients who have postoperative myocardial injury are asymptomatic
           and have no ECG changes. Diagnosis of MI requires biomarker elevation (Troponin &gt;
           0.3ng/ml) plus clinical or ECG or imaging evidence of myocardial injury. Of the latter 3
           criteria, 2 are often absent. In selected patients, this study will use trans-thoracic
           echocardiography, CT coronary angiography, and cardiac MRI to improve diagnostic yield
           and define those diagnostic modalities that are most useful in the postoperative
           patient.

      Rationale:

      Postoperative myocardial injury may negatively impact health-related quality of life.
      Affected patients may experience higher levels of postoperative dependency. This possibility
      has implications for patient rehabilitation, provincial and personal healthcare costs, as
      well as patients' physical, emotional and mental well-being and relationships. The public
      health dimension of this problem could therefore be significant. In addition, an incomplete
      understanding exists of how individual patient cardiac risk factors, in combination with the
      perioperative environment, result in myocardial injury. The diagnostic investigations that
      are most useful in this setting have not yet been clearly defined. Patients who fail to be
      rescued after experiencing postoperative complications (as distinct from failure to avoid
      experiencing the complication in the first instance) plays a central role in postoperative
      mortality. Early recognition of such patients is therefore crucial. By prospectively
      observing a cohort of high-risk surgical patients, this study will provide insight into how
      these factors interact. This will allow us to better characterize the potential predictors
      and features of postoperative myocardial injury. We hope that our findings will aid in the
      identification of patient characteristics associated with increased risks of postoperative
      myocardial injury, thus helping to direct diagnosis, early treatment and rescue. This study
      will thus potentially yield important data that will positively impact future patient care
      and the rational use of healthcare resources.
