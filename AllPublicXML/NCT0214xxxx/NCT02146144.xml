  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epimacular membrane (EMM) is a degenerative condition associated with age, with a
      variable impact on vision. Treatment is surgery based and consists of a vitrectomy followed
      by a peeling of the epimacular membrane using a microgripper. Peeling of the internal
      limiting membrane (ILM) is an adjuvant action that is now frequently practiced and which is
      expected to increase the success rate of EMM surgery by reducing the risk of recurrence of
      EMM. Although ILM peeling does not seem to have an adverse effect on visual acuity, it is not
      totally without consequence, it involves the risk of histological disorganization of the
      retina at the origin of one or several microscotomas, which are themselves responsible for a
      final visual discomfort. These microscotomas, resulting in the perception of somewhat black
      spots visible near the fixed point or the fixed image, may be highlighted by microperimetry
      and would be a loss of functional opportunity for the patient.

      In addition, recurrence of EMM, which the ILM peeling is supposed to diminish, does not alter
      the vision in half the patients. Furthermore, for those patients who are functionally
      affected by any such recurrence, a second epimacular membrane peeling surgery can be done.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the difference in microscotoma(s) before
      surgery and 6 months later, between an &quot;active ILM peeling&quot; group and a &quot;no ILM peeling&quot;
      group. Given the more invasive nature of ILM peeling, the investigators believe that the rate
      of microscotomas in these patients is higher than those without peeling.

      The visits for this trial are those planned for patients receiving EMM surgical operation,
      namely:

      Selection/Inclusion visit : D-90 to D-7 This visit can be split in two according to the
      requirements of the investigator and/or the patient.

        -  Full information about the trial

        -  Verification of the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria

        -  Obtaining the signed informed consent (the same day or after a period of reflection)

        -  Medical and surgical history - *Examination: Visual acuity measured on the ETDRS scale,
           near vision (Parinaud), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT),
           microperimetry and pre-operative: &quot;Patient discomfort&quot; questionnaire (Appendix 7), an
           assessment of the appearance of the lens at the slit lamp, examination of the fundus
           after pupillary dilation, biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment, retinal
           photography.

      Surgery visit D0:

        -  List of all the surgical procedures

        -  Randomization for ILM peeling or not, in the operating room after dyeing of the ILM by
           the Membraneblue-Dual® (Picture of the macula). An anonymous video of the surgery will
           be sent to Nantes for centralized processing of the analysis of the EMM's grip areas.

      To avoid bias, the follow-up visits will be made by an ophthalmologist and/or an orthoptist
      who will not know what action has been performed.

      Follow-up visit M1 (1 month after the surgery ± 7 days)

        -  Examination: Visual acuity measured on the ETDRS scale, near vision (Parinaud), spectral
           domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), Microscopic examination of the eye,
           microperimetry, fundus photography and post-operative &quot;Patient discomfort&quot; questionnaire
           (Appendix 8). Biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment, retinal photography.

        -  AE

      Follow-up visit M6 (6 months after the surgery ± 15 days)

        -  Examination: Visual acuity measured on the ETDRS scale, near vision (Parinaud), spectral
           domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), Microscopic examination of the eye,
           microperimetry, fundus photography and post-operative: &quot;Patient discomfort&quot;
           questionnaire (Appendix 8). Biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment, retinal
           photography.

        -  AE End of study visit M12 (12 months after the surgery ± 15 days)

        -  Examination: Visual acuity measured on the ETDRS scale, near vision (Parinaud), spectral
           domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), Microscopic examination of the eye,
           microperimetry, fundus photography and post-operative &quot;Patient discomfort&quot; questionnaire
           (Appendix 8), Biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment, retinal photography.
