  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to evaluate the clinical response, safety and survival of the FDA
      approved drugs Dabrafenib, Trametinib in combination with Metformin. Investigators
      hypothesize that the combination of an FDA approved non toxic dose of oral Metformin with the
      B-Raf inhibitor, Dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor, Trametinib will yield little toxicity and
      improve clinical outcomes in terms of objective response rates and survival in metastatic
      melanoma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a single-arm, single center, uncontrolled phase I/II trial to estimate the
      safety of the combined treatments and then estimate the efficacy in terms of objective
      response rate in patients with stage IIIC and Stage IV melanoma treated with
      dabrafenib/trametinib and metformin.

Phase II will estimate the efficacy of the drugs, enrolling 20 patients during stage 1 with an upper limit of 39 for the 2nd stage.</description>
