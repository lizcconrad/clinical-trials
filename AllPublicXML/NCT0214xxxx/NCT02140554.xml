    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, multi-site, single dose, Phase 1 study in up to 29
      adults with Severe Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The study will evaluate hematopoietic stem cell
      (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) using LentiGlobin BB305 Drug Product.

    <textblock>
      Subject participation for this study will be 2 years post-transplant. Subjects who enroll in
      this study will be asked to participate in a subsequent long-term follow up study that will
      monitor the safety and efficacy of the treatment they receive for up to 13 years
      post-transplant.

    <time_frame>1-24 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by the following:
success and kinetics of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment
safety and tolerability of plerixafor for mobilization
incidence of treatment-related mortality
incidence of mortality through 2 years after drug product infusion
detection of vector-derived replication competent lentivirus (RCL) in any subject
characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to malignancy
monitoring of laboratory parameters and Adverse Events (AEs)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical efficacy will be evaluated by comparing the frequency of clinical events secondary to sickle cell disease</measure>
    <time_frame>1-24 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be evaluated by the following:
severe vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). A severe VOC is defined as an episode of pain lasting more than 2 hours severe enough to require care at a medical facility. Priapism that lasts more than 2 hours and requires care at a medical facility is considered a severe VOC
acute chest syndrome events, defined as an acute event with pneumonia-like symptoms and the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate
strokes or transient ischemic attacks</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older.

          2. Diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD), with either βS/βS or βS/β0 or βS/β+ genotype.

          3. Have severe SCD. i.e., in the setting of appropriate supportive care measures for SCD
             (e.g., pain management plan, hydroxyurea), as judged by the Investigator, have
             experienced one or more of the following events:

               -  Recurrent severe vaso occlusive crises (VOC) (at least 2 episodes per year in the
                  preceding 2 years or in the 2 years prior to initiation of a regular transfusion
                  program).

               -  Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) (at least 2 total episodes in the prior 2 years, with
                  at least one episode in the past year or in the year prior to the initiation of a
                  regular transfusion program), defined as an acute event with pneumonia-like
                  symptoms and the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate.

          -  Prior receipt of an allogeneic transplant.

          -  Immediate family member with a known or suspected Familial Cancer Syndrome.
