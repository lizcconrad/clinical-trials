  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that a bibloc-apnea splint has a comparable efficacy on
      respiratory measures as a monobloc-apnea splint and that the cost of treatment is the same.
      The goal is primarily to compare the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) after 6 weeks of treatment
      and the cost of treatment during one year.

      This randomized controlled parallel group multicenter study includes 316 subjects referred
      for the treatment of moderate to severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The subjects visit the
      clinic at 5 scheduled occasions.

      The study includes 2 arms. Secondary measures are obtained by respiratory analysis and
      questionnaires. Electromyography (EMG) of the masseter muscle is recorded and the influence
      of bruxism is evaluated in terms effect on efficacy and adverse events
