  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is common in Kenya. The precursor of esophageal cancer is esophageal
      squamous dysplasia (ESD). In this study, persons known to have ESD will undergo endoscopic
      removal or ablation of ESD in order to prevent development of esophageal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) is the precursor lesion of esophageal squamous cell
      cancer. ESD causes no symptoms but can be detected by screening. ESD may harbor various
      grades of dysplasia. Patients with moderate grade or high grade dysplasia (MGD or HGD) have
      up to a 40-fold increased risk of esophageal squamous cell cancer.

      In this study, persons known to have ESD with MGD or HGD on the basis of prior screening will
      be invited to undergo endoscopic treatment with either endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
      and/or radio frequency ablation (RFA) in order to remove or ablate regions of ESD.
      Participants will undergo a series of endoscopies to treat ESD and monitor success of
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is 18-85 years of age, inclusive

          -  Participant has had a prior endoscopy with Lugol's chromoendoscopy demonstrating an
             unstained lesion (USL) of at least 5 mm which on biopsy contained moderate grade
             dysplasia (MGD), high grade dysplasia (HGD), or esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC)
             of flat mucosa limited to the lamina propria, with no evidence of invasion.

          -  The maximum allowable linear length of USL-bearing esophagus is 20 cm.

          -  No more than 14 continuous linear cm of esophagus require treatment for MGD, HGD, or
             ESCC.

          -  For patients with ESCC, CT scan of chest and upper third of the abdomen shows no
             exclusionary findings for the trial, such as metastasis.

          -  Participant is not pregnant and has no plans to become pregnant in the ensuing 12
             months (confirmation of pregnancy status in women of child-bearing age and ability
             required prior to each endoscopy with urine or blood test, if subject believes she may
             be pregnant or has missed a menstrual period)

          -  Participant is eligible for treatment and follow-up endoscopy and biopsy as required
             by the protocol

          -  Participant is willing to provide written, informed consent to participate in this
             clinical study and understands the responsibilities of trial participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Esophageal stricture preventing passage of a therapeutic endoscope

          -  Any prior endoscopic resection

          -  Any esophageal dilation in the past 12 months

          -  Any history of ESCC of the esophagus, except for ESCC of flat mucosa limited to the
             lamina propria diagnosed within 12 months of study enrollment.

          -  In participants with ESCC, any evidence of nodal involvement or distant metastases

          -  Any previous ablative therapy within the esophagus (photodynamic therapy, multipolar
             electrical coagulation, argon plasma coagulation, laser treatment, or other) or any
             radiation therapy to the esophagus.

          -  Any previous esophageal surgery, except fundoplication

          -  Evidence of esophageal varices detected within last 6 months or at initial EMR/RFA
             procedure

          -  Evidence of eosinophilic esophagitis on endoscopy and/or histology

          -  History of coagulopathy, or use of warfarin within the past month.

          -  Report of uncontrolled coagulopathy with international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2 or
             platelet count &lt;75,000 platelets per ÂµL (note: laboratory testing is not required for
             all subjects in this study)

          -  Participant is using aspirin, clopidogrel, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             that cannot be discontinued 7 days before and after therapeutic sessions

          -  Participant has a known history of unresolved drug or alcohol dependency that would

             post-treatment instructions, or follow-up guidelines

          -  Participant has an implantable pacing device (examples; automatic implantable
             cardioverter/defibrillator, neurostimulator, cardiac pacemaker) and has not received
             clearance for enrollment in this study by the physician responsible for the pacing
             device

          -  Participant suffers from psychiatric or other illness deemed by the investigator as an
             inability to comply with protocol
