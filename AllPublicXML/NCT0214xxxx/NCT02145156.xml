  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an innovative approach to improving HPV vaccination
      among the Hispanic population. The clinical objectives/aims of this HPV educational
      intervention project are to determine:

        1. The number of young adults and adolescents in each arm who received any dose of the HPV
           vaccine during the study period,

        2. The number of young adults and adolescents in each arm who initiated the HPV vaccine
           series during the study period,

        3. The number of young adults and adolescents in each arm who initiated but did not
           complete the HPV vaccine series during the study period,

        4. The number of young adults and adolescents in each arm, among all eligible, who
           completed the HPV vaccine series during the study period,

        5. The number of young adults and adolescents in each arm who completed the HPV vaccine
           series during the study period, among those who initiated the series at study start, and

        6. The number of young adults and adolescents in each arm who completed the HPV vaccine
           series among those who initiated the series during the study period.

      The implementation of this educational intervention in clinic waiting rooms is intended to
      assist primary care providers in communicating HPV vaccine awareness and education to parents
      and patients in a culturally tailored format.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While HPV infection is nearly ubiquitous among the sexually active population, the morbidity
      and mortality from HPV-related diseases disproportionately affects minorities and the poor.
      Hispanic women are at particularly high risk as they have the highest rates of invasive
      cervical cancer when compared to all other racial or ethnic groups in the U.S. Initiating the
      3-dose HPV vaccination series is more common among Hispanic adolescents than whites, but
      series completion has been lowest among Hispanic populations.

      To understand barriers to HPV vaccination and to provide insight into ways in which an
      existing educational intervention should be modified for a Hispanic population, the
      investigators conducted focus groups among Hispanic parents and Latina young adults. All
      groups reported vaccine cost, access to insurance, and a general lack of awareness and/or
      understanding of either HPV or the vaccine as barriers. All groups also wanted substantially
      more &quot;general&quot; information about both HPV and the vaccine in order to make informed
      vaccination decisions. The educational intervention was generally well received but there
      were universal suggestions from all the groups to provide additional basic information about
      HPV infection, to add information about the vaccine for boys/young men, and to modify the
      color scheme and logo to make it more eye-catching and pleasing.

      This current phase of the project will be comprised of real world testing of an iPad-based
      educational intervention about HPV, &quot;Combatting HPV Infection and Cancer&quot; (CHICOS) that has
      been revised and developed per focus group feedback to target the Hispanic population.

      By providing information that patients and parents have clearly indicated they want in a way
      that is culturally sensitive and meaningful and also individually personalized, the
      investigators hope to improve HPV vaccination rates.

        <population>Includes adolescents in the sample who could be matched to vaccination data, who had not received all 3 doses of the HPV vaccine prior to baseline, and who also had 1 or 2 doses of the HPV vaccine at study enrollment and completed the vaccine series during the study period.</population>

            <title>Tailored Intervention</title>
            <description>Intervention: Tailored educational materials. In this arm, participants will complete a baseline survey on an iPad, view a series of educational webpages on the iPad, and complete a brief post intervention survey.
Tailored educational materials: The tailored intervention will use participants' baseline survey responses to generate tailored educational messages about the HPV vaccine. These educational messages will reflect the top concerns indicated by the participant about the HPV vaccine. Additional tailoring will occur in the form of images matched to self-reported race and age, and using participants' first name in the information presented.</description>

Untailored educational materials: The untailored intervention will present educational information on the iPad that is not responsive to participants' baseline questionnaire answers and instead is derived directly from the HPV “Vaccine Information Sheet” that has been created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</description>
