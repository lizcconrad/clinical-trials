  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is a chronic mental health condition characterized by maladaptive food
      consumption (i.e., hypophagia) and distorted body image. There is substantial evidence of a
      phenotypic overlap between anorexia nervosa and anxiety disorders, as well as data suggesting
      the two share a common genetic pathway. Despite these findings, little research has examined
      fear conditioning among individuals with anorexia nervosa, and no research has examined
      whether individuals with anorexia nervosa have a propensity to overgeneralize conditioned
      fear stimuli, one of the more robust fear-conditioning markers of anxiety disorders. The
      current study assesses generalization of conditioned fear with fear-potentiated startle: the
      cross-species enhancement of the startle reflex when an organism is in a state of fear.
      Animal data, as well as an emerging literature in humans, tightly links fear-potentiated
      startle to the amygdala-based fear circuit. Thus, evidence of overgeneralized
      fear-potentiated startle in anorexia nervosa would link this eating disorder to
      hypersensitivity of the fear circuit and could inform the development of novel pharmacologic
      and psychological treatments for anorexia nervosa based on treatment models used in the
      anxiety disorders literature.

      The overarching objective of the current proposal is to examine the feasibility of applying a
      generalization of conditioned fear-potentiated startle paradigm, which has been used
      successfully to measure the sensitivity of fear networks in anxiety disorders, to adults with
      anorexia nervosa. The specific aim will be to examine whether conditioned-fear generalization
      gradients in anorexia nervosa participants differ from those in healthy controls. It is
      hypothesized that anorexia nervosa participants will display stronger generalization as
      indicated by less quadratic generalization gradients (i.e., a more gradual decline in
      conditioned fear as the generalization stimuli deviate from the conditioned fearful stimuli),
      which is indicative of a heightened sensitivity, or lower thresholds of activation, in the
      fear circuit (i.e., less danger information necessary to trigger the fear).
