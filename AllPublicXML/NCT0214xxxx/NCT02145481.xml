      The objective of the DeQCAD study is to measure the quality of the decision-making process
      for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) who are
      making treatment decisions. In particular, this study is seeking to answer: a) How informed
      are patients about their treatment choices, b) are patients participating in the
      decision-making process as much as they would like to, and c) do the treatment decisions made
      match patients' preferences?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), having a stent (or percutaneous coronary
      intervention or PCI) involves both risk and inconvenience, and thus it represents a classic
      &quot;preference-sensitive&quot; situation, in which treatment decisions should be aligned with the
      patient's preferences.

      In this project the investigators will develop the first comprehensive, patient-reported
      measure of decisional quality for CAD that is feasible to implement in a variety of settings.
      The investigators will accomplish this by: 1) Identifying the key elements to capture
      decisional quality and identifying candidate questions to address these elements, using
      patient and expert feedback; 2) Pilot testing a preliminary instrument in a diverse patient
      population to assess measurement properties and select a reduced set of candidate questions
      for further testing; and 3) Establish the reliability and validity of a new comprehensive
      decisional quality measure for single and repeated examinations. This will result in a
      multidimensional decisional quality instrument for patients with CAD that will be ready for
      implementation into routine care.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients ≥ 18 years old

          2. Able to answer survey questions in English

          3. Diagnosis of coronary artery disease in one of the following categories:

               1. Stable CAD group

                    -  Meets any 1 of the following 3 criteria for stable CAD: 1) The patient has a
                       clinical diagnosis or prior history of CAD; 2) Angina without change in
                       frequency or pattern for the 6 weeks prior to enrollment; 3) Angina is
                       controlled by rest and/or sublingual/oral/transcutaneous medications.

                    -  Accelerating pattern of stable angina with: 1) no ECG changes at rest; 2) no
                       cardiac marker evidence of myocardial necrosis (e.g., elevated troponin or
                       CK-MB); 3) scheduled for elective or urgent cardiac catheterization after
                       being evaluated in the outpatient setting (i.e., not from the emergency
                       department or inpatient hospitalization).

               2. Acute coronary syndrome group • Acute coronary syndrome where there is cardiac
                  marker evidence of myocardial necrosis (e.g., elevated troponin or CK-MB) without
                  new ST-segment elevation. Includes non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI).

        Exclusion criteria:

             or left bundle branch block on the admission ECG.

             discomfort of myocardial ischemic origin.

          5. Cognitive impairment such that the patient cannot give informed consent for himself or
