    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site trial to be conducted at 2 clinical sites. Up to 20
      subjects will receive study treatments. Following study treatments, follow-up visits will
      occur at 60, 90 and 180 days from each subject's last study treatment.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects with moderate to severe atrophic acne scars will be enrolled. Subjects will receive
      up to three dual-depth treatments to the cheek and temple areas impacted by acne scars,
      treating the number of treatment squares necessary to cover the area of scarring. Each
      treatment square will receive 30 lines per transducer depth for a total of 60 lines per
      treatment square. Three treatments 30 days apart will be required.
