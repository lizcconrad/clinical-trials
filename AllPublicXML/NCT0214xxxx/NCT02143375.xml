  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiologic gingival pigmentation(PGP) is the most common type of gingival pigmentation and
      cosmetic concern particularly in gummy smile patients. Laser therapy is an effective and
      noninvasive treatment option. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of diod
      laser on the treatment of PGP in patients.

      Preoperative and postoperative photographic and clinical observations about the gingival
      melanin pigmentation were made according to Dummett-Gupta Oral Pigmentation Index scoring
      criteria given by Dummett C.O. in 1964 The investigators classified pigmented gingiva in
      patients as:

        1. Mild:Pink to slightly brown

        2. Moderate:Deep brown or black

        3. Severe:Mixed in color Score in each tooth was taken including one full inter dental
           papilla. Observations were made in natural light. The assessment of the scoring of the
           pigmentation index were done by all the three examiners, and the agreed upon score was
           assigned to prevent individual variations.

      The investigators compared the intensity of pigmentation in each patient in recall sessions
      after 1month and 3mounth postoperative.

    <description>The 810-nm diode laser has energy and wavelength characteristics that specially target the soft tissues. It has an affinity for hemoglobin and melanin, so it is an excellent soft tissue laser and is applicated for cutting and coagulating gingival tissue.Today,sparse studies have been published assessing physiologic gingival pigmentation using diode laser,therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of diode laser on the treatment of gingival pigmentation in adult patients.</description>
