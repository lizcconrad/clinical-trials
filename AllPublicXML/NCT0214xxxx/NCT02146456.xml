  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colloid solution is generally used to maintain intravascular volume. It is reported to impair
      blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro more than crystalloid does by prolonging coagulation
      time and decreasing clot strength. The formed fibrin clot is more vulnerable for fibrinolysis
      in a case of using colloid. Dilution of plasmin in vitro with colloid enhances fibrinolysis
      primarily by diminishing Î±2-antiplasmin-plasmin interaction.

      Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytics that competitively inhibits the activation of
      plasminogen, by binding to specific site of both plasminogen and plasmin, a molecule
      responsible for the degradation of fibrin, a protein that forms the framework of blood clot.
      It is used to treat or prevent excessive blood loss during surgery and in other medical
      conditions. Gastrointestinal effect, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypersensitivity reaction,
      or potential risk of thrombosis is reported as the adverse effect of tranexamic acid.

      We hypothesized that inhibition of plasmin by tranexamic acid after colloid administration
      can improve the colloid-induced clot strength impairment.
