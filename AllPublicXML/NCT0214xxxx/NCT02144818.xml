    <textblock>
      During the last decades, owing to the growing tendency of women to delay childbearing plans
      because of career and personal priorities, fertility specialists today are seeing more and
      more women with poor ovarian reserve and with poor ovarian response Controlled ovarian
      hyperstimulation (COH) is considered a important factor in the success of in vitro
      fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET), enabling the recruitment of multiple oocytes and,
      thereby, resulting in more than one embryo. However, owing to the extreme variability in
      ovarian response to COH, in a subgroup of patients with poor ovarian response, this method
      may yield a very small number of follicles After succeeding in maximal recruitment of the
      follicles, the triggering of ovulation is extremely important in order to achieve, as many
      as, mature oocytes.

      Several studies have reported retrieval of more mature oocytes after GnRH agonist triggering
      compared to the number of oocytes retrieved after hCG. Among the possible advantages of GnRH
      agonist for final oocyte maturation is the simultaneous induction of an FSH surge. The role
      of the natural mid-cycle FSH surge is not fully clear. FSH was reported to induce LH receptor
      formation in luteinizing granulosa cells, and to promote oocyte nuclear maturation and
      cumulus expansion .

      Another method described to trigger ovulation is the &quot;Dual triggering&quot;- GnRH agonist 40 h
      prior to ovum pickup and hCG added 6 h after the first trigger. The dual triggering was
      described as the treatment in cases with recurrent empty follicles.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate three different methods of ovulation triggering
      in women with poor ovarian response
