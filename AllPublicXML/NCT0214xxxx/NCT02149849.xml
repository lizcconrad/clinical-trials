    <textblock>
      Up to 85% experience shoulder pain after thoracic surgery, especially on the same side as
      surgery are performed. Referred phrenic nerve pain is probably one cause of ipsilateral
      shoulder pain (ISP), and positioning of the arm during surgery another. Studies indicates
      that ISP can be caused by the positioning of the patient during surgery due to muscle -and
      ligament strain. Can a change in the surgical positioning (less press and stretch) of the
      ipsilateral arm effect the shoulder pain after thoracic surgery?

    <description>Using visual analog scale for assesing pain in the shoulder (Scale from 0-10). Mesauring times: VAS pain related to the shoulder before surgery, VAS pain shoulder at day 1 and 3 after surgery. Further will Oslo University Hospital scheme for registration of pain for location and characteristic also be used.</description>
