  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test how well magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can measure
      whole gut transit time in people with constipation, and how readily it can detect a change in
      transit time induced by taking a dietary supplement with laxative effects.The investigators
      expect to demonstrate that ispaghula (psyllium) accelerates movement of matter through the
      intestinal tract.

      The investigators will also assess whether a change in gut bacteria and the chemicals that
      they release can be detected.
