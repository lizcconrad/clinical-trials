      1. Objective:

             -  To popularize knowledge of prevention and health care of osteoporosis.

             -  To investigate the prevalence of primary osteoporosis in community residents.

        2. Method:

             -  The survey study included the five boroughs of six communities in Shanghai (Xuhui
                District 2, Pudong New Area 1, Minhang District 1, Pudong New Area 1, Jiading
                District 1). 10,000 participants are expected to be included.

             -  Through a questionnaire and physical examination form, carries on the investigation
                to the 50-85 years old postmenopausal women during the 3-year follow-up period.

             -  Make a survey of Bone Mineral Density,SF-36,international osteoporosis foundation
                ONE-MINUTE OSTEOPOROSIS RISK TEST,Markers of bone metabolism
                test,EQ-5D,Hepatic-renal function test and thyroid stimulating hormone level test.

             -  Physicians in each community as the backbone, Shanghai University of Traditional
                Chinese Medicine, Longhua Hospital is responsible for personnel training.

             -  Shanghai Clinical Research Center is responsible for program and data management.

             -  Shanghai District Health and Family Planning Commission is responsible for
