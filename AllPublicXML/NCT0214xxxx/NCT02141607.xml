  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between shock, ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, hemodynamic
      instability, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiorgan failure has been
      extensively investigated, but there is no consensus on the trigger mechanisms of tissue
      injury at the molecular level.

      Current therapies are targeted to reduce symptoms of shock and multiorgan damage but they are
      unable to act at the &quot;beginning of the cascade&quot;, because of the lack of a model explaining
      the molecular basis of shock induced tissue injury and ensuing organ damage.

      The present observational study is aimed at identifying the molecular triggers of acute heart
      failure (HF) induced by shock and to identify inflammatory mediators and markers that are
      activated in shock, with a particular emphasis on the role of uncontrolled proteolytic
      activity.

    <description>The clinical endpoint will be Acute Heart Failure (AHF), assessed by a pool of measures/estimates of cardiac function and filling pressures, based on cardiac output monitoring, inotropic drugs requirements, left and right ventricles assessment using echocardiography.

    <description>The clinical endpoints will be:
The Acute Heart Failure (AHF) assessed by a pool of measures/estimates of cardiac function and filling pressures, based on cardiac output monitoring, inotropic drugs requirements, left and right ventricles assessment using echocardiography. AHF will be at evaluated within 7 days after ICU admission.
Mechanical ventilation (MV)-free days or organ support (vasopressor, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), etc.) free-days
Survival to ICU
Prognosis at discharge from the ICU (objective - dead or alive, morbidities - and subjective)
Prognosis at discharge from the hospital (objective - dead or alive, morbidities - and subjective).
The changes in molecular biomarkers will be evaluated by means of proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis of blood samples collected within 7 days after ICU admission</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Long term effects of AHF in survivors assessed by changes in omics markers</measure>
    <time_frame>at about 100 days from ICU admission and enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients discharged after a shock episode have high morbidity and mortality rates, and evidences indicate that physiological condition is restored only after several months. The blood sample will be collected only in patients in healthy conditions, reporting no re-hospitalization associated to shock sequelae during the follow up.</description>

    <description>Septic shock is defined as sepsis-induced hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg or a drop of &gt; 40 mm Hg from baseline or mean arterial pressure &lt; 70 mm Hg persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

    <description>The control group will consist on:
5 healthy blood donors: serving only for the purposes of obtaining reference values for proteomics analysis
a cohort of 20 patients hospitalized for sepsis OR cardiac syndromes not developing shock: will be recruited from patients admitted to the hospital during the study period. The clinical status of the patients will be assessed during hospitalization to ascertain shock and AHF development. Shock development will be an exclusion criteria.</description>
