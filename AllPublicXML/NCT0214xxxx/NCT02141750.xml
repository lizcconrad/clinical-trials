      The Registry pretends to identify stratification, diagnosis and treatment approaches in
      patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in community hospitals with tertiary hospitals to
      optimize resources and identify strategies to improve health care quality through the
      creation of clinical guidelines that serve for unify management and treatment methods with
      adherence to international guidelines which include suggestions for treatment and medication.
