  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major hypothesis explaining drug resistance is overexpression of p-glycoprotein at the
      target lesion. Based on several studies, p-glycoprotein (P-gp) has an important role in
      neurologic diseases, especially in drug resistant epilepsy. But there is no surrogate marker
      that can quantify the expression of P-gp because of the difficulty in measuring substances in
      the neurologic system and the lack of clinical trials. Here, the investigators use a novel
      non-invasive [11C] -verapamil Brain PET and SPAM analytic method as a surrogate marker for
      quantifying the expression of p-glycoprotein.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study on healthy volunteers and a case-control study on patients with drug resistant
      epilepsy and drug sensitive epilepsy is performed. The investigators compare the whole brain
      SUV in each group (normal control, drug resistant epilepsy, drug sensitive epilepsy) and the
      asymmetry by the standardized uptake value(SUV) of ipsilateral areas and contralateral areas.

      [11C] -verapamil PET will be used as a surrogate marker of P-gp expression in patients with
      epilepsy, and will be an important prognostic factor of individualized drug therapy. Also, it
      can be used as a biomarker in checking of the drug efficacy of novel medications.
      Furthermore, by localizing epileptogenic zones for patients, [11C] -verapamil PET could
      contribute in improving the prognosis of surgical treatment in drug resistant epilepsy.
