  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us learn what is the best amount of fluid to give to
      patients during bladder surgery in order to avoid delayed bowel function after surgery, which
      could prolong hospital stay.

    <measure>incidence of postoperative ileus (POI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>POI will be defined as intolerance of oral intake by postoperative day 5, or the cessation of diet and/or placement of an NGT for clinical signs or symptoms associated with POI, including one or more of the following: nausea, emesis, abdominal bloating or distension, or excessive burping. Rate of ileus will be compared between the treatment groups using the chi-square test. A 95% confidence interval for the difference in ileus rate will also be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>complications</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Overall rate of grade 2-5 30-day complications, and rate of grade 2-5 gastrointestinal, pulmonary, renal, hematologic and cardiac complications will also be compared using the chi-square test. Based rate of grade 2-5 gastrointestinal, pulmonary, renal, hematologic and cardiac complications will also be compared using the chi-square test.</description>

  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The non-intervention group will receive maintenance crystalloid fluid at 10cc/kg/h. Blood loss will be replaced 1:1 with albumin. Transfusion will follow transfusion criteria. Fluid management will not be dependent on the EV1000</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Goal directed fluid therapy (GDT)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the GDT arm, patient's SV will be optimized before induction with crystalloid boluses prior to induction of general anesthesia. The GDT arm will have fluid therapy guided by the Edwards EV1000-clinical platform and maintenance crystalloid fluid will be 3cc/kg/h. During the surgical procedure when SVV rises above 12 an albumin bolus will be administered at 250 ml increments until the SVV falls below 8. Transfusion will follow transfusion criteria.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (21 years old or greater) who are able to provide informed consent

          -  Patients who undergo an open, elective radical cystectomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active atrial fibrillation or flutter, since the algorithm is not
             accurate in case of cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Female patients who are pregnant (female patients of child-bearing potential must have
             a negative serum pregnancy test â‰¤ 14 days prior to surgery or 15 to 30 days prior to
             surgery with a negative urine pregnancy test the morning of surgery)

          -  Presence of ascites, because increased abdominal pressure interferes with EV1000
             reading accuracy

          -  BMI &gt; 45 or &lt;17, because increased abdominal pressure interferes with EV1000 reading
             accuracy
