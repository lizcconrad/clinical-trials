      This study is complementary to the main study &quot;Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Serum Levels
      Evolution During the Six Months After Alcohol Withdrawal &quot; NCT01491347.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Bdnf gene - Val66Met polymorphism in subjects
      with alcohol dependence according to their alcohol consumption status 6 months after
      withdrawal (relapse or abstinence), in relation to the presence of psychiatric
      co-morbidities.
