      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      single ascending doses of ASP015K.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 3 dose cohorts (low, medium and high). Each cohort will
      consist of 8 subjects with a 3:1 randomization ratio for ASP015K to placebo. Subjects will be
      confined to the clinic for study procedures until day 4 (5 days). After all subjects in a
      dose cohort have completed study procedures through day 4, a decision will be made whether or
      not dosing and enrollment of the next dose cohort should occur, which will only take place
      after a review of the safety and tolerability data through day 4 of the most recent dose
      cohort and any additional reported adverse events (AEs) for previously dosed cohorts.

             any investigational drugs within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever is
