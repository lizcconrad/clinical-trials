  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical education was transformed from mainly didactic class before 19th century to the
      clerkship and internship training based on the concept of &quot;learning by doing&quot; in 20th
      century. There are new challenges for medical education in the 21th century, including
      knowledge explosion, the importance of communication and teamwork in clinical care, and lack
      of comprehensive and systemic experiential learning. Therefore, another paradigm shift of
      medical education in this century is necessary. This research project, through applying
      high-fidelity simulation, resuscitation teamwork model, and concept of flipped classroom in
      resuscitation training, take the innovation and reform of resuscitation training as a pilot
      test for paradigm shift of medical education.

      This research project is a 4-year project. Three innovative intervention for resuscitation
      training will be developed, implemented, and evaluated. There will be 4 phases in this
      project:

        1. Development phase (1st year): establishment of structure, validity and reliability test,
           faculty development, and course preparation.

        2. Experiment phase (2nd year): comparative studies will be conducted.

        3. Implementation phase (3rd year): integration and implementation of innovative
           interventions.

        4. Evaluation phase (4th year): effectiveness evaluation and analysis of learning
           retention.

      Through innovation, development, implementation and effectiveness evaluation in this 4
      phases, this research project hope to integrate high-fidelity simulation, resuscitation
      teamwork model, and concept of flipped classroom, into resuscitation training successfully
      and appropriately. Furthermore, these experiences can provide the bases of paradigm shift in
      medical education in the future.
