  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of adjuvant
      corticosteroids in clinically diagnosed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in infants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine whether the early administration of adjuvant corticosteroids in
      addition to high dose oral Co-trimoxazole reduces mortality amongst infants aged 2-6 months
      with vertically acquired HIV and clinically diagnosed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.
      Infants will be randomized to receive either a steroid regime of oral prednisolone at 2 mg/kg
      for 7 days, then 1 mg/kg for 7 days, then 0.5mg/kg for 7 days for a total of 21 days or
      placebo.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive infants with HIV and clinical features of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia
             who require oxygen (oxygen saturations in air &lt; 90%).

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia will be made by one of the study
             investigators. All infants must be HIV ELISA positive or exposed, have an oxygen
             requirement (saturations on air &lt; 90%) and have severe respiratory distress and cough.
             They may also have a low grade fever, clear chest or diffuse signs on auscultation and
             features suggestive of Pneumocystis jiroveci infection on chest radiography.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous known allergy or hypersensitivity or other contraindication to
             corticosteroids or co-trimoxazole.

          -  Previous treatment for suspected Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia or a delay starting
             steroids for greater than 24 hours after starting high dose co-trimoxazole.

          -  Patients who are not exposed to HIV.

          -  Infants with known preexisting active pulmonary or cardiac disease.

          -  Patients who do not live within the Blantyre district and who are unable to attend
             follow up at QECH.

          -  Infants whose parents or guardians refuse consent.
