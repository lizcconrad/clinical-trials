  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to pursue statistical analysis on a series of molecular
      laboratory results obtained from chronic wounds. It elucidated diversity, quantification, and
      other aspects of microbial diversity in chronic wounds.

    <description>The study elucidated diversity, quantification, and other aspects of microbial diversity in chronic wounds. It evaluated samples from different regions, different types of wounds, different outcomes, and longitudinal data if multiple samples were sent over time from a single individual.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2. Data Collection: The molecular wound cultures have been performed on thousands of patients from around the country. The information from the culture results that were processed were used to compile an antibiogram for a laboratory.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>There are many geographic regions which have a number of samples which could be analyzed and compared to other geographic regions yielding valuable insight into the microbiology of chronic wounds.</description>
