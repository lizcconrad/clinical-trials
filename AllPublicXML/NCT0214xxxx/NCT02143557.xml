  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chylothorax occurs in ~3 to 5 % of infants undergoing cardiac surgery. Standard treatment
      requires discontinuation of breast milk feeding, due to the abundance of long chain
      triglycerides, and transition to a medium chain triglyceride (MCT) based formula. Objective:
      To determine the effectiveness of fat-modified breast milk (MBM) for the treatment of
      chylothorax compared with MCT-formula. Hypothesis: The investigators primary hypothesis was
      that infants fed MBM would have more chyle drainage in the first 5 days after diagnosis
      compared to infants fed an MCT based formula which is the current standard of care. Design:
      Infants with chylothorax were eligible. Treatment infants (n=8) received mother's own milk
      that had been modified by removing the fat layer via centrifugation and adding MCT and
      nutrients to provide 67 kcal/mL and 11 g/100 mL protein (MBM group). Control infants (n=8)
      received an MCT-formula (MCT group). The feeding intervention was a minimum of 6 weeks after
      chest tube removal per The Hospital for Sick Children standard chylothorax treatment
      protocol. Outcome measures collected included chyle drainage from chest tubes, weight, length
      and head circumference measurements and estimated energy and nutrient intake.

    <description>Average daily energy, protein and other nutrient intakes were calculated using milk volumes consumed (recorded in the medical record [in-hospital] or 3 day consecutive food records [after discharge]), analyzed breast milk fat composition values, milk nutrient values from the literature, product monographs and Food Processor SQL Ed v. 10.2 (ESHA Research).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants &lt; 12 months of age who were diagnosed with chylothorax.

          -  Infants included in the intervention group (MBM) needed to have received &gt;80% of their
             enteral feeds as breast milk prior to surgery.

          -  Infants included in the control group (MCT-formula) needed to have received &lt;80% of
             their enteral feeds as breast milk prior to surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were excluded if their diagnosis made it unlikely that they would be able to
             follow the hospital's standard 6 week protocol for treatment of chylothorax

          -  Were receiving only parenteral nutrition at the time of diagnosis of chylothorax

          -  Primary caregiver of the baby did not have good comprehension of English.
