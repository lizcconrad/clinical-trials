  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eye care professionals prescribe contact lenses to new wearers on a daily basis, and it is
      common practice for practitioners to educate their patients to gradually increase their
      contact lens wear time over their first few days of use; however, there is no scientific
      basis in the literature for this practice. This study will compare the ocular health and
      comfort of new contact lens wearers who are randomly assigned to begin contact lens wear with
      increasing wearing time versus those who immediately start full-time wear (eight hours or
      more/day). The increasing wearing time group will wear daily wear contact lenses (Acuvue
      Oasys) for two, four, six, eight, and eight or more hours on the first, second, third,
      fourth, and fifth days, respectively. The other group will be instructed to wear the same
      contact lenses for eight or more hours per day, starting with the first day of wear. Both
      groups of subjects will have their eye health and comfort evaluated at baseline, one, and two
      weeks with a lighted-microscope and eye comfort surveys. Subjects will also keep a daily log
      of eye comfort with a visual analog scale survey at home. All subjects will learn how to wear
      and take care of contact lenses. They will also receive a prescription for contact lenses at
      the conclusion if they wish to continue wearing the study contact lenses.

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will measure the subject's visual acuity with a Bailey-Lovie high-contrast paper (logMAR) chart. If the patient is unable to read the 20/40 letters, the investigator will pinhole over the subject's unaided or presenting refractive error correction (glasses) to determine the subject's visual potential. The investigator will encourage the subject to do their best while reading the chart.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-Invasive Break Up Time (NIBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Medmont E300, which is a device used during routine eye exams, will be used to determine the subject's NIBUT.7 In brief, the Medmont will be positioned over the subject's right eye. The subject will then be asked to look into the instrument at the central green ring. They will then be asked to blink three times. After the third blink, the subject will be asked to keep their eyes open and to not blink for as long as possible while the investigator records NIBUT as the amount of time required for the first distortion detected in the array of Placido disk rings. The subject will then be allowed to blink normally for ten seconds before repeating the procedure on the fellow eye. NIBUT will be repeated in triplicate for each eye and averaged.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear Meniscus Height</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Oculus Keratograph 5M will be used to determine the subject's tear meniscus height. In brief, the subject will be asked to look at the target within the instrument. The subject will then be asked to blink at a normal rate and remain still until the instrument has determined their tear meniscus height.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bulbar &amp; Limbal Redness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Oculus Keratograph 5M will also be used to determine the subject's bulbar and limbal redness. In brief, the subject will be asked to look at the instrument. The instrument will then automatically quantify the subject's degree of bulbar and limbal redness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Slit-Lamp Exam</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will use a slit-lamp biomicroscope to document the general appearance of the anterior eye structures: eye lashes, eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea. Eyelids will be graded based upon a grading scale that was agreed upon by the investigators. The front of each eye will also be evaluated to confirm that the subject's eyes are healthy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A sterile sodium fluorescein strip will be wet with sterile saline and applied to the superior bulbar conjunctiva. After waiting for about one minute, corneal staining will be assessed with a cobalt blue light and a yellow filter. The Cornea and Contact Lens Research Unit CCLRU grading scale will be used to evaluate staining.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Schirmer's Test I</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tear volume will be assessed with Schirmer's Test. In brief, the strip will be placed at the temporal third of the lower eyelids. The subject will then be asked to close their eyes lightly for five minutes. The length of wetting will then be measured and recorded in mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects will also be given an eye comfort diary to be taken home and used on a daily basis; subjects will record their end of day contact lens wear comfort in this diary on a visual analog scale (1-100 scale).They will also document their approximate contact lens wear time in this diary.</description>
