  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Denutrition and Obesity are risk factors for perioperative surgical complications.

      In patient with cancer, incidence of denutrition is markedly increased. Surgical resection of
      cancer induces a high intensity cellular stress response and catabolism reinforcing the risk
      for perioperative denutrition.

      In this study, we thought to investigate the change in body composition during the
      perioperative period using anthropometric measurements and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis
      (BIA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body composition measurements will be performed before surgical procedure (7 days) and at day
      1, day 5, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery.

      Others data will be recorded including anthropometric measurements, nutritional intake,
      occurence of surgical complication, type of surgical procedure, type and stage of cancer, and
      CT-scan measurements of subcutaneous abdominal fat, visceral fat and peri-renal fat before
      surgery and at 6 months.
