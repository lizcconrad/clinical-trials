  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors characterizing
      central obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and high blood pressure. The concept of
      MetS represents the pre-cardiovascular and pre-diabetic pathologic conditions, which has been
      a useful tool in prognosing the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus.
      Importantly, interventions applied at the pre-pathologic stage with MetS would be of great
      clinical and health significance in achieving better preventive and therapeutic outcomes.
      Yoga, a mind-body exercise, has been suggested to have beneficial effects on dyslipidemia,
      hypertension and diabetes. A pilot study has demonstrated the trends in the improvement of
      metabolic parameters in middle-aged adults with MetS but the findings are inconclusive
      because of the small sample size and brief yoga follow-up period (i.e., 2-month). In addition
      to the needs of a better designed randomized controlled trial in studying the beneficial
      effect of yoga in controlling MetS in middle-aged individuals, the investigation on yoga and
      MetS in elderly population has been lacking. This is important as the potential use of yoga
      as lifestyle modification in elderly individuals with MetS will result in significant
      reduction of the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Thus, this study aims to
      examine the efficacy of yoga exercise in improving metabolic abnormalities in middle-aged and
      older adults with MetS. In addition to elderly, middle-aged adults are included in the
      present investigation because of the idea that cardiovascular diseases and diabetes with
      aging can be mostly prevented by intervention at the middle-age. A randomized controlled
      trial with repeated measure design will be conducted to examine the effect of 1-year regular
      yoga training on the MetS parameters in middle-aged and older individuals who are 30-60 and
      60-80 years of age, respectively. Primary outcome measures include waist circumference,
      systolic/diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, triglyceride, and lipid cholesterol profile
      whereas secondary outcome measures include self-reported stress and depression levels. This
      study is anticipated to provide valuable information in exploring the therapeutic role of
      yoga in managing MetS. As yoga exercise is an economical regimen which can be easily and
      readily applied to large scale of target population, it is of hope to be practically useful
      to relieve the burden on cardiovascular disease and diabetes by introducing yoga lifestyle to
      the management of MetS.

    <description>The operational definition of waist circumference is the measure of circumference at the waist area. This is a commonly used indicator for recognizing central obesity. The waist circumference will be determined by using tape with metric scale. To determine the waist circumference, the upper hip bone will be located and a measuring tape will be placed around the abdomen. The tape measure will be horizontal and the measuring tape will not be snug but without causing compressions on the skin.</description>

    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>Resting blood pressure measurement will be performed after the subject has taken 15-minute rest in the laboratory by using an electronic blood pressure monitor. Both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be obtained with the cuff over brachial artery region at the level of heart.</description>

    <measure>Change in blood glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements will be performed on the glucose and insulin level in venous blood sample collected after overnight fast. Subjects will be asked to come to the laboratory after an overnight ~10 hours fasting. Before each resting blood sampling, subjects will be requested to sit in a quiet environment for 15 minutes prior to blood collection. Ten ml of venous blood will be drawn from an antecubital vein in the forearm. The blood collection will be performed by a licensed nurse or medical lab technologist. After collection of venous blood sample, blood samples will be dispensed into a lithium heparin plastic tube to prevent coagulation. The remnant whole blood will be centrifuged to obtain plasma samples and stored at -80°C in a freezer before being analyzed for glucose</description>

    <description>Self-reported stress and depression levels are proposed to be the secondary outcome measures because the stress and depression levels could be improved by yoga intervention which might have beneficial effects on MetS parameters indirectly. The indicator of stress level will be adopted to estimate the mental health in this project. The Patton Type A personality questionnaire will be used to examine the stress level. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) will be used to estimate the depression level of the subjects.</description>
