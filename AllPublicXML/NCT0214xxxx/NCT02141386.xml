  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment remains a major disability for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy for treating MS-associated
      cognitive deficits using a unique computer-based plasticity-based and adaptive cognitive
      remediation treatment (PACR) compared to a computer-based control. This novel cognitive
      remediation approach has led to striking improvements in cognitive functioning in other
      disorders (schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, aging, and dementia) but has never been
      applied to individuals with MS. The investigators will enroll 136 MS participants who will be
      randomized in a 2:1 pattern to complete either the treatment or control condition for 60
      hours across a 12-week treatment period. Both the treatment and control conditions will be
      accessed remotely by the subjects from a study-provided laptop computer. Study outcomes will
      include program compliance, performance on study tasks and neuropsychological measures,
      quality of life and functional status. Given the success of this program with other disorders
      and strong preliminary data from our feasibility study, the investigators believe PACR is an
      exciting untapped opportunity to improve cognition in individuals with MS.
