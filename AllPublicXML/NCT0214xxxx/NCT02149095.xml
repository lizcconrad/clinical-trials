  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TransCon PEG treprostinil is a novel prodrug form of treprostinil, in which treprostinil is
      reversibly conjugated via a four-arm branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. Reversible
      coupling of treprostinil to PEG should allow for a modified extended pharmacokinetic profile
      to achieve sustained plasma concentrations of treprostinil.

      This will be the first investigation of TransCon PEG treprostinil in humans. This study aims
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating single doses of a subcutaneous injection of TransCon PEG
      treprostinil.
