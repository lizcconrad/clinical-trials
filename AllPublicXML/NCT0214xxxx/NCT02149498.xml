      A cornerstone in PD research is the investigation of neurophysiological changes as potential
      biomarkers that could help in tracking disease progression and response to therapies.
      Electroencephalography (EEG) could provide a non-invasive and relatively cheap tool for
      identification of such biomarkers. In this study we will use high-density
      electroencephalograph (EEG) recording, in order to develop a platform of biomarkers that
      could be more sensitive and reliable to disease progression and response to therapeutic
      intervention than standard clinical measures.
