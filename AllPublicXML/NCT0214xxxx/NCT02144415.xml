  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-center study will be a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
      active-controlled crossover study with a single inpatient treatment visit. The abuse
      potential of single oral doses of EB-1020 IR (400 mg, 800 mg) will be compared with that of
      placebo and d-amphetamine (20 mg, 40 mg; active control) in healthy recreational stimulant
      users. Subjects will participate in a medical Screening visit (Visit 1), one 4-day inpatient
      Qualification Phase (Visit 2), one 11-day inpatient Treatment Phase (Visit 3), and a safety
      Follow-up visit (Visit 4).

      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 10 treatment sequences according to a two 5 x 5 William
      squares design. To maintain blinding, subjects will be required to ingest eight capsules with
      approximately 240 mL water on each study drug administration day.

      Serial pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations will be conducted up to 24 hours after each study
      drug administration. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be obtained to confirm exposure to
      EB-1020. Safety monitoring will include recording of adverse events (AEs), regular
      assessments of vital signs measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and
      continuous telemetry monitoring for at least 3 hours after study drug administration.

    <measure>Maximum effect (Emax) on Drug Liking visual analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Drug liking VAS is one of the measures of balance of effects that assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot; (score of 50 mm), on the left with &quot;strong disliking&quot; (score of 0 mm) and on the right with &quot;strong liking&quot; (score of 100 mm).</description>

    <description>Drug liking VAS is one of the measures of balance of effects that assesses the degree that a participant likes a drug effect at the time the question is being asked (that is, at the moment). It is scored using a 100 millimeter (mm) bipolar visual analogue scale (VAS) anchored in the center with a neutral anchor of &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot; (score of 50 mm), on the left with &quot;strong disliking&quot; (score of 0 mm) and on the right with &quot;strong liking&quot; (score of 100 mm).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Drug Liking VAS (Emax/Emin)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Overall drug liking VAS is one of the measures of balance of effects that assesses the participant's global perception of drug liking (that is, effects over the whole course of the drug experience including any carryover effects). A 100 mm bipolar VAS is used to assess response based on a score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (0 mm = &quot;strong disliking&quot;, 50 mm= &quot;neither like nor dislike&quot;, and 100 mm= &quot;strong liking&quot;).</description>

    <description>Take drug again VAS is one of the measures of balance of effects. It is a subjective assessment of the degree to which a participant would desire to take the drug again if given the opportunity. It is presented on a 100 mm bipolar VAS with score ranging from 0 mm to 100 mm (score of 0 mm = &quot;definitely not&quot;, 50 mm = &quot;do not care&quot;, and 100 mm = &quot;definitely so&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>High VAS (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>High VAS is one of the measures of positive effects that assesses the effect experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0 mm= definitely not) to 'extremely' (score of 100 = definitely so).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Good Effects VAS (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Good drug effects VAS is one of the measures of positive effects that assesses the effect experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0 mm= definitely not) to 'extremely' (score of 100 mm= definitely so).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bad Effects VAS (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Bad effects VAS is one of the measures of negative effects that assesses the effect experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0 mm= definitely not) to 'extremely' (score of 100 mm= definitely so).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nausea VAS (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Nausea VAS assesses the effect experienced by the participant on a 100 mm unipolar VAS, where responses are unidirectional and range from a response of 'none' (score of 0 mm) to 'extremely' (score of 100 mm).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ARCI-A scale (Emax and TA_AUE)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>ARCI-A is measure of other stimulant effects. It is a set of 13 questions in which each question contributes to total score. Participants select 'False' / 'True' for response. One point given for each response that agrees with scoring direction, true items receive score of 1 if answer 'True', false items receive score of 1 if answer 'False'. No points if answer is opposite to scoring direction. Score range: 0 to 13, higher score indicated higher other subjective effects.</description>
