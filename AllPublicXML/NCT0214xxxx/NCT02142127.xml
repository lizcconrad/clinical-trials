    <textblock>
      Human mass-balance studies with radiolabelled study drug are needed to evaluate the amount of
      drug that is recovered over time via different elimination routes of the body, i.e., whole
      blood, blood cells, plasma, urine, feces, and expired air. The ideal case is to be able to
      demonstrate a (near) complete recovery (≥95 %) of the administered dose.

      A good understanding of the metabolic pathway of the study drug is equally important.
      Mass-balance data, together with metabolic profiles in excreta, are used to characterize the
      biotransformation pathways of a drug and to help evaluate its drug-drug interaction
      potential.

      To this purpose, in this study, blood, urine, and feces are collected to investigate the
      metabolic profile of GFT505, and plasma and urine are collected to investigate the
      non-radioactive pharmacokinetics of GFT505 and its principle metabolite GFT1007. Other
      metabolites will be investigated in plasma and urine according to the radioactivity results.
      Non-radioactive pharmacokinetics of GFT505 and metabolites in feces will be investigated
      according to the radioactivity results.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label, single oral dose and single center study of 14C-labelled GFT505
      and its metabolites in healthy subjects.

      After an overnight fast, subjects will be administered one dose of 14C-labelled GFT505
      containing an equivalent of 120 mg of the compound with 240 mL of non-carbonated water. The
      total amount of administered radiocarbon will be 1.63-1.81 megaBecquerel (MBq) (44.1-48.8
      μCi).

      Blood, urine, and feces will be collected at scheduled time intervals from before
      administration of the radiolabelled study drug throughout confinement at the clinical center
      and thereafter, if needed. Several samples of expired carbon dioxide will be obtained up to
      48 h after the administration of radiolabelled study drug.

      Radiocarbon will be assayed in all available samples (whole blood, plasma, urine, feces, and
      expired air) by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The metabolic profile of GFT505 will be
      assayed in plasma, urine, and feces. Non-radioactive pharmacokinetics of GFT505 and its
      principle metabolite GFT1007 will be assayed in plasma and urine. Other metabolites will be
      investigated in plasma and urine according to the radioactivity results. Non-radioactive
      pharmacokinetics of GFT505 and metabolites in feces will be investigated according to the
      radioactivity results.
