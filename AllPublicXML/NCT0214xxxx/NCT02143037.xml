  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contingency management (CM) is highly efficacious for reducing substance use, and recent data
      suggest that reinforcing attendance at treatment can significantly improve treatment
      outcomes. Importantly, CM interventions that reinforce attendance are more likely to be
      adopted clinically than those that reinforce abstinence. Having objective indicators of
      drinking outcomes, nevertheless, is critical for quantifying the benefits of attendance-based
      CM treatment in alcohol abusing populations. New technology is now available to gauge alcohol
      use in patients' natural environments. The Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitor (SCRAMx®)
      continuously monitors alcohol consumption 24 hours a day. As such, it may be ideal for
      objective evaluation of alcohol consumption during treatment intervention studies, including
      those that involve CM.

      In this study, 114 patients participating in community based outpatient treatment programs
      for alcohol use disorders will wear SCRAMx for a 12-week period. They will be randomized to
      standard care or standard care plus CM, with reinforcement contingent upon attendance at
      treatment. The investigators will assess treatment attendance and alcohol use via SCRAMx and
      self reports. The investigators expect that patients randomized to the CM intervention will
      remain in treatment longer and show reductions in both SCRAMx assessed and self reported
      drinking days relative to those randomized to standard care.
