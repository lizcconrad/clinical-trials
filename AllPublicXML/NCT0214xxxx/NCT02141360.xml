      This hypothesis-generating feasibility study compares mTBI Patients and Controls using
      advanced MRI Applications.

      This hypothesis-generating feasibility study is being conducted to determine potential
      associations between a broad range of clinical neurological symptoms and MR images, data, and
      clinical findings involved in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). These associations will be
      examined over the acute and sub-acute period (approximately 3 months) following injury to
      provide information useful for optimization of MR pulse sequences for mTBI applications.

      The intent of this study is to broadly generate a range of potential mTBI biomarkers
      detectable using investigational MR pulse sequence technologies. Feasibility data attained in
      this study may be used for engineering program decision-making and in support of future
      scientific assessment, engineering development, published research databases or registries
      mTBI data and images, and other purposes determined by the Sponsor. The results of this study
      are not intended for use in regulatory submissions.

      Subjects will be examined on commercially available MR scanners using investigational or
      standard of care MR coils and a series of investigational Application Packs containing a
      predetermined set of MR pulse sequences optimized by GEHC.
