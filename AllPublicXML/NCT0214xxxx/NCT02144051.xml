      This is a first time in man (FTIM), Phase I study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose,
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose, safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of AZD5312. This is a
      multicentre study with sites in the United States and United Kingdom. Approximately 90
      patients are expected to be enrolled in this study.

      The study involves two parts, Part A, Dose Escalation and Part B, Dose Expansion.

      This is a first time in man (FTIM), Phase I study to determine the Maxiimum Tolerated Dose,
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose, safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of AZD5312. This is a
      multicentre study with sites in the United States and United Kingdom. Approximately 90
      patients are expected to be enrolled in this study.The study involves two parts, Part A, Dose
      Escalation and Part B, Dose Expansion.

      AZD5312 will be given intravenously (IV) as an infusion, over one hour. For the purpose of
      planning, each 4 week period (28 days) will be called a Cycle. AZD5312 will initially be
      administered 4 times within the first 11 days, (on Days [1, 4, 8 and 11]± 2), with no dosing
      on sequential days. Patients will receive weekly treatments on Days 15 and 22 to complete
      Cycle.

      1. During the subsequent cycles, patients will receive weekly treatment on Days 1, 8, 15 and
      22 (±2). The AZD5312 dose will not change unless dose reductions are required due to
      treatment-related toxicity. Patients will continue to receive AZD5312 until disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met. Toxicity,
      Pharmacokinetics and biomarker data will be assessed throughout the study. Alternative
      infusion durations and/or treatment schedules may be explored if preliminary data suggest
      these would be more appropriate.

(Assess absolute reduction in CTC counts). •Metastatic bone disease status of mCRPC patients (PCWG2 criteria, (Scher et al, 2008). •Malignant soft tissue response rate will be assessed byResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) for all patients with measurable disease whenever possible.</description>

          -  Patient must understand nature of trial and provide a signed and dated, written
             informed consent form prior to study specific procedures, sampling and analyses. If a

             component of study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the patient and
             he/she will not be excluded from other aspects of the study.

             a solid tumour of either locally advanced or metastatic castrate resistant prostate
             cancer (mCRPC), breast, bladder, ovarian, gastric or salivary duct carcinoma where an
             Androgen Receptor pathway may be a potential factor.

          -  Part B Dose Expansion.

               -  Patient must understand nature of trial and provide a signed and dated, written
                  informed consent form prior to any study specific procedures, sampling and
                  analyses.

               -  Part A Dose Escalation Patients must have histological or cytological
                  confirmation of a solid tumour of either locally advanced or metastatic castrate
                  resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), breast, bladder, ovarian, gastric or salivary
                  duct carcinoma where an Androgen Receptor pathway may be a potential factor.

                  subsequently increasing Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values obtained at least
                  one week apart. Arm 3 will include non-mCRPC patients. The patient populations in
                  the dose expansion phase will be as follows:

          -  Arm 1 Prostate cancer patients with prior second generation anti-hormonal therapy
