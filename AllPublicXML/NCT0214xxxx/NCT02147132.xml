  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking prevalence is over 83% in methadone-maintained patients. These patients experience
      significant difficulty quitting, and there is evidence that a majority of
      methadone-maintained patients smoke most of their cigarettes in the 4 hours following
      methadone dosing. The objective is to provide a preliminary test of the ability of two
      pharmacological treatments, the nicotine nasal spray and varenicline, relative to placebos,
      to reduce smoking during the 4 hours following methadone dosing.

    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be given a special electronic cigarette lighter called Quitbit.The electronic lighter will record a timestamp for each time the lighter is used to light a cigarette. Data will be collected from the lighter at each study visit. This will measure how many cigarettes are smoked and when.</description>

    <measure>Cigarettes per day</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quitbit lighter will measure how many cigarettes are smoked per day. In addition to the Quitbit lighter measurement, the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) form will be filled out for each subject to measure use, as well.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Carbon monoxide level</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Carbon monoxide (CO) in each participant's breath will be tested. A CO level less than or equal to 8 parts-per-million will be used to verify reports of no smoking.</description>
