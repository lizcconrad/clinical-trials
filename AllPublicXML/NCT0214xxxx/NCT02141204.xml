  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare immunogenicity, reactogenicity and
      safety of two formulations (liquid vs. lyophilised) of GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine when
      administered as two doses in healthy infants aged ≥ 6 weeks.

      This protocol summary has been amended based on NDAC- Vaccines (New Drug Advisory Committee
      on Vaccines) of Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI)'s recommendation to conduct this
      study as a Phase IV study instead of phase III, because the Rotarix liquid file application
      is considered as a line extension of Rotarix Lyophilized formulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/Legally Acceptable
             Representative(s) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  A male or female between, and including, 6 and 10 weeks of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/ Legally Acceptable
             Representative(s) of the subject.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Birth weight &gt;2000 g.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs since
             birth. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within 30 days of the first dose of study vaccine with the exception for the routine
             childhood vaccinations.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational product.

          -  History of confirmed RV GE.

          -  Previous vaccination against RV.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, (including

          -  Uncorrected congenital malformation (such as Meckel's diverticulum) of the
             gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for Intussusception or history of
             Intussusception.

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F on oral, axillary or tympanic
                  setting, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal setting. The preferred route for
                  recording temperature in this study will be axillary.

               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
                  infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator
                  (warrants deferral of the vaccination).

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or medical history.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned
