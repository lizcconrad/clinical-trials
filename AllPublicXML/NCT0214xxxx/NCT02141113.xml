  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is considered an investigator-initiated clinical research trial, which means that your
      study doctor is researching a particular medication (in this case a medication that is
      currently FDA- approved) for the treatment of AD/HD in individuals ages 6-17. The medication
      is guanfacine hydrochloride.

      The hypothesis is that this medication could be used in adults with Attention
      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder who have not received satisfactory results with their current
      stimulant ADHD medication. The study drug is investigational for use in adults.
      Investigational means it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for use in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether guanfacine hydrochloride used as an adjunct
      therapy (to subjects' current stimulant medication) would bring about a statistically
      significant improvement in AD/HD symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and efficacy of GH as adjunctive medication to psychostimulants in adult ADHD</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be evaluated using three primary measures; 1: ADHD rating scale with adult prompts (ADHD-RS), 2:Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I, and 3: Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess safety and tolerability of GH.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, during treatment, end of study (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Aside from exploring general safety and tolerability of GH, the study will also investigate the safety and tolerability of 5mg and 6mg doses of GH and the safety and tolerability of down titration of GH at the end of the study. Safety of GH will be assessed throughout the course of the study through the collection of a series of vitals, including: blood pressure, weight, pulse rate, and physical examination.
Medication tolerability will be assessed by surveying levels of fatigue (Fatigue Symptoms Inventory), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)), mood (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)), and sexual functioning (Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX)) throughout the course of the study.</description>
