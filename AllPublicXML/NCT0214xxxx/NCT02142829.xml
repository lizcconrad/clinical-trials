  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of two local pain control methods in
      bariatric patients by assessing the amount of postoperative pain and amount of postoperative
      pain medications needed. This information was used to determine which local anesthetic
      provided the best pain control.

      The investigators have previously utilized the On-QÂ® pain ball to obtain local control by
      continuous delivery of bupivacaine to pain fibers at the incision site. On-Q makes use of an
      implanted catheter and a continuous infusion pump that the patient carries with them
      typically for 48-72 hours after surgery. EXPAREL is a long-acting liposomal delivery vehicle
      that extends the life of bupivacaine in the surgical site for up to 72 hours. It can be
      injected in all trocar sites and offers another potential solution to patient pain control
      without the need for a catheter and the hardware needed to deliver the local anesthetic.
      Patient NRS (numerical rating scale) scores for postoperative pain and total medication
      consumed were used to assess the differences between the two treatment groups.
