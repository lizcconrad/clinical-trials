  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness characterized by persistent widespread muscle pain with
      generalized hyperalgesia and allodynia. It can be accompanied by other concomitant symptoms
      like fatigue, sleep disturbances, musculoskeletal disorders, distress and psychological
      disorders. This condition is very prevalent. It has been reported to be about 2-5% of the
      general global population. Fibromyalgia is associated with balance problems and increased
      fall frequency. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an 8 weeks
      dance-movement therapy programme on balance, strength, flexibility and quality of life in
      patients with fibromyalgia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition associated with balance problems and pain. It has been
      previously described that fibromyalgia may affect peripheral and/or central mechanisms of
      postural control. Balance or postural stability is a very complex task that involves the
      integration of multiple sensory inputs to execute appropriate neuromuscular activity needed
      to maintain balance.

      Patients with fibromyalgia have also muscle weakness. Muscle strength depends on both the
      cross-sectional area of the muscle and the neural activity. Range of movement and quality of
      life have also been reported to be affected.

    <description>Balance is going to be assessed with the Mini BalanceEvaluation System Test. This test assesses dynamic balance, with four subscales:anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation and dynamic gait.
The Mini BESTest is a 14 item test scored on a 3 level ordinal scale. For the Mini BESTest, the original BESTest 4 level (0 - 3) scoring was revised to 3 levels (0 - 2) due to redundancy. Total score = 28 points per test directions. Two items have right and left assessment in which the lower score is used within the total score (directions specify which to use). For research, many studies specify use of both left and right data, thus calculating data based on 32 (vs 28) points</description>
