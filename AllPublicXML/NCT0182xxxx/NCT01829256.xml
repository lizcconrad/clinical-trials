  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is associated with high rates of cardiovascular events and
      death. In addition, DKD is the major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United
      States. The purpose of this study is to prevent progression of kidney disease among patients
      with DKD and uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) using a tailored, telehealth intervention that
      simultaneously address medication management and modifies multiple risk factors through a
      combination of patient self-monitoring, behavioral therapies and education to optimize
      adherence and self-efficacy. Additional goals are to improve control of cardiovascular
      disease risk factors and reduce cardiovascular events and death.

      We hypothesize that patients with DKD and uncontrolled HTN who receive this intervention will
      have less progression, or a smaller decrease in kidney function, after 3 years when compared
      to the education control group.

      A randomized, controlled trial to slow DKD progression:

        1. Using an innovative telehealth approach that is potentially scalable with demonstrable
           efficacy in reducing antecedents of kidney disease, including poor blood pressure,
           glucose, and lipid control

        2. Enrolling demographically diverse patients from local primary care clinics to allow
           applicability of our results to the general US population within existing delivery
           systems; and

        3. Targeting patients with moderate DKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 45-90
           ml/min/1.73m2 with evidence of diabetic nephropathy) and uncontrolled HTN (blood
           pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg), accounting for about 20% of all patients with diabetes who
           disproportionately suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular events,
           and death.
