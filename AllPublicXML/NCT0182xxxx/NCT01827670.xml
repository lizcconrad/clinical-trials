  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies have demonstrated long term relief from dentine hypersensitivity with twice
      daily brushing of a toothpaste containing stannous fluoride in comparison to marketed
      (negative) controls. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a stannous
      fluoride dentifrice in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity compared to a marketed
      (negative) control, over a period of 56 days (8 weeks) with twice daily brushing.

    <description>The examiner conducted the evaporative air sensitivity assessment and scored the subject's response to the sensitivity stimulus using the four-point categorical Schiff Sensitivity Scale (SSS).
Score 0 = Subject does not respond to air stimulus Score 1 = Subject responds to air stimulus, but does not request discontinuation of stimulus Score 2 = Subject responds to air stimulus, and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus Score 3 = Subject responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Tactile Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline-Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the tactile sensitivity of eligible teeth using a Yeaple probe. The constant pressure applied by Yeaple probe probe allowed the examiner to vary the force applied to the dentin surface from 10g to an upper threshold of 80g, in increments of 10g. The greater the pressure the participant was able to tolerate, the less sensitive the tooth was considered. Testing began at 10g and increased by 10g, with each successive challenge, until either a &quot;yes&quot; response (pain was elicited) was recorded or the maximum force has been reached.</description>

        <description>The examiner assessed the tactile sensitivity of eligible teeth using a Yeaple probe. The constant pressure applied by Yeaple probe probe allowed the examiner to vary the force applied to the dentin surface from 10g to an upper threshold of 80g, in increments of 10g. The greater the pressure the participant was able to tolerate, the less sensitive the tooth was considered. Testing began at 10g and increased by 10g, with each successive challenge, until either a &quot;yes&quot; response (pain was elicited) was recorded or the maximum force has been reached.</description>
