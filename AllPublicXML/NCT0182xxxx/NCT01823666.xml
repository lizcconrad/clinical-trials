  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is believed to be the early stage of dementia. The
      investigators assume that some psychological and imaging risks may predict the conversion. In
      the current longitudinal study, psychological and imaging data of people with MCI will be
      obtained at baseline, and will be followed at 26 weeks and 52 weeks. The predictors will be
      found in comparison with controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MCI increases the risk of later developing dementia. About 10-15% of the amnestic form of
      mild cognitive impairment will progress to Alzheimer's disease in one year. But some people
      with MCI never get worse. Others with MCI later have test results that return to normal for
      their age and education.

      To develop a new drug for the prevention of dementia(dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or
      vascular dementia), investigators need a sensitive and specific tool for recognizing patients
      who will converse to dementia. The investigators want to establish an operational diagnostic
      criteria instead of a descriptive criteria for mild cognitive impairment.
