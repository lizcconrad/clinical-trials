  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal advantages of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with
      blood-oxygenation- level-dependent (BOLD) contrast for studying brain function are:
      non-invasiveness, ubiquitous availability, relatively high spatiotemporal resolution, and the
      ability to map function over the entire brain. Thus, BOLD fMRI is the most widely applied
      technology to study healthy brain function and pathophysiology associated with disease. In
      studies of drug abuse and psychiatric illness though, normal assumptions mapping BOLD signals
      to neurometabolism may be violated. Generally, these effects are ignored, resulting in large
      study-to-study variability.

      Quantitative fMRI (qfMRI) measures metabolism directly and is more suitable for studies of
      drug abuse and psychiatric illness. However, qfMRI is too complex for routine use. Cerebral
      metabolism during brain activation during visual stimulation measured with a new fMRI
      approach that is simple enough for clinical applications will be compared to CMRO2 activation
      measured using standard qfMRI.

      Healthy subjects will undergo a single imaging session. During the imaging session, fMRI and
      simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy measurements will be made during visual stimulation
      (e.g., viewing a flashing checkerboard). This is a methods development study focused on
      comparing a new method for estimating CMRO2 associated with brain activation with the
      standard fMRI approach for estimating CMRO2.
