  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study, we plan to review the performance of colonoscopy in colon cancer screening
      and surveillance, especially with the recent improvements in endoscopic technology (high
      definition endoscopes), use of split dose preparation which provides excellent colon
      preparation for detection of lesions and increasing awareness and detection of flat lesions
      of the colon. The findings will help us define the role of colonoscopy screening of colon
      polyps and flat lesions and identity areas for improvement. The data will be used for
      continuing quality improvement and presenting our outcomes at academic meetings and
      publishing our results in peer reviewed journals.

      Investigator's goal is to collect data from the endoscopy reports and clinic station reports
      to complete a descriptive analysis of the demographics, colonoscopy procedure performance,
      and assess the type of benign colon polyps detected during screening and surveillance from
      02/01/2000 - 12/31/2020.

      Specific variable to be reviewed:

        1. Patient Demographics: Age, Sex, Race, Height, Weight, BMI (patient privacy will be
           acknowledged).

        2. Indications for Colonoscopy (screening, surveillance, symptoms or tertiary referral
           [EMR])

        3. Comorbid conditions: , cancer and surgical history, medical conditions,

        4. Colonoscopy procedure; quality of colon preparation (using the Boston Bowel Preparation
           Scale) 0 - 3 for each section of the colon (Ascending, Transverse, Descending and Total
           Colon) , cecal intubation rate, cecal intubation and total procedure time, type of
           colonoscope (if CO2 was used in the procedure and techniques for colonoscope insertion,
           including position changes.

        5. Examination findings: number of polyps and nature of polyps removed (site, size,
           surface, vascular pattern); type of polyp removed (serrated and sessile (flat) ; optical
           features and histology of polyps.

        6. Resection techniques: biopsy, snare resection, endoscopic mucosal resection etc.

        7. Including Pathology report findings so that a comparison can be made of the optical
           features and actual pathology report.

        8. Outcomes of colonoscopy: adenoma detections (tubular and villous), cancer and quality
           metrics.

        9. Outcome of colonoscopy: Complications (Bleeding and performance).
