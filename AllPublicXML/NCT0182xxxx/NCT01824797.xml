      The purpose and objective of this study is to determine the changes in bone metabolism after
      bariatric surgery in postmenopausal women.

      This is a prospective cohort study that will enroll up to 40 postmenopausal female subjects
      with class II and III obesity from the Duke Center for Metabolic and Weight Loss Surgery. The
      study team will enroll subjects that are already being scheduled for either sleeve
      gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The osteoclast activity, the osteoblast activity,
      and the bone mineral density will be measured in all subjects preoperatively and 12 months
      postoperatively through research specific blood tests and Dual energy x-ray Absorptiometry
      (DEXA) scans.

      The primary endpoints are change in osteoclast activity as measured by C-terminal telopeptide
      of type I collagen and change in bone density as measured by DEXA scan. These are continuous
      variable and given the small sample size the investigators will use a nonparametric Wilcoxon
      rank-sum test to compare the difference in one year change in these variables. There is a
      slight risk of loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to protect all PHI. There
      is also the risk of increased exposure to radiation from the DEXA scans performed twice with
      each subjects participating in the study.
