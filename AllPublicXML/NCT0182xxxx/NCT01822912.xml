  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) patients discharged to Skilled Nursing Facilities have higher
      rehospitalization rates and mortality than patients discharged to home.

      HF disease management programs have been shown to reduce rehospitalizations in community
      settings, no national guidelines have been set forth for Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF).

      This study will investigate the the effect of a heart failure-disease management program on
      the outcome of all-cause hospital readmissions, emergency room admissions and mortality for
      30 days post-SNF admission using 7 component heart failure disease management program.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in health status and self-care 60 days post SNF admission</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days post SNF admission</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the difference in health status and self-care for patients with HF cared for by a SNF heart failure-disease management program vs usual care 60 days post SNF admission. Health Status will be measured by the KCCQ (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) which is a 23 item questionnaire specific for patients with HF. It includes aspects of physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and stability), social function, self-efficacy, knowledge, and quality of life. HF Self Management will be measured using the SCHFI (Self-Care HF Index) which consists of 15 item scale with 3 domains of self care including self care maintenance (behaviors to maintain clinical stability), self-care management (decision making process with regard to symptom changes), and confidence to manage symptoms.</description>
