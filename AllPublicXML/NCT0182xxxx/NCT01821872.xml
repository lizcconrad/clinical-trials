  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite its use for decades all over the world, the exact mechanism of action of paracetamol
      is not fully understood and essentially involves a combination of hypotheses. It is known to
      have an effect via the central nervous system, and of the many mechanisms proposed, one
      hypothesis is that it may have indirectly activate CB1 (cannabinoid) receptors, through its
      novel metabolite AM404.

      This study aims to elucidate cerebrospinal levels of paracetamol and to measure the
      concentration of its metabolites, including AM404 in CSF. This may, in turn, give us useful
      information on the mechanism of action of paracetamol.

      Patients undergoing spinal blockade for urological surgery were administered 1g paracetamol
      intravenously at varying intervals prior to spinal anaesthesia, at which time 5mls of
      cerebrospinal fluid and 10mls of blood were sampled, and analysed for concentrations of
      paracetamol, paracetamol glucuronide, paracetamol sulphate, and AM404, a known
      endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor, and metabolite of paracetamol.

      Paracetamol readily penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid in animal studies and in
      children. This could account for the rapid central analgesic and antipyretic action of
      intravenous paracetamol however this remains to be studied in adults. AM404 has never before
      been identified in humans, and its presence in CSF following paracetamol supports the
      hypothesis of a central mechanism of action of paracetamol via AM404.
