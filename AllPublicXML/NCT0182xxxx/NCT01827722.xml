    <textblock>
      CRVO occurs when the vessels in the back of the eye become blocked. This creates a dangerous
      condition because the vessels are weak and prone to leakage. This results in the development
      of macular edema.

      Previous studies have shown that inflammatory mediators and growth factors, such as vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are elevated in patients with macular edema associated with
      CRVO.

      Ozurdex® is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is available by
      prescription for macular edema following CRVO and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). It is
      also indicated for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of
      the eye. The approved dosage is 0.7 mg.

      Ranibizumab (Lucentis®) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is
      available by prescription for other eye disorders, such as wet age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD), macular edema following CRVO or BRVO, and diabetic macular edema (DME).
      The approved dosage for wet AMD and macular edema following CRVO/BROV is 0.5 mg given
      monthly. The approved dosage for DME is 0.3 mg given monthly.

      Dr. Gonzalez is conducting an investigational study on the safety and effectiveness of
      treating CRVO-associated Macular Edema with a combination of 0.7 mg of Ozurdex® and 0.5 mg
      Lucentis®, given as separate injections into the eye.

      This is a 52 week, single masked, 1:1:1, randomized, phase IV, multicenter injection
      controlled clinical study with a 24 week treatment phase followed by a 24 week follow up
      phase. Subjects will be randomly assigned to Ozurdex every 16 weeks, Ranibizumab monthly, or
      combination Ozurdex every 16 weeks with Ranibizumab. Patients assigned to IV Ozurdex arm will
      receive a total of 2 intravitreal Ozurdex injections (in combination with monthly Ranibizumab
      sham) administered at 16 week intervals beginning on Day 1 and ending at Week 16. Patients
      assigned to IV Ranibizumab arm will receive injections administered at monthly intervals (in
      combination with Ozurdex sham beginning on Day 1 and Week 16). Patients assigned to IV
      Ozurdex with IV Ranibizumab will receive a total of 2 intravitreal Ozurdex injections
      administered at Week 16 intervals beginning on Day 1 and ending at Week 16 with an initial IV
      Ranibizumab injection administered on Day 1, then treated with Ranibizumab according to
      reinjection parameters assessed monthly through Week 20 (in combination with Ranibizumab sham
      if Ranibizumab reinjection parameters are not met). Treatment at end of study treatment phase
      Week 24 will be standard of care for all arms at the Investigator's discretion.
