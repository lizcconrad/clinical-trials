    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study were (a) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and to evaluate and
      compare the pharmacodynamics of ilaprazole and esomeprazole following a single dose (Day 1)
      and once daily (QD) administration for 5 consecutive days each of 10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg
      ilaprazole tablets and 40-mg esomeprazole tablets; (b) to evaluate the safety of 10-mg,
      20-mg, and 40-mg ilaprazole tablets following QD oral administration for 5 consecutive days;
      and (c) to characterize the plasma gastrin concentration profile on Day 1 and Day 5 following
      QD oral administration of 10-mg, 20-mg, and 40-mg ilaprazole and 40-mg esomeprazole tablets
      for 5 consecutive days.

    <time_frame>for 24 hours dosing of Ilaprazole</time_frame>
    <description>For each regimen and day, mean pH and percentage of time pH exceeded 3, 4, 5, and 6 were tabulated and descriptive statistics were provided for 24-hour postdose intervals and each of the following intervals of time relative to dosing: 0 to 4 hours, &gt;4 to 9 hours, &gt;9 to 12 hours, &gt;12 to 16 hours, and &gt;16 to 24 hours.</description>

    <measure>ilaprazole and esomeprazole plasma concentration data and pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were tabulated and descriptive statistics computed</measure>
    <time_frame>for 24 hours dosing of Ilaprazole</time_frame>
    <description>The assessments of dose proportionality for ilaprazole regimens were performed via 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of the central values obtained within the framework of the ANOVA on natural logarithms of dose-normalized Cmax, AUCt, and AUC</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior to any study-specific procedures being performed, the subject voluntarily signed
             the approved informed consent/PIPEDA authorization form after having it fully
             explained and all questions answered.

          -  The subject was between 18 and 55 years, inclusive, and was generally in good health.

          -  Pregnancy test results for all females were negative in order to enter and remain in
             the study. A serum pregnancy test was performed on all females at Screening, Day -1 of
             each period, and Day 6 of Period 4 only, or if a subject prematurely discontinued.
             Results must have been negative in order for study drug to be administered.

          -  Female subject was using, and agreed to continue the use of, a double-barrier method
             of birth control. Oral, patch, implants, or injectable contraceptives were accepted as
             1 method if the subject had been taking them for greater than 2 months at the
             Screening Visit. Subjects who had a bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or
             bilateral oophorectomy for a minimum of 6 months, or surgical sterilization of partner
             (vasectomy for 6 months minimum), or were postmenopausal (defined as the absence of
             menses for 2 years or the absence of menses for 12 months and follicle-stimulating
             hormone [FSH] level of &gt;40 IU/L) did not require the use of birth control.

          -  Subject had a negative breath test result for H pylori prior to enrollment.

          -  At the Screening Visit, subject had a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 to
             30 kg/m2, as determined by the following calculation.

          -  Subject was in general good health as evidenced by a medical history, a complete
             physical examination, and ECG without clinically significant abnormalities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject had current evidence of cardiovascular, central nervous system, hepatic,
             hematopoietic, renal, or metabolic dysfunction; serious allergy, asthma, history of
             significant sensitivity to any drug; or lactose intolerance that would contraindicate
             taking ilaprazole or esomeprazole or would interfere with the conduct of the study.
