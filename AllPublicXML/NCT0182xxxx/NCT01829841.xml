  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1
           and Flt3. Phase I study has shown that the toxicity is manageable.

        -  The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety profile between
           Famitinib and Sunitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
