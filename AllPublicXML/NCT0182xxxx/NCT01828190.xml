      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on
      patient suffering from residual Crohn's disease related perianal fistulas already treated
      with TNF alpha blockers

      This study is a prospective open-label study that consists three periods: screening,
      treatment and follow-up. After signing an informed consent, subjects will be assessed by a
      gastroenterologist, a surgeon (for the diagnosing the perianal disease and assessing the need
      for surgery) and a HBOT specialist for assessing the capability of the subject to undergo
      HBOT treatment.After the screening period, eligible subjects will enter an 8 weeks HBOT
      treatment period, combined with TNFalpha blocker treatment. This period will be followed by a
      4 months follow-up period in which treatment with TNFalpha blocker will continue.

      All patients will have an MRI and TRUS examinations to assess the fistulas and also blood
      tests for CBC, chemistry, inflammatory markers and cytokine analysis. Same evaluation will be
      repeated at the end of the study.
