  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recognition of out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) during an emergency call is based on
      standardized questions concerning the symptoms of OHCA. With this method cardiac arrest is
      recognized in 50-83% of cases. When the emergency medical dispatcher identifies cardiac
      arrest during the emergency call the survival of the patient improves. Accurate emergency
      medical service response is activated promptly and bystander will receive cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) instructions. It has been estimated that proper implementation of CPR
      instructions will save thousands of lives each year.

      If the ECG could be recorded by the mobile phone, transmitted during the emergency call to
      the dispatch centre and analysed there with the software of a semi-automated external
      defibrillator(AED), the recognition of cardiac arrest could be more accurate.

      The aim of this study is to examine, if AED, with minimal size electrodes within an area of a
      mobile phone, is able to recognize reliably ventricular fibrillation (VF), the rhythm with
      the best prognosis in OHCA.

      Dysrhythmia patients who need an implantable cardioverter defibrillator(ICD) or patients with
      an already implanted ICD which function needs to be revised will be recruited into this
      study. Our hypothesis is that the ECG and VF is recordable in 100% of cases with a
      semi-automatic defibrillator. In sample size calculations we compared this 100% recognition
      to the present situation with 80% recognition of cardiac arrest in emergency medical
      communication centre during emergency call. According to the power calculation of 1-sided
      binomial test with risk level 0.05 and power of 95 %, 22 observations is needed to detect
      difference between expected full successes (99 %) from the previous 80 % of successes in
      recognition.

    <description>The recorded rhythms will be analysed, beside an AED, by two experienced cardiologists and categorised as shockable or non-shockable. The cardiologists also will assess the quality of the recordings and grade each recording according to three categories of quality: 1, bad; 2, average; 3, good.</description>
