  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the donor nerve attached with the flap, the dorsal branch of the digital nerve and the
      dorsal digital nerve is commonly used for finger pulp reconstruction.This study compares two
      donor nerves: the dorsal branch of the digital nerve and the dorsal digital nerve.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators compares two donor nerves attached with the flap for sensory reconstruction
      of finger pulp: the dorsal branch of the digital nerve and the dorsal digital nerve. The main
      outcomes were static 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of the
      flap, and pain and cold intorlence of the reconstructed finger.

    <measure>static 2-point discrimination (2PD) test</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test points are at the center of the radial or ulnar portion of the pulp. Each area is tested 3 times with a Discriminator. We stop at 4mm as a limit of 2PD and consider this normal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cold intolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cold intolerance in the reconstructed finger is assessed using the self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire [10]. The maximum score is 100 and was group into 4 ranges (0-25, 26-50, 51-75, and 76-100), corresponding to mild, moderate, severe, and extreme severity, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the visual analogue scale (VAS), patients are asked to report pain sensations of the reconstructed pulps and donor sites. The VAS consists of a 10 cm line that is grouped into mild (0-3 cm), moderate (4-6 cm) and severe (7-10 cm).</description>
