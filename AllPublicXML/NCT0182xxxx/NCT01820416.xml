  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low-level laser therapy can improve hearing
      thresholds in individuals with hearing loss. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a
      treatment, placebo, or control group. The treatment group will be given a three treatment of
      low-level laser therapy, which consists of shining low-level lasers beams onto the ear and
      head. The laser beams are cool to the touch, and do not cause discomfort. Each laser
      treatment will last approximately 4 minutes. Three treatments will be applied three times
      within the course of one week. Hearing tests will be administered immediately before
      treatment, immediately after treatment, and six weeks after treatment. Results will be
      analyzed to determine the effect of the laser treatment on hearing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-level laser therapy has been practiced for about 20 years in Europe and is beginning to
      be practiced in the US. Theoretically, laser energy in the red and near infrared light
      spectrum is capable of penetrating 2-5 cm into tissue and can stimulate mitochondria in the
      cells to produce more energy (through the production of adenosine triphosphate), which in
      turn may help prevent or repair tissue damage. The effects of low-level laser therapy on
      hearing have not been well studied. It has been suggested that laser therapy might help
      repair damage to the cochlea and restore some degree of hearing loss. Studies of low-level
      laser stimulation of cochleae utilizing microscopy, PET imaging, and MRI suggest potential
      therapeutic benefit to hearing. While preliminary studies suggest a possible improvement in
      hearing thresholds, a carefully controlled study is needed to verify the results using a
      valid battery of audiological tests.

    <description>Hearing status, as assessed by the Connected Sentence Test (CST). Difference scores (post-test - pretest) are reported. The CST approximates everyday conversation. Scoring is based on the number of correctly repeated key words. Higher numbers indicate better scores. The minimum score is 0 (0%) and the maximum is 100 (100%). When comparing test-retest scores for an individual, Cox et al. (1988) suggest that changes of 15% or more (based on 100 key words) are indicative of significant changes. We subtracted the post-test from the pre-test, so that negative difference scores indicate worse performance, and positive difference scores indicate better performance. Difference scores with an absolute value smaller than 15 are interpreted as no significant change. In addition, pre- and post-test performance was assessed for groups using t-tests on the difference scores.</description>

        <title>Change in Speech Perception</title>
        <description>Hearing status, as assessed by the Connected Sentence Test (CST). Difference scores (post-test - pretest) are reported. The CST approximates everyday conversation. Scoring is based on the number of correctly repeated key words. Higher numbers indicate better scores. The minimum score is 0 (0%) and the maximum is 100 (100%). When comparing test-retest scores for an individual, Cox et al. (1988) suggest that changes of 15% or more (based on 100 key words) are indicative of significant changes. We subtracted the post-test from the pre-test, so that negative difference scores indicate worse performance, and positive difference scores indicate better performance. Difference scores with an absolute value smaller than 15 are interpreted as no significant change. In addition, pre- and post-test performance was assessed for groups using t-tests on the difference scores.</description>

            <description>Low-level laser applied for approximately 4 minutes to the area around the pinna, the back of the neck, and the top of the head.
Low-level Laser Therapy: Portable unit containing two laser diodes producing 532 and 635 nm wavelengths. Both diodes produced energy levels of 7.5 mw (class IIIb). Beams from both diodes were dispersed through lenses to create parallel line-generated beams, rather than spots. The 532 nm light was constant, and the 635 nm light was pulsed, with frequencies of 15 and 33 Hz. The pulsing alternated between frequencies every 30 seconds.</description>
