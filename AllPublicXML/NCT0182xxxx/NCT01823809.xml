    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a combined use of
      non-invasive coronary angiography with multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and stress
      cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients with obstructive lesions on MSCT and
      with low to intermediate pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) as compared to
      invasive coronary angiography (CAG) and Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) measurements.
