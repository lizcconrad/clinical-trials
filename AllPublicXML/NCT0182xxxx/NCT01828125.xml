  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the unfortunate case of severe hypoglycaemia, glucagon is the first-line treatment because
      of its potent and rapid action starting as fast as 5 minutes after subcutaneous or
      intramuscular injection. Large dose of glucagon such as 1 mg subcutaneous is usually
      associated with undesirable side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, bloating and headache.

      The overall objective of this research proposal is to assess the efficacy of lower
      subcutaneous doses of glucagon (0.1 mg or 0.2 mg) to correct hypoglycaemia compared to the
      standard dose (1.0 mg) in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D).

      It is postulated that much lower dosages of glucagon (0.1 or 0.2 mg) injected subcutaneously
      will be just as effective as the current recommended dose of 1.0 mg to correct hypoglycaemia
      without the undesirable gastro-intestinal side effects.

      In the unfortunate case of severe hypoglycaemia, glucagon is the first-line treatment because
      of its potent and rapid action starting as fast as 5 minutes after subcutaneous or
      intramuscular injection. Current instructions for the treatment of severe hypoglycaemia call
      for the immediate injection of 1 mg of glucagon subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Large dose
      of glucagon such as 1 mg subcutaneous is usually associated with undesirable side-effects
      such as nausea, vomiting, bloating and headache. Moreover, glucagon emergency kits are
      relatively expensive (around $100 per kit), thus increasing the financial burden of diabetes
      on patients and the health care system.

      The primary objective of this research project is to the study the pharmacological effects of
      different doses of glucagon injected subcutaneously to correct hypoglycaemia during
      controlled conditions mimicking a hypoglycaemic event in adults with type 1 diabetes. More
      specifically, we will be looking at the effects of subcutaneous glucagon injected at 0.1 or
      0.2 mg and 1.0 mg to normalized plasma glucose during a hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp
      in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

    <description>A first catheter will be inserted for infusion of D-[6,6-2H2] glucose and insulin. A second catheter will be inserted for infusion of dextrose. Dextrose infusion will be enriched with D-[6,6-2H2] glucose. A third catheter will be inserted for sampling. D-[6,6-2H2] glucose will be administered as a priming dose followed by a constant infusion throughout the experiment. Insulin will be administered as a primed continuous infusion. The first two hours will serve as an equilibration period for the tracer while glucose infusion will be adjusted to achieve a plasma glucose concentration of 5 mmol/L. The third hour is considered the baseline period. Following this, dextrose infusion rate will be decreased over a period of 1 hour to attain hypoglycaemia with a target blood glucose level at 2.8 mmol/L. At the end of the fourth hour, a subcutaneous glucagon dose will be given and plasma samples will be drawn for the determination of labelled and unlabelled glucose, plasma insulin and glucagon.</description>
