      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of itraconazole sequential
      therapy (intravenous injection/oral solution) in participants with invasive pulmonary fungal
      infections ([IPFI]; lung diseases caused by fungal infection).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm,
      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of itraconazole sequential therapy in
      participants with IPFI. The study duration will be 4 to 6 weeks. The treatment will be
      divided into the intravenous (into a vein) injection period and the oral solution
      administration (giving) period. During the intravenous injection period 200 milligram (mg)
      twice daily loading dose (large initial dose) will be given for first 2 days, 200 mg once
      daily for the subsequent 12 days. Then sequential itraconazole oral solution 200 mg twice
      daily will be given as maintenance therapy (treatment designed to help the original primary
      treatment to succeed) for 2-4 weeks. Participant's clinical, mycological and comprehensive
      efficacy will be assessed at Week 6. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <description>Clinical efficacy was assessed as cured: the signs and symptoms of invasive fungal infections (IFI) completely disappeared or full or nearby resolution of radiographic manifestations; markedly improved: the signs and symptoms of IFI were improved or disappeared and at least 50 percent improvement of radiographic findings; improved: the signs and symptoms of IFI were moderately improved and less than 50 percent improvement of radiographic findings; failed: the clinical symptoms and signs of IFI were not changed or worsened.</description>
