    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of ultra low dose danazol (Optina) for the treatment of
      diabetic macular edema versus placebo. Optina has already been granted 505(b)2 status by the
      FDA and will incorporate all safety data from prior FDA approvals. Additional safety data
      will be collected specifically for this low dosage.

      This study will identify a population of subjects where Optina demonstrates a therapeutic
      effect.

      A portion of 505(b)2 drugs are approved based on a single clinical trial.

          2. Male or female 18 years or older with Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus [defined as a
             self-report of diabetes accompanied by treatment (insulin or diet) or a history of
             fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmo/l (126 mg/dl) or 2-hr plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmo/l
             (200 mg/dl)]

             women who have had menses within the past 12 months, who have not had tubal ligation
             or bilateral oophorectomy [Note: patients using contraceptive methods containing
             progesterone (including a progesterone IUD) for 90 days prior to randomization or
             planning to use progesterone contraceptive methods (including a progesterone IUD)
             during the study drug treatment period are not eligible for enrollment.] Should a

        Study Eye Inclusion Criteria (if both eyes meet criteria, both eyes will be study eyes)

          1. Change in VA within previous 12 months reasonably believed to be associated with DME
             in the opinion of the Investigator

          2. BCVA in accordance with ETDRS letter score of ≥24 (e.g., 20/320 or better) and ≤78
             (e.g., 20/32 or worse)

          3. Definite retinal thickening ≥275 microns on spectral-domain OCT due to DME involving
             the center of the macula on clinical exam in the opinion of the Investigator

             component of the danazol test drug (cornstarch, lactose, magnesium stearate, gelatin,
             and talc) (Note: Lactose intolerance is not a contraindication to ingesting the small
             amount of lactose contained in oral medications)

          2. Known allergy to any component of the placebo test drug (lactose, magnesium stearate,
             and gelatin)

          3. History of systemic (e.g., oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous,
             intra-uterine, epidural, bursal, or implanted) androgens, progesterone or

             months prior to randomization (topical non-ophthalmic corticosteroids are not
             excluded)

          4. Blood pressure &gt;180/110 mm Hg (in cases where either or both of the systolic or
             diastolic limits are exceeded, blood pressure can be re-measured after 10 minutes rest

         14. Use of any hormonal therapies including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and
             contraceptive medications that contain progesterone within 3 months before
             randomization (Note: patients on pure estrogen or estradiol replacement therapy can be
             enrolled in the study)

         15. Unstable cardiovascular disease or a history of significant heart disease (including
             unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, or history of
             coronary revascularization procedure) within 6 months before randomization

         16. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude participation
             in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and glycemic

             type of insulin (for example, changing to or adding a short acting insulin from a
             longer-acting insulin), or increased the daily dose ≥ 50%, initiated intensive insulin
             treatment such as an insulin pump or additional daily injections or plan to do so in
             the next 3 months should not be enrolled.

         17. Significant hepatic disease (defined as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
             aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase [ALP], more than twice the upper limit of
             normal) where, in the opinion of the Investigator, danazol might be contraindicated

         18. Significant renal disease (defined as serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl, history of renal
             transplant, or undergoing dialysis at screening) where, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, danazol might be contraindicated

         19. Changes in anti-hypertensive medication within 3 months before randomization (except
             for dosage adjustments that are considered minor in the opinion of the Investigator)

         20. Major surgery (e.g., head and neck, chest, abdomen, gastrointestinal, genitourinary or
             central nervous system) within past 28 days or anticipated in the next 6 months

             pseudotumor cerebri

         22. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of study entry that involved
             treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at the time of study
             entry

         23. Patient is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center during the next 6
             months

        Study Eye Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than DME; e.g., cataract
             extraction, vitreo-retinal interface disease (a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal
             membrane)

          2. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, VA would
             not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy, closure of
             juxafoveal capillaries, dense subfoveal hard exudates)

          3. An ocular condition (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, might affect macular edema or alter VA during the course of the study,
             e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, Irvine-Gass
             Syndrome, etc.

          4. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is likely to interfere
             with ocular measurements or evaluations during this study

          5. History of treatment for DME at any time in the past 8 weeks (such as focal/grid
             macular photocoagulation, intravitreal or peribulbar corticosteroids, anti-vascular
             endothelial growth factor [VEGF drugs], or any other treatment). Note, the 28-day
             screening period allows subjects to be screened at 4 weeks post DME treatment and have
             a baseline visit 28 days later.

          6. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within 4 months prior to
             randomization or anticipated need for PRP in the 6 months following randomization

          7. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 6 months or anticipated within the next 6
             months following randomization

          8. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization

          9. Uncontrolled glaucoma (in Investigator's judgment) in the study eye
