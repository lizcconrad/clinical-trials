    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and efficacy of three test article foams (PDI-192 0.1%
      Foam, PDI-192 0.15% Foam, and Vehicle Foam) such that a final commercial product may be
      selected for future development.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>&quot;Treatment Success&quot; based on change in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Success rate, based on IGA score. Success rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieve &quot;Clear&quot; (score = 0) or &quot;Almost Clear&quot; (score = 1) and at least a 2-grade improvement from Baseline on the IGA score at Day 29. IGA is a measure of overall severity of atopic dermatitis using a 5-point ordinal scale from 0 = clear to 4 = severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pruritis Severity at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in the severity of pruritus (itching) at Day 29. Pruritis severity is based on a periodic subject assessment using a 4-point ordinal scale from 0 = none to 3 = severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from Baseline in EASI scores at Day 29. EASI excludes non-key signs of eczema (such as xerosis and scaling, oozing and crusting), and subjective parameters (such as pruritus and sleep loss) in order to focus the index on key disease signs and to avoid mixing objective parameters with subjective symptoms. EASI scores range from 0 (least severe) to 72 (most severe).</description>

    <measure>Change in Body Surface Area (BSA) Affected</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Days 8, 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from Baseline in the percent BSA affected by disease at Days 8, 15 and 29.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Signs of Atopic Dermatitis (AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 8, 15 and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in severity of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, lichenification and oozing/crusting at Days 8, 15, and 29. All clinical signs are evaluated on a 4-point ordinal scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pruritis Severity at Days 8 and 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 8 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in the severity of pruritus (itching) at Days 8 and 15. Pruritis severity is based on a periodic subject assessment using a 4-point ordinal scale from 0 = none to 3 = severe.</description>
