  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy participants will ingest American ginseng daily or a placebo for four weeks prior to
      engaging in a unaccustomed exercise bout designed to induce mild-moderate muscle soreness.
      Muscle soreness will be assessed via decrements in muscle strength and with a self-rating of
      perceived soreness before and several times after the exercise.

      Healthy men and women will consume either 2000 mg of American ginseng daily (four 500 mg
      pills will be taken at four different times during the day always with food/meals) or a
      placebo (4 cellulose) for four weeks prior to engaging in a 40 minute downhill treadmill jog
      (12% decline) at a speed of 7 miles per hour. Participants will consume one pill with
      breakfast, one pill with lunch, one pill with dinner and another pill with a snack either
      between meals or prior to bedtime. The exercise will be consist of five, eight minute bouts
      of jogging with two minutes of rest/recovery in between. The degree of muscle soreness will
      be assessed using a Biodex strength testing machine (isometric and concentric isokinetic
      torque), and a self-rating of perceived soreness on a scale from zero to ten. All of the
      above measures will be taken before and several times after the downhill jogging protocol.
