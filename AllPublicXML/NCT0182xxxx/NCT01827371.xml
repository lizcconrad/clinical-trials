    <textblock>
      Imvamune (licensed name of MVA being developed as a smallpox vaccine) has been tested in over
      2,000 individuals and is on path for licensure. This study will be a Phase II to evaluate
      three different immunization schedules and two different modes of delivery. The study will
      look at condensed schedules. Study will randomize subjects to one of four arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label immunogenicity and safety study of different
      immunization schedules and delivery systems (syringe and needle vs. the Stratis™) in healthy,
      vaccinia-naïve adults 18 years to 40 years of age, inclusive. Approximately 352 subjects will
      be enrolled and randomized to one of four study arms. Study Arm A (N=88) will receive a two
      dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose) via the SC route using a syringe
      and needle on Day 1 and 29. Study Arm B (N=88) will receive a two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE®
      (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL per dose) via the SC route using a syringe and needle on Day 1 and 15.
      Study Arm C (N=88) will receive a two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL) via
      the SC route using a syringe and needle on Day 1 and 22. Study Arm D (N=88) will receive a
      two dose regimen of IMVAMUNE® (1x10^8 TCID50/0.5 mL) via the SC route using the Stratis™ on
      Day 1 and 29. Immunogenicity assessments will be performed using ELISA and PRNT. Safety
      assessments will be done via solicited injection site and systemic reactions. Unsolicited AEs
      will be collected until 28 days post last injection and SAEs for the duration of the
      subjects' study participation. Safety laboratory assessments will be performed at baseline
      and 14 days after each vaccination. Primary outcome measures: For each subject, the peak PRNT
      will be defined as the highest titer among all available measurements post second
      vaccination; Occurrence of solicited local injection site reactions in subjects receiving
      vaccine via the Stratis™ compared to syringe and needle administration as collected on the
      memory aid and by in clinic assessment. Parent protocol to sub-study 13-0027.

    <measure>Geometric Mean Peak Plaque Reduction Neutralization Titer (PRNT) After Second Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 through Day 31 after 2nd vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was collected from all participants at 8, 15, 22 and 29 days after receipt of the second vaccination for assessment of plaque reduction neutralization titers. The peak titer for each participant was defined as the highest titer among all available measurements post second vaccination. The geometric mean for each group was then assessed from individual participants' peak titers.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reporting Moderate or Severe Solicited Local Injection Site Reactions After Receiving Vaccine Via the Stratis™ Compared to Syringe and Needle Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days after each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Participants maintained a memory aid to record daily the occurrence of local injection site reactions for 15 days after vaccination based on their interference with daily activities (pain and itchiness at injection site, underarm pain and swelling) or based on a quantitative measurement of the reaction (redness, swelling). In the subjective grading scale, severe reactions prevented daily activities, moderate reactions interfered with but did not prevent daily activities, and mild reactions were present but did not interfere with daily activities. For the quantitative scale, severe reactions greater than 30 millimeters (mm), moderate reactions were 15-30mm, and mild reactions were 1-15mm. Participants are counted by the maximum severity on any of the 15 days, and for this outcome measure, only those reporting moderate or severe events are counted. Formal comparisons by Fisher's Exact test were conducted for Arm D (Stratis, Day 1,29) compared to A</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geometric Mean Peak ELISA Titer After Second Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 through 31 after the 2nd vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was collected from all participants at 8, 15, 22 and 29 days after receipt of the second vaccination for assessment of antibody titers by ELISA. The peak titer for each participant was defined as the highest titer among all available measurements post second vaccination. The geometric mean for each group was then assessed from individual participants' peak titers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Associated With IMVAMUNE</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 after the first vaccination through 180 days after the 2nd vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events included any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death; was life threatening; was a persistent/significant disability/incapacity; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation thereof; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or may have jeopardized the participant, or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes. Association with IMVAMUNE was determined by the investigator and defined as &quot;Related&quot;, meaning a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse event. Reasonable possibility was defined as there being evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the adverse event.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Peak Plaque Reduction Neutralization Titer (PRNT) After Second Vaccination</title>
        <description>Blood was collected from all participants at 8, 15, 22 and 29 days after receipt of the second vaccination for assessment of plaque reduction neutralization titers. The peak titer for each participant was defined as the highest titer among all available measurements post second vaccination. The geometric mean for each group was then assessed from individual participants' peak titers.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 7 through Day 31 after 2nd vaccination</time_frame>
        <population>The modified ATP population was defined as all participants who received both vaccinations in window, excluding those who did not have a complete dose delivered or received non-study vaccinations. Only measurements (blood draws) between Days 7-31 were considered and subjects had to have at least two measurements in that range to be included.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Reporting Moderate or Severe Solicited Local Injection Site Reactions After Receiving Vaccine Via the Stratis™ Compared to Syringe and Needle Administration</title>
        <description>Participants maintained a memory aid to record daily the occurrence of local injection site reactions for 15 days after vaccination based on their interference with daily activities (pain and itchiness at injection site, underarm pain and swelling) or based on a quantitative measurement of the reaction (redness, swelling). In the subjective grading scale, severe reactions prevented daily activities, moderate reactions interfered with but did not prevent daily activities, and mild reactions were present but did not interfere with daily activities. For the quantitative scale, severe reactions greater than 30 millimeters (mm), moderate reactions were 15-30mm, and mild reactions were 1-15mm. Participants are counted by the maximum severity on any of the 15 days, and for this outcome measure, only those reporting moderate or severe events are counted. Formal comparisons by Fisher's Exact test were conducted for Arm D (Stratis, Day 1,29) compared to A</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Peak ELISA Titer After Second Vaccination</title>
        <description>Blood was collected from all participants at 8, 15, 22 and 29 days after receipt of the second vaccination for assessment of antibody titers by ELISA. The peak titer for each participant was defined as the highest titer among all available measurements post second vaccination. The geometric mean for each group was then assessed from individual participants' peak titers.</description>

Association with IMVAMUNE was determined by the investigator and defined as &quot;Related&quot;, meaning a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse event. Reasonable possibility was defined as there being evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the adverse event.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Associated With IMVAMUNE</title>
          <description>Serious adverse events included any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death; was life threatening; was a persistent/significant disability/incapacity; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation thereof; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or may have jeopardized the participant, or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes. Association with IMVAMUNE was determined by the investigator and defined as &quot;Related&quot;, meaning a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse event. Reasonable possibility was defined as there being evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the adverse event.</description>
          <population>All subjects receiving at least one vaccination are included in the analysis population 'as treated', so one subject randomized to Arm C vaccinated out of window, equivalent to the schedule for Arm A, was analyzed for this outcome measure as Arm A.</population>
