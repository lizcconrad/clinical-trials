    <textblock>
      Distal radius fracture is one of the most common causes for visiting the emergency
      department. Nowadays, simple radiography is used as a control standard for evaluating
      reduction of distal radius fractures. The disadvantages include time wasting, frequent x-ray
      exposures and use of more sedation in determining adequate reduction, made scientists to
      evaluate alternative method such as ultrasonography which fast, easy and less dangerous were
      considered as advantages. The investigators goal was to identify whether ultrasonography
      guidance compare with the simple radiography aids in determining the adequacy of distal
      radius fracture reduction.
