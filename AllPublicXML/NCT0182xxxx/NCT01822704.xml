  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the efficacy of a 10-week whole
      body vibration training program on physical functioning, societal participation and quality
      of life in individuals with chronic stroke. It is hypothesized that the whole body vibration
      program will induce significantly more gain in physical functioning, societal participation,
      and quality of life in chronic stroke patients, compared with the control group.
