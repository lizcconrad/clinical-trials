    <textblock>
      The purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity in female
      volunteers of EN41-UGR7C vaccine candidate adjuvanted with Alum using IM administration. The
      objective of the immunisation is to induce mucosal and systemic binding and neutralizing
      antibodies against HIV in order to block the virus on the mucosal surface and neutralise the
      viral particles that may eventually succeed in crossing the mucosal barrier.

      This is a Phase 1 exploratory study. EN41-UGR7C will be administered for the first time in
      humans.

      Volunteers who are vaccinated with EN41-UGR7C may develop an immune response against HIV, but
      its ability to induce meaningful protection against HIV will not be known before Phase 3
      efficacy trials are completed, as correlates of protection against HIV are not yet clearly
      defined.

      Consequently, there is no direct benefit to volunteers. They will be reimbursed for their
      time and travel.
