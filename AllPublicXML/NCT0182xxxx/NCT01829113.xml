Following the loading dose period, OGX-427 will be administered at 600mg IV weekly Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21 day cycle during the Treatment Phase. OGX-427 will be given prior to the administration of pemetrexed (500mg/m2 IV) and carboplatin (AUC 6 IV) on Day 1 of each cycle. A maximum of four treatment cycles will be administered.
Patients with objective response or stable disease after four cycles of therapy will move on to a Maintenance Phase of OGX-427 administered at 600mg IV weekly Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21 day cycle plus pemetrexed (500mg/m2 IV on Day 1). Patients may remain on maintenance as long as they are benefiting and have no evidence of disease progression.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of advanced NSCLC, excluding squamous cell and small
             cell histology. Tumors with mixed NSCLC histologies are eligible, as long as the
             predominant histology is not squamous. If small-cell elements are present or not
             otherwise specified histologically, the patient is not eligible.

          2. Metastatic disease (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging
             system, v7.0).

          3. No prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or biological therapy
             for metastatic disease; adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for Stage I, II, or III
             disease is allowed as long as the interval from the end of treatment until disease
             progression was &gt;12 months.

          4. No prior radiation therapy to the whole pelvis or to ≥25% of the total bone marrow
             area. Other radiation therapy must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry.
             Must have recovered from acute adverse effects prior to study entry.

          5. At least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1.

          7. Baseline laboratory values as follows:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥10 g/dL

               -  Platelets ≥100,000/μL

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ≤3.0 x the
                  upper limit of normal (ULN); 5 x ULN if known hepatic metastases.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, unless secondary to Gilbert's disease

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN. If creatinine is &gt;1.5, calculate creatinine
                  clearance (CrCl) ≥45 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault method:

             Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) = (140-age) x (weight/kg) x (0.85 if female)/ (72 x
             serum creatinine mg/dL)

          8. Fertile male patients willing to use adequate contraceptive measures.

          9. Female patients who are not of child-bearing potential, and fertile female patients of
             child-bearing potential who agree to use adequate contraceptive measures, who are not
             breastfeeding, and who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours
             prior to start of randomization.

         10. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

         11. Must be ≥18 years of age at the time of consent.

         12. Willingness and ability to comply with trial and follow-up procedures.

             receptor (EGFR) &quot;activating&quot; mutations where first-line treatment with targeted
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is more appropriate.

          2. Known central nervous system (CNS) disease other than neurologically stable, treated
             brain metastases defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage
             after treatment and no ongoing requirements for corticosteroids, (e.g., dexamethasone)
             for at least 2 weeks.

                  are eligible).

          4. Patients currently receiving therapeutic anticoagulation.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women.

          6. Any serious, active underlying medical condition that would impair the ability of the
             patient to receive study treatment, such as diabetes mellitus or infection.

          7. Unable or unwilling to take folic acid or vitamin B12.

          8. Active second malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin or superficial bladder cancer)
             defined as requiring current need for cancer therapy or at high risk of recurrence
             during the study.

          9. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.
