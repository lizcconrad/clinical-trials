    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find what happens to capecitabine in the body when
      dosed using actual versus ideal body weight in subjects with advanced tumors and elevated
      body mass index.

      Cycle 1 : Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 PO BID for 7 consecutive days (D1 - D7) will be
      administered by subject (with Ideal Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage. Day
      8-No drug administered.

      Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 PO BID for 7 more consecutive days (D9 - D15) will be administered
      by subject (with Actual Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage. There will be 6
      consecutive days that no drug will be administered by subject (Days 16-21).

      Cycle 2 and beyond: Capecitabine 1,250 mg/m2 PO BID for 14 consecutive days (D1 - D14) will
      be administered by subject (with Actual Body Weight being used to determine BSA) for dosage.
      Days 15-21-No drug administered.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PK parameters will be summarized it terms of number of observations, means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges, stratified by time point. AUC will be estimated using the Lagrange approximation method and a paired t-test will be used to compare the PK parameters between full weight and limited weight based dosing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>A combination of Response Rate, Evaluation of Measurable Disease, and Progression Free Survival of subjects using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1 (changes in only the largest diameter of the tumor lesions) over time</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurable disease is defined as measurable lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20 mm with conventional techniques (CT, MRI, x-ray) or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as time from first dose of capecitabine to time to clinical or imaging evidence of progressive disease.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic
             cancer for which capecitabine treatment is considered a standard treatment option.

          -  Patients with measurable or evaluable disease are eligible

          -  Patient's Body Mass Index must be 30 kg/m2 or higher.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

        Hematologic: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt;1000/mcL (microliters), Hemoglobin &gt; 8gm/dL
        (transfusions permitted) and platelets &gt; 75,000/mcL

        Renal: serum creatinine ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance (CrCl)
        (either estimated or calculated) &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m for patients with creatinine levels
        above institutional normal.

        Females: Crcl =(140-age)(weight in kg)(0.85)/72 x Serum creatinine

        Males: Crcl =(140-age)(weight in kg)/72 x Serum creatinine

        Hepatic: Serum Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN and No liver metastases: Aspartate
        aminotransferase(AST) and Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5x ULN Liver metastases: AST and
        ALT ≤ 5x ULN

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Capecitabine is contra-indicated in pregnant women because of known detrimental
             effects on the fetus. A negative pregnancy test is required in all premenopausal women
             within 14 days of study therapy initiation. Women of child-bearing potential and men
             with an active female sexual partner must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal, surgical, barrier methods or abstinence allowed) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had systemic chemotherapies or targeted therapies within 3 weeks or
             radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to entering the study or those patients whose
             adverse events from prior therapies have not recovered to &lt; grade 1 and are still
             considered clinically significant.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents for cancer treatment.

          -  Patients with treated, stable brain metastases are allowed to enroll. Patients must be
             at least 4 weeks from brain radiation and off any medications used to treat brain
             metastases including steroids. Patients are allowed to be on anti-epileptic
             medications that are not contraindicated based on the drug-interaction table.

          -  Patients with any condition of the gastrointestinal tract that is expected to result
             in an inability to swallow or absorb oral medications (ie. prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption and requiring i.v. alimentation). This will be determined at the
             discretion of the PI.

          -  Patients may not be taking any concomitant drugs that are contraindicated based on the
             drug-interaction table.

          -  Concurrent treatment with warfarin (coumadin) is allowed, but close monitoring of the
             PT/INR (Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio) is recommended.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             severe infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             clinically significant or symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, other malignancies requiring
             therapy or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because
             capecitabine is a pregnancy category D drug and is known to pass to the infant in
             breastmilk.

          -  Patients with known deficiency of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to capecitabine.
