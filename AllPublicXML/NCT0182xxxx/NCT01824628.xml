    <textblock>
      This is a unicentric, two cohorts, observational transversal study.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the QT/QTc intervals of HIV positive subjects
      receiving an antiretroviral therapy and those without HIV in an ambulatory care setting.

      Primary objective:

      The primary objective is to compare the QT/QTc intervals of HIV positive subjects treated
      with antiretroviral therapy and followed at the ambulatory HIV clinic and the QT/QTc
      intervals of :

        1. an outpatient HIV negative population from the same health center pre-admission one-day
           surgical clinic.

        2. the large HIV-free korean population studied in the ECG-ViEW database.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Evaluate the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation in the outpatient HIV positive
           population comparatively to the two HIV negative outpatient populations available from
           the one-day surgical clinic and the ECG-ViEW database.

        -  Evaluate risk factors associated with QTc interval prolongation in the outpatient HIV
           positive population compared to the outpatient HIV negative population and the
           population studied in the ECG-ViEW database.

        -  Compare the QT/QTc intervals and the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation of the
           outpatient HIV positive population currently on an antiretroviral regimen including a
           protease inhibitor versus those on an antiretroviral regimen without protease inhibitor.

        -  Compare the QT/QTc intervals among the outpatient HIV positive population treated with a
           protease inhibitor, in regard to the presence or the absence of certain genetic
           polymorphisms that may influence pharmacokinetic aspects of protease inhibitors.

    <measure>QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals determined by a 12-leads ECG</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 = Day 1 - This is a transversal study.</time_frame>
    <description>The QT/QTc intervals are determined by a 50 mm/s 12-leads ECG in the outpatient HIV positive population. The ECG is conducted in the morning, between 8:00 and 12:00 to limit the circadian variation.
For the control group, the QT/QTc intervals are assessed through a registry of outpatient HIV negative subjects who had had a standard 12-leads ECG done in pre-admission one-day surgery clinic.
In both groups, the corrected QT interval is calculated with the Bazett's formula and the Fridericia's formula.</description>

    <description>Compare the QTc intervals calculated with the Bazett's formula and the Fridericia's formula in both study groups in order to determine the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation. The QTc interval is considered to be prolonged if it exceeds 430 ms in women and 450 ms in men.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0 = Day 1 - This is a transversal study.</time_frame>
    <description>A predetermined questionnaire is filled for each of the study subjects in order to assess factors associated with an increased QTc interval prolongation. This contains demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity...), known health issues (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, liver diseases...), concomitant drugs, etc.</description>

    <description>Compare the QTc intervals calculated with the Bazett's formula and the Fridericia's formula between outpatient HIV positive subjects treated with a protease inhibitor (PI) based antiretroviral regimen and those treated with an antiretroviral regimen without PI. The QTc interval is considered to be prolonged if it exceeds 430 ms in women and 450 ms in men.</description>

    <description>A blood sample of each subject treated with a PI is analyzed in the laboratory in order to determine whether certain genetic polymorphisms influence on the metabolism of the drug, thus causing a QTc interval prolongation or not.</description>

        The study is being conducted within the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal
        (CHUM). The recruited population was identified from the CHUM ambulatory care HIV clinic
        and an ECG registry composed of outpatient HIV negative subjects who were scheduled for a
        one-day surgery. The HIV positive outpatients on antiretroviral therapy will be recruited
        prospectively from March 2013 through August 2013. The outpatient HIV negative cohort will
        be recruited retrospectively according to a 10:1 ratio.
