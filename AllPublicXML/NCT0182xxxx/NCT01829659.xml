  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess the effects of the CTP inhibitor on the function of your
      platelets (cells within your blood that are involved in the formation of blood clots) and to
      assess whether you have responded to the ticagrelor well enough to prevent the formation of
      blood clots within the stent or site in which angioplasty was performed.

      Recent studies have looked at how racial differences can affect platelet reactivity, the way
      blood clots. But these studies have not looked at the way different racial backgrounds can
      affect the way the blood forms clots. Minorities, such as African-Americans are
      underrepresented. Therefore, we are conducting this platelet reactivity study to better
      understand if there are differences in how this drug affects African-Americans from how they
      affect Caucasian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and receiving
      ticagrelor. These data will be compared to a historical control of Caucasian patients who
      underwent similar platelet function testing.

        Thirty African American patients with documented acute coronary syndrome who agree to
        participate in this clinical study and who sign an informed consent will be enrolled.

        Race determination will be based on a patient's self-report, but patients enrolled in the
        trial must also report that all four of their grandparents were of the same race as theirs.
        Other races (Asian, Native American, etc) will be excluded from this study.

          -  Presenting with ACS fulfilling the following:

               1. Symptoms or new ECG changes (ST segment elevation or depression of at least 1 mm
                  in 2 or more contiguous leads on EKG)

               2. Elevation of biomarkers (CK-MB ≥2 ULN or troponin ≥ ULN)

          -  Self-identified as African-American

          -  Treatment with 75-100mg ASA daily

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any indication (atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis or prosthetic heart valve, PE,
             DVT) for antithrombotic treatment during study period.

          -  Fibrinolytic therapy within 48 hours before randomization

          -  Concomitant therapy with a drug having possible interaction with ticagrelor.
             (concomitant therapy with a strong cytochrome P-450 3A inhibitor or inducer)

          -  Increased bleeding risk including: recent (&lt;30 days) GI bleeding, any history of
             intracranial, intraocular, retroperitoneal, or spinal bleeding, recent (&lt;30 days of
             dosing) major trauma, sustained uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure
             [SBP]&gt;180mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP]&gt;100mmHg), history of hemorrhagic
             disorders that can increase the risk of bleeding, platelet count less than 100,000 mm3
