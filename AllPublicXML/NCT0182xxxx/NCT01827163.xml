    <description>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the feasibility of this regimen in patients with node-negative HER-2/neu overexpressed /amplified breast cancer with a tumor size of &lt; 3 cm. The regimen is considered feasible if patients are able to complete the paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and lapatinib (THL) portion of the regimen without a dose delay or reduction or grade 3 or greater QTc prolongation.</description>

    <description>Paclitaxel (T) at 175 mg/m2 q 2 weeks x 4 with filgrastim/pegfilgrastim + trastuzumab (H) + daily oral lapatinib (L), followed by trastuzumab q 3 weeks x 15 doses + daily oral lapatinib (HL). Pegfilgrastim 6mg will be given subcutaneously (SQ) on day # 2 of each paclitaxel administration. Filgrastim may be used in lieu of pegfilgrastim at physician's discretion. Trastuzumab will be administered weekly (4 mg/kg bolus followed by 2 mg/kg weekly) starting with paclitaxel treatment cycle # 1. After 4 cycles of paclitaxel, pts will receive trastuzumab on a q 3 weeks x 15 doses (to complete about one year). The q 3 week trastuzumab may be started from 1-3 weeks after the last dose of paclitaxel. A total of 15 infusions of trastuzumab will be given q 3 weeks after the completion of paclitaxel during the HL phase. Lapatinib will be given orally at 1000 mg daily, starting with paclitaxel during the THL phase &amp; continued for the remaining year during the HL phase for about a year.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma with HER2/neu
             immunohistochemistry 3+ or FISH-amplified breast cancer with a ratio of ≥ 2.0

          -  Tumor size of ≤ 3 cm and node-negative disease. Nodes with single cells or tumor
             clusters &lt; 0.2 mm by H&amp;E or IHC are considered node-negative. Patients with
             micrometastasis (nodes with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2 cm) are allowed.
             Further axillary dissection will be determined by the patient's surgeon as per
             standard of care.

          -  Patients must be ≥18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Treatment should be started within 90 days of the final surgical procedure for breast
             cancer.

          -  Patients may have bilateral synchronous breast tumors. Patients may have received
             hormonal therapy for the purpose of chemoprevention but must be willing to discontinue
             prior to enrollment and while participating in this trial.

          -  If patients have peripheral neuropathy, it must be ≤ grade 1.

          -  Patients must be willing to discontinue sex hormonal therapy e.g., birth control
             pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc., prior to enrollment. Women of
             childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective contraception
             while on treatment and for a reasonable period thereafter.

          -  Hematologic parameters: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/μL and platelet count
             ≥100,000/μL.

          -  Non-hematologic parameters: total bilirubin must be ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit
             of normal (ULN), transaminases (SGOT or SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN.

          -  Negative HCG pregnancy test for premenopausal women of reproductive capacity and for
             women less than 12 months after the menopause. LVEF by ECHO (with strain if possible)
             with LVEF of ≥ 50%. If an ECHO cannot be done, a MUGA may be performed.

          -  Patients must give written, informed consent indicating their understanding of and
             willingness to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with stage IV breast cancer or undergoing chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
             immunotherapy, or biotherapy for current breast cancer.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding patients.

          -  Patients with a concurrently active second malignancy, other than adequately treated
             non-melanoma skin cancers or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Patients with unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or with a history of a
             myocardial infarction within 12 months. Patients with high-risk uncontrolled
             arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, high-grade AV block, supraventricular
             arrhythmias which are not adequately rate-controlled). Patients are excluded if they
             have grade 3 QT prolongation (Appendix F) (&gt;500 ms) or require drugs that may prolong
             the QT.

          -  Subjects who have current active hepatic (including hepatitis B or C) or biliary
             disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones).
