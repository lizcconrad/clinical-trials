      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of injecting the Stromal
      Vascular Fraction (SVF) [containing Adipose Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs)] enriched fat grafts
      into regions of the face that require enhancement. The safety of SVF will be evaluated
      throughout the course of the study phase through the assessment of laboratory values,
      physical examinations, adverse events, safety phone calls etc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female or Male, Age 18 years or older

          2. Subjects that are scheduled for liposuction and facial fat grafting procedures for
             cosmetic purposes

          3. Facial volume defects which could be treated with a total graft volume of between 1mL
             and 50mL

          4. BMI between and including 23 and 28

          5. Able to understand and provide written and verbal informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently taking or have taken NSAIDs within last two weeks or corticosteroids within
             the last six weeks prior to screening

          2. Diagnosis of any of the following medical conditions:

               -  Active malignancy (diagnosed within 5 years), except for treated non-melanoma
                  skin cancer or other non-invasive or in-situ neoplasm

               -  Active infection

               -  Type I or Type II Diabetes

          3. Subjects who are unlikely to comply with the protocol (e.g., uncooperative attitude,
             inability to return for subsequent visits, dementia, and/or otherwise considered by
             the Investigator to be unlikely to complete the study)

          4. Subjects with a known drug or alcohol dependence within the past 12 months as judged
             by the Investigator

          5. Subjects with major illnesses involving the renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, and/or
             nervous systems

          6. Subjects with elevated kidney and/or liver functions

          7. Any other disease condition or laboratory results that in the opinion of the
             investigator may be clinically significant and render the subject inappropriate for
             the study procedure(s), may alter the accuracy of study results, or increase risk for
             subjects.

          8. Subjects with life-expectancies less than 9 months

          9. Subjects with known collagenase allergies

         10. Subjects with idiopathic or drug-induced coagulopathy

         11. Pregnant females

         12. On radiotherapy or chemotherapy agents

         13. Taking strong CYP450 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir,
             nelfinavir, saquinavir), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin, telithromycin),
             chloramphenicol, azole antibiotics (ketoconazole, itraconazole) and nefazodone.

         14. Subjects with a history of keloids or hypertrophic scar formations
