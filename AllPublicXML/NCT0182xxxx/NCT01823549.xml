  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a survey to determine the frequency of Complementary and Alternative Medicine
      (CAM) use in patients recently diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer who were starting
      radiation therapy. The survey was repeated at three time points to assess changes in CAM use
      over time.
