  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine substance use is common worldwide. No approved pharmacologic treatments for
      methamphetamine dependence exist. paliperidone are Second generation antipsychotics，and have
      effects of blocking dopamine2(D2) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A(5-HT) receptors
      neurotransmitters.To determine whether mirtazapine would reduce methamphetamine use among
      methamphetamine addicts.

    <description>The outcome was the confirmed abstinence during 12 weeks. Confirmed abstinence was defined as a negative urine drug test. The following aggregate measures of urine drug test results were calculated: the time-to-first positive urine test, the Treatment Effectiveness Score (TES; the sum of the number of METH-free urine samples submitted per participant ), the longest period of MA abstinence during the 84 days.</description>

    <description>psychosis assessement was made once a week.Psychotic symptom relapse was defined as one or more of the following: (1) hospitalization for psychotic symptoms; deliberate self-injury or violent behavior, or suicidal or homicidal ideation that was clinically significant;25% increase in PANSS total score;for patients who scored &gt;40 at randomization, or a 10-point increase for patients who scored ≤40 at randomization for two consecutive assessments (within 1 week), and (4) increase in prespecified individual PANSS items scores (P1, P2, P3, P6, P7 and G8) to ≥5 for patients whose score was ≤3 at randomization, or to ≥6 for patients whose score was 4 at randomization for two consecutive assessments (within 1 week)</description>
