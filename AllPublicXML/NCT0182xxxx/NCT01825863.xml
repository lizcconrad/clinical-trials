  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is a common disease and usually occurs within the ages of 10-30 years
      old.&quot; Ten percent of the population will get this disease during a lifetime.&quot; At Bispebjerg
      hospital it is one of the most common acute surgeries performed. Though at Bispebjerg
      hospital the surgery is only performed on adults as there is no pediatric ward. The surgical
      technique is primarily laparoscopic surgery, where the patients have their appendix removed
      while in general anaesthesia. During the last three years Bispebjerg hospital has had an
      average of 287 patients per year undergoing laparoscopic surgery. From January to the
      September 2012 a total of 211 patients have had the operation, with 29% having the operation
      performed during daytime, 48% in the evening and 22% at night. Open appendectomy is only
      performed in cases where laparoscopic surgery is impossible, this is often due to adhesions,
      scar tissue from former abdominal surgery or peritonitis. The scars from laparoscopic surgery
      are usually smaller than that from an open appendectomy, but it gives the patient three
      smaller scars divided on three abdominal quadrants instead of one larger scar on one
      quadrant.

      The investigators want to conduct a clinical trial with fifty six patients undergoing
      laparoscopic surgery due to acute appendicitis. The investigators want to find out if it is
      possible to improve the post-operative pain management within this very large group of
      patients undergoing acute surgery. In detail, the investigators wish to explore whether the
      use of the BD-TAP blockade in the abdominal wall on patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery
      due to acute appendicitis, can anesthetize the patients completely or partially, so they can
      avoid morphine intake completely or partially during the post-operative phase (12-24 hours).
      The research project will be a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial.
