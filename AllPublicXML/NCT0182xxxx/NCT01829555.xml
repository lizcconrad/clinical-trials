  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose control is necessary to avoid the immediate and long-term adverse effects associated
      with type 1 diabetes, and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose is the first important
      step to achieving glucose control. Data suggest that large proportions of adolescents and
      young adults fail to adhere to standard guidelines of self-monitored of blood glucose testing
      and have hemoglobin A1c levels &gt;7.5%. A finite period of poor metabolic control can lead to
      increased risk of medical complications over an individual's lifespan, necessitating novel
      interventions to improve self-monitored blood glucose testing and metabolic control in
      emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. The investigators treatment approach, which provides
      direct tangible reinforcement for objective evidence of behavior change, is efficacious in
      decreasing substance use, reducing weight, and improving medication adherence.

      The purpose of this project is to develop and pilot test an intervention based on behavioral
      economic principles for improving self-monitored blood glucose testing in young persons with
      type 1 diabetes. In this pilot study, patients will text in, via cell phones, each time they
      test, and a return text will inform them of reinforcer vouchers earned. The investigators
      will collect data on self-monitored blood glucose testing frequency and A1c levels preceding
      treatment initiation and throughout a 6 month treatment period. If promising, a randomized
      trial will lead to larger scale evaluations of reinforcement interventions alone, or in
      combination with multimodal treatment approaches, and it may be applied to other clinical
      issues such as adherence to continuous glucose monitoring. Importantly, this intervention can
      be administered remotely and in an automated fashion, allowing for widespread adoption if
      efficacious.
