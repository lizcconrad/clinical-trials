    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that participation in a formal cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
      program improves aerobic exercise capacity and quality of life over the medium term for
      patients with congenital heart disease with reduced exercise capacity. To test this
      hypothesis, subjects will be randomized to either receive a 12-week cardiopulmonary
      rehabilitation program or standard of care, with interval testing of aerobic capacity and
      other physiologic markers improved fitness, as well as assessment of quality of life.

    <description>The subjects will attend 2 sessions each week for 12 weeks. Each session will be approximately 2 hours in duration, consisting of both exercise (aerobic and strength,~60 minutes) and education. In addition, subjects will be directed to participate in 3 weekly ~40 minute home exercise training sessions, personalized to their level of aerobic conditioning.</description>
