  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Diabetes Association recommends optimizing glycemic control to achieve a
      glycated hemoglobin (A1C) of less than 7% in patients with diabetes. Despite these
      recommendations, approximately 25% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery have evidence of
      suboptimal glycemic control (A1C&gt;7%). Recent research has demonstrated that such patients
      experience a higher rate of post-operative complications and significantly worse short-term
      and long-term post-operative survival. Therefore, it is recommended that attempts should be
      made to improve glycemic control while patients wait for their elective surgery. However, at
      present processes of care that facilitate pre-operative glycemic control optimization do not
      exist in Canada.

      The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a
      comprehensive community-based pre-operative diabetes optimization program for patients
      awaiting elective cardiac surgery.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial and will investigate the feasibility and
      effectiveness of a pre-operative diabetes optimization program for patients with suboptimal
      glycemic control awaiting elective cardiac surgery. Consenting patients will be randomized to
      a Standard Pre-Operative Diabetes Care Group (Group 1) and a Structured Pre-Operative
      Diabetes Optimization Group (Group 2).

    <description>Patients will receive structured pre-operative diabetes optimization while they wait for surgery. Patients will be referred to the Youville Diabetes Center where they will undergo preoperative optimization of their diabetes management. This will include in-depth diabetes education and instruction pertaining to lifestyle modification (blood glucose monitoring, nutrition, and physical activity) to improve glycemic control. Pharmacologic therapy will be reviewed by the Youville Diabetes Center certified diabetes nurse educators.</description>
