  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is observed in our ageing
      population. Since it is less invasive, endovascular repair (EVAR) by stent-graft (SG)
      insertion is frequently indicated in patients with intermediate and high-operative risk.
      Patient selection and stent planning for EVAR is done on CT-scans based on specific anatomic
      criteria. SG are inserted in the catheterization laboratory under digital substraction
      angiography (DSA) and fluoroscopic guidance. With this technology, no soft-tissue
      differentiation is available during the intervention and important information are lacking
      such as thrombus and aneurysm extension close to proximal and distal landing zones. Our team
      has recently patented a software allowing the extraction of the AAA (lumen and thrombus) from
      pre-operative CT-scanner. In collaboration with Siemens medical, the investigators have
      integrated this technology to the Siemens workstation in the catheterization laboratory. The
      investigators can now import the aortic lumen and thrombus meshes segmented from
      pre-operative CT-scans and perform a rigid registration with fluoroscopy and DSA data to
      enhance visualization of soft tissue during EVAR.

      Our preliminary results are encouraging in terms of feasibility and visualization. However,
      the delivery device of the SG and the guidewire used during the intervention are stiff and
      induce a deformation of aortic lumen and thrombus. This deformation impairs the accuracy of
      rigid registration. The investigators propose to improve registration accuracy by
      implementing an elastic deformation of aortic lumen and wall based on the segmentation of
      endovascular devices (delivery device, guidewires and catheters) inserted during the
      procedure and by biomechanical modeling.

      This project has 3 objectives: 1. To implement and validate a new optimized workflow enabling
      rigid registration between AAA meshes extracted from preoperative CT-scan with fluoroscopic
      images. 2. To develop an elastic registration of the AAA meshes based on 2D or 3D modeling of
      the endovascular device. 3. To validate the accuracy of elastic registration and compare it
      with the rigid registration.

      Experimental protocol: These 3 objectives will be completed in three experimental phases:

        1. Improvement and implementation of the current rigid registration software. In this
           phase, several new features such as an improved correction system by automatic capture
           of DSA, an automated 3D/3D rigid registration, recognition of the origin of internal
           iliac arteries will be implemented. This new beta version will be tested in 20 patients
           at CHUM Research center and Dalhousie University-QEII Health Sciences Centre.

        2. Implementation of an elastic registration based on endovascular device segmentation and
           center line corrections. The luminal path of the segmented lumen on preoperative CT-scan
           will be aligned with the path of the endovascular devices, then an elastic deformation
           of the aortic lumen and thrombus meshes generated from CT-scanner will be applied and
           registered to fluoroscopic and DSA images. A workflow allowing a fast recognition and
           segmentation of endovascular devices from one to three stereotaxic fluoroscopic views
           will be implemented in the Leonardo workstation and tested off-line on the previous 20
           patient database and also in-vitro in realistic phantoms.

        3. Online validation of elastic registration: The best strategy as defined above will be
           validated clinically on-line. The beta version will be tested in real time in 20
           patients requiring SG procedures and compared to the prior cohort having EVAR/FEVAR
           procedures with rigid registration. The accuracy of rigid and elastic registrations will
           be compared in the two experimental groups.
