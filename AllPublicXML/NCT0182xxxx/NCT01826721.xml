  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) must follow complex medication regimens and require
      a substantial amount of education for effective self-management. The current standard of care
      for post-transplant medication teaching is a Self Medication education program conducted in
      hospital by the pharmacist. The Transplant Medication Information Teaching Tool (TMITT) is a
      web-based e-learning tool for SOTR developed at the Toronto General Hospital. The ability to
      control the content, sequence, pace and timing of education in order to achieve personal
      learning objectives, as well as the opportunity for ongoing review and reinforcement of
      information, may be an attractive, convenient and effective teaching modality.

      SOTR will be randomly assigned to receive the standard of care or the standard of care plus
      the TMITT intervention. Primary objectives are to compare patient satisfaction and medication
      knowledge between the two groups at baseline and 3 months using modified versions of
      previously published questionnaires. Medication adherence as measured by a multidimensional
      approach including both subjective and objective components, will also be compared at 3
      months. Our hypothesis is that an education strategy that includes both the standard
      pharmacist teaching followed by a tailored online e-learning intervention post-discharge will
      lead to improved patient satisfaction, knowledge and medication adherence.
