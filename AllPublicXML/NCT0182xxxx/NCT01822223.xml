  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which implant-abutment design is more likely to
      promote early soft-tissue healing processes and/or will enhance longitudinal peri-implant
      bone and soft-tissue health.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the integrity of the peri-implant oral soft-tissue attachment to
      implant abutments by comparing tissue responses to a laser-ablated implant-abutment and an
      implant-abutment manufactured with a smooth surface.

      Investigators will assess the initial post-surgical peri-implant attachment-seal and will
      test whether or not the tissue-abutment interface re-forms with equal integrity when the
      abutment is removed and replaced with a new abutment.

      Data will include histological, radiographic, clinical, and subjective aesthetics to compare
      the effectiveness of two abutment designs. Both devices are supplied by the BioHorizons
      Implant Systems Inc. of Birmingham, Alabama; the abutments are analogous in design and
      material except the test device has a laser-ablated surface and the control abutment is
      smooth.

    <measure>Grams of Force Needed to Disrupt Tissue Attachment to the Abutment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post-abutment placement</time_frame>
    <description>A force transducing periodontal probe instrument will electronically capture the grams of force needed to disrupt the attachment to the implant abutment; tissues will be probed from the gingival margin to the alveolar bone crest at 4 points around each abutment and an adjacent tooth: measurements will be captured from the mesial, buccal, distal, and lingual. The specific force probe generates a descriptive graph that demonstrates the cumulative force and distribution necessary to disrupt the attachment of the gingival tissues to the abutment. These graphs were recorded, but were difficult to interpret and have not been reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Millimeters of Clinical Attachment to the Abutment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post-abutment placement</time_frame>
    <description>A periodontal probe will be used to measure the level of clinical attachment to the abutment in millimeters. Measurements will be captured at 4 points around each abutment; mesial, buccal, distal, and lingual. All measurements were considered and the change in attachment level was assessed at each individual site. Data were reported as descriptive and were used to elucidate potential advantages and/or disadvantages of varying abutment types. These data were strictly confirmatory to the proof-in-principle histology presented in the report. Measures were taken at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and 12 months to determine if attachment to one abutment type was more or less stable over time. The specific force probe generates a descriptive graph that demonstrates the cumulative force and distribution necessary to disrupt the attachment of the gingival tissues to the abutment. These graphs were recorded, but were difficult to interpret and have not been reported.</description>

        <description>A force transducing periodontal probe instrument will electronically capture the grams of force needed to disrupt the attachment to the implant abutment; tissues will be probed from the gingival margin to the alveolar bone crest at 4 points around each abutment and an adjacent tooth: measurements will be captured from the mesial, buccal, distal, and lingual. The specific force probe generates a descriptive graph that demonstrates the cumulative force and distribution necessary to disrupt the attachment of the gingival tissues to the abutment.

        <description>A periodontal probe will be used to measure the level of clinical attachment to the abutment in millimeters. Measurements will be captured at 4 points around each abutment; mesial, buccal, distal, and lingual. All measurements were considered and the change in attachment level was assessed at each individual site. Data were reported as descriptive and were used to elucidate potential advantages and/or disadvantages of varying abutment types. These data were strictly confirmatory to the proof-in-principle histology presented in the report.
