  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of docosahexaenoic fatty acid and
      eicosapentaenoic fatty acid supplementation for six months on the inflammation state as well
      as the process of muscular regeneration and the metabolic disorders like obesity and insulin
      resistance in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy
      (DMB) compared to those receiving placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DMD and DMB are X-linked diseases caused by mutations in the DMD gene, these mutations have
      important functional and structural consequences in skeletal muscle. In muscle fiber is
      observed inflammation and necrosis as a result of lost regenerative capacity. The muscle
      fibers can be replaced by connective and adipose tissue. In a previous study the
      investigators identified that 50% of Duchenne and Becker patients in the range of thirteen
      years old have obesity. In addition, these patients (N=66) have hyperinsulinemia (53.7%) and
      insulin resistance (48.5%). It is well known that obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin
      resistance have a inflammatory background.

      It has been demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic fatty acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic fatty
      acid (DHA) exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and have beneficial effects on obesity,
      hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in children and adolescents.

      Objective: Determine the effect of EPA and DHA on inflammation, obesity and insulin
      resistance in patients with DMD/DMB compared to those receiving placebo.
