  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to acquire pilot data for a larger study to test
      the following hypothesis: Treatment of the hands of patients with chronic hand
      dermatitis/atopic dermatitis with CLn BodyWash, a novel gel wash cleanser currently marketed
      as a cosmetic product containing a dilute concentration of less than 0.01% sodium
      hypochlorite and less than 0.005% concentration as it is lathered, will result in a
      statistically significant reduction in the number of skin fauna present on the hands of these
      patients compared to treatment of such patients with traditional wash used clinically such as
      Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Hand Eczema will be asked to wash with either a CLn BodyWash or Cetaphil Daily
      Facial Cleanser. Patients and study staff will be blinded. Hand swabs will be done prior to
      the wash and after 20 minutes. The average time spent in the study for each patient should be
      less than 2 hours unless an Adverse Event occurs.
