    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies molecular profiling-based targeted therapy in
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775, everolimus, and
      trametinib are drugs that each target a specific variation in tumors by blocking different
      proteins needed for cell growth. Veliparib blocks an enzyme that helps repair
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaged by chemotherapy, which may help chemotherapy drugs work
      better. It is not yet known whether testing patients for variations in their tumor and
      assigning treatment targeting the variation is more effective than standard non-targeted
      therapy in treating advanced solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the response rate (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) and 4-month
      progression-free survival (PFS) for treatment with agents chosen based on the presence of
      specific mutations in patient tumors with the response rate for treatment with agents chosen
      from the complementary set of agents not identified to target the mutations of interest.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment regimens corresponding to one of their
      mutation/amplification categories. Patients may cross over to a second mutation/amplification
      determined regimen within Arm A, if there is one, upon disease progression.

      REGIMEN I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and
      temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN II: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 PO BID for 5 doses starting on day 1 and
      carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN III: Patients receive everolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN IV: Patients receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients are assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment regimens as in Arm A from the
      complementary set (not corresponding to one of their mutation categories). Patients may cross
      over to Arm A upon disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days. Patients with
      unacceptable toxicities that have not resolved by day 30 are followed up biweekly until
      stabilization or resolution.

             was in combination; patients who have received temozolomide with a PARP inhibitor in
             the past are eligible to participate but will not receive veliparib with temozolomide
             on study; such patients are eligible to receive other treatment regimens on study
             based on identified genetic mutations

             receive everolimus on study; if these patients have mutations of interest in pathways
             other than the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
             (pI3K) pathway, they will be eligible to receive agents based on that mutation

          -  TREATMENT: Patients who have received prior mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
             (MEK) inhibitors would not be eligible to receive trametinib DMSO on study; if these
             patients have mutations of interest in pathways other than the rat sarcoma (RAS)
             pathway, they will be eligible to receive agents based on that mutation

          -  TREATMENT: Patients with current or a history of interstitial lung disease, known
             severely impaired lung function (spirometry and carbon monoxide diffusing capability
             test (DLCO) 50% or less of normal and oxygen [O2] saturation 88% or less at rest on
             room air) or non-infectious pneumonitis will not be assigned treatment with everolimus
             or trametinib DMSO; symptoms should have resolved and course of antibiotics been
             completed for patients with a history of infectious pneumonitis to be eligible

          -  TREATMENT: For patients on everolimus, fasting serum cholesterol =&lt; 300 mg/dL OR =&lt;
             7.75 mmol/L AND fasting triglycerides =&lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); NOTE: in
             case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can receive everolimus
             on study only after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication with follow up
             documentation of values below the above cut-off

          -  TREATMENT: Patients with known hypersensitivity reaction to dacarbazine are ineligible
             to receive temozolomide

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents;
             patients on other trials will be eligible as long as they are no longer receiving
             study treatment

          -  TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including,
             but not limited to psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, invasive
             fungal infections, or active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infection,
             liver disease such as cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and active and chronic
             hepatitis (i.e., quantifiable hepatitis B virus [HBV]-DNA and/or positive hepatitis B
             surface antigen [HbsAg], quantifiable hepatitis C virus [HCV]-ribonucleic acid [RNA])
             are not eligible to participate; testing for hepatitis B or other infections for
             eligibility will be performed only if clinically indicated

          -  TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might
             predispose for drug intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take
             oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption, malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease) are
             excluded; subjects with Crohn's disease or a partial or complete small bowel
             obstruction are also excluded, as are any patients who cannot swallow tablets or
             capsules whole; tablets or capsules must not be crushed or chewed; nasogastric or
             gastrostomy tube (G-tube) administration is not allowed

             anticoagulants such as warfarin are excluded; low molecular weight heparin is
             permitted for prophylactic or therapeutic use

          -  TREATMENT: Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  TREATMENT: Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents; patients on
             other trials will be eligible as long as they are no longer receiving study treatment

          -  TREATMENT: Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are
             excluded from this clinical trial; patients who have a history of seizures are not
             eligible to receive veliparib, but patients who have either not had seizures or who
             have been on stable doses of anti-seizure medicine and had no seizures for 4 weeks
             will be eligible for other study agents; enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants are
             contraindicated
