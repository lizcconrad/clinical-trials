    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-DTBZ PET
      to the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other parkinsonism disorders,
      including multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive
      supranuclear palsy (PSP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients with PD, 40 patients with MSA, 20 patients with CBD, and 20 patients with PSP,
      will be enrolled. Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria according the subject grouping, each subject will have 3
      visits in this study, as one screening visit, one imaging visit, and one safety evaluation
      visit.

      Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,

    <description>All subjects that received 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ for injection.Sensitivity and specificity analysis of VMAT2 imaging will include all subjects for whom there is sufficient data to evaluate the parameter in question.Descriptive statistics will be presented to help detect changes within groups or differences between groups (PD vs. MSA, CBD, PSP). The descriptive statistics will include mean, standard deviation, median, and ranges for continuous variables, and frequency and percent frequency for categorical variables.Mann Whitney test will be used to compare the mean SUVR values between PD and other groups. ROC curve will be used to determinate the diagnostic threshold of SUVR and the sensitivity and specificity of 18F- DTBZ PET in the differentiating PD, MSA, PSP, and CBD. Statistical analysis was performed using a unpaired t test based on one contrast to test a hypothesis of regional abnormal uptakes of 18F-DTBZ in an individual MSA/PSP/CBD patient compared to a PD group.</description>

    <description>This study will compare the brain uptake of 18F- DTBZ in 40 patients with PD, 40 patients with MSA, 20 patients with CBD, and 20 patients with PSP . Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion criteria according the subject grouping, each subject will have 3 visits in this study. Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.</description>

    <description>During this study, subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of approximately 10 mCi 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ immediately prior to imaging.
The proposed dose for this study is based on our phase I study. At the proposed human dose of 10 mCi, the whole body effective dose (ED) will be approximately 680 mrem. The estimated human ED is expected to be comparable to or below the range of other approved brain imaging agents, such as 18F-FDG.</description>
