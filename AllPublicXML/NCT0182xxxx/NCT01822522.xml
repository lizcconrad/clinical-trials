      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cabozantinib-s-malate in
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment and human immunodeficiency virus.
      Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib (XL184) (cabozantinib-s-malate)
      as a single agent in solid tumor participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      infection and to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between cabozantinib and
      antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV infection.

      II. To investigate the effects of therapy on participant immune status and HIV viral load.

      III. To preliminarily assess objective response rates associated with treatment for commonly
      represented tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal;
             postmenopause is defined as amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months; note: women who have

             infection, including antiretroviral medications, when clinically indicated and should
             be under the care of a physician experienced in HIV management; participants will be
             eligible regardless of antiretroviral medication (including no antiretroviral
             medication) provided there is no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has been
             stable for at least 4 weeks with no intention to change the regimen within 8 weeks
             following study entry; as study-specific (antiretroviral-based) strata fill, however,

             be &gt; 500 ms, two additional electrocardiogram (ECGs) separated by at least 3 minutes
             should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =&lt;
             500 ms, the participant meets eligibility in this regard
