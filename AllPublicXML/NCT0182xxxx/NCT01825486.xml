      Background: Accidental falls result in major physical and psychological morbidity in the
      elderly, especially stroke patients. To get optimal prevention of stroke falls, it is crucial
      to identify independent risk factors from multivariate analysis of related balance and gait
      parameters.

      Aim: To evaluate the effects of balance and gait characteristics in determining whether or
      not accidental falls may happen. To investigate if the balance and gait parameters affect the
      time from lesion to when (and if) patients suffer from falls. To compare differences of
      balance and gait parameters in accidental fall patients between those with severe accidental
      injuries and those without severe injuries.

      Methods: The 2-year observational cohort study will enroll 706 elderly stroke patients, who
      have not had a previous stroke. They will be retrieved from the Inpatient department and
      followed-up regularly in the Outpatient department when they are discharged. All subjects
      will be evaluated at 1 month and 6 months after stroke. These evaluations will include:
      mental, cognition and depression status; lower-limb muscle strength assessed by a dynamometer
      as well as range of motion of joints assessed by a biaxial electro-goniometry; functional
      independence measure; balance and gait pattern will be assessed by both clinical observation
      and objective laboratory examination (a dynamic posturography and computerized gait analysis
      system); falls and fall-related injuries during the proceeding year. Differences in baseline
      characteristics are tested by one-way ANOVA, Mann Whitney U or t tests, if appropriate. The
      investigators will identify the independent risk factors of accidental falls with logistic
      regression and use the log rank statistic of Kaplan-Meier survival curve to differentiate the
      risk of accidental falls or fall-related injuries in different groups.
