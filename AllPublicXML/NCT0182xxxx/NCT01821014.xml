  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Much of the basic general medical care and chronic disease management in rural Honduras comes
      from groups of volunteers setting up temporary clinics run by volunteers. These clinics, also
      known as brigades, or medical missions, are often criticized for their lack of quality and
      the lack of follow-up, both of which stem, in part, from understaffing with volunteer
      physicians. This study is designed to assess if it is feasible, safe, and acceptable to treat
      patients in short-term mobile medical clinics in rural Honduras using US physicians connected
      with patients by videoconference.
