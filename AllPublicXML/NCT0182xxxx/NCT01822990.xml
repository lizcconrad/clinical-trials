  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating anti-beta2-glycoprotein antibodies have been associated with coronary artery
      disease and peripheral arterial disease. This auto-antibodies could activate endothelial
      cells leading to the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and increasing the release of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines.

      On the other hand, endothelial dysfunction of atherosclerotic patients acts as a primary
      pathogenic event, as it occur before structural changes are evident on angiogram or
      ultrasound scan. Loss of endothelial normal function causes vasoconstriction, local
      coagulation alterations and an increase arterial wall proliferation. This situation s been
      attributed to a reduction in nitric oxide bioactivity, and to an increase oxygen-free radical
      formation in the context of the pro-inflammatory status found in atherosclerosis.

      Hypothesis: Circulating Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies could be associated with
      endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide metabolism disruption en patients with peripheral
      arterial disease.

    <description>The titer of circulating anti-endothelial cell antibodies directed against beta2-glycoprotein antigens (Circulating ABGPI) could be detected by indirect immunofluorescence using a diagnosis reagent kit and subjects serum.</description>

    <measure>Flow-mediated arterial dilatation (FMAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>FMAD is an ultrasound test based on the ability of endothelial cells to detect changes in shear stress and is one of the most effective and reliable indirect methods for estimating endothelial dysfunction. The ultrasound transducer is applied proximal to the antecubital fossa, and a longitudinal image of the brachial artery is obtained. The basal arterial diameter is determined. A blood pressure cuff is then placed distal to the measurement area and inflated to a pressure of 250 mmHg for five minutes. New measurements of the arterial diameter in the final diastolic phase should be obtained, 60 seconds after the cuff is deflated</description>

    <measure>Nitrite serum levels</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nitrite serum levels reflects the nitric oxide metabolism. Serum nitrite concentration could be measured by colorimetric analysis using the Griess reaction. This is a chemical reaction which uses sulphanilamide and naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride under acid conditions (phosphoric acid).The system is capable of detecting nitric oxide in a variety of biological and experimental fluids, like human serum samples.</description>
