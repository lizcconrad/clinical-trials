      The present proposal investigates the influence of energy drinks on the blood oxygenation
      concentration of the optic nerve on healthy subjects. On a voluntary basis, 15 subjects, man
      or woman, will be selected to undergo this experiment. Many factors can influence the blood
      oxygenation concentration of the optic nerve, which will be measured also during this
      experiment, namely: Intra ocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, heart rate and systemic
      hemoglobin saturation.

      The subjects will have to be tested twice to test the two conditions of this experiment:

        1. The effect after the intake of a can of Redbull (250 ml)

        2. The difference with the intake of 250 ml of water

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the blood oxygenation concentration of the optic
      nerve varies after having ingested 250 ml of Redbull.

      Our hypothesis are:

        1. The blood oxygenation concentration of the optic nerve measured with OSOME (see detailed
           description below), decreases due to the consumption of the energy drink Redbull
           compared to an equal volume of water.

        2. The IOP measured with iCare tonometer decreases after the consumption of the energy
           drink Redbull compared to an equal volume of water.

        3. The systemic blood pressure, measured with an automatic sphygmomanometer remains
           constant after ingestion of Redbull energy drink or an equal volume of water.

        4. Heart rate, measured with a sphygmomanometer automatic increases after taking a Redbull
           energy drink compared to an equal volume of water.

        5. The rate of systemic hemoglobin saturation measured with a pulse oximeter remains
           constant after the ingestion of a Redbull energy drink or an equal volume of water.

      The blood oxygenation will be assessed using a machine called the OSOME. The online
      spectroreflectometry oxygenation measurement in the eye (OSOME) was used to measure eye
      fundus oxygenation, more precisely optic nerve head capillaries structures oxygenation, by
      full spectrum reflectometry (1020 wavelength from 400 to 700nm) in real time (O.S.O.M.E.,
      Faubert &amp; Diaconu US patent # 5,919,132) with 2% accuracy. It includes a fundus camera
      (Topcon, Osaka, Japan) coupled with a digital video camera (USB) and a detection unit
      composed of a multi-channel spectrograph and a charged coupled device (CCD).

      In order to use this machine, upon arrival, the patient's right eye needs to be dilated with
      drops of proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%, tropicamide 1% and phenylephrine hydrochloride
      2.5%. The patient is required to rest for 20 minutes to allow a complete dilatation of the
      pupil before using the OSOME.
