    <textblock>
      This research study is a phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of a drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer.

      Eribulin is a chemotherapy approved by the US FDA in November of 2010 to treat patients with
      metastatic breast cancer who have received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. It works
      by interfering with cancer cell division, growth and spread.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see how well Eribulin helps
      participants with metastatic breast cancer as a first-line or second-line chemotherapy
      treatment. The investigators also would like to learn about the side-effects that
      participants experience with this medication, in particular, neuropathy.

      Neuropathy is a condition in which the nerves are affected, leading to numbness or tingling
      of the fingers and toes. The investigators would like to study the effect Eribulin has on the
      nerves through regular questionnaires that ask about any nerve-related symptoms. The
      investigators also plan to send blood samples to determine if gene markers may indicate
      increased sensitivity to the nerve effects of Eribulin.

      If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening
      tests and procedures to confirm your eligibility. Many of these tests and procedures are
      likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not
      take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently,
      they may or may not have to be repeated. The screening tests and procedures will include: a
      medical history, a physical examination and vital signs, performance status, an assessment of
      your tumor, routine blood tests, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show
      that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study
      treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate
      in this research.

      If you take part in this research study, you will be given Eribulin by intravenous infusion
      (by vein). The time to complete a single treatment is 60 minutes. You will receive Eribulin
      on Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle. In the third week (Day 15) you will not receive any study
      medication. Each complete treatment cycle lasts 3 weeks.

      During all cycles you will have a physical exam and you will be asked questions about your
      general health and specific questions about any problems that you might be having and any
      medications you may be taking.

      At the beginning of cycles 1,2,3 and every other subsequent cycle, you will be asked to
      complete three online questionnaires using a wireless tablet computer provided in the clinic
      where you are being seen. This is a well established method of administering electronic
      questionnaires. No data will be stored on these computers. The data will be transmitted to
      servers where the data will be securely stored. Your data will be submitted using a special
      identification number. You will be given a username and a password. You will be given
      detailed instructions on how to use the computer and how to enter the data. If the wireless
      tablet computer is not working, paper forms will be provided. It will take about 15-30
      minutes to complete. Some questions you will be asked to answer may make you feel
      uncomfortable. You may choose not to answer any questions that make you feel uncomfortable.

      We will assess your tumor by the appropriate imaging modality (e.g., CT scan or MRI) every 9
      weeks.

      About 4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure blood counts, organ function, and for
      other safety reasons. Blood tests will be done on Day 1 and Day 8 of every treatment cycle
      (every three weeks). One additional tube of blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected at Day
      1 to be used to better understand the nerve toxicities of chemotherapy and to be used for
      future research on breast cancer.

      You will have a follow-up visit three weeks after stopping study treatment. During that
      visit, you will have a physical exam, as well as an assessment of any side effects and
      current medications. If you continue to have on-going side effects related to your study
      treatment, we will continue to follow you until this side effect resolves. About 4
      tablespoons of blood will be drawn to measure blood counts and organ function. If you stop
      therapy because of a side effect but your cancer is under control, we will continue to follow
      you with scans every 9 weeks until cancer growth is observed.
