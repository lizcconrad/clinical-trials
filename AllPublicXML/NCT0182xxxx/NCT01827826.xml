  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 30 million U.S. adults will have type 2 diabetes by 2050. Contributing
      to this national trend is the obesity epidemic. Three randomized trials have demonstrated
      that intensive behavioral interventions can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. The
      purpose of this pilot study is to inform a future randomized, controlled Phase III trial of a
      population-based, telephonic, exercise and weight loss intervention to translate the findings
      of the Diabetes Prevention Program into practice. The telephonic intervention will be
      compared to usual care (30 participants in each group). The investigators will deliver the
      intervention in 12 weekly, 20-minute calls, with four subsequent maintenance calls, for a
      total of 16 calls over 24 weeks. Study outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 12 and 24
      weeks.

      For this planning grant the investigators do not have an overall hypothesis. The
      investigators' goal is to develop and test whether it is possible to do exercise and weight
      loss

    <description>Participants assigned to the intervention group worked with the study interventionist over the phone to reduce their risk for developing Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2. The intervention lasted for 24 weeks, with weekly phone calls for the first 12 weeks and 4 maintenance calls over the second 12 weeks. Study measurements were taken at baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks. After 24 weeks, the investigators randomly divided the intervention group in half. The first group did not receive any more phone calls from the interventionist. The second group continued to receive monthly 20-minute phone calls from the interventionist. At 52 weeks post-baseline participants from both groups had their labs drawn, wore a pedometer for 3 days, and called in with a self-reported weight.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the intervention group received a total of 16 phone calls from the study interventionist over 24 weeks. The first 12 weeks was the intervention phase and calls were made weekly. The second 12 weeks was the maintenance phase and calls were made every 3 weeks. After 24 weeks, the investigators continued to follow this group for 52 weeks post-randomization, allowing half of the group to continue to receive monthly maintenance calls while the other half received no further calls. The study interventionist used behavior modification techniques to encourage intervention group participants to adopt healthy eating and exercise habits so that improvement might be seen in fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, and waist/hip measurements.</description>
