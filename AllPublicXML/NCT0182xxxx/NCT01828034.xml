  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an investigational combination of drugs for bile duct or
      gallbladder cancers. Gemcitabine and cisplatin are two forms of chemotherapy commonly used in
      combination to treat bile duct and gallbladder cancers. The investigators are looking to
      improve treatment results. They will attempt to do so by adding the drug MEK162 to the
      treatment plan. MEK162 acts by blocking a protein called MEK 1/2 which helps cancer cells
      grow and divide. This study will help answer the question of whether MEK162 is a helpful drug
      in patients with bile duct or gallbladder cancers when given with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

    <description>Phase I component of the study, a classic 3+3 cohort dose escalation scheme will be used to identify the MTD of MEK162 when administered with gemcitabine at dose 800 mg/m2 and cisplatin given at dose 20 mg/m2 week 2 &amp; 3 of a 3 week cycle. The final cohort will receive gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 and cisplatin 20mg/m2 week 2 and 3 of a 3 week cycle in combination with MEK162 at the MTD as determined above. In the phase II part of the study, patients will receive MEK162 at the MTD dose plus gemcitabine and cisplatin at the dose level determined acceptable in the phase I portion. In the phase II part of the study, patients will receive MEK162 at 45mg BID plus gemcitabine (800 mg/m2) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2) as determined by the phase I portion.</description>
