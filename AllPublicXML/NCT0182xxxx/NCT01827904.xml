      The objective of this prospective, randomized, double-blind (to subjects, local site's
      blinded assessor and Tremor Core Lab assessors), crossover, multi-site, two-arm study
      (ExAblate treated arm Vs ExAblate Sham treated control arm) is to test the efficacy of
      treatment using the ExAblate Transcranial System and to further demonstrate safety in
      medication-refractory tremor in subjects with essential tremor (ET).

      This study is evaluating a new technique for performing Thalamotomy for tremor control. While
      current techniques have possible invasive or radiation effects, the use of ExAblate if
      totally non-invasive and without any radiation. After informed consent and screening,
      eligible subjects will be randomized to either an ExAblate treatment or an ExAblate Sham or
      &quot;fake&quot; procedure. The chance of randomization to Sham is one out of four. Subjects who are
      randomized to Sham Control will undergo the same procedure and follow-up visits through their
      Month 3 visit. After the Month 3 assessments are complete, all subjects will be unblinded and
      those in the Sham treated group will have the option for an actual ExAblate treatment in an
      unblinded fashion, as long as they still qualify for ExAblate treatment. All subjects will be
      followed at 6 and 12 months and for up to 5 years as directed by their doctor.
