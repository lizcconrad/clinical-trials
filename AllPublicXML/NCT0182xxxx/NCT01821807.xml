      The aim of the study is to observe the rate of postdural puncture headache observed after
      spinal anesthesia in cesarean section patients.

      Two kind of spinal anesthesia needles will be used:

        1. 26 Gauge Quincke (cutting-tip needle)

        2. 26 Gauge Atraucan (atraumatic needle)

      The investigators will observe:

        1. Number of spinal punctures

        2. Time required for the spinal anesthesia procedure

      Patients will be evaluated after 7 days for:

        1. Headache

        2. Backache

      It is a known phenomenon that spinal anesthesia sometimes results in headache.

      The aim of the study is to observe the rate of postdural puncture headache observed after
      spinal anesthesia in cesarean section patients.

      Two kind of spinal anesthesia needles will be used:

        1. 26 Gauge Quincke (cutting-tip needle)

        2. 26 Gauge Atraucan (atraumatic needle)

      We will observe:

        1. Number of spinal punctures

        2. Time required for the spinal anesthesia procedure

      Patients will be evaluated after 7 days for:

        1. Headache

        2. Backache

      2 kind of spinal anesthesia needles will be used, but no comparison will be made. This is an
      observational study. Although literature gives different rates of postdural puncture headache
      for these two needles, we observe the same rate of headache in our clinical practice. We want
      to define the real rate of postdural puncture headache in patients undergoing cesarean
      section with spinal anesthesia.

      <time_frame>The patients were observed over one week period. No other extra observation was made as a routine. The stated adverse events had been reported during that time.</time_frame>
      <desc>One patient had sinus pause, that was observed just few minutes after the local anesthetic application. The second was found to have intracranial epidural hemathoma, that was found on the 1st postoperative day. We have linked it to minor head trauma 3 days before the surgery. The patient had not reported it in the anamnesis prior to the surgery.</desc>
