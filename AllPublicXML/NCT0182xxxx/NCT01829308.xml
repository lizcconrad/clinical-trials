  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the implementation of two evidence-based intervention
      strategies of SBIRT (Generalist vs. Specialist) for adolescent alcohol, tobacco, other drug
      use, and HIV risk behaviors.

    <textblock>
      Guided by Proctor's conceptual model of implementation research, the proposed study is a
      multi-site, cluster randomized trial to compare two principal strategies of SBIRT delivery
      within adolescent medicine. In the Generalist Strategy, the primary care provider delivers
      brief intervention (BI) for substance misuse. In the Specialist Strategy, BIs are delivered
      by behavioral health counselors. The 7 study sites, primary care clinics operated by a large,
      urban Federally Qualified Health Center in Baltimore, will be randomly assigned to implement
      SBIRT for adolescents using either the Generalist or Specialist strategies. Staff at each
      site will be trained in the assigned implementation strategy, and quarterly booster trainings
      will be provided during the implementation period. Implementation outcomes, including:
      penetration, costs/cost-effectiveness, acceptability, timeliness, fidelity/adherence, and
      patient satisfaction will be assessed during the 18-month-long implementation period using a
      complementary combination of administrative service encounter data, provider and patient
      surveys, and qualitative interviews. At the end of the active implementation period, all
      training and technical support activities will cease for 12 months in order to measure
      relative sustainability. The study will also examine the effectiveness of integrating HIV
      risk screening within an SBIRT model.
