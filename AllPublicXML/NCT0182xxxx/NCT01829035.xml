  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, open-labeled, phase III study in patients with advanced
      HCC. A total of 338 patients will be randomized (1:1) into one of the two treatment arms, to
      receive sorafenib with (Arm Combination-treatment; Arm C) or without (Arm Sorafenib alone
      treatment; Arm S) cTACE.

      All the patients will be initially given sorafenib within 72 hours after the randomization.
      Treatment should continue until the criteria for treatment discontinuation are met.

      After the treatment period, patients will undergo follow up for survival every 12 weeks (±7
      days) from the last dose, and the survival follow up will be performed for at least 1.5 years
      after the last patient's last treatment.

      The superiority of the Arm C (cTACE+Sorafenib) over the Arm S (Sorafenib) in the OS period
      will be verified in the ITT set and FAS using a stratified log-rank test. Stratification
      factors consist of mUICC stage (III vs. IV), Vascular invasion (none and Vp1-2 vs. Vp3-4 and
      any other presence), Child-Pugh score (5 vs. 6-7), serum AFP level (≥200 ng/mL vs. &lt;200
      ng/mL). The significance level is 5% (one-sided).

    <description>Concurrent use of the following material/drug is defined as cTACE in this trial.
Embolization material (e.g., gelatin sponges, porous gelatin particles, Ivalon, etc.) other than ethiodized oil
Anti-tumor drug:
Unapproved drug/embolization material from each regulatory agency should not be used.
To chemo-embolize all arteries feeding viable lesions via super selective cTACE, which is more effective and can be recommended as it rarely causes impairment of non-cancerous liver tissues. After assessing the disappearance of tumor stain as much as possible by angiography, the cTACE procedure should be completed</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible to participate in the study, patients must meet the following criteria:

          1. Signed written informed consent

          2. Clinical or histological diagnosis of HCC based on the guidelines of the Korean Liver
             Cancer Study Group and the National Cancer Center Korea

          3. At least one typical enhanced index lesion in the liver that is bi-dimensionally
             measurable by multiphasic spiral CT scan or dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and size of
             largest tumor is 15 cm or less at enrollment.

          4. Tumor conditions confirmed by abdominal imaging (contrast enhanced CT ± MRI) and chest
             imaging (CT) performed within 4 weeks prior to the treatment initiation:

          5. Age of at least 20 years.

          6. ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2.

          7. Child-Pugh class A or B (Child-Pugh score ≤ 7).

          8. Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks.

          9. Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function as assessed by the following
             laboratory requirements (no transfusion, no restoration), conducted within 14 days
             prior to screening:

         10. Female patients at least 1 year postmenopausal, surgically sterile or those of
             childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 14 days prior
             to the first treatment, and have to use at least one medically acceptable and
             effective contraceptive method for the last 2 months prior to Screening Visit: methods
             of effective contraception result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year)
             when used consistently and correctly such as a barrier method (implant, injectable
             contraceptives, oral contraceptives, intrauterine contraceptive device), hormonal IUD,
             sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner.
