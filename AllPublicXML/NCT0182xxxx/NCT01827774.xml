        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in need of transvaginal surgical repair of primary (i.e., de novo) pelvic
             organ prolapse.

          -  POPQ = stage 2 or 3 in the vaginal compartment with the leading edge of prolapse
             (i.e., more severe prolapse)

          -  At least one symptom associated with prolapse (e.g., any of the following including
             but not limited to vaginal bulge, vaginal pain/discomfort, voiding dysfunction, manual
             reduction (digitation) needed for defecation, fecal incontinence, dyspareunia)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  BMI &gt; 40

          -  Not medically fit for transvaginal surgery under general or spinal anesthesia

          -  Active UTI at the time of the index procedure as determined by urine culture

          -  Vaginal atrophy (Note: Patient may be included after vaginal atrophy has been
             effectively treated.)

          -  Prior placement of synthetic mesh or biologic graft for pelvic organ prolapse

          -  A history of cervical, ovarian, uterine, endometrial, vaginal, vulval, colon, rectal
             or bladder cancer

          -  Currently planned obliterative surgical repair for pelvic organ prolapse

          -  Systemic infection at the time of surgery

          -  Requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy, including steroids or cytotoxic agents

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding or planning pregnancy during the study period

          -  Previous diagnosis of collagen disorder (i.e., Marfan's, Ehlers-Danlos)

          -  Physical allergies or cultural objections to the receipt of porcine products

          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 months

          -  Ongoing participation in an investigational device or drug trial

          -  Currently undergoing evaluation or treatment for chronic pelvic pain (e.g., pain as a

             syndrome)

          -  Active vaginal infection at the time of the index procedure
