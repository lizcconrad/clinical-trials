      This research attempts to adapt and optimize a word learning treatment, specifically
      interactive book reading, for use with Kindergarten children with Specific Language
      Impairment (SLI). Children with SLI have difficulty learning language without any obvious
      cause for this difficulty. Two treatment studies will be conducted to determine (1) the
      number of times children with SLI need to hear new words during book reading to learn the new
      words; (2) the best way to provide the target number of exposures to new words during book
      reading. For example, is it better to hear the new words many times within the book and to
      read the book few times, or is it better to hear the new words a few times within the book
      and to read the book many times. The investigators hypothesize that children with SLI will
      need to hear new words 2 to 3 times as often as children with normal language to learn the
      words and that reading the books many times will be more effective than repeating the words
      many times within a book.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7.4% of Kindergarten children.
      Children with SLI are known to have difficulty learning new words, which places them at
      greater risk for future reading impairments and academic failure. Surprisingly, there are few
      interventions for word learning by children with SLI that have undergone rigorous efficacy
      and/or effectiveness testing. The goal of this research is to optimize an interactive book
      reading intervention that has proven to be successful in teaching vocabulary to other groups
      of Kindergarten children.

      This preliminary clinical trial consists of two studies. The first study attempts to identify
      an adequate intensity of the interactive book reading treatment for children with SLI. Here,
      words are randomized to a treatment or no treatment (i.e., test only) condition and children
      are randomized to different intensities of the treatment. Specifically, children will hear
      the treated words either 12, 24, 36, or 48 times during treatment. The second study further
      tests the adequate intensity by comparing two versions of the treatment within the adequate
      intensity. Each child will receive two treatments at the identified adequate intensity.
      Children will be randomized to two treatments. One treatment will be balanced between the
      amount of times the new word is heard within the book and the amount of times the book is
      read. The second treatment will be more heavily weighted for either repetitions within the
      book or the amount of times the book is read. This study will examine how much children with
      different language skills benefit from the adequate intensity. In addition, this study will
      examine how best to achieve the adequate intensity. Specifically, is it better to hear the
      word more often in the session or to read the book more times or to have a balance of both?
      In the treatment condition, words are randomized to more repetitions in the session or to
      more repetitions of reading the same book.

      At the conclusion of this research, an adequate intensity and manner of achieving this
      intensity of interactive book reading will have been identified for children with SLI.
      Moreover, a better understanding of the types of outcomes that can be attained through
      changing intensity and changing the manner of achieving intensity will be gained for this
      treatment and this group of children. This will inform future research on this treatment by
      determining whether a larger study can be initiated or whether the treatment needs further
      refinement to be effective for children with SLI.

    <description>In Study 1, children are randomized to one of four treatment conditions, determining whether they will hear the treated words either 12, 24, 36, or 48 times during treatment. In Study 2, one of the intensities from Study 1 will be tested more extensively by examining how best to achieve the adequate intensity. Specifically, is it better to hear the word more often in the book or to read the book more times? In the treatment condition, words are randomized to more repetitions in the book or to more repetitions of reading the same book to address this question.</description>
