  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family of DNA viruses that is
      capable of infecting humans. HPV infection can cause cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina,
      and anus in women or cancers of the anus and penis in men. Two prophylactic vaccines have
      been proven to be highly effective in preventing the acquisition of HPV infection and the
      genital precancerous lesions caused by it. However, we do not know yet if a previously
      infected individual, once vaccinated, would be less infective to her or his sexual partner.
      We plan to conduct a study, called Transmission Reduction And Prevention with HPV vaccination
      (TRAP-HPV) study to answer this question. It will include 500 sexually active couples (total
      of 1000 individuals) in university student health clinics in Montreal (age 18-45 years). It
      will be a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blinded intervention trial. Study
      participants will be followed up to 12 months. Behavioural and biological data will be
      collected at the time of study enrolment, then at months 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 post-enrolment.
      The results of this trial will be invaluable in informing policies regarding vaccination of
      women and men.

    <textblock>
      Two prophylactic vaccines (Gardasil by Merck, and Cervarix by GlaxoSmithKline) have been
      proven in randomized controlled trials (RCT) to be highly effective in preventing infection
      against the target HPV types (HPV-6, 11, 16 and18, for Gardasil, and HPV-16/18, for Cervarix)
      and the cervical precancerous lesions caused by them. These vaccines have shifted the
      paradigm of prevention and are expected to have a major impact in reducing the burden of
      cervical cancer and of other HPV-associated malignancies, such as vulvar, vaginal, penile,
      anal, and oropharyngeal cancers, as well as benign HPV-associated conditions (in the case of
      Gardasil), such as anogenital warts and respiratory papillomatosis. However, little is known
      about the extent with which vaccination may reduce transmission between sexual partners; i.e.
      much remains to be understood on the effects of HPV vaccine in preventing transmission of
      target HPV types to sexual partners of vaccinated individuals and its impact on herd
      immunity.

      The investigators propose to conduct a placebo-controlled, double-blinded RCT to measure the
      impact of vaccination in preventing HPV transmission within young (age 18-45) heterosexual
      couples at McGill and Concordia Universities in Montreal, Canada. Individual partners in 500
      couples will be randomized to a treatment (Gardasil 9) or a control vaccine (Havrix, a
      hepatitis A vaccine). This control vaccine provides a similar health benefit incentive as HPV
      vaccination while preserving the scientific cogency of a &quot;placebo&quot; comparator. Risk factor
      data will be collected via computerized questionnaires at enrolment (time 0), 2, 4, 6, 9 and
      12 months. At all time points, the investigators will measure HPV DNA infection status by PCR
      in both partners in exfoliated penile, and oral samples from men and vaginal, oral samples
      from women. Assessing pre-enrolment humoral immune response to HPV infection with a
      competitive Luminex immunoassay (CLIA) will be done in an enrolment blood sample from all
      study participants.

      The primary outcome will be the reduction of HPV DNA positivity for the target HPV vaccine
      types (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) in multiple anatomic sites in Havrix-treated sexual partners
      of participants who received Gardasil 9. The investigators hypothesize that HPV vaccination
      is effective in reducing the risk of HPV transmission to their sexual partners. They will use
      the Kaplan-Meier technique and logrank tests to compare the cumulative probability of HPV
      infection in sexual partners of vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals against follow-up
      time, and Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the effect of vaccination and other
      covariates on transmission of HPV to sexual partners. Statistical analyses will follow an
      intention-to-treat approach but additional regression models will examine the role of several
      candidate determinants in mediating transmission and the protective effects. Mixed-effects
      models will also be used to take advantage of the repeated measurements across visits, HPV
      types, and anatomical sites for the same subject.

      In addition to the findings on protection to unvaccinated partners, it is expected that this
      study will provide valuable insights as to whether protection may exist for a vaccine
      recipient in preventing infection in an anatomical site in which a target type has not yet
      established infection. These findings will generate key parameter data to inform the extent
      of herd immunity in cost-effectiveness models of HPV vaccination. Such models are essential
      to arrive at rational science-driven policies of HPV vaccination in girls and boys in Canada.

    <description>Reduction in HPV type concordance (for the four target types) will be the main outcome evaluable as per the above group contrasts. These comparisons will be done with due attention to the enrolment virological status of the individuals. For instance, it is expected that a Havrix-treated woman who is positive for HPV 6 in the anal specimen but negative for this type in the vaginal specimen may derive benefit if her partner receives Gardasil, even if he is HPV-6 positive in the penile sample. The assumption is that protection via vaccination is pan-mucosal, via transudation of neutralizing antibodies; this protection may mediate transmission.</description>

    <description>HPV vaccine intervention: The intervention vaccine will be Gardasil 9, a 9-valent vaccine by Merck. This vaccine was chosen because it allows for the observation of 9 HPV outcomes (HPV 6, 11, 16 and18) (the other available vaccine, Cervarix, protects against HPVs 16 and 18, only).</description>

    <description>The placebo comparator will be Havrix, by GSK. This control vaccine was chosen because hepatitis A immunization provides a similar health prevention incentive as HPV vaccination to study participants while preserving the scientific cogency of a &quot;placebo&quot; comparator. Gardasil 9 requires administration of 3 doses, while Havrix only requires 2 doses. For this reason, a placebo injection (saline solution) will be added in between the Havrix vaccination regimen. Consequently, both treatment and control vaccines will have similar regimens, i.e., study entry, 2 months, and 6 months.</description>
