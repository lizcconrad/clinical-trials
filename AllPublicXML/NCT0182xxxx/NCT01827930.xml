  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Imatinib Mesylate at a dose of 400 mg / day is the standard treatment for patients with
      CML-CP. Recent studies show that the quality of response rate (complete cytogenetic response
      and major molecular response rate) is dependent on the residual plasma Imatinib.

      The Imatinib Mesylate at a dose of 400 mg / day is the standard treatment for patients with
      CML-CP. Recent studies show that the quality of response rate (complete cytogenetic response
      and major molecular response rate) is dependent on the residual plasma Imatinib. This study
      aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a strategy for dose adjustment of Imatinib Mesylate
      based on the measurement of the residual plasma imatinib in patients treated for at least 2
      years Imatinib 400 mg / d in complete cytogenetic response for at least 1 year.
