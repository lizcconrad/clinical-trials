      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of LY3045697 after
      multiple doses and to determine how long LY3045697 remains in the body. Each participant is
      expected to complete 3 dosing periods. At least 7 days will pass between dosing periods.

          -  Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 60 days prior to drug

             the judgment of the investigator, indicates a medical problem that would preclude
             study participation

          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study, such as

             45 mL of distilled spirits]

          -  Have an abnormal blood pressure (supine) defined as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;95
