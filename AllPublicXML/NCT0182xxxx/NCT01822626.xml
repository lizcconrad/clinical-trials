  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialised world.
      Evidence is growing that early life nutrition can play a role in behavioural and cognitive
      problems in children and adolescents and is well documented that being overweight and obese
      during childhood can have short- and long-term physical and psycho-social health
      implications.

      This is an individually randomised trial to evaluate the efficacy of a family
      pediatrician-lead counselling intervention in reducing the BMI of over-weight children aged
      4-7 years old. As secondary objectives the investigators evaluate the effect of the
      counselling on dietary behaviours and physical activity.

      The investigators targeted the intervention to overweight children, while obese children were
      referred to specialised care. The counselling targeted diet, physical activity, and sedentary
      behaviours.

    <description>A family pediatrician-lead counselling was offered to children assigned to the intervention group. The counselling program consisted of 5 motivational interviews based on Stages of Change Theory. Child and family always had to leave the meeting having agreed two objectives, one concerning food and one physical activity improvements, clearly defined and achievable. During each subsequent interview was assessed the degree of achievement of the objectives of the previous meeting. Based on the assessment the objective could be reinforced or redefined. After each change the objectives were recorded.</description>
