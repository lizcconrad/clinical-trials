    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin is safe and effective in the
      treatment of weight or weight gain in young people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) who
      are currently taking atypical antipsychotic medication.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site randomized trial to evaluate oral
      fixed dose metformin (RiometÂ®) in decreasing weight or weight gain in children ages 6-17
      years, 4 months with ASD who are currently taking atypical antipsychotic medication. A
      16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of metformin with dose guided by
      age will be conducted. A secondary study aim will be to assess the long-term safety and
      efficacy of metformin by conducting a 16-week open label continuation.

             antipsychotic therapy(going back as far as prior 12 months); or, if BMI is greater or
             equal to 85th percentile corrected for age and sex, then a greater than 5% body weight
             increase per year (prorated at greater than 5% body weight increase if medicated for
             longer than a year).

          4. Age 6 years to 17 years, 4 months.

          3. History of liver disease, renal impairment, congestive heart failure, pernicious
             anemia, any other condition increasing the risk for lactic acidosis, or any serious
             medical illness requiring treatment.

          4. Use of cationic drugs excreted by the kidneys.

          5. Planned surgery or procedure requiring contrast.

          6. Pregnant at screening contact.

          7. On other psychotropic concomitant medications for less than 2 months.

          8. Treatment or planned treatment with concomitant medications with unacceptable
             interactions with metformin, including topiramate, levetiracetam, beta blockers,
             angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, or histamine H2 receptor
             antagonists.

          9. Unable to tolerate blood work.

         10. Current use of medication for target symptoms of appetite or weight loss.

         11. Planned change of medication, medication dose, or behavioral treatment targeting
             weight loss during the study period.
