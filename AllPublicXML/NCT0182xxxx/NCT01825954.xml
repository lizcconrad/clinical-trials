    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of a noninvasive cortical
      electrostimulation therapy known as &quot;Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical
      Electrostimulation&quot; (RINCE) in the management of fibromyalgia. Patients who meet the 1990
      American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia will receive up to 24 RINCE
      treatments delivered by a medical device called &quot;NeuroPoint&quot;. Approximately 45 fibromyalgia
      patients will be randomized into one of three study groups. One of these groups will receive
      sham treatment, meaning they will receive no treatment at all, while the remaining two groups
      will receive different amounts of RINCE therapy. The study's primary outcome measure will be
      the patient's change from baseline in self-reported 24-hour average pain intensity. The
      study's hypothesis is that there will be a difference between treatment groups in primary
      outcome measure.
