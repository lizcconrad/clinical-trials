  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain, the great concern for the patients undergoing spine surgery, has led to
      common use of opioid-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) postoperatively.
      Opioid-based IV-PCA offers better pain control, which could facilitate early recovery,
      rehabilitation and increase patient satisfaction. However, its use inevitably increases the
      incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), another great discomfort, as high as
      80% in patients with multiple risk factors.Therefore, there have been consistent efforts to
      prevent PONV with multimodal therapies such as risk stratification, modification and
      preventive use of antiemetics.

      Of all antiemetics, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) antagonist, especially ondansetron, is most
      commonly used and extensively studied to reduce PONV because of its efficacy and fewer side
      effects.[8] However, its efficacy is not quite satisfactory when it comes to PONV associated
      with opioid-based IV-PCA. Recently, there are many reports comparing the antiemetic efficacy
      between ondansetron and the 2 newly developed 5-HT3 antagonists, ramosetron and palonosetron.
      Ramosetron is known to have a higher affinity and longer duration of binding to 5-HT3
      receptor, therefore exhibits potent and sustained anti-emetic effect than previously
      developed 5-HT3 antagonists.Palonosetron has a unique allosteric binding to the 5-HT3
      receptor, which brings a higher affinity, longer duration of action and longer elimination
      half-time.According to the previous studies, both ramosetron and palonosetron showed superior
      antiemetic efficacy for PONV associated with opioid-based IV-PCA to ondansetron as expected
      by their theoretical advantages. However, it has never been evaluated which one has superior
      antiemetic efficacy for opioid-based IV-PCA associated PONV. Therefore, in this study, we
      tried to evaluate the relative antiemetic efficacy of ramosetron and palonosetron in
      controlling opioid-based IV-PCA related PONV.
