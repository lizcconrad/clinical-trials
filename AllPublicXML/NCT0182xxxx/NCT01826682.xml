  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic condition. Its evolution can be
      aggravated in some periods by an increase of the symptoms (above all the cough, the dyspnoea
      and the quantity of sputum purulence). This is known as exacerbation and it is the most
      frequent cause of hospital stay, urgences services and death in COPD. A physiotherapy program
      is carrying out in patients attending to the Hospital because of an exacerbation.

      The hypothesis of this study is that a physiotherapy program added to a medical treatment
      increase the ventilatory function, the physiques variables, decrease depression and anxiety
      and improve the quality of life. Additionally, it is going to be assessed the effect of
      physiotherapy in time using phone calls and visits to the patient's home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits added to the respiratory physiotherapy and physical activity have been evidenced
      previously in the treatment of COPD. This justify the need of a short physiotherapy
      intervention program regarding to the hospital stay in exacerbation of COPD and a follow-up
      after the hospital stay.

      4% of europeans have been reported to have medical intervention caused by respiratory
      exacerbation. 20% of these patients are patients with COPD. The mortality of COPD
      exacerbation is about 14% and 30% if mechanical ventilation is needed.

      In order to that, it is very important to improve the quality of life and the recuperation of
      patients. It is relevant to mention the the high cost associated to this condition.

    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention during hospital stay in lower and upper limbs strength. The quadriceps and the hand-grip strength is assessed using a dynamometer with a standard protocol allowing three attempts on each side. During each measurement, patients were sitting with their shoulder adducted and elbow flexed to 90°. The maximum value achieved was used in the analyses. This is important in order to quantify the increase of strength Kg/cm2 The test 2-minute step in place is also going to be used for this purpose, counting the times the patients go up the right knees in two minutes.</description>

    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention in respiratory parameters using a spirometer as recommended by the American Thoracic Society. The most important respiratory parameters evaluated are forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO2) and oxygen partial pressure (PO2)</description>
