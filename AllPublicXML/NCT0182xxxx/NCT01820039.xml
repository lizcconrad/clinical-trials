      Objectives The investigators present an online application to empower and inform patients and
      improve guideline adherence in unexplained subfertility. Thereby the investigators expect to
      reduce overtreatment in fertility care with higher quality of care.

      Methods The investigators conduct a prospective cohort study including couples with a
      diagnosis of unexplained subfertility. Couples consulting their general practitioner with an
      unfulfilled child wish will be offered to use FertiScreen. FertiScreen is an online
      application, in which patients are asked questions about their fertility problem (ie
      menstrual cycle, age, duration of child wish and the results of the Chlamydia Trachomatis
      antibody titre and semen analysis). FertiScreen then uses the validated prediction model of
      Hunault to calculate couples' chance of natural conception during the next twelve months. In
      addition, patients can find links to extra information concerning subfertility. Couples can
      then initiate an online consultation with their general practitioner and a gynaecologist, in
      order to discuss their results and prognosis. When the calculated prognosis of spontaneous
      conception within one year is &gt;30%, tailored expectant management for 6-12 months will be
      advised, as no benefit can be expected from fertility treatment.

      Questionnaires will be sent to patients as well as to their caregivers (general practitioner,
      gynaecologist). These questionnaires will focus on the use of FertiScreen (System Usability
      Scale) and the different domains of quality of care (effectiveness, cost-effectiveness,
      safety, patient-centredness). For the latter, the investigators use the Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale and the Patient Centredness Questionnaire for Infertility.

      In order to be able to draw conclusions, the investigators will conduct a baseline
      measurement among couples with unexplained subfertility who have been referred to a fertility
      clinic. Their data will be abstracted from their medical records and they will receive the
      aforementioned questionnaires as well (except for the System Usability Scale).

      The investigators will recruit couples presenting to general practitioners in the Nijmegen
      area (which for second line treatment consists of one general hospital and one academic
      hospital). To detect an increase in guideline adherence of the current 60% to 75% with a
      power of 80% (P&lt;0,05), the investigators need to include 152 couples in the before as well as
      in the after measurement.
