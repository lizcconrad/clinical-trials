      The primary objective is to evaluate the impact on heart failure related quality of life when
      integrating a mobile health system, Verizon Wireless's Converged Health Management (CHM),
      into a subject's self-management of their heart failure (HF) as well as in the medical
      management of HF by the subjects' clinical team.
