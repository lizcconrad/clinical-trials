      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the timing and magnitude of improvements to red
      blood cell health associated with consumption of Jobelyn™.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From past history, case studies in Nigeria, as well as testimonials from all over the world,
      have shown a robust increase in hemoglobin within a few weeks in people with serious cases of
      anemia present under disease conditions such as sickle cell, Malaria, HIV, or cancer. In
      parallel, improvements in red blood cell health were also seen in many healthy people with
      general low blood counts due to undetermined factors.

      A clinical study on anemia is currently ongoing in Nigeria. The study population is focused
      on women and aims at evaluating whether Jobelyn™ consumption can help increase hemoglobin and
      thus reduce risk factors associated with gynecological surgery in a Nigerian cohort of
      gynecological patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01670955).

      As a parallel to the ongoing study in Nigeria, this study protocol will help to
      systematically examine the effects of Jobelyn™ on anemic conditions in an otherwise healthy
      North American population, and help document the speed and magnitude of improvements in a
      population without concomitant infections or sickle cell anemia.

      Twenty-four human subjects of both genders will be tested over a period of 8 weeks. Both
      genders may enroll in the study, but we expect more women to be eligible, due to effects of
      menses and prolonged consumption of birth control pills. Recruiting of volunteers will happen
      via NIS Labs. A screening blood draw will be used for CBC/differential and the hemoglobin
      level help determine eligibility.

      Enrolled subjects will randomized to consume placebo or Jobelyn™ for 8 weeks, during which
      time subjects are monitored at baseline, and after 3 days, 7 days, and 2, 4, and 8 weeks. A
      fasting blood sample will be taken at each visit, and used for hemoglobin and fasting glucose
      measurements.
