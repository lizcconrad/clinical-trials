  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate wether the use of the Stortz video laryngoscope
      will render in shorter time for the intubation of obese patients compared with the use of a
      conventional Macintosh laryngoscope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese patients are prone to develop desaturation soon after initiation of anaesthesia
      compared to patients of normal body weight. It is therefore important to keep the time from
      when spontaneous breathing to when the airway is secured with a orotracheal tube as short as
      possible. We will therefore investigate if it is possible to shorten this time by using a
      Stortz videolaryngoscope.

      Patients 18-60 years with ASA grade 1-3 and BMI &lt; 35 that turn up for planned surgery that
      demands the use of orotracheal tubing and controlled ventilation will be randomly and
      consecutively enrolled in either of two groups. Patients in both groups will be anaesthetised
      with the same combination of drugs using Propofol and Remifentanyl or Fentanyl for induction
      of sleep, combined with Rocuronium for muscle relaxation.

      After the induction and relaxation the intubation will be facilitated using either of two
      laryngoscopes. In the first group a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope, and in the second
      group a Stortz videolaryngoscope will be used. The time to intubation is defined as the time
      from grabbing the laryngoscope to when the tube has been inserted and end-tidal carbon
      dioxide appears on the monitor. Our hypothesis is that we will be able to achieve a faster
      intubation with the use of videolaryngoscope.
