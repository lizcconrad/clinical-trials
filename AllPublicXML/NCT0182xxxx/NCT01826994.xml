  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Thoracic complaints, possibly due to a cardiac ischemic cause are a diagnostic challenge in
      general practice. When an underlying ischemic cardiac condition (AMI (acute myocardial
      infarction), UAP (unstable angina pectoris)) is considered, referral from general
      practitioner (GP) to a cardiologist has to take place. However, cardiac analysis in 80% of
      referred patients is negative. To optimize referral decisions of GPs, new and fast
      diagnostics are needed.

      Objective:

      To assess the incremental diagnostic value for AMI of a novel rapid PoC H-FABP-test in
      addition to history taking and physical examination in patients presenting in daily general
      practice with possible AMI. In addition the cost-effectiveness of the test will be evaluated.

      Study design:

      Delayed type cross-sectional diagnostic study.

      Study population:

      Patients presenting to the GP with any new-onset chest complaint, at time of presentation not
      lasting for more than 24 hours, that is considered to be of possible cardiac origin by the
      GP.

      Intervention:

      Point of care Heart Type Fatty Acid Binding Protein test (PoC H-FABP-test), added to usual
      care. PoC H-FABP-testing, by qualitatively measuring H-FABP in one single drop of blood
      obtained by finger prick, is added to normal procedures of consultation and referral decision
      by the GP.

      Main study parameters / endpoints:

      Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of point of care
      H-FABP-testing for AMI, alone as well as part of a clinical diagnostic algorithm, in patients
      with thoracic complaints in general practice. All outcome measures, based on using an
      algorithm and/or point of care H-FABP-testing, will be compared to regular diagnostic
      assessment by the GP without using an algorithm and/or point of care H-FABP-testing.
      Therefore, incremental value of H-FABP-testing and/or a diagnostic algorithm is measured.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      Individual participants will experience low risk, since study participation comprehends
      regular care except for an extra finger prick and possibly collection of one extra venous
      blood sample. For this low amount of disadvantage, the participant will experience no
      advantage either. However, results of the study will possibly be useful for similar patients
      in future.

    <description>An economic evaluation by means of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be performed. This evaluation will be performed by determination of the ratio between the difference in costs and the difference in benefits between the two strategies that are observed in this study, being the usual reference policy of the general practitioner and the reference policy that could be created when a determined algorithm combined with point of care heart type fatty acid binding protein testing would be used.</description>
