  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether decay causing bacteria are reduced when
      adhesive xylitol disks are used intraorally three times a day for two weeks in adults with
      dry mouth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Xylitol,an FDA approved sugar substitute, has been shown to reduce tooth decay. Patients who
      experience dry mouth may be more susceptible to dental decay because they lack the protection
      provided by an adequate flow of saliva. These patients are likely to have high levels of the
      decay causing bacteria, mutans streptococci.

      The purpose of this research is to test the ability of a novel xylitol delivery vehicle to
      reduce mutans streptococci in patients with dry mouth over a two week period. The delivery
      vehicle is a slowly dissolving xylitol disk (lozenge) that adheres to soft tissues inside the
      mouth. Participants will place disks on both sides of the mouth three times a day.

    <description>Daily use of 8 disks containing 0.5 grams xylitol each for two weeks. The disks adhere to gum tissue with a food grade adhesive backing and slowly dissolve. The disks are applied one on each side of the mouth in the morning after breakfast, again at midday, and four are applied, two on each side, at bedtime.</description>
