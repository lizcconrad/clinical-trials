  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine if margetuximab is effective in the treatment of
      certain patients with relapsed or refractory advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the pivotal study that established that Herceptin® was highly effective when added to
      standard chemotherapy in the front-line treatment of women with HER2 positive metastatic
      breast cancer, benefit appeared to accrue to those patients whose tumors expressed the HER2
      oncoprotein at the 3+ level by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or those patients whose tumors
      demonstrated evidence of HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      testing. Similarly, when Herceptin® was used as a single therapy in women with metastatic
      breast cancer that had progressed following cytotoxic chemotherapy, 3+ overexpression of
      HER2, but not 2+ expression, was associated with response to treatment. These and other
      studies have led to the recommendation that Herceptin® should be administered to patients
      with breast cancer whose tumors exhibit 3+ overexpression or gene amplification. This study
      will evaluate whether treatment of patients with tumors that would not be expected to respond
      to Herceptin® therapy, namely those that lack HER2 gene amplification and express the
      oncoprotein at the 2+ level by IHC, may benefit from the use of the anti-HER2 monoclonal
      antibody, MGAH22. If 5 or more responses are seen in 41 evaluable patients, then further
      clinical development of margetuximab will be justified.

    <description>Response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria based on Cycle 2, Day 21 computed tomography (CT) scans. This study will employ a Simon two-stage optimum design in which an initial cohort of 21 patients will be treated with margetuximab. If two or more responses (partial or complete response) are seen at the first tumor re-evaluation on day 21 of Cycle 2, the study will be expanded to include up to 41 patients (20 additional patients in Cohort 2, the second stage of the study) in order to determine whether further development of the drug is warranted (5 or more responses in 41 evaluable patients).</description>
