  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant ureteral obstruction often necessitates chronic urinary diversion and is associated
      with high rates of failure with traditional double-J ureteral stents. To overcome drawbacks
      of the double-J stent, recently, metallic stents have been used to manage for palliative
      treatment in patients with ureteral obstruction associated with end stage malignant disease.
      The success rates of metallic stents have been reported to be high and the method proved to
      be useful in patients with malignant ureteral obstruction. In addition, covered metallic
      stents have many advantages compared with bare metallic stents, such as lower rate of tissue
      invasion and higher patency rate. However, there is little investigation about comparison of
      clinical efficacy between covered-metallic stents and double-J stents in malignant ureteral
      obstruction.

      Therefore, investigators plan to perform a prospective randomized study to compare clinical
      efficacy of silicone-covered metallic ureteral stent and double-J ureteral stent in patients
      with malignant ureteral obstruction.
