  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn whether perioperative IV (intravenous) administration of
      acetaminophen (commonly referred to as Tylenol) shows any different clinical outcomes over
      the oral (by mouth) administration of acetaminophen for a patient having a laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. If improved pain scores occur with the administration of IV acetaminophen,
      it may result in fewer requests for pain-related intervention such as other oral pain
      medications.
