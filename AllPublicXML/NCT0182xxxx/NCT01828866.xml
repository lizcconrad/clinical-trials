  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One interesting approach to the treatment of addiction is the use of Eye Movement
      Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) (Shapiro, 1989). Although research on the feasibility
      and efficacy of EMDR on addiction is limited and often lacks methodological rigor, the
      results are promising and suggest that further research on this subject is warranted.

      This proposal consists of two studies to test and determine the acceptability, feasibility
      and efficacy of EMDR as an intervention to reduce craving and alcohol use in alcohol
      dependent outpatients as well as to gain further understanding in underlying working
      mechanisms.

             two weeks before baseline screening) of drugs other than alcohol or nicotine (relative
             exclusion: decision on case-by-case basis whether it leads to therapy-interference);

          -  Meeting the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria for current (in
             the last two weeks before baseline screening) regular alcohol use (at least &gt; 21E
             (women) or &gt; 28E (men) per week) (relative exclusion: decision on case-by-case basis)
             (relative exclusion: decision on case-by-case basis whether it leads to

             post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD);

          -  Severe, current (since the start of regular treatment) psychiatric symptoms
             (especially manic, psychotic, suicidal and aggressive symptoms) that may endanger
