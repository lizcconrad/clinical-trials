  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to compare the change in z-scores for growth during a
      120-day study period in children with picky eating behaviors who were randomly assigned to
      receive nutrition counseling only (control group) or nutrition counseling plus an oral
      milk-based nutritional supplement (study group). The secondary objectives of the study were
      to compare the following between the control and study groups: a) dietary macro- and
      micro-nutrient intakes; b) quantitative ultrasound bone measurements of radius and tibia; and
      c) incidence of common illnesses (diarrhea, upper and lower respiratory tract). The safety
      objective of the study was to compare the frequency of adverse events (AE) among the control
      group and study group subjects.
