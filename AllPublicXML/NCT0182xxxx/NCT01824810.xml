  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is being conducted to provide proof of concept for three recently developed
      needling treatments, in the treatment of whiplash associated disorder type 2 (WAD-II). The
      investigators aim to show that these techniques should be considered as regular, effective
      options for people suffering from WAD-II. These techniques are Intramuscular stimulation
      (IMS), neural prolotherapy (NPT), and myoActivation (mA).

      Additionally, the investigators plan to begin profiling responders and non-responders in an
      effort to identify which treatment is likely to work best for different people. In the
      future, this may help to expedite treatment for WAD-II, helping patients get the most
      appropriate treatment, more quickly.

      The investigators expect to show that all three treatments are significantly better than a
      placebo treatment, and to collect information on what makes each technique more or less
      likely to work for individual cases.

    <textblock>
      Evidence shows that people who do not recover from whiplash symptoms within the acute phase
      (3 months post-injury) may continue to have neck pain and disability years later. The
      investigators hope to show that these novel treatments offer long-lasting improvement in
      chronic whiplash symptoms long after the acute phase has passed and other more traditional
      treatments (standard physiotherapy, massage, etc) fail.

      Each of these needling techniques has small bodies of research, anecdotal evidence, and/or
      patient feedback to support its use. All are currently used in clinical practice throughout
      British Columbia for the treatment of many types of chronic pain symptoms. However, because
      they are quite new, many clinicians and insurance companies are resistant to them and will
      not recommend them to clients/patients, or they may only suggest these treatments as a last
      resort. Studies like this one are needed to provide concrete evidence of the efficacy of
      these treatments and increase their use.

      The objective of this project is to show proof of concept - all three needling techniques are
      valid and not because of a placebo effect. The investigators plan to use results from this
      study to support efforts to secure funding for large-scale, adequately powered studies. Our
      long-term objective is to make these types of treatments more readily available to those who
      need more than traditional therapies currently offer.

      Secondary objectives are to show relationships between pain and our secondary measures
      (function, depression, anxiety). The investigators plan to begin profiling patients who are
      more or less likely to respond to each type of needling treatment. This profiling will help
      identify people most likely to benefit from each treatment and to get patients the best
      treatment, sooner.

      This is a double-blind, randomized control trial. The person evaluating change in
      participants will not know what treatment the participant has received. Additionally, the
      patient will not know if they are in a treatment or a placebo group (though they may be able
      to use a process of elimination to determine what treatments they are NOT getting, but that
      is acceptable and unavoidable). Once volunteers have been confirmed as eligible, they will be
      randomly assigned to one of four groups - three treatment groups or the control group. The
      investigators will be assessing pain levels (and several secondary outcome measures) at three
      timepoints: pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-months post-treatment. At each timepoint,
      our primary and secondary outcome measures will be evaluated, and a number of general
      questions will be asked.

      the investigators hope to show that these three techniques, though somewhat novel and not yet
      well-supported in the literature, are all effective in treating WAD-II. Additionally, the
      investigators hope to show that these effects are long-lasting and provide pilot data that
      these treatments reduce the need to access other types of treatments and reduce the need for
      medications.

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Intramuscular Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Intramuscular Stimulation is the insertion of fine, flexible needles into shortened muscle tissue. No substance is injected. In shortened or supersensitive muscles, stimulation of stretch receptors in the muscle causes a lengthening response in the affected tissue. This reflex response is felt by the patient as a cramping sensation which releases as the muscle returns to a normal length. Needles may be inserted and removed immediately or inserted and left in the tissue for several minutes. Practitioners may also use the approach of &quot;twirling&quot; the needles to enhance the grasping response in the muscle.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>myoActivation</intervention_name>
    <description>In myoActivation treatments, a fine needle is used to administer a micro-injection (less than .2 mL) of saline (0.9%) targeted to muscle, fascia, connective tissue, and scar tissue. The needle is inserted into shortened muscle tissue to elicit a reflex response that lengthens the tissue and promotes a healing response. One session includes between 10 and 80 needle insertions, and is a combination of deep and shallow needling techniques. Additionally, the practitioner treats superficial fascia and scar tissue by using multiple shallow needle insertions to a scarred area and/or areas of abnormal elevation and depression in the skin.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Neural Prolotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants in the neural prolotherapy group will receive micro-injections of a dextrose or mannitol solution directly under the skin using a very fine needle. This treatment targets the superficial cutaneous nerves. It is suggested that these injections quickly reduce cutaneous nerve edema, allowing these nerves to freely cross the fascia to reach the skin. Treatments may include up to 200 micro-injections with a fine needle. Injections follow major nerve routes associated with neck and upper back pain.</description>

    <description>The sham needling control group will receive up to 5 needle insertions in areas unrelated directly to whiplash pain. No injection will be given though participants in this group will not be aware of the presence or absence of a substance injection. Sham treatments will take anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes, to preserve blindness.</description>
