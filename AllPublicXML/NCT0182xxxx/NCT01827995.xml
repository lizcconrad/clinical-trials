  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that around 50 000 women die every year due to consequences of unsafe
      abortion (Singh et al, 2009). A majority of these deaths occur in low-income countries where
      access to safe abortion care is limited. Unplanned pregnancy and unsafe abortion thus place a
      huge burden on scarce medical resources. Any improvement in Comprehensive Abortion Care (CAC)
      would mean important improvements for the concerned women and their families (Singh, 2006) as
      well as for the societies at large. Recommended improvements concern increased access to the
      safest and most cost-effective methods such as medical abortion provided at primary level
      facilities (Singh et al, 2009). A Cochrane Review concludes that most randomised controlled
      trials within the field of medical abortion are conducted in high-income settings with good
      access to emergency health care services (Kulier et al, 2004). A simplified regime for
      medical abortion, which could be used at primary level facilities, would contribute to the
      reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity related to unsafe abortions globally. However,
      there is a knowledge gap in order to determine if a simplified follow up of medical abortion
      is equally effective as the standard procedure in a low-income setting. The results will
      provide evidence-based information to be used in revising training and service delivery
      guidelines' in order to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity in both low and high-income
      setting.

    <description>Intervention group: Simplified followup Mifepristone at outpatient clinic, followed by the administration of misoprostol 24-48 hours later (in the clinic or at home). The women will not return to the clinic for routine follow up visit, but are given instructions on how to use a checklist and a low sensitivity pregnancy test around day 10-14. They are asked only to return if they have any health problems or screen positively. The low sensitivity urinary-hCG (with HCG of 1000 IU/ml) test will be used. Women will be provided the pregnancy test free of cost along with a pictorial checklist. A research assistant or a nurse will explain in detail how to use the pregnancy test as well as the checklist, and provide phone numbers in case of any questions or doubts. Follow-up interviews will be conducted through home visits or phone (if woman has one) during the next 1-2 days to screen for on-going pregnancies and assess acceptability the self-assessment.</description>
