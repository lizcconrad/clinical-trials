  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation followed by dose expansion study of TL32711 in combination with
      5-Azacitidine in subjects with Myelodysplastic syndrome who are naïve, have relapsed or have
      failed prior 5-azacitidine therapy. Pre-clinical and mechanistic studies support that
      5-Azacitidine may modulate pathways that enable birinapant-mediated anti-tumor activity.

      This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, non-randomized study in male and female subjects with MDS
      who are naïve, refractory or have relapsed to 5-Azacitidine therapy.

      Primary Objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose,
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of birinapant (TL32711) when administered in combination with
      5-azacitidine (5 AZA) in subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are naïve,
      refractory or have relapsed to 5-AZA therapy.

      Secondary Objectives are to determine the clinical activity using the International Working
      Group (IWG) (Cheson, 2006) Response Criteria for MDS during the Phase 1b dose escalation
      stage of the study and in the Phase 2a expansion cohort, to determine the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of birinapant when administered with 5-AZA in plasma and to assess exploratory
      translational biomarkers of anti-tumor activity of birinapant in combination therapy.

          -  Subjects with high-risk MDS who are naïve to 5-Azacitidine or have previously received
             5-AZA or decitabine as first-line cytotoxic therapy. Subjects with prior 5-Azacitidine
             therapy were evaluated to be either refractory or relapsed as determined by the
             Investigator, according to IWG response criteria.Subjects with relapsed or refractory
             disease may have only received prior 5-Azacitidine or decitabine.

          -  Hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease can be used up to 24 hours
             prior to therapy but not concomitantly with 5-Azacitidine.

          -  Adequate liver, pancreatic and renal function.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             within 48 hours prior to the first dose

          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of adequate contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with life-threatening toxicity or non tolerability to prior 5-Azacitidine
             therapy.

          -  Subjects with hypoplastic Myelodysplastic syndrome.

          -  Impaired cardiac function, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias despite medications,

          -  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTcB) more than 480 msec

          -  Lack of recovery of prior adverse events to Grade ≤1 severity (National Cancer
             Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4) (except alopecia)
             due to therapy administered prior to the initiation of study drug dosing.

          -  Nursing or pregnant women.

          -  Known allergy to any of the formulation components of birinapant.
