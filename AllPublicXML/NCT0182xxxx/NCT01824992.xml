  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon α-2b gel (Yallaferon®) for
      the treatment of patients with cervical high-risk HPV infections; to analyze the HPV type
      infections and clinical negative conversion.

      285 patients with positive high risk HPV infection were randomized into interferon gel group
      and control group at ratio of 2:1 (203 patients in treatment group and 82 patients in control
      group). The patients in treatment group received 1g recombinant human α-2b interferon gel
      every other day for consecutive 3 courses of treatment, whereas no treatment was conducted in
      control group.

    <description>Secondary efficacy endpoints were the differences of single-type HPV infection, dual infection and multiple infections on the 6th month between the two groups.
Evaluation criteria:
Negative conversion was defined as all positive hr-HPV DNA at baseline turning negative.
Non-negative conversion was defined as at least one of the positive hr-HPV DNA at baseline not turning negative.</description>
