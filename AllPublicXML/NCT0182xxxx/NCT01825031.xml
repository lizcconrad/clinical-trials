      A randomised controlled trial to investigate three methods to reduce early mortality in
      adults, adolescents and children aged 5 years or older starting antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      with severe immuno-deficiency. The three methods are:

      (i) increasing the potency of ART with a 12 week induction period using 4 antiretroviral
      drugs from 3 classes

      (ii) augmented prophylaxis against opportunistic/bacterial infections and helminths for 12
      weeks

      (iii) macronutrient intervention using ready-to-use supplementary food for 12 weeks.

      REALITY is a open-label randomised trial of 1800 adults, adolescents and children aged 5
      years or more with low CD4 counts about to initiate ART.

      The trial will have a factorial design with 3 randomisations, each to address one of the
      potential approaches to reduce early mortality in adults and children initiating ART with low
      CD4, namely:

        1. Raltegravir for 12 weeks from ART initiation in addition to 3 standard ART (3-drug
           2-class) versus standard of care first-line 3-drug 2-class ART (choice according to
           national guidelines for ART initiation);

        2. Immediate enhanced opportunistic infections (OI) prophylaxis with isoniazid/pyridoxine
           and cotrimoxazole, plus 12 weeks fluconazole, 5 days azithromycin and a single dose of
           albendazole versus cotrimoxazole prophylaxis alone for the first 12 weeks followed by
           isoniazid and any prophylaxis and/or treatment prescribed at screening

        3. supplementation with Ready to Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) for 12 weeks versus standard
           of care nutritional support to those with poor nutritional status according to local
           guidelines.

      All participants will receive cotrimoxazole throughout the trial.

      The primary objective of the trial is to identify effective, safe and acceptable
      interventions to reduce early mortality (all-cause) in HIV-infected adults, adolescents, and
      older children (5 years or more) initiating ART.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 5 years or older

          -  Documented HIV infection by HIV ELISA or HIV rapid test

          -  Naive to ART

          -  CD4 T-cell count &lt;100 cells/mm3 on blood test taken at screening for REALITY

          -  Results of screening haematology and biochemistry tests available and no
             contraindications to planned ART according to national guidelines

          -  Patient/carer provide informed consent (and children &lt;18 years assent, as appropriate
             according to their age and knowledge of HIV status)

        The lower age limit is because CD4 counts are less reliable predictors of immunodeficiency
        under 5 years: CD4 counts are recommended by guidelines in older children.

        No patient with a CD4 count above 100 cells/mm3 should have ART delayed in order to
        subsequently meet eligibility criteria. Rather, patients eligible for REALITY will be those
        testing HIV positive for the first time with a low CD4 count (i.e. those delaying
        presentation to care), or those who have defaulted before initiating ART and only return to
        care at an advanced stage of immuno-deficiency.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications to any proposed antiretroviral drugs (including integrase
             inhibitors), isoniazid, fluconazole, albendazole or azithromycin

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding or intending to become pregnant during the first 12 weeks of
             the study

          -  Ever known to have previously received single-dose nevirapine for prevention of
             mother-to-child transmission (mother or child).
