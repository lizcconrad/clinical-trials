  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very few studies have examined different models of care involving initial ambulatory
      home-based diagnosis in diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), identifying patients who
      benefit from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and reducing the need for
      polysomnography (PSG). This study aims to assess the role of an ambulatory approach with home
      diagnostic sleep study. We hypothesize that the ambulatory approach is as good as the
      conventional approach in managing OSA in terms of improvement of clinical outcome but the
      former approach will lead to substantial cost savings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      parallel study on new referrals to the Respiratory Clinic, Prince of Wales Hospital, with
      suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS). OSAS was defined by apnea-hypopnea index(AHI) 5/hr
      or more of sleep plus excessive daytime sleepiness or two of the following symptoms: choking
      or gasping during sleep, recurrent awakenings from sleep, unrefreshed sleep, daytime fatigue,
      and impaired concentration. All patients with suspected OSAS underwent assessment at the
      clinic with the Epworth sleepiness score(ESS) and symptoms evaluation. Patients who had ESS
      score&gt;9 or at least two OSAS symptoms as described above were invited to join the study. They
      were randomized into either group A)home-based management approach or group B)hospital-based
      management approach by a random table by a third party not involved in the trial.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness that is measured by use of a very short questionnaire. The questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for eight different situations that most people engage in during their daily lives, though not necessarily every day. The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0-9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10-24 range indicates that expert medical advice should be sought.</description>

          <title>In-hospital Sleep Study</title>
          <description>Conventional polysomnography will be performed as in-patient at Prince of Wales Hospital for every subject in this group, recording electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, submental electromyogram, bilateral anterior tibial electromyogram, electrocardiogram, chest &amp; abdominal wall movement by inductance plethysmography, airflow measured by a nasal pressure transducer &amp; supplemented by oronasal airflow thermistor, &amp; finger pulse oximetry.</description>

          <title>Ambulatory Sleep Study</title>
          <description>home sleep study is a pocket-sized digital recording device. It is a multi-channel screening tool that measures airflow through a nasal cannula connected to a pressure transducer, providing an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) based on recording time. It also detects both respiratory and abdominal efforts through the effort sensor and can differentiate between obstructive and central events.</description>
