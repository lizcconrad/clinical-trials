      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of high intensity interval exercise
      (HIIE) on inflammation and endothelial dysfunction found in children with obesity. Our
      working hypothesis is that, compared with obese children prescribed moderate exercise, obese
      children prescribed HIIE will demonstrate greater improvements in endothelial function and
      inflammatory markers following a 6-week exercise intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, even in children, is generally accompanied by a state of chronic inflammation. To
      combat childhood obesity, clinicians and scientists recommend lifestyle interventions that
      include increased physical activity and exercise in an attempt to promote weight loss and,
      consequently, decrease comorbidities associated with excess adiposity. More importantly, it
      appears that the influence of regular exercise may offer children with obesity a multitude of
      health benefits, independent of weight loss. However, the intensity of exercise required to
      elicit significant health benefits is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present
      project is to study the influence of high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) on the existing
      inflammatory state found in obesity. Specifically, the proposed project will examine
      endothelial function and markers of inflammation, such as TNFa, IL-6, hsCRP, and adiponectin,
      in children with obesity before and after an exercise intervention. The data will then be
      used to determine if changes in these values differ in magnitude based on the intensity of
      exercise. Children with obesity will be randomized into either moderate exercise or HIIE
      groups, and attend sessions 3 times per week for 6 weeks. The moderate group will cycle
      continuously for 30 minutes at 65%-70% of maximal heart rate and the HIIE group will perform
      ten, 2-minute bouts at 90%-95% of maximal heart rate. Outcome measures of body composition,
      aerobic capacity, blood lipids, glucose metabolism, endothelial function, and inflammation
      will be measured pre- and post-intervention. Results may help in establishing exercise
      protocols not only for children with obesity, but also other inflammatory diseases such as
      diabetes, cancer, and arthritis.

    <description>The subject will participate in a 6-week exercise intervention, 3 days per week on a cycle ergometer. The moderate exercise group will begin with a five-minute warm-up, cycling at 50-55% of the subject's maximal heart rate as determined by the initial fitness assessment. Following the warm-up, the moderate group will cycle for 30 minutes at 65-70% of maximal heart rate. The subject will then complete a 5-minute cool-down at 50-55% of maximal heart rate. Heart rate will be measured via individual heart rate monitors.</description>

The subjects in the HIIE group will begin with a five-minute warm-up at 50-55% of the subject's maximal heart rate as determined by the initial fitness assessment. Following the warm-up, the HIIE group will perform 10, two-minute exercise bouts at 90-95% of maximal heart rate, with one minute of active recovery at 55% of maximal heart rate between each interval for a total of 30 minutes.
