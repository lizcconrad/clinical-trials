  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant use of fibrin glue (FG) in the fistula tract has been shown to promote closure of
      low-output enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs). The primary objectives of this study are to
      compare the clinical efficacy, safety of autologous platelet-rich fibrin glue (PRFG),
      commercial fibrin glue, and control therapy in the management of patients with low-output
      volume ECFs.

      -  This is a prospective, randomized, multi-centered study clinical, safety and economic
           outcome of ECFs patients.

        -  Subjects are randomized to one of 3 groups:

             -  Group 1: Autologous PRFG-treatment [PRFG + Standard of care (SOC)]

             -  Group 2: Commercial FG-treatment [FG + Standard of care (SOC)]

             -  Group 3: Control (SOC only)

        -  Study will include three phases:

             -  Phase 1: Screening, consent and enrollment

             -  Phase 2: Patients will receive either PRFG, commercial FG, or SOC only for 14 days

             -  Phase 3: Follow up: for patients with closed fistula within 14 days, we will follow
                up them for 6 months. For patients whose fistulas were still open will be treated
                with other therapeutic option and follow up for 6 months after closure.

    <description>As described in our previous study, platelet-rich cryoprecipitate and thrombin were obtained from 300-400ml whole blood of each patient enrolled in the PRFG group and then frozen at -20°C for storage. Prior to application, frozen cryoprecipitate and thrombin stored were thawed in a 37°C water bath. Aminomethylbenzoic Acid (1ml: 1mg, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added into the cryoprecipitate in the volume ratio of 1:10.</description>

    <description>A forward-viewing fistula-fiberscope (EndoView, Outai Medical Equipment, Shanghai, China), with 15cm length and 5mm width of fiber optical wire, was inserted into the fistula tract to accomplish endoscopic visualization. Briefly, the fistula-fiberscope assisted procedure was carried out percutaneously, allowing the exposure of internal hole and the whole tracts, followed by insertion of this catheter with distal mixing device.</description>
