  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies report association between restless legs syndrome (RLS), HTA and
      cardiovascular diseases .

      The mechanisms involved in this relationship remained unknown, but several evidences favor
      the role of periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), patterns frequently associated with RLS.
      Sympathetic overactivity is associated with PLMS with increased pulse rate and blood pressure
      coincident with PLMS. PLMS-related repetitive nocturnal blood pressure fluctuations could
      contribute to the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke in patients with
      RLS, especially in the elderly. Several studies already reported that dopaminergic agonists
      reduce the severity of RLS and the PLMS index.

      Do dopaminergic agonists reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated autonomic
      dysfunctions in patients with RLS ?

      Nocturnal BP (blood pressure) decline has major clinical implications, and the loss of normal
      reduction in BP during sleep is associated with high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality.

      The main aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of rotigotine patch treatment on
      validated cardiovascular risk factors ambulatory BP during night, day and night-to-day ratio,
      and endothelial function in patients with idiopathic RLS compared to placebo.
