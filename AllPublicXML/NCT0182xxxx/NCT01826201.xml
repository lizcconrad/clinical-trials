    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether MOL4239 is effective in adult subjects with
      mild to moderate plaque psoriasis by comparing two target lesions in which each subject will
      apply MOL4239 ointment to one target lesion and placebo ointment to the contralateral target
      lesion twice a day for 28.5 consecutive days.

      This is a phase 2a, Randomized, Multi-center, Blinded, Paired Psoriasis Lesion, Comparative
      Placebo-Controlled study to evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
      MOL4239 in 30 adult subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Eligible subject will
      have a diagnosis of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis affecting 9.9% body surface area (BSA)
      or less, and two designated similar target lesions with a Psoriasis Severity Score of at
      least 6 or higher. Each subject will apply 10% MOL4239 ointment to one target lesion and
      placebo ointment to the contralateral target lesion twice a day for 28.5 consecutive days.

    <measure>Improvement in Lesion Appearance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Photography of the MOL4239 and placebo treated lesions will be performed at baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28 to assess for the improvement in lesion appearance after drug treatment. The assessment will be completed by a blinded panel of dermatologists experienced in the assessment of psoriasis.</description>

    <measure>Physician's Treatment Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7, Day 14, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The physician's treatment preference utilizing visual assessment and selection of the most improved plaque. The determination will be either 1)right lesion is preferred compared to left, 2)left lesion is preferred compared to right, 3) no difference between the right and left lesion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of patients achieving treatment success in the treatment group compared to the placebo group on day 28. Treatment success is defined as patient achieving a psoriasis severity score (PSS) of 3 or less, or an improvement of 5 points or more on the PSS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EIS Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Erythema, Induration and Scale (EIS) area. Total score will be the EIS x Area, and will be calculated at baseline, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28. The EIS will represent the sum of individual scores of Erythema, Induration and Scale using the same scale utilized in the PSS. The area of active erythema, induration and scale will be measured and the total scores will be calculated from the EIS scores multiplied by the area in cm2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed based on reported adverse events, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms, hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis. Adverse events will be reported throughout the trial. Vital signs will be performed at screening, baseline, prior to the morning dose on Days 0, 1, 7, 14, 28, and at the follow up visit on Day 42. Physical examinations will be performed at Screening, baseline and Day 28. Hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis will be performed at screening, baseline, Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and at the follow up visit on Day 42. ECGs will be performed at Screening, baseline and Day 28.</description>

Trace or slight elevation of plaque above normal skin level
Moderate elevation with rounded or sloped edges to plaque
Marked elevation with hard, sharp edges to plaque
Very marked elevation with very hard, sharp edges to plaque Scaling 0 - 4
0 None

Physical examinations will be performed at Screening, baseline and Day 28. Hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis will be performed at screening, baseline, Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and at the follow up visit on Day 42.
