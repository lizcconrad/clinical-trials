  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies at our institution, using a genetic mouse model of gastric cancer,
      strongly suggest that innervation of the stomach wall is required not only for the
      development, but also for the progression of gastric cancer, and that denervation of the
      stomach either by vagotomy or by injection of botulinum toxin (Botox®) in the stomach wall
      may represent an effective therapeutic intervention. New treatment options for inoperable
      cancer in the stomach are urgently needed, and local treatment with botulinum toxin seems to
      be an attractive possibility. In this pilot study Botox injections will be given by
      gastroscopy in both the tumor and the surrounding stomach wall. The purpose of the study is
      to obtain data needed to calculate sample size in a larger controlled trial.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

        Patients with verified gastric adenocarcinoma but found non-resectable or inoperable after
        evaluation in the appropriate multidisciplinary team at St.Olav Hospital. Trondheim
        University Hospital. The inclusion criteria for such patients are:

          1. Patients who have received 1.line and 2. line chemotherapy but no longer respond to
             such therapy.

          2. Patients who, due to toxicity of chemotherapy, cannot be offered such treatment.

          3. Patients who, after meticulous information about chemotherapy, still do not want such
             treatment.

          4. Patients with performance status (ECOG) 0-2.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Known allergy to any of the components in Botox®

          2. Known peripheral motor neuropathy disease ( for example: Amyotrophic Lateral
             Sclerosis, ALS), or subclinical or clinical deficiency of neuromuscular transmission
             (for example: Myasthenia Gravis or Eaton-Lambert`s Syndrome).

          3. Pregnant or lactating women.

          4. Another cancer disease that is not under control.

          5. Another concomitant treatment for cancer.

          6. Serious mental illness.

          7. Performance status (ECOG) 3-4.
