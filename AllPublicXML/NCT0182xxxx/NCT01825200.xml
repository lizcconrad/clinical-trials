  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this trial is that the incidence of a pre-defined composite of common
      systemic hypersensitivity adverse events for Flublok recipients is non-inferior to that
      reported for licensed IIV recipients. Another hypothesis is that the safety and
      reactogenicity of Flublok is clinically acceptable, i.e. consistent with the overall safety
      profiles previously observed with Flublok and with the licensed comparator.

      The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all people aged 6
      months and older be immunized to prevent influenza. Currently the only approved influenza
      vaccine across the entire age group is inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). A Biologics
      Licensing Application (BLA) for Flublok was approved by the FDA for influenza immunization of
      adults 18-49 years of age. Additional safety and, ultimately efficacy, data is needed to
      support use in adults ≥50 years of age, an important age group as adults ≥65 years of age are
      among those at increased risk of influenza complications.
