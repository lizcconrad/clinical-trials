    <textblock>
      Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects female children.
      Rett syndrome is characterized by significant elevation in blood markers of oxidative stress.
      EPI-743 is a novel therapeutic with demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of
      disorders characterized by oxidative stress. The purpose of this study is to examine the
      safety and efficacy of EPI-743 in a population of children with Rett syndrome.
