  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO) in patients who will be undergoing an enteroscopy as an outpatient
      procedure with symptoms of functional dyspepsia. In addition, the investigators would like to
      identify the types of bacteria that are present in the small intestines in patients with SIBO
      and compare two different diagnostic tools: microbiologic culture and DNA sequencing of
      bacteria.

      The aim is to compare the microbiota between patients with and without the clinical
      complications of SIBO
