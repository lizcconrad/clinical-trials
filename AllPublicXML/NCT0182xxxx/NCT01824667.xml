  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of a new food supplement which is currently
      available in the market, called BimunoÂ® (B-GOS), on gastrointestinal discomfort (e.g.
      bloating, abdominal pain/cramp and flatulence) in adults who often experience these symptoms
      but are otherwise healthy.

      About 400 volunteers will take part in this study, which will last 6 weeks (to include 4
      weeks treatment and 2 weeks follow up period).

      Episodes of abdominal pain or discomfort (e.g. bloating, abdominal pain/cramp and
      flatulence), in the absence of diseases, are commonly associated with food or drug intake or
      with alterations of bowel habit and vary between individuals in frequency and severity.

      Some dietary ingredients are known to reduce these symptoms. We have used B-GOS previously in
      trials with healthy younger and older adults and we have observed a trend towards reducing
      abdominal bloating. However, the investigators have not tested B-GOS in healthy adults who
      often experience these symptoms and this is what we will investigate now.
