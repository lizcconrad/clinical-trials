      Use of MRI and DWI to diagnose cardiac scarring after heart attack.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To discover new information about MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) called DWI (diffusion
      weighted imaging) and its ability to diagnose cardiac scarring.

      CMR-DE (cardiac MR with delayed contrast enhancement) evaluates if there has been scarring in
      the heart muscle following a heart attack.

      Subjects are injected with a contrast medication that makes the scarring visible if present.
      To prove the efficacy of DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) to provide the same images that
      CMR-DE (cardiac magnetic resonance with delayed contrast enhancement) provides.

    <description>Subjects will undergo a MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan where DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) will be performed. Subjects will not receive contrast during this sequence, but will receive contrast as standard MRI protocol.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Diffusion Weighted Imaging with MRI scans</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will have an MRI(magnetic resonance imaging)performed. This sequence will take no longer than 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Only DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) will be added to the standard cardiac MR protocol for viability which requires contrast injection. DWI(diffusion weighted imaging) sequence does not require contrast injection.</description>
