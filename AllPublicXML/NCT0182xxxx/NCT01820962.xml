  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a hematological malignancy who are undergoing intensive chemotherapy need a
      central venous catheter (CVC)during their treatment. CVCs are locked with heparin when they
      are not used.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether concentrated citrate locking, compared to
      heparin, reduces the incidence of central venous catheter-related thrombosis and infections
      in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheter (CVC)-related thrombosis and infections are frequently occurring
      complications and may cause significant morbidity in patients with hematological
      malignancies. Interventions to decrease fibrin deposition have the potential to reduce
      CVC-related thrombosis and infections.

      At present heparin is most often used as locking solution for central venous catheters in
      hematological patients despite a lack of evidence regarding the efficacy and safety.
      Trisodium citrate (TSC) had been shown to be an effective antimicrobial catheter locking in
      hemodialysis patients.

    <description>Patients will be followed from insertion of the central venous catheter till removal of the central venous catheter, an expected average of 30 days. The central venous catheter is seen daily and checked for thrombosis and infections when the patient is admitted on the ward. Discharged patients are seen at least weekly on the outpatients clinic and their central venous catheter is checked for thrombosis and infections. A standard ultrasound is made 30 days after insertion and within 24 hours after removal of the central venous catheter.</description>
