    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy before
      surgery followed by gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with pancreatic cancer.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin
      calcium, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill
      any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new treatment program for patients with borderline
      resectable pancreas cancer in order to determine what effects, good and bad, chemotherapy and
      chemoradiation have on your cancer and to see if it allows safe surgery.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the accrual rate of this study.

        -  To assess the rate of treatment-related toxicity and treatment delay during preoperative
           therapy.

        -  To assess the rate of completion of all preoperative and operative therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the macroscopic (R0/R1) resection rate.

        -  To estimate the rate of radiographic and histopathologic response to preoperative
           therapy.

        -  To estimate the time to locoregional and distant recurrence.

        -  To assess overall survival (OS).

        -  To retrieve nucleic acids from pretreatment pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma biopsies
           and to assess the quality of these nucleic acids using a sequencing-based assessment of
           tumor DNA.

    <description>Each patient will receive mFOLFIRINOX therapy administered every other week for a total of 4 cycles. Each treatment cycle is a total of 14 days. This treatment program consists of four drugs (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by irinotecan 180 mg/m^2 IV over 90 minutes on day 1 followed by, leucovorin 400 mg/m^2 IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m^2 IV over 46-48 hours).
Two to six weeks following treatment with the mFOLFIRINOX, if the tumor has not spread to other parts of the body then the patient will receive capecitabine 825 mg/m^2, twice daily for 28 days along with radiation therapy. Patients will have surgery within 4-10 weeks of the last dose of chemoradiation if the tumor has gotten smaller or stayed the same.
Within 6-8 weeks following surgery, patients will receive gemcitabine for 2 cycles (1 cycle is 28 days). Gemcitabine will be given IV on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28 day cycle.</description>
