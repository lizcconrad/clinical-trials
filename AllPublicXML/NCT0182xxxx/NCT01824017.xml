  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal extends work done in mouse models evaluating the consistency of
      measuring RLIP76 in a clinical cohort (Aim 1) by using guidelines provided by the NIH for
      validating biomarkers. We will also proceed to estimate the effect size of a potential
      correlation of RLIP76 with standard MsY treatment measures such as hgbA1c, LDL, and
      triglyceride levels in a longitudinal prospective study ( Aim 2) that will follow a cohort of
      patients with MsY who seek care at the City of Hope Endocrine clinic over a 12 month period..

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will perform 6 repeated measurements on first blood draws from patients with Type 2 diabetes who also have MsY. Sixty-seven percent (4 out of 6) of the quality controls must be within 15% of the mean of these measurements for us to consider the ELISA-based RLIP76 assay to be consistent</description>

    <measure>Effect size of correlation of RLIP76 levels with treatment measures of metabolic syndrome such as hemoglobin A1c, LDL, and triglyceride levels.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will perform a longitudinal correlative study to evaluate the correlation of RLIP76 levels with changes in treatment measures of metabolic syndrome, such as hemoglobin A1c, LDL, and triglyceride levels. The results of this objective will be used to design a correlative study to determine the correlation of RLIP76 levels to the change in treatment measures of metabolic syndrome.</description>

    <description>Data will be collected at patients' usual follow-up intervals for monitoring their metabolic conditions (i.e., T2D, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, etc.), which will be at 3 or 6 month intervals with a +/- 30 day window. Standard treatment surveillance measures such as hemoglobin A1c, LDL, and triglyceride levels will be performed as the standard of care for patients with MsY. Blood samples for these tests will be drawn while subjects are fasting</description>
