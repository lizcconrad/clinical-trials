            <description>Oral administration of Faldaprevir 120 mg (BI 201335) soft gel capsule.
The study was divided into two phases, the first being a single dose and the second a multiple dose.
During the single dose treatment (days 1-5), subjects received one single dose in the morning of day 1.
During the multiple dose treatment (days 6-15), subjects received multiple oral doses of faldaprevir once daily from day 6 to day 15.</description>
