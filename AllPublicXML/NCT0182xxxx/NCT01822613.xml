    <textblock>
      To study the safety and efficacy of the combination of LJM716 and BYL719 against currently
      available treatments of physician's choice in previously treated esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma patients.

      The study design included a Phase 1b dose escalation portion to define the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of LJM716 and alpelisib,
      followed by an open-label, randomized Phase 2 part to compare anti-tumor activity of
      LJM716-alpelisib combination versus physician's choice of second-line therapy (paclitaxel,
      docetaxel, irinotecan). However, the phase 2 part was not conducted as the study was
      terminated early due to limited anti-tumor activity with LJM716-alpelisib combination
      observed in phase 1b.

             localized disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received prior phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor or
             anti-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3 (ERBB3 or HER3) antibody treatment,
             including bi-specific antibodies with HER3 as one of the targets (patients with prior
             exposure to pertuzumab or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agents are
             eligible)

          -  Patients who do not have an archival or fresh tumor sample (or sections of it)
             available or readily obtainable.

          -  Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastatic involvement.

          -  Patients who have received prior systemic anti-cancer treatment, such as cyclical
             chemotherapy or biological therapy within a period of time that is shorter than the
             cycle length used for that treatment (e.g. 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin-C) prior
             to starting study treatment.

          -  Patients who have received definitive radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting study
             drug, who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy and/or from whom ≥ 30%
             of the bone marrow was irradiated.
