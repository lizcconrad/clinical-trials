  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II, [MPS II]) is a rare, genetically linked lysosomal
      storage disease (LSD) caused by deficiency of the enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S). Most
      MPS II patients will present with some degree of neurodevelopmental involvement, ranging from
      severe cognitive impairment and behavioral problems to mildly impaired cognition. This is an
      observational study; no investigational treatment will be administered. The primary objective
      of this study is to evaluate the neurodevelopmental status of pediatric patients with MPS II
      over time and to gain information to guide future treatment studies in this patient
      population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be considered eligible for enrollment:

          1. a. The patient has a deficiency in iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme activity AND b. The
             patient has a documented mutation in the iduronate-2-sulfatase gene. OR c. The patient
             has a normal enzyme activity level of one other sulfatase

          2. The patient is male, and is at least 2 years of age and less than 18 years of age at
             the time of informed consent.

          3. The patient must have sufficient auditory capacity at enrollment, with or without
             hearing aids, in the Investigator's judgment to complete the required protocol
             testing, and be compliant with wearing the aids on scheduled study visits.

          4. The patient, patient's parent(s), or legally authorized guardian(s) has voluntarily
             signed an Institutional Review Board / Independent Ethics Committee-approved informed
             consent and/or assent form(s), as applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study.

          1. The patient has clinically significant non-Hunter syndrome-related CNS involvement or
             medical or psychiatric comorbidity(ies) which, in the investigator's judgment, may
             interfere with the accurate administration and interpretation of protocol assessments,
             affect study data, or confound the integrity of study results.

          2. The patient has a general conceptual ability score (GCA) or a developmental quotient
             on the cognitive scale below 55 at Screening.

          3. The patient is participating in an interventional clinical trial or has participated
             in an interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to enrollment; participation
             in non interventional observational studies is permitted.
