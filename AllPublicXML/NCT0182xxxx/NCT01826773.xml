  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate how safe and how well an investigational imaging product
      CardioPET™ performs as compared to standard approved imaging products in assessing the
      function of heart muscle in coronary artery disease patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The open label, phase II, multi center, study objectives are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the diagnostic performance of CardioPET™ in assessing myocardial perfusion
           as compared to standard Tc-99m myocardial perfusion agents with coronary angiography as
           the standard of reference for CAD.

        -  To evaluate the safety of CardioPET™ in known or suspected CAD subjects.

        -  A secondary objective is to assess fatty acid uptake at rest and following stress.

    <description>The aim of this clinical protocol is to study CardioPET™ as a PET imaging agent for evaluation of myocardial perfusion in subjects with known or suspected CAD with a single injection of CardioPET™.
The primary efficacy endpoint for this phase II study is the sensitivity and specificity of CardioPET™ compared to Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) using coronary angiography as the standard of reference for the detection of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Group I will consist of 15-20 patients and will have CardioPET™ imaging performed with a repeat identical stress component at ≥ 48 hours and ≤ 10 days after the initial stress MPI study. There should be no intervention or change in symptoms between the tests, and the patient must have an angiography scheduled to be performed within 30 days.
The analysis of the acquired imaging data will determine if CardioPET™ is suitable for identifying myocardial flow defects that were observed in exercise or pharmacologic stress Tc-99m MPI imaging. The goal for this CardioPET™ imaging group is to measure blood flow at near maximal stress.</description>

    <description>Group II will consist of 15-20 subjects will have undergone either, stress, Tc-99m MPI study or stress-echocardiography indicating ≥2 segments of ischemia. These patients must have been referred and scheduled for coronary angiography. If initial evaluation was performed with stress echocardiography, subjects will have either exercise or pharmacologic stress MPI.
CardioPET™ imaging in these subjects must be performed ≥ 48 hours and ≤ 10 days from the initial stress (stress MPI or echocardiography) at rest only. An angiography must be scheduled to be performed within 30 days.</description>
