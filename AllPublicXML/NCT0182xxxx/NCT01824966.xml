    <textblock>
      There has been much controversy surrounding the biologic behavior and prognosis of esophageal
      signet ring cell (SRCs) containing carcinomas. To clarify the biologic behavior of SRCs, the
      investigators compared the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of SRCs with other
      adenocarcinomas (ADC) of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).

    <textblock>
      Adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) is an aggressive
      neoplasm and has a poor prognosis. Surgical based treatment has been the treatment of choice
      for localized esophageal adenocarcinoma.

      Signet-ring cell carcinoma is a unique histologic subtype of adenocarcinoma characterized by
      abundant intracellular mucin accumulation and a compressed nucleus displaced toward one
      extremity of the cell (the so-called signet-ring cell (SRC)). According to the World Health
      Organisation (WHO), a true signet-ring cell carcinoma (SRCca) is defined as an adenocarcinoma
      in which the predominant component (more than 50% of the tumor) consists of isolated or small
      groups of SRC in the stroma. If the tumor contains less than 50% of those cells, it is
      generally considered as an adenocarcinoma (ADC).

        From our prospectively built database we retrieved all adenocarcinoma from 1990 till 2009
        who underwent primary surgery with R0 resection. Seven hundred seventy-nine patients were
        included for further analysis. Pathology reports mentioning signet ring cells (n = 82) were
        reviewed by our pathologist and, after confirmation, tumors were classified into two groups
        according to WHO criteria (&gt;50% SRC or &lt;50% SRC). The remaining 697 ADC patients served as
        control group.
