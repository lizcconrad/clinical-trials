  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a disorder in which a type of white blood cell (eosinophil)
      involved in allergic reactions, enter and cover the walls of the esophagus (food pipe). As a
      result, the esophagus becomes swollen and blocked making it difficult to swallow, and this
      leads to heartburn. In severe cases it can lead to food getting stuck in the esophagus and
      poor growth or weight loss in children

      The main purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of two different
      types of treatment for EoE:

        1. Oral viscous budesonide- which is a steroid medication that has been used to treat
           asthma. Recently, it has been used as a therapy to treat the eosinophilic inflammation
           in EoE, and

        2. Specific food elimination.

      The study will also be looking to see if a blood test is useful in following the progression
      of EoE. Currently the only way to follow EoE is by repeating endoscopy, which is a more
      &quot;invasive test.&quot;

      This study is a open label, randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the efficacy of
      a topical steroid preparation to an antigen (food) elimination diet.

      A total of 60 participants will be recruited for this study that are positive for food
      allergens. Study participants will be randomly assigned to treatments as described below, and
      the duration of each treatment phase will be 16 weeks.

      The subjects will be randomized to group A and B. Subject and study team will NOT be blinded
      to the group assignments.

      Group A will receive oral viscous budesonide at a dose of 1 or 2 mg daily depending on the
      height.

      Group B will receive an elimination diet (elimination of the foods the subject is allergic
      to).
