  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is at least 2-3 times higher in persons with
      psychotic illnesses than in the general population. Life expectancy of individuals with
      psychosis is also 20-25 years less than the general population, primarily due to premature
      onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite the high risk for T2DM and CVD, psychotic
      illness has been an exclusion criterion in all large-scale studies of diabetes prevention and
      management. We propose a 3-year randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a
      lifestyle intervention (LI) aimed at reducing caloric intake and increasing physical activity
      in overweight or obese individuals (N=150) suffering from both a psychotic illness and T2DM.
      Weight and glycemic control will be the primary outcome variables. It is hypothesized that a
      significant weight reduction and improvement in glycemic control will be found in those who
      receive the LI relative to those who do not.
