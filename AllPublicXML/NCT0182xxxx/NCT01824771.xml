    <textblock>
      Continuous Veno-Venous Hemofiltration (CVVH) can eliminate metabolic products effectively and
      replace renal function partly. It is widely used in intensive care units (ICUs), especially
      for patients with acute kidney injury/failure in an unstable hemodynamic status. Lactate is a
      molecule smaller than glucose, which can pass through filtration membrane freely in CVVH.
      Therefore, the blood lactate concentrations would no longer reflect tissue oxygenation status
      in patients with unstable hemodynamic status. However, there is no prospective study
      evaluated the effect of CVVH on lactate removal in critically ill patients. The influence of
      different dose of CVVH on lactate elimination is not clear in patients with different level
      of serum lactate. Our study aimed to find out how the dose of CVVH effects on lactate
      clearance, and then re-estimate the prognostic value of lactate in critically ill patients
      with CVVH.
