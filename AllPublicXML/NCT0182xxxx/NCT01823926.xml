      Introduction: Inhalation therapy has been established as an efficient route to treat asthma
      exacerbations, but coupled to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) remains quite challenging.

      Objectives: The aim of this study were to compare radiaoaerosol pulmonary index and
      radioaerosol mass balance in the different compartments (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) using
      vibrating mesh nebulizers (VMN) and jet nebulizer (JN) coupled to noninvasive ventilation
      (NIV).

      Material and methods: The investigators assessed 10 stable moderate to severe asthmatics in a
      crossover study. Patients was randomly assigned to participate in both phases of the study:
      Phase 1(NIV+MN) and phase 2(NIV+JN). DTPA-Tc99m with radioactivity of 25 miC was used to
      inhaler using JN positioned in the circuit using a &quot;T&quot; piece, particle size generation in a
      five micron range and oxygen flow tritated at eight L/min and MN was positioned in the mask,
      particle size generation in a one range and connected to electrical energy. NIV was used a
      bilevel pressure through a face mask attached with straps and pressure adjusted were 12 cmH2O
      and 5 cmH2O as inspiratory and expiratory pressures, respectively. After, radioactivity
      counts were performed using a gama camera and regions of interest were delimited. To
      calculate aerosol mass balance the investigators considered the amount of radioaerosol
      deposited into the lungs, upper airways, stomach, nebulizer, circuit, inspiratory and
      expiratory filters, and mask divided for each of these compartments and represented as a
      percentage.

    <measure>To compare inhaled dose of radioaerosol into the lungs and determine distribution across horizontal and vertical gradients</measure>
    <time_frame>10 mouths</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after inhalation, participants sat in a chair with the back positioned in front to the gamma camera (STARCAM 3200 GE, California, USA) to obtain radioactives counts from the posterior thorax during a period of 500 seconds on a matrix of 256 X 256 matrix. After, participants were positioned sitting in front to the gama camera to obtain images from face. Then, the same procedure was performed to analysis deposition in the nebulizer, circuits, inspiratory filter, expiratory filter and face mask. Counts representing stomach were obtained from posterior thorax and corrections for decay of technetium were used to during extrapulmonary measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To quantify mass balance of the delivery system and different compartments, including intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary deposition.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 mouths</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of deposition in pulmonary and extrapulmonary compartments was expressed as a percentage from the count in each compartment to the total radioaerosol mass generated by nebulizers. The inhaled radioaerosol was considered the sum of deposition into the upper airways, lungs and stomach.</description>
