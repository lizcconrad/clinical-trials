  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to identify modifiable mechanisms contributing to risk and
      vulnerability among youth. The investigators test the hypothesis that eveningness, the
      tendency to go to sleep late and wake late, is an important contributor to, and even cause
      of, vicious cycles that escalate vulnerability and risk among youth. This study seeks to
      determine whether two interventions to reduce eveningness can reduce risk and confer
      resilience in critical aspects of health, development and functioning in youth.

      Teens who exhibit a circadian tendency toward eveningness ('night-owls') follow a delayed
      sleep schedule, increasing activity later in the day and both going to sleep and getting up
      later, compared to morning-types ('larks'). The circadian tendency toward eveningness during
      adolescence arises from a confluence of psychosocial, behavioral and biological factors and
      is an important contributor to, and maybe even cause of, vicious cycles that escalate
      vulnerability and risk for poor health and major forms of psychopathology. Indeed, an evening
      circadian tendency has been associated with a wide range of adverse effects including poorer
      health, poorer academic performance, poorer self-regulation, greater use of substances,
      greater tendency for impulsivity, more depression and anxiety, greater emotional instability
      and more aggressive and antisocial behavior. While the biological shift toward eveningness
      during puberty may be difficult to modify, the psychosocial and behavioral contributors are
      modifiable. Moreover, modifying these contributors will eliminate key factors that exacerbate
      the biological shift. The proposed research will advance current knowledge on the role of
      eveningness as a mechanism contributing to poorer outcomes during adolescence. The
      investigators aim to reduce eveningness among 10-18 year olds via an intervention which
      integrates evidence-based treatments derived from basic research on the circadian system
      (Treatment 1) compared to a psychoeducational intervention that highlights the interplay
      between sleep, diet, exercise and stress (Treatment 2). The investigators will randomly
      allocate adolescents with an evening circadian tendency, and who are 'at risk' in at least
      one of five health domains (emotional, cognitive, behavioral, social, physical), to either:
      (a) Treatment 1 (n = 86) or (b) Treatment 2 (n = 86). Measures will be taken pre-treatment,
      post-treatment, and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. This research is a first step within a
      longer term plan to accelerate knowledge on the potentially powerful positive effects, for
      the developing neural system, of simple, disseminable psychosocial interventions specifically
      designed to target modifiable risk factors across adolescence.

        Inclusion criteria.

          1. Scoring within the lowest quartile of the Children's Morningness-Eveningness
             Preferences Scale (CMEP; 27 or lower) and a 7-day sleep diary showing a sleep onset
             time of of 10:40 pm or later for 10-13 year olds, 11 pm or later for 14-16 year olds,
             and 11:20 pm or later for 17-18 year olds at least 3 nights per week. Must have had
             the current pattern of late bedtimes for the last 3 months.

          2. 'At risk' in one of the five health domains: emotional, behavioral, social, physical,
             and cognitive. Emotional risk will be operationalized as a score of 4 or above on any
             of the following items on the Child Depression Rating Scale: Difficulty Having Fun,
             Social Withdrawal, Irritability, Depressed Feelings, Excessive Weeping, or a T-score
             of 61 or above on the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASQ), based on age
             group (10-11 years, 12-15 year, 16-19 years) using the MASC-10 Profile. Behavioral
             risk will be operationalized as a Sensation Seeking Scale score greater than 3.93 for
             males ages 10-13, greater than 3.19 for females 10-13, greater than 4.07 for males
             14-18, or greater than 3.19 for females 14-18; taking ADHD medication or Kiddie
             Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (KSADs)
             diagnosis of ADHD; current alcohol or substance abuse; or past alcohol or substance
             dependence. Social and cognitive risk will be defined as &quot;worse&quot; than others the
             teen's age in one or more social behavior from Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Section
             VI or failing one or more academic class from CBCL Section VII, respectively. Physical
             risk will be operationalized as a Physical Health Questionnaire-15 score of 4 or
             above, six or more days of school absences, or a BMI above the 85th percentile for the
             participant's sex and age.

          3. Age between 10 and 18 and living with a parent or guardian and and attending a
             class/job by 9am at least 3 days per week;

          4. English language fluency;

          5. Able and willing to give informed assent.

        Exclusion criteria.

          1. An active, progressive physical illness (e.g., cancer, respiratory disorder) or
             neurological degenerative disease directly related to the onset and course of the
             sleep disturbance;

          2. Evidence from clinical diagnosis or report by youth or parent of sleep apnea, restless
             legs or periodic limb movements during sleep. Youth presenting with provisional
             diagnoses of any of these disorders (e.g., sleep apnea) will be referred for a
             non-study polysomnography (PSG) evaluation at the parent's discretion and will be
             enrolled only if the diagnosis is disconfirmed;

          3. Mental retardation, autism spectrum disorder, or other significantly impairing
             pervasive developmental disorder. Based on previous recruitment experiences in our
             youth depression study, we expect this exclusion to be invoked very infrequently (once
             every few years);

          4. Bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or another current Axis I disorder if there is a
             significant risk of harm and/or decompensation if treatment of that comorbid condition
             is delayed as a function of participating in any stage of this study. Otherwise, we
             will allow all other comorbid psychiatric conditions to (i) to maximize
             representativeness and (ii) because a byproduct may be that the treatment constitutes
             a helpful 'transdiagnostic' treatment for youth across psychiatric disorders.

          5. A medication-free group may be difficult to recruit and would likely be
             unrepresentative. Hence, participants will not be excluded on the basis of stable use
             of medications (&gt; 4 weeks). The exception was use of hypnotics and other medications
             known to alter sleep (e.g., melatonin).

          6. History of substance dependence in the past six months;

          7. Current suicide risk sufficient to preclude treatment on an outpatient basis.
