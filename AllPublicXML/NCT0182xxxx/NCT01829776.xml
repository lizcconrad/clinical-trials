  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will compare how often people with multiple sclerosis (MS) fall before
      participating in the Free From Falls (FFF) educational program, during the program, and for 8
      weeks after the program. The protocol will also evaluate the accuracy, efficiency and
      convenience of an email survey to count how often people fall.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will recruit people with MS who report falling at least twice in the
      previous 2 months to participate in the FFF program. All subjects will record their falls and
      injurious falls on a daily basis for at least 3 weeks before the program, during the program
      and for 8 weeks after the program. The program will consist of a weekly 2 hour session. One
      hour of the session will be educational and one hour of the program will involve exercise.
      The outcome of this study will be change in fall rate between the periods before, during and
      after the program.
