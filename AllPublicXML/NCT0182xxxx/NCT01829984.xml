  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different ways of teaching people how to give
      injections at home. The first is what we do now, which is teaching patients and/or their
      caregivers verbally and by giving written instructions. The second is what we do now (verbal
      and written instructions) along with a demonstration and practice using a needle and an
      injection pad that feels similar to skin and fat. This is being done to find the best method
      for teaching people to give an injection at home.

    <description>The first 25 subjects recruited into the study will be that control group. Subjects accrued during the control phase will receive the control injection teaching, which at MSKCC is verbal instruction. To minimize practice variation, the teaching will be provided by the office-practice nurse guided by a verbal script. The consented subjects will complete a questionnaire before the teaching, immediately after the teaching, and after performing the injection the following day. The nurse who administered the teaching will also complete an evaluation immediately following the teaching.</description>

    <description>The subsequent 25 subjects enrolled into the study will be in the intervention group. Subjects accrued during the intervention phase will receive the verbal and written injection teaching, plus demonstration and return demonstration using an injection model. It is anticipated that the intervention teaching will take no longer then 5 additional minutes, however time will be evaluated as a secondary objective as well in both groups. The consented subjects will complete a questionnaire before the teaching, immediately after the teaching, and after performing the injection the following day. The nurse who administered the teaching will also complete an evaluation immediately following the teaching.</description>

        the proposed study. Nurses will notify the PI of any patient due to start adjuvantadjuvant
        or neoadjuvant treatment when the regimen includes pegfilgrastim.
