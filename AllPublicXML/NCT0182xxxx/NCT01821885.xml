    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to asses the efficacy of the spirometry and a minimal smoking

      years, smokers of more than 10 packs-year and without a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) diagnosis.

    <description>During a year, recruitment for active smoker patients was done by doctors in primary care medical offices. In the intervention group, after been randomized, one trained nurse completed the questionnaires and did the spirometry with bronchodilator test and set a date with its family doctor who did a minimal smoking cessation counselling intervention and informed the patients about the spirometry results according to established protocol.</description>
