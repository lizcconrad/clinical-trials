  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) 2011 report states that the market for
      cosmetic procedures has shown significant growth over the past two years, with 13.8 million
      cosmetic plastic surgery procedures performed in the United States in 2011, up 5% since 2010.
      While surgical cosmetic procedures did increase significantly from 2010 to 2011, the overall
      growth in cosmetic procedures is being primarily driven by a substantial rise in
      minimally-invasive procedures. Cosmetic minimally-invasive procedures increased 6%, with
      nearly 12.2 million cosmetic minimally-invasive procedures having been performed in 2011.
      This highlights the growing consumer demand for non- or minimally-invasive cosmetic
      procedures that do not involve surgical procedures such as liposuction and the associated
      risks, potential complications and lengthy and painful recovery processes.

      Low level laser light therapy, such as that to be provided through application of the
      Erchonia® Obesity Laser in this clinical study protocol, offers a simple, non-invasive, safe,
      effective and side-effect free alternative to achieving body circumference reduction.

      Justification for this assertion of anticipated safety and effectiveness of the application
      of the Erchonia® Obesity Laser for the reduction of body circumference is found through three
      FDA clearances for Erchonia® Low Level Laser devices for body circumference reduction
      indications, as follows:

      K123237 (532 nm green light diodes): Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser: is indicated for use as a
      non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for individuals intending to
      undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of hips, waist, and thighs.

      K121695 &amp; K082609 (635 nm red light diodes): Erchonia® ML Scanner (MLS) &amp; Erchonia® Zerona:
      is indicated for use as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for
      individuals intending to undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of
      hips, waist, and thighs.

      K121690 &amp; K120257 (635 nm red light diodes): Erchonia® MLS, Zerona, Zerona-AD: is indicated
      for use as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for individuals
      intending to undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of the upper
      arms.

      Therefore, Erchonia low level lasers have been determined safe and effective by the FDA for
      application for body circumference reduction indications for multiple body areas, such that
      evaluation of application of the Erchonia Obesity Laser to reducing body circumference in
      more overweight individuals is a natural extension of its proven and accepted application for
      body circumference reduction purposes.

    <measure>Difference in the Proportion of Primary Outcome Successes Between Treatment Groups for Change in Combined Circumference Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individual measurements in inches of the waist, hips and upper abdomen were combined to calculate a total body circumference measurement. Change in combined circumference measurement from baseline to 4 weeks was calculated for each subject. Individual subject success was defined as a change of 3.0 inches or more in the combined circumference measurement across the evaluation period. A decrease in combined circumference measurement is positive for individual subject success. An increase in combined circumference measurement is negative for individual subject success. Overall study success was defined as a 40% or greater difference between the proportion of individual successes in each treatment group.</description>

    <description>Individual measurements in inches of the waist, hips and upper abdomen were combined to calculate a total combined body circumference measurement. Change in combined circumference measurement is calculated as the difference in circumference measurements from baseline to endpoint (4 weeks). A negative (-) change indicates a decrease in circumference and is positive for study success. A positive (+) change indicates an increase in circumference and is negative for study success.</description>

        <title>Difference in the Proportion of Primary Outcome Successes Between Treatment Groups for Change in Combined Circumference Measurements</title>
        <description>Individual measurements in inches of the waist, hips and upper abdomen were combined to calculate a total body circumference measurement. Change in combined circumference measurement from baseline to 4 weeks was calculated for each subject. Individual subject success was defined as a change of 3.0 inches or more in the combined circumference measurement across the evaluation period. A decrease in combined circumference measurement is positive for individual subject success. An increase in combined circumference measurement is negative for individual subject success. Overall study success was defined as a 40% or greater difference between the proportion of individual successes in each treatment group.</description>
