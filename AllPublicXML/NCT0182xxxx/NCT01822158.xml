    <measure>Determine if there is a change in satisfaction with team communication following the use of a structured debrief checklist after vaginal deliveries.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>An electronic opinion survey will be administered to participants both pre and post checklist utilization. The survey was derived from communication literature on medical teams such as the collaboration items and 3 subscales from the labour and delivery version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) TeamSTEPPS training program for high functioning medical teams.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if the use of a vaginal delivery debrief checklist will reduce documentation of conflicting data in the electronic medical record.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>Utilizing the pre-validated Vaginal Delivery Debrief Medical Record Audit Tool, records will be examined pre and post use of the Vaginal Delivery Debrief Checklist. Assessment will be made to determine if there are fewer conflicting data points in the electronic medical record (EMR) for key elements following use of the Vaginal Delivery Debrief Checklist.</description>

    <description>Utilization of a Vaginal Delivery Debrief Checklist after vaginal deliveries for a period of three months, by team members who have consented to be a part of this study and who are present at vaginal deliveries. The Vaginal Delivery Debrief checklist consists of 2 levels. The first level includes a list of 6 key elements, such as APGAR scores,estimated blood loss, perineal repair, etc. The second level,or extended debrief, occurs whenever unanticipated outcomes, such as low APGAR scores, postpartum hemorrhage or a difficult delivery occurs. Team members complete the checklist after each delivery they attend.</description>
