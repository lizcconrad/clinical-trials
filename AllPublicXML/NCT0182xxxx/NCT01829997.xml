  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spine fusion is one of the most common procedures performed in spinal surgery. Several
      surgical techniques can achieve a solid union, but the intertransverse posterolateral fusion
      (PLF) is the most widely used. However, complications can develop when the bone graft
      material used is insufficient to achieve the desired fusion. With its unique properties,
      nanOss Bioactive 3D can be mixed with bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and autograft bone to obtain
      new bone growth during the healing process.

      nanOss Bioactive 3D is approved for use in the U.S., however, additional information is
      useful to assess its efficacy in the posterolateral spine. The purpose of this study is to
      assess fusion results in the posterolateral spine using nanOss Bioactive 3D mixed with
      autograft bone and BMA. It is hypothesized that the use of nanOss Bioactive 3D will result in
      fusion at 12 months, with CT evidence of bridging trabecular bone, less than 3mm of
      translational motion, and less than 5 degrees of angular motion.

      The post market clinical investigation is designed to assess instrumented PLF using nanOss
      Bioactive 3D bone void filler with autograft bone and bone marrow aspirate in patients with
      symptomatic spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative disc disease (DDD) with up to Grade 1
      spondylolisthesis at one or two adjacent levels from L2-S1 characterized by the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.

      Patients will be evaluated at Preop, discharge, 6 and 12 months. X-rays will be obtained at
      each visit; Additionally, a CT scan will be performed at the 12 month postoperative visit to
      assess fusion status.
