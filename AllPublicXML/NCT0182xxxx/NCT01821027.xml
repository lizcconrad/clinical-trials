  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754)
      affect the pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) and pharmacodynamics (ie, how
      the drug affects the body) of a single dose of simvastatin.

    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the
      assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same
      medication on the same days and in the same order) to determine how multiple doses of
      canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of simvastatin
      (a drug used to treat raised cholesterol). The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening
      phase, an open-label treatment phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. During the
      open-label treatment phase, each volunteer will receive a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin on
      Day 1, followed by 300 mg of canagliflozin once daily on Days 2 through 6. On Day 7,
      volunteers will receive both simvastatin 40 mg and canagliflozin 300 mg. Each volunteer will
      participate in the study for approximately 32 days
