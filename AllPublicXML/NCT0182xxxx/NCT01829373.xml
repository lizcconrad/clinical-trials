  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the ability of the allogeneic cellular vaccine 1650-G vaccine to enhance
      immune recognition of tumor cells in patients with lung cancer. The vaccine is combined with
      an oral medication called beta glucan, an over the counter oral dietary supplement that may
      also stimulate the immune system in ways that helps the body eradicate cancer cells and
      reduce risk of recurrent cancer. The primary purpose of this study is to measure the changes
      in the number of immune cells that might help lower risk of cancer recurrence. The
      investigators do not yet know if the vaccine is effective in fighting cancer and will not
      know at the end of this study whether this has been of benefit.

    <textblock>
      Open-label pilot (Phase II) study to assess the immunologic activity of a cellular vaccine
      composed of killed allogeneic tumor cells (1650-G) and GM-CSF in patients with stage I-IIIA
      NSCLC after definitive therapy. (Surgery, Surgery plus Radiation Therapy, or Surgery,
      Radiation Therapy plus Adjuvant Chemotherapy).

             the &quot;analysis for immunologic response&quot; 16 weeks after the second vaccination. Study
             doctor will discuss acceptable methods of contraception with patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have not have no active residual or progressive lung cancer (Stable
             Disease)
