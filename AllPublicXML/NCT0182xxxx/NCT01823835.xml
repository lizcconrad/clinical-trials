    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-institution, Phase Ia/Ib/IIa open-label, dose-finding, safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and proof-of-concept study of GDC-0810 as a single agent and in
      combination with palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist. The study is divided into 3 phases: Phase
      Ia, Phase Ib, and Phase IIa. During Phase Ia (dose escalation phase), GDC-0810 single agent
      will be administered orally on a continuous daily dosing regimen with a Day -7 lead-in period
      for single dose PK evaluation prior to the start of daily treatment. The incidence of
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be evaluated from Day -7 through the first cycle (28
      days) of treatment (35 days total). Depending on safety and tolerability, participants will
      be assigned sequentially to escalating doses of GDC-0810 using standard 3 + 3 design. During
      Phase Ib (dose escalation and expansion phase), participants will receive GDC-0810 with
      palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) and assess
      the safety and tolerability of concomitant administration. During Phase IIa (dose expansion
      phase), participants previously treated with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) will be treated at
      the RP2D to further characterize the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of
      GDC-0810.
