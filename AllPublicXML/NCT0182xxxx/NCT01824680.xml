  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess the hormonal regulation of satiety by an
      intense exercise before and after a 3 month physical activity program. Hormones assessed are:
      leptin, grhélin, Cholecystokinin, Glucagon-Like-Peptid-1 (GLP-1), PYY.

      It is well known that in overweight adults and children also, an intense physical exercise
      diminish the food intake relatively to the total energy expenditure and this effect is
      persistent after a 6 weeks physical activity program.

      Our hypothesis are: a diminution of food intake after the intense physical exercise and a
      persistent diminution of food intake after the 3 month physical activity program, an
      augmentation of levels of GLP-1 and PYY during the intense exercise before and after the
      physical activity program, a diminution of the level of GLP-1 and leptin before and after the
      physical activity program

      There is two sequences, one before and one after the physical activity program. Each sequence
      contains one &quot;rest&quot; session and one &quot;exercise&quot; session.

      Each session contains : blood sample at regular interval (Leptin, Ghrélin, CCK, PYY, GLP-1),
      a sleeping assessment (Pittsburg scale), an assessment of hunger sensations at regular
      interval, an assessment of food intake in a &quot;ad libitum&quot; lunch and in the diner indirectly by
      the SU.VI.MAX. tool.

      During the &quot; rest &quot; session :

      Blood samples, assessment of hunger sensation, assessment of food intake are realized during
      the morning. Physical condition (VO2 max, DEXA, and muscular test), insulin-sensibility,
      lipid profile, are also assessed.

      During the &quot;exercise&quot; session: it is identical to the first session but an intense exercise
      of 40 minutes is realized at 70% of the patient's VO2 max. The peripherical blood output is
      measured by a non-invasive method: the Near-Infra-Red-Spectroscopy, during the exercise.

      The 3-months-physical activity program : there is 4 sessions of 30 minutes and 2 sessions of
      1 hour per week. Most of exercises sessions are realized at home but one 1-hour session per
      week is controled with a sports educator.
