    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure the clinical effectiveness of two different
      polypropylene meshes used for laparoscopic inguinal hernias by evaluating subjects' length of
      hospital stay, perioperative complications, recurrence rate, pain score, comfort level and
      postoperative quality of life. A secondary goal of the study is to evaluate the ease of use
      and time it takes surgical residents to place the mesh and perform the surgery using these
      two different meshes.

      Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common operations performed by general surgeons in
      the world. There are two main ways to repair an inguinal hernia, open or laparoscopic. Open
      compared to laparoscopic, is more invasive and leads to more scarring and longer recovery
      periods. Laparoscopic repair is done by making a small cut in or just below the umbilicus and
      has become an accepted standard for inguinal hernia repair and has become the technique of
      choice for recurrent inguinal hernias.

      During laparoscopic repair, the placement of a prosthetic mesh aids in reinforcing the
      abdominal wall and allowing for tension free repair. Meshes also helps to lower the
      recurrence rate. The most safe and effective type of mesh prosthesis currently being used in
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs are polypropylene meshes. There is some emerging
      evidence that &quot;lighter weight&quot; forms of polypropylene meshes may improve quality of life
      outcomes following surgery for inguinal hernias. Further evaluation is needed to support this
      evidence.

    <description>The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and/or to provide evidence of whether or not one polypropylene mesh is more effective than the other. This will be done by measuring whether or not a &quot;lighter weight&quot; form of a polypropylene mesh may improve a patient's quality of life outcomes following laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate the ease of use and time it takes surgical residents to place the mesh and perform the surgery using these two different meshes.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This information may make it possible to determine if one mesh is easier for residents to use during surgery and therefore take them less time to perform the surgical procedure. This information may aid in lessening the amount of time the patient spends in the operating room thus lowering medical costs as well as improving patient outcomes.</description>
