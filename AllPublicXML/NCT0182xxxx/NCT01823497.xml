    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of 2 morphine delivery
      systems for post-surgical neonates. The investigators hypothesize that this study will be
      feasible to conduct, and that neonates receiving morphine via a Parent/Nurse Controlled
      Analgesia pump will receive less morphine and experience fewer side effects than neonates
      receiving morphine via continuous opioid infusion.
