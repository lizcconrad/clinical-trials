      To explore the therapeutic effects for treatment of cholecystolithiasis by minimally invasive
      cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder reservation and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Method：
      patients with cholecystolithiasis who received minimally invasive Cholecystolithotomy with
      gallbladder reservation and patients with cholecystolithiasis who received laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy(LC) in The Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical College from May 2011 to
      December 2013. Patients who received minimally invasive cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder
      reservation as trial group, patients who received LC as control group.the overall follow-up
      period is 1 year. Then the investigators statistically analyze improvement of
      cholecystolithiasis symptoms in every group, thickness of gall bladder wall, the gallbladder
      function and the rate of the recurrence of cholesterol gallstone in trial group.

      The investigators Prospect： Minimally invasive cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder
      reservation is meaningful for recovering the function of gallbladder.
