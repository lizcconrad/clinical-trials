  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with low platelets (less than
      75x10^9/L) the opportunity to undergo treatment and possible cure of their virus. The main
      hepatitis C drugs will be administered as standard of care, with the addition of the study
      drug eltrombopag.

      The investigators hypothesize that providing eltrombopag to CHC patients with low platelets
      (less than 75x10^9/L) will permit the initiation and completion of antiviral triple therapy
      with boceprevir, ribavirin, and pegylated-interferon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SQUELCH-C is an investigator-initiated, single arm, non-blinded pilot study on the use of
      eltrombopag in combination with ribavirin, pegylated-interferon, and boceprevir, for patients
      who would not otherwise be treatment candidates because of low platelet counts (less than
      75x10^9/L).

      Administration of the drugs ribavirin and boceprevir will be standard of care, with one
      exception for interferon.

      The total drug treatment period for the study patient will range from 32 - 56 weeks,
      depending on liver disease stage and viral response. Follow-up will take place at 12 and 24
      weeks post treatment to evaluate for sustained viral response. Total study participation may
      require 1.5 years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients at least 18 years of age.

          -  Require a platelet count below 75 x 10^9 /L at time of screening.

          -  The patients must meet the eligibility criteria for all drugs involved.

          -  Only genotype 1 (a, b, indeterminate, or mixed).

          -  Confirmed history of chronic hepatitis C.

          -  Cirrhotic patients will be included.

          -  Liver imaging within 1 year to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is required in
             patients with cirrhosis.

          -  Patients without evidence of cirrhosis but meeting platelet criteria will also be
             admitted to study.

          -  Subjects must be able to provide informed consent, comply with drug administration
             instructions, and be able to complete each study visit.

          -  Ability to cover costs of ribavirin, interferon, and boceprevir will also be required.

          -  Female subjects are eligible if: Non-pregnant, non-childbearing potential, or of
             childbearing potential and willing to perform complete abstinence or correctly use a
             form of birth control during intercourse [barrier method, intrauterine device,
             hormonal therapy, or surgical sterilization in females or male partner]. They must
             also be willing to have pregnancy tests performed every 4- weeks until 6 months after
             completion of ribavirin.
