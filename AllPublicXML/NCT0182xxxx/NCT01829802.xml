    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      RAL+ATV/r in comparison with TDF/FTC+ATV/r in HIV-1 infected patients presenting virologic
      failure and PI and TDF naïve.

      Overall Study Design and Plan: Description

      This is a pilot, randomized, open-label study. All the participants will be assigned to
      receive RAL+ATV/r or TDF/FTC+ATV/r. Patients will be evaluated at screening, randomization
      (day 0), and on weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48.

      At the screening visit, subjects must be willing and able to give written (signed and dated)
      informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. They will receive a unique screening
      number and will undergo the study procedures associated with the screening visit. The
      investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all eligibility criteria specified and
      record the details of the informed consent process and the results of this assessment in the
      subject's medical records. Two forms of the ICF will be signed, one for the subject and the
      other to file at the site.

      At baseline visit, enrollment criteria will be reviewed and subjects who meet all of them
      will undergo study procedures. Subjects will receive instructions about study medications and
      dosing schedule. Subjects should start study medication within 24 hours of the baseline
      visit. Subjects will return to the investigator´s site for study visits and procedures.
      Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study must return for a discontinuation visit and
      undergo the study procedures identified for the discontinuation visit.
