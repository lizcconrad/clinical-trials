      Hypothesis:

      Cetuximab, an anti-EGFR antibody, is used with radiotherapy in the treatment of locally
      advanced and inoperable upper aerodigestive tract cancers. Actually, no predictive biomarkers
      of Cetuximab antitumor activity are known in this setting. It has been shown recently that
      FCγRIIIA and FCγRIIA receptor polymorphisms played a role in antitumor activity of
      trastuzumab and cetuximab.

      The investigators therefore hypothesized that FCγRIIIA and FCγRIIA receptor polymorphisms may
      play a predictive role in Cetuximab effectiveness in upper aerodigestive tract cancers with
      recurrence or metastatic disease that make them inaccessible to loco regional treatment.

      This study is a multicentre prospective pharmacogenetic observational study, conducted on
      locally advanced and inoperable upper aerodigestive tract cancers.
