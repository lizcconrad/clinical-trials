  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase Ib part of the study aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended
      Phase II dose (MTD/RP2D) of once daily buparlisib in combination with every-three-week
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with previously untreated metastatic squamous NSCLC.

      The purpose of the Phase II portion of the study was to assess the treatment effect of adding
      buparlisib versus buparlisib-matching placebo to every-three-week carboplatin and paclitaxel
      on progression free survival (PFS) in patients with previously untreated metastatic squamous
      NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the observation of DLTs and AEs, the safety profile of this investigational
      treatment was considered challenging requiring dose reductions/interruptions and even the
      evaluation of an alternative schedule of buparlisib administration. The study was early
      terminated, and the primary objective was not met. Therefore the phase ll portion of the
      study was never initiated.

    <description>Overall response is the number of participants who had a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) based on local investigator's assessment of RECIST criteria. Per RECIST: CR, all detectable tumor has disappeared; PR, a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions (TLs) taking as a reference the baseline sum, no worsening of non-TLs, and no new lesions; Progressive disease (PD), a &gt;=20% increase in TLs, clearly worsening of non-TLs, or emergence of new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), small changes that do not meet previously given criteria.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival Time</measure>

    <description>Overall survival (OS) time was measured from the start of study drug to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient was not known to have died, survival was censored at the date of last contact. Data was collected post treatment every 6 weeks until approximately 75% of patients have reached the survival endpoint (Phase I + Phase II).</description>

    <time_frame>Screening, Every 6 weeks until disease progression for up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (QoL) is evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC-13 scale. QLQ-L30 is composed of 30 items, whose responses range from 0 to 4. The QLQ-LC13 is used in conjucntion with the QLQ-C30 and provides information on an additional 13 items specifically relating to lung cancer. It incorporates one multi-item scale to assess dyspnea and a series of single-item scale to assess pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and haemoptysis. All the multi-item scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

    <description>Pharmacokinetics of buparlisib will be investigated in order to investigate any unexpected impact of carboplatin and paclitaxel therapy on the pharmacokinetics of buparlisib. For this purpose, plasma samples will be collected during phase II of the trial. In one set of the population (N=40) samples will be collected according to a sparse sampling strategy over the entire course of the treatment, to allow a proper estimate of the pharmacokinetic parameters. In addition, trough samples should be collected, for the whole population, for measurement of buparlisib/placebo. These additional samples will allow investigating potential PK/PD relationships for various therapeutic or adverse outcome in the whole study population.</description>

    <measure>Duration of overall response</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks from randomization until first documented progression for up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of overall response (DR) is defined as the elapsed time between the date of first documented response and the following date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer. DR will primarily be listed. DR may be described using Kaplan-Meier curves and any related statistics if relevant and will be presented by treatment group in phase II. These analyses will be performed on the responder subset, i.e. patients with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).</description>
