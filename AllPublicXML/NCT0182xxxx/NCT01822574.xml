    <textblock>
      This research was performed to determine which of the three techniques used by knee surgeons
      at the Mayo Clinic was the most accurate at the surgical removal (resection) of the knee-cap
      (patella) in a symmetric fashion during total knee replacement (arthroplasty). Although all
      three techniques are known to be effective, the three techniques had never been compared to
      one another to determine if one was more effective than the others at resecting the patella.

    <textblock>
      Resection of the patella to prepare it for placement of a patellar prosthesis is a procedure
      that is performed routinely in the vast majority of total knee arthroplasties (TKA) in the
      United States and at the Mayo Clinic. This procedure is performed by a number of different
      techniques that have been proved to be safe and effective. Despite this, patellar
      instability, tilt, obliquity, and maltracking are all possible complications of improperly
      resected patellae during TKA. The goals of resection are to create a patella that is
      symmetrical, absent of obliquity (slanting), and thick enough to receive a patellar
      prosthesis. Although outcomes are generally good for most described methods, to date, little
      had been published regarding direct comparison of these methods.

      Patients undergoing TKA with planned patellar resection were randomized to have their patella
      resected by one of three methods during primary TKA: 1) use of a cutting guide, 2) haptic
      feedback, or 3) free-hand resection guided by four quadrant measurements. There were three
      experienced fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons (hip and knee) performing the procedures
      who were all familiar and experienced with each of the three techniques being investigated.
      Each surgeon, within a group of 30 of their patients, performed a total 10 resections using
      each of the three methods listed above (30 resections per surgeon for a total of 90
      resections).

      Before and after resection measurements of knee-cap thickness were taken and used to
      determine patellar symmetry. The resulting symmetry of each of the three techniques was then
      be compared between and within each of the three techniques and surgeons. Each procedure was
      also be timed from first measurement by the staff surgeon to the final measurement by that
      surgeon.

    <measure>Mean Asymmetry of the Patella After Patella Resection</measure>
    <time_frame>approximate average surgery time of 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Post-resection symmetry of the patella was independently assessed by a resident or fellow who was not involved in the resection. This was evaluated by dividing the patella into four equal quadrants and measuring the thickness in the center of each quadrant using a ring tipped or &quot;C&quot;-shaped caliper. The difference between the thickest and thinnest measurements of the patella was reported as the value of asymmetry.</description>

    <measure>The Difference Between Surgeon Goal and Actual Resection Height</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 0 (prior to patella resection), and after surgery (approximately 3 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure attempts to capture the most accurate method for obtaining a desired thickness. Each patellar resection procedure began by exposing the articular surface of the patella. Once the patella was fully exposed and the surgeon measured the native patellar thickness, the timer was started. The surgeon then stated their goal for post resection thickness, and these values were recorded. After the final resection, the timer was stopped. The ability to obtain the resection goal was independently assessed by a resident or fellow not involved in the resection. This was calculated by taking the difference between the surgeon's goal and the average thickness of the four quadrants measured by the resident or fellow.</description>

        <title>Mean Asymmetry of the Patella After Patella Resection</title>
        <description>Post-resection symmetry of the patella was independently assessed by a resident or fellow who was not involved in the resection. This was evaluated by dividing the patella into four equal quadrants and measuring the thickness in the center of each quadrant using a ring tipped or &quot;C&quot;-shaped caliper. The difference between the thickest and thinnest measurements of the patella was reported as the value of asymmetry.</description>

            <title>Cutting Guide Technique</title>
            <description>The guide is clamped onto the patella and tightened so that it remains stable. The guide has a slot that allows insertion of a standard sagittal saw blade, and this slot guides the blade as it is advanced across the patella. The thickness is then measured in the center of the patella to ensure that the resection goal is achieved. Additional resection may be performed as needed.</description>

            <description>It consists of a free hand cut (no guide used) with a standard sagittal saw that is oriented based on osteo-cartilaginous landmarks and haptic palpation of the patella by the surgeon. The resection thickness/obliquity can be altered based on haptic feedback (use of the sense of touch) of the patella. The thickness is then measured in the center of the patella to ensure that the resection goal is achieved. Additional resection may be performed as needed.</description>

        <title>The Difference Between Surgeon Goal and Actual Resection Height</title>
        <description>This outcome measure attempts to capture the most accurate method for obtaining a desired thickness. Each patellar resection procedure began by exposing the articular surface of the patella. Once the patella was fully exposed and the surgeon measured the native patellar thickness, the timer was started. The surgeon then stated their goal for post resection thickness, and these values were recorded. After the final resection, the timer was stopped. The ability to obtain the resection goal was independently assessed by a resident or fellow not involved in the resection. This was calculated by taking the difference between the surgeon's goal and the average thickness of the four quadrants measured by the resident or fellow.</description>
