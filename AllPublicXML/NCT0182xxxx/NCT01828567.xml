  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VA has committed to disseminate a web-based Healthy Living Assessment tool and use it as
      the cornerstone of a personalized prevention plan to engage patients to improve their health
      behaviors that lead to high health risk. Health risk assessments done in isolation, however,
      do not generally lead to behavior change. Our study will test the effectiveness of a Shared
      Decision Making intervention designed to activate Veterans to enroll in effective prevention
      programs. The intervention will be conducted over the telephone, by a prevention coach, and
      will be linked to the patients' primary care team. The co-primary outcomes will be patient
      activation and patient enrollment in prevention programs; 10-year risk of major cardiac
      events will also be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over half of all deaths, and many illnesses, can be attributed to four modifiable risk
      factors: tobacco use, overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. There are
      clear links between these modifiable factors and heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease,
      and stroke which continue to be the leading causes of death in the United States. Significant
      improvements have been made in controlling conditions that lead to heart disease, cancer and
      stroke (e.g., hypertension and hyperlipidemia). However, the underlying behavioral factors
      (e.g., obesity, tobacco use, and physical inactivity) have not been addressed as well.
      Prevention is particularly important for Veterans because of the high prevalence of
      significant risk factors for poor health. For example, more than 70% of VHA patients are
      overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25kg/m2) and one-third are obese (BMI 30kg/m2), which is
      significantly higher than the US population. Smoking also remains a significant problem among
      Veterans, with VHA enrollment data from 2010 indicating a prevalence of 20%. Younger Veterans
      are at particularly high risk for developing chronic illnesses because they are more likely
      to be overweight/obese and smoke more heavily than non-Veterans.

      The investigators propose a two-site, two-arm randomized trial measuring the effectiveness of
      a Shared Decision Making (SDM) intervention in activating Veterans to enroll in effective
      prevention services, and improve cardiovascular risk, compared to VA usual care. The study
      will be performed at the Durham and Ann Arbor VAMCs. Each arm will have 225 patients;
      patients will be VA users with at least one modifiable risk factor (obese, inactive, or
      tobacco user) who are not currently enrolled in a prevention service. The SDM intervention
      will be conducted by a prevention coach, telephone based, and will use the output from VHA's
      Healthy Living Assessment to engage Veterans in a conversation where individual preferences
      are matched to behaviors, and choices for specific prevention services. The resulting
      prevention action plan will be shared with the Veterans primary care team, and documented in
      the medical record.

      Outcomes will be obtained at baseline, 1 month and 6 months after enrollment by blinded
      research personnel. The primary outcomes will be: 1) proportion enrolled in effective
      prevention services; and 2) change in the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). The secondary
      outcome is 10-year risk of coronary events, as measured by Framingham Risk Score. Process
      evaluations of the intervention and its implementation will also be conducted to inform
      future dissemination and implementation should it prove effective.
