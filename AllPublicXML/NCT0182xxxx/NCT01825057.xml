    <textblock>
      General medical hospitals provide care for a disproportionate share of patients who abuse or
      are dependent upon substances. This group is among the most costly to treat and has the
      poorest medical and substance use outcomes. Motivational interviewing(MI) is a
      well-recognized, evidenced-based substance abuse treatment that has been adapted for use as a
      brief intervention in health care settings.MI is applicable to many health-related behavioral
      problems, and can be taught to a broad range of health care clinicians. However, it is
      unclear which implementation strategies will lead to the efficient and proficient uptake of
      MI in general medical settings, such as medical inpatient units.

      Primary care clinicians have multiple practice demands and time constraints. New practices
      have the greatest chance of being implemented if they are simple and compatible with existing
      workflows and systems. Two widely used strategies to bring specialized practices into use
      within general hospital settings are the &quot;see one, do one&quot; apprenticeship model of training
      and use of consultation-liaison (CL) services. &quot;See one, do one&quot; has been a modus operandi in
      medical education for centuries and relies upon a competency-based supervision training
      approach. While it has been empirically validated in the specialty addiction field, less
      controlled testing of this implementation strategy is available in general medical settings.
      The apprenticeship approach requires that appropriate patients and trainers are available
      with high flexibility for teaching and supervision; when applied to behavioral counseling
      approaches, this may be seen as incompatible with the medical role and time constraints of
      clinicians. In contrast, ordering MI through CL is a relatively simple, minimally burdensome
      process and highly compatible with the way clinicians secure other specialist services for
      their patients in the hospital.

      We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial using mixed quantitative and qualitative
      methods to examine the effectiveness of three different strategies for integrating MI into
      the practice of healthcare providers working within Yale New Haven Hospital's internal
      medicine hospitalist service and other general medical inpatient units. Specifically, we will
      randomize 40 healthcare providers to one of three conditions: (1) a continuing medical
      education workshop that provides background and &quot;shows&quot; healthcare providers how to conduct
      MI (the control condition, called SEE ONE); (2) a &quot;see one, do one&quot; apprenticeship model
      involving workshop training plus live supervision of bedside practice (DO ONE); and (3)
      ordering MI from CL after learning about it in a workshop (ORDER ONE). Following the
      respective MI trainings, each healthcare provider will be assessed for the provision of MI to
      40 study-eligible inpatients, recruited by the research team after admission to our general
      medical units.

    <description>The percentage of Motivational Interviewing recorded sessions will be verified by audio recordings, conducted among each Healthcare provider's 40 consecutively enrolled study patients.

    <time_frame>All sessions conducted and recorded by the Healthcare provider during the trial period, an expected 24 weeks per Healthcare provider, will serve as the source for obtaining MI adherence and competence data</time_frame>
    <description>We will: 1) calculate mean adherence and competence scores for the two factors (fundamental and advanced MI strategies) identified in prior psychometric analyses;and 2) determine if sessions achieve our criterion level for adequately performing MI namely, at least half the MI consistent items rated average or above for both adherence and competence.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        For Healthcare provider participants:

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Assignment to one of the general medical inpatient units at YNHH during day-time
             shifts; intensive care units will be excluded given the morbidity of patients in this
             setting.

          -  Volunteer to serve as study clinicians, attend a workshop about MI, and possibly
             receive live supervision.

          -  Agree to all procedures of this trial (randomization to training condition and of
             assigned patients, audio recording MI sessions, and completing assessments).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Have been formally supervised to use MI with patients on the units.

          -  Intend to give notice to YNHH that they plan to leave the hospital or are scheduled
             for medical or family leave such that they will not be able to interview 40 patients
             during the study period.

        For patient participants:

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Are 18 years of age or older.

          -  Acknowledge use of a substance within past 28 days and meets screening criteria
             consistent with substance (illicit drugs, licit drugs that are used in a non-medically
             indicated fashion, alcohol, or nicotine) use disorder.

          -  Are willing to consent to audio recording of interview with the Healthcare provider or
             CL psychiatrist.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Have an altered mental status such as delirium, encephalopathy, dementia or mental
             retardation or a score on the Confusion Assessment Method &gt; 0 since this would impair
             provision of consent and ability to participate

          -  Inability to speak English. Most of the Healthcare providers are mono-lingual English
             speakers, and all MI integrity raters only speak English. We therefore do not have the
             capacity to include Spanish-only speaking patients in the study.

          -  Stroke (that precludes participation)

          -  Resides in a nursing home, skilled nursing facility or Hospice Care

          -  Receiving palliative care

          -  Deaf

          -  Unable to speak lucidly

          -  Previous participation in the protocol

        An information sheet was requested and approved for a subset of patient subjects. This is
        due to the study being conducted within an acute medical inpatient unit, where conditions
        that might limit a person's ability to sign the consent form may occasionally occur. This
        subset of patients includes: patients that are physically unable to write (i.e. hand
        tremors, spinal cord injury, stroke that precludes signing, broken hand, broken shoulder,
        muscular dystrophy and other physical ailments preventing a patient from physically
        signing), unable to see (i.e. legally blind, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus which
        led to blurred vision), unable to read (i.e. patient does not have their glasses on them).
