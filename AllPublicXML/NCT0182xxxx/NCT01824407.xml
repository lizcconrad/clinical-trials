  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sponsor of this study, SANUWAVE, Inc., has developed an investigational device known as
      the dermaPACE® (Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression) device for the possible treatment of
      diabetic foot ulcers. This device generates acoustic (sound) pressure waves designed to act
      on the cells in your body to generate proteins that may lead to wound closure. The dermaPACE®
      device has not been approved for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers; therefore its use in
      this study is investigational.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of the dermaPACE® device to help diabetic
      foot ulcers heal more quickly. The active study device, the dermaPACE®, will be compared to
      an inactive look-alike device (called a &quot;Sham&quot;) in this study. The sham device will not
      provide any treatment to your diabetic foot ulcer.
