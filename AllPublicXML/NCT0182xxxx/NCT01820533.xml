  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study ownership and use of cell phones in low-income smokers. This may help us better
      understand the impact of cell phone ownership plans on low income smokers' access to
      quitlines. Use of quitlines may be impeded by limited access to landline phones and limited
      airtime minutes on cell phones.
