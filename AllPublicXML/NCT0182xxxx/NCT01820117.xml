    <textblock>
      While thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) has been a primary component in successful treatment
      of a variety of childhood and adult cancers, the exposure to this treatment has been
      associated with significant cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity in long-term survivors.
      Within non-cancer populations, cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity is associated with
      increased risk for cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs), accelerated brain atrophy and
      neurocognitive impairment. Patients with chronic heart disease demonstrate problems with
      attention, processing speed, memory, and executive functions. Chronic pulmonary disease also
      increases the risk of stroke, leukoencephalopathy, and neurocognitive impairment in
      non-cancer populations. The investigators propose to examine indices of brain integrity,
      including neurocognitive performance and brain MRI/MRA, in long-term adult survivors of
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treated with thoracic radiation and no direct central nervous system
      therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To evaluate brain integrity in adult survivors of childhood HL treated with thoracic
           radiation therapy.

        2. To identify therapeutic factors associated with brain integrity in adult survivors of
           childhood HL who are at risk for cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.

        3. To examine associations between cardiac, vascular and pulmonary health and brain
           integrity in adult survivors of childhood HL treated with thoracic radiation.

      This is an observational study to collect health data from long-term survivors of Hodgkin
      lymphoma (HL). Data will be collected once at participant enrollment. The long-term effects
      of thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) given earlier as part of the treatment for HL will be
      examined in long-term survivors and compared to health data collected from normal volunteers.

      HL survivors who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) with TRT will
      be recruited to complete a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation, brain MRI/MRA, a clinical
      neurological exam, peripheral pulse contour analysis, non-invasive central blood pressure
      monitoring, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and serum biomarkers related to cardiac
      disease. As part of their standard St. Jude LIFE protocol evaluation, they also complete an
      echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests and questionnaires designed to evaluate broad
      health, psychological, socioeconomic and environmental factors that impact everyday life.

      A comparison sample of healthy individuals, frequency-matched on age, sex and race will also
      be recruited. The comparison group will complete the comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation,
      brain MRI/MRA, clinical neurological exam, pulse contour analysis, non-invasive central blood
      pressure monitoring, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Through the St. Jude LIFE
      protocol, the comparison sample will also complete an echocardiogram, pulmonary function
      tests and questionnaires designed to evaluate broad health, psychological, socioeconomic and
      environmental factors that impact everyday life.

    <description>In HL survivors only, outcome variables will be: sustained attention (continuous), memory (continuous), leukoencephalopathy (dichotomous) and hemosiderin deposits (dichotomous). Independent variables are radiation dose to cardiopulmonary structures. Covariates will include chemotherapy exposures, particularly anthracycline exposure. For each continuous response variable, linear regression model will be used to see its association with these independent variables, adjusted for race/age/sex. Other possible covariates include educational attainment, employment and occupation, current physical activity, and alcohol and tobacco. For each dichotomous response variable, logistic regression model will be used to see its association with these independent variables, adjusted for race/age/sex. AIC criteria will be used to select the final model.</description>

        SJLIFE is an institutional initiative to establish a lifetime survivor cohort to study
        physical and behavioral health outcomes in adult survivors of childhood cancer. This
        protocol includes individuals diagnosed and treated with a malignancy during childhood at
        SJCRH since 1962, who are now 10 or more years from diagnosis and over 18 years of age.

        The current study will recruit participants from the SJLIFE cohort who received thoracic
        radiation as part of their treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.

        Potentially eligible comparison group participants will be recruited from the relative or
        friend population who accompany any After Completion of Therapy (ACT) or SJLIFE patient for
        follow-up at SJCRH.
