  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The five proteins of the ITI (Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor) family, are essential components of
      the extracellular matrix, the dynamics of which they participate in the processes of cellular
      differentiation and proliferation. I. The ITIH1, ITIH2, ITIH3 and ITIH4 genes seem to be
      overwhelmingly expressed in the liver, this organ secreting then the corresponding proteins
      in the general circulation. The only data on ITIH5 indicate that this gene is poorly
      expressed in the liver and that the major source of its expression is the placenta. In the
      context of genetic studies on the syndrome of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (congenital
      aplasia of the uterus and vagina), the investigators have shown the involvement of ITIH5 and
      implemented validation experiments of this gene in mice. The investigators have shown that
      the production of ITIH5 by the uterus varies greatly depending on the physiological state of
      this organ, especially during pregnancy and the estrous cycle. The investigators also found
      that most of the production ITIH5 was located in the uterus. Therefore, the serum dosage of
      ITIH5 could be used clinically as a new biological marker specific to the uterus. This
      non-invasive biological marker could thus assist in the diagnosis and the understanding of
      uterine pathologies. ITIH5 rate being correlated to endometrial proliferation, its dosage
      could be an early and non-invasive marker of endometriosis. The peak of production of ITIH5
      by the uterus at the time of embryo implantation window indicates that the assay could
      provide a better assessment of endometrial receptivity to embryo. It then could be a hand
      tool of diagnosis in some cases of early repeated miscarriages, and secondly, a prognostic
      tool for embryo implantation in the context of in vitro fertilization.

      The investigators conducted an initial feasibility study on the serum dosage of ITIH5, which
      was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Rennes. This first step
      has been validated. Now, the project is to perform a quantitative analysis of ITIH5 and to
      correlate clinical and biological data of relevant pathological and physiological situations.
      This project was the subject of a national and international patents of which the University
      Hospital of Rennes is promoter.
