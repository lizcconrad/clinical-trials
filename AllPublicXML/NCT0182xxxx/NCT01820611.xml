      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the Arcos
      Revision Stem system, determine the stability of the implants, and evaluate any relationship
      between Paprosky bone defect level and the success of the Arcos Stem.

      Primary Endpoint: survivorship and revision rate up to 5 years post-operatively Secondary
      Endpoints: Stability and Fixation of Arcos Hip by radiographic assessment, Relationship
      between bone defect level and survivorship, Oxford Hip Score and Harris Hip Score
      post-operative, Adverse events, complications.

      Case Report Forms: Demographic Data, Paprosky Acetabular/Femoral Defects, Operative Data,
      Oxford Hip Score, Harris Hip Score, Collection of X-rays, Radiographic Evaluation form,
      Adverse Events, Revisions, Lost to Follow-up, and Protocol Deviations

      200 patients: 100 with BoneMaster HA, 100 without BoneMaster HA. Up to 10 sites globally will
      be used to fulfill enrollment in this study.

      All cases enrolled will be those implanted with either the Cone, Broached, or Calcar Proximal
      Body and one of the five distal options (Slotted, Bullet-tip, Interlocking, STS, or ETO).

      To be included in the study, a patient must have received a revision total hip arthroplasty
      with the Arcos system. The Arcos system is to be used in accordance to the indications for
      use and contraindications detailed in the approved labeling of the device.

      Study time perspective:

      Collection of retrospective data in supplement to the data collected in the course of the
      prospective study to compensate total enrolment goal. This is applicable for 3 sites:
      Finland, United Kingdom (NHS Sheffield), Spain.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be followed up as tot he same time points for the
      duration of the study.
