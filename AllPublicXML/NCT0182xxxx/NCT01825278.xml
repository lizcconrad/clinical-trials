    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate the clinical applicability of the ExSpiron Respiratory Volume
      Monitor (RVM, ExSpiron™, Respiratory Motion, Inc.; Waltham, MA) in obese surgical patients
      undergoing general anesthesia. Previous work has demonstrated the ability of the ExSpiron
      monitor to provide non-invasive, real-time, continuous measurements of respiratory parameters
      such as tidal volume (TV), minute ventilation (MV) and respiratory rate (RR) mostly in normal
      weight patients but those studies did not specifically look at obese subjects. Respiratory
      depression, in the postoperative setting due to residual anesthetics and/or opioid
      administration, continues to be a significant cause of adverse outcomes. Obese patients are
      at increased risk for respiratory complications. Currently, there is no objective measure of
      early respiratory indicators for developing respiratory compromise. Current respiratory
      assessment in non-intubated patients relies on oximetry data and subjective clinical
      assessment. Pulse oximetry has been extremely helpful in recognizing oxygen desaturations but
      it is a late indicator of respiratory decline. There is no current device capable of giving
      real time ventilatory information such as tidal volume and minute ventilation of a patient
      that is not mechanically ventilated. The ExSpiron system utilizes an impedance based
      technology and proprietary algorithms (Respiratory Motion Inc.) to obtain these measurements.
      The study hypotheses are that the non-invasive, impedance-based RVM monitor will accurately
      reflect TV, RR and MV in obese surgical patients before induction of general anesthesia,
      during controlled ventilation and following extubation; that ExSpiron will accurately reflect
      the post-extubation respiratory status of the patient; and that apnea and hypopnea episodes
      in the recovery room as detected by the ExSpiron monitor are correlated with the individual
      risk for obstructive sleep apnea as determined by the STOP-Bang risk stratification.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ExSpiron monitor accurately reflects TV, MV and RR in obese patients in the preoperative holding area before surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>1 - 1.5 hours before surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will have a monitoring strip applied to right chest in the pre op holding area, and respiratory data will be recorded to the monitor. These will be compared with data from a manual handheld spirometer via 5 recordings over a time period of 5 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ExSpiron will accurately reflect the post-extubation respiratory status of the patient</measure>
    <time_frame>1 - 3 hours in the recovery room</time_frame>
    <description>Patient will continue to be monitored for MV, TV and RR after surgery in the recovery room, until recovery from anesthesia up to 3 hours. Respiratory data will be recorded to the monitor. These will be compared with data from a manual handheld spirometer via 3 recordings over a time period of 3 minutes. The change in the respiratory values to preoperative baseline will also be compared</description>

    <measure>apnea and hypopnea episodes in the recovery room detected by the ExSpiron monitor are correlated with the individual risk for obstructive sleep apnea</measure>

    <description>The pattern of respiration as assessed by the Exspiron monitor continued in the recovery room after surgery will be correlated with the patients OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionaire</description>

    <description>Monitoring sensors will be applied to patient's right chest and the monitoring device will collect breathing parameters such as breathing rate and volumes before, during and after the procedure until patient is ready to leave the recovery room. At the beginning and at the end of the study investigator will perform a one-time measurement of patient's respiratory parameters using a standard handheld spirometer. This is a non-invasive device that is commonly used in clinical care not related to research.</description>
