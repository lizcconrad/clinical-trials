  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Vascular grafts are increasingly implanted due to an increasing prevalence of
      atherosclerosis and diabetes, and about 1-6% of vascular procedures are complicated by
      infection. Mortality attributable to prosthetic vascular graft infections (PVGI) is high.
      However, there are almost no data regarding best treatment options of such complicated
      infections. Most recommendations are based on expert opinion and not on clinical trials or
      cohort observational data analyses. Evaluating infectious and other complications after
      vascular surgery procedures are important, and additionally, such studies may offer insights
      for quality improvement and improved patient outcomes. With the first aim investigators will
      establish an infrastructure for studying PVGI in Zurich. Investigators will take advantage of
      the Swissvasc registry, a central registry which collects preoperative, operative and
      discharge data regarding the index vascular surgical interventions. They will create a
      prospective observational cohort database of all patients who receive a vascular graft
      (peripheral, aortic, vein) at the University hospital of Zurich (VASGRA Cohort A). Patients
      with a PVGI will be included in VASGRA Cohort B and followed up using a flow chart with a
      focus on the course of this infectious complication. Additionally, investigators will
      establish a biobank with the collection of tissue- and blood samples of patients with PVGI.
      With the second aim researchers will investigate different diagnostic, clinical and
      therapeutic research questions nested in the VASGRA Cohort. Firstly, they will address
      epidemiological questions, such as: determine the incidence and outcome of complications
      after vascular graft placement; determine risk factors, best treatment strategies and outcome
      of PVGI, and determine the influence of different antibiotic regimens on the outcome of PVGI
      due to different bacterial pathogens. Secondly, investigators will determine the accuracy of
      different imaging techniques (PET/CT and MRI) for the diagnosis of PVGI, and their individual
      role for the assessment of treatment response. Thirdly, investigators will evaluate the
      bacterial diversity of vascular wound infections using 16s r-Ribonucleic acid
      (RNA)amplification, and investigators will explore whether this bacterial diversity does
      predict disease progression. Here, investigators will also study the impact of negative
      pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on bacterial diversity in the treatment course of PVGI.
      Fourthly, investigators will look for cut-off levels of relevant blood leucocytes count,
      C-reactive protein and procalcitonin raising suspicion of a PVGI. Lastly, investigators will
      look at histopathological features of excised vascular grafts. Expected value of the project:
      Results from the proposed study are an important contribution to the field, based on the
      large sample size, longitudinal design and by unifying clinical and epidemiological science.
      The very well characterized patient groups and the close connection between vascular
      surgeons, infectious disease specialists, specialists in nuclear medicine and microbiologist
      will help to investigate PVGI in depths. Investigators hope to be able to develop guidelines
      regarding best diagnostic modalities and treatment options in case of vascular graft
      infections. In the future we plan to examine bacteria retrieved from the PVGI in the
      laboratory in detail. The recovered bacteria will be examined for antimicrobial
      susceptibility and their capability to form biofilms. Furthermore investigators will examine
      how bacterial recovery form explanted grafts could be optimized.
