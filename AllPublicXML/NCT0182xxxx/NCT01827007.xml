  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether fluid responsiveness of the critically ill
      patient can be assessed by analysing the PEEP-induced hemodynamic effects to systolic blood
      pressure, pulse pressure, aortic blood flow, aortic time-velocity integral and left
      ventricular end diastolic area measured with transesophageal echocardiography (PEEP-test).
      The chances are compared to increase of CI after volume expansion (gold standard). In
      clinical practise, it would be especially relevant if PEEP-induced changes in arterial
      pressure variations could be used in evaluation of volume status and fluid responsiveness.
      However, as ECHO-derived variables are used in greater extent to guide the treatment with
      inappropriate evidence, the simultaneous registration of ECHO-derived hemodynamic
      measurements is essential in the study design.
