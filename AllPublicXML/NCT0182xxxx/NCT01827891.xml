    <textblock>
      This single-center, randomized controlled trial is to investigate the impact of remote
      ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on the risk contrast-induced acute kidney injury and its
      long-term impact on renal function for patients with diabetes undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention in Beijing
      Anzhen Hospital were enrolled, and all the eligible participants were randomized to either
      remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) group or control group. Those randomized to RIPC group
      had a pneumatic medical tourniquet cuff (width , 5 cm ; length , 40 cm) placed around their
      upper arm at &lt; 2 hours before the PCI procedure. The pneumatic medical cuff was inflated to a
      pressure of 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes , followed by 5 minutes of deflation to allow
      reperfusion. This procedure was repeated for 3 times. Control participants did not experience
      this procedure of transient upper-limb ischemia.
