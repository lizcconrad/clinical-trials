  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present project hypothesizes that the potential protective effect of olive oil relies on
      its polyphenols profile (quality and quantity) and that it may be synergistic to other food
      components. Among the nutrients that may be of interest for bone and muscle tissues,
      unsaturated fatty acids and vitamins are the most described.

      Consequently, based on the promising available preliminary data, the present project aims to
      investigate the possible preventive effect of olive oil polyphenols and eventually the
      synergistic effects of fatty acids and vitamin D on bone, muscle and adipose tissue, in order
      to prevent any locomotor dysfunction.

      Volunteers will be supplemented during 9 months. The primary and secondary outcome measures
      will be performed at baseline, 3 and 9 months.
