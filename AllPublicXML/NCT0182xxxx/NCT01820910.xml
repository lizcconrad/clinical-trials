  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective of this trial is to establish the efficacy of an upfront targeted therapy
      consisting of Chlamydophila psittaci (Cp)-eradicating therapy with prolonged administration
      of doxycycline followed by eradication monitoring and antibiotic re-treatment at infection
      re-occurrence in patients with newly diagnosed ocular adnexae marginal zone lymphoma The
      primary endpoint is the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with newly
      diagnosed stage-IE lymphoma treated with the experimental strategy.

    <description>All enrolled patients will be treated with doxycycline 100 mg bid daily, orally, for four weeks followed by four weeks rest, repeated for three cycles. Response will be assessed by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and ophthalmologic examination at the end of the planned treatment. Patients who will achieve complete response, partial response or have a stable disease at 3 months from upfront doxycycline will be monitored for infection re-occurrence and assessed for response with MRI and ophthalmologist evaluation every six months for the first five years.</description>

          3. Absence of B symptoms

          4. Previously untreated patients

          5. No systemic antibiotic therapy in the last three months before enrolment

         10. No previous or concurrent malignancies with the exception of surgically cured
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma of the skin or other cancers without
             evidence of disease at least from 5 years

         11. Absence of any familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule

         12. Sexually active patients of childbearing potential must implement adequate
             contraceptive measures during study participation

         13. No concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs

          3. Patients unwilling to comply with the requirements of follow-up

          4. Myasthenia gravis (tetracycline can exacerbate muscle weakness)
