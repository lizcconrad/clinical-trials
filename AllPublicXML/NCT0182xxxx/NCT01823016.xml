  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of JNJ-38518168 compared with placebo in participants with
      persistent asthma that is inadequately controlled despite current treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be randomized (treatment group assigned by chance, like flipping a coin),
      double-blind (study investigators and participants will not know what treatment is being
      administered), and placebo-controlled (a placebo is identical to the study agent, but
      contains no active ingredients). A total of 160 participants will receive either placebo or
      JNJ-38518168 once daily. The study duration will be approximately 32 weeks and will include a
      screening phase of approximately 4 weeks, a 24-week placebo-controlled treatment phase, and a
      4-week follow-up phase. Participant safety will be monitored throughout the entire study
      period..
