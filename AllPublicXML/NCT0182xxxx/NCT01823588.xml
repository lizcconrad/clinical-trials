  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of strategies have been evaluated to improve the prevention and control of the main
      cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors. Nursing telephonic and tele-counseling individualized
      lifestyle educational programs were found to improve blood pressure (BP) control and
      adherence to healthy lifestyle. This study aims at evaluating for the first time the efficacy
      of a nurse-led reminder program through email (NRP-e) to improve CVD risk factors among
      hypertensive adults.

      Participants will receive usual care and a guideline-based educational program on BP control
      and healthy lifestyle habits. Subjects in the NRP-e group will also receive weekly email
      alerts and phone calls from a nurse care manager for 6 months. Emails contain a reminder
      program on the compliance with a healthy lifestyle based upon current guidelines for CVD
      prevention. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 1, 3 and 6 months after enrollment;
      randomization will be made centrally and blood samples will be evaluated into a single,
      accredited laboratory.
