  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immediate and delayed complications related to the surgical procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Serious surgical complications are categorised as any surgical event which is potentially life-threatening, internal organ perforation (or other injury), bleeding in excess of 1000 mL or adverse events, related to the surgical procedure, during follow-up which requires re-hospitalisation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy outcome is a composite of objective and subjective measures including POP-Q stage 0 or 1 of the upper vaginal segment (i.e., point C/D, which represents the most distal point of the vaginal apex in relation to the total vaginal length) and a negative response to the question, &quot;Do you experience a feeling of bulging or protrusion in the vaginal area?&quot; (question 16 on the UDI). The secondary outcome measures further include the individual components of the composite end point, other POP-Q measurements and patient-reported urogenital distress.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transvaginal suture capturing mesh device</intervention_name>
    <description>The Uphold™ LITE vaginal support system is an intra-vaginal approach to apical and anterior vaginal wall prolapse repair that utilizes a suture capturing device to place the mesh. After primary dissection the suturing device is used to pull the mesh through the sacrospinous ligament, medial to the ischial spine. An anterior colporraphy was allowed following the Uphold™ LITE procedure at the discretion of the surgeon if deemed necessary.</description>
