    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the short-term
      (6 week) and long-term (6 month) effect of chiropractic care combined with a specific
      nutritional supplement regimen to chiropractic care with a placebo supplement for patients
      with ankle sprains, in terms of improvement in physical function and pain.

      Specific Aim 1: to compare the short-term (6 week) effect of chiropractic care combined with
      a specific nutritional supplement regimen to chiropractic care with a placebo nutritional
      supplement for patients with ankle sprains, in terms of speed and amount of improvement in
      physical function and pain. Our hypothesis is that chiropractic care plus nutritional
      supplements designed to supply necessary nutrients for ligament healing will have improved
      outcomes in pain and disability, compared to chiropractic care plus placebo. We will use the
      Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activities of Daily Living Subscale (FAAM ADLS) to measure
      outcomes.

      Specific aim 2: to compare the long-term (6 month) effect of chiropractic care combined with
      a specific nutritional supplement regimen to chiropractic care with a placebo nutritional
      supplement for patients with ankle sprains, in terms of speed and amount of improvement in
      physical function and pain. Our hypothesis is that chiropractic care plus nutritional
      supplements designed to supply necessary nutrients for ligament healing will have improved
      outcomes as measured by the FAAM ADLS, compared to chiropractic care plus placebo.

      Specific aim 3: to explore any changes in the attitude, knowledge and behavior of
      chiropractic interns and practitioners of the role of nutrition in treating musculoskeletal
      injuries, pre- and post-intervention. We will also compare their responses to those of a
      population of students and practitioners who did not participate in the project, as a
      comparison group.

    <description>Acute phase (1st treatment through Week 4): Ligaplex 1. Ligaplex 1 supplies nutrients to support connective tissue and reduce inflammation. The protocol is commonly used in chiropractic practice and suggested by Standard Process: 2 capsules 3 x day.
Chronic phase (Weeks 5-16): Glucosamine Synergy. This supplement maintains connective tissue and joint health. The protocol is commonly used in chiropractic practice and suggested by Standard Process: 1 capsule 3 x day.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute ankle sprain, defined as ankle sprain within the past 7 days, by patient report.
             Treating clinician will verify diagnosis via clinical examination.

          -  Ages 18-50; ankle sprains are more common in this age group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of grade III ankle sprain, fracture or dislocation; fracture will be
             diagnosed using the Ottawa ankle rules11,12

          -  Contraindications to chiropractic care, such as fracture or other abnormalities found
             by history, examination, or x-rays, as determined by the treating or supervising
             clinician.

          -  Pregnancy: although it is unlikely that the nutritional supplements would have adverse
             effects on the fetus, we are excluding pregnant women as a safeguard.

          -  Unwilling or unable to regularly take the supplements (e.g., vegetarians; known
             sensitivity by self-report; patients will be shown the ingredient list prior to
             signing the informed consent).

          -  Litigation for a health-related claim (in process or pending).

          -  History of ankle surgery or presence of ankle hardware (pins, screws, etc.), by
             patient report.

          -  History of diabetic or other peripheral neuropathy, by patient report.

          -  Current use of prescription or nonprescription medications that may interact with
             experimental or placebo supplements, by patient report.
