  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Readmission to a hospital shortly after discharge is a common and costly problem. In the
      United States patients with a diagnosis of heart failure currently experience an elevated 30
      day readmission rate of approximately 20%. By providing patients with medication related
      counseling at discharge by a pharmacist, home medications at discharge, and seeing the
      patient again in a pharmacist-run Medication Therapy Management (MTM) clinic 7 days after
      discharge, the study anticipates achieving its primary goal of showing a reduction in the
      readmission rate. Secondary goals are: 1) to determine patients understanding of the
      medication they are taking, 2) to evaluate satisfaction with the comprehensive discharge
      counseling service, and 3) determine the number of interventions made and benefit of the MTM
      clinic.

      The active arm of this study (medication related hospital discharge counseling by a
      pharmacist, home medications, and 7 day follow-up visit at a pharmacist run MTM clinic) is
      available to all subjects. To study the primary goal of reducing the 30 day readmission rate
      the data obtained from the active arm subjects will be compared to a match group of
      hospitalized patients that were previously discharged with a diagnosis of heart failure. The
      data for all secondary study goals will be obtained directly from the active arm subjects.
