    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to combine and adapt Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
      + Safety Planning Intervention (SPI) for individuals with suicidal behavior and to determine
      its feasibility, acceptability, safety and preliminary effectiveness. An exploratory aim is
      to collect data on the cognitive changes underlying treatment gains.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The study is a nine-week clinical trial combining Safety Planning Intervention plus
           Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for patients with a recent history of suicidal
           thoughts or behavior and current or past depressive symptoms.

        -  These treatments work for depression and some preliminary data suggest they may work to
           prevent suicidal behavior.

        -  Participation includes:

             -  Nine weeks of free treatment

             -  Clinical assessments

             -  An opportunity to offer your views on treatment and suggestions for improving the
                treatment in focus groups
