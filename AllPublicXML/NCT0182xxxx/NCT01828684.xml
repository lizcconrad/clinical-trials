  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 9% of men and 18% of women suffer from migraine headaches. Almost all migraine
      sufferers report light sensitivity during a headache. Some people with migraine report that
      light can trigger their migraines and some people with migraine are light sensitive all of
      the time. The investigators have recently determined that certain colors of light are more
      likely to trigger migraines than other colors. In this study the investigators want to know
      if people who wear glasses that block these colors of light will have fewer migraine
      headaches.
