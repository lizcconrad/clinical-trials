  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All trauma patients admitted to certain Intensive Care Units (ICU) will have
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal swabs performed to determine MRSA
      colonization status. Only those patients who are determined to be colonized with MRSA at
      admission will be included in the study. All patients must be age 18 and older, admitted
      directly to the ICU from either the Emergency Department or the operating room with
      trauma-related injuries, and must not have active or recent known history of MRSA infections.
      Once patients have been determined to be colonized with MRSA, they will be randomized to
      receive &quot;decolonization&quot; treatment or placebo. &quot;Decolonization&quot; treatment will include
      Chlorhexidine baths and Mupirocin ointment to both nares for 5 days and placebo will entail
      &quot;routine&quot; soap baths and Lubricating Jelly. Both groups will be kept on standard contact
      precautions throughout the course of the study. Repeat nasal swabs will be performed at the
      completion of the treatment regimen to determine the efficacy. Patients will be screened for
      invasive MRSA infections as dictated by their clinical course. The primary outcome measure
      will be invasive MRSA infection rate (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, bacteremia and soft
      tissue infection). Secondary endpoints include hospital lengths of stay, ICU lengths of stay,
      mechanical ventilatory support requirements, colonization status at the end of treatment, and
      death rates. As determined by our power analysis, we aim to enroll 75 patients in each arm
      over the course of 12-24 months.

      Partway through the enrollment period, it was determined that in the best interests of the
      patients, the protocol would be altered to eliminate the randomization process and treat all
      patients with the decolonization treatment regimen.
