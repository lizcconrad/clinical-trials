    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine used widely throughout the world. Because
      of this it is a useful vaccine in which to develop new methods for studying immune responses.
      Measuring the immune response to vaccines helps us to understand how they work and whether
      they are likely to protect any individual against infection. For most vaccines we measure the
      immune system's production of antibody after a vaccine has been given. The investigators want
      to develop new methods that give a far more detailed picture of the antibody response to
      vaccines than has previously been possible. These methods will investigate the genetic
      instructions used by each antibody producing cell to make antibody. These methods have the
      potential to give new insights into the way vaccines work, which could be applied to studying
      vaccines and vaccine schedules in the future.

    <measure>Part 2- To assess B cell VH/L gene segment usage by HepB specific B cells during and following administration of a three dose course of HepB vaccine given at 0,1, 2 or 0, 1, 6 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 7 days after the second immunisation, and 0, 7 and 40 days after the third immunisation</time_frame>
    <description>HepB specific cells will be isolated using magnetic-activated cell sorting, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. VH/L gene segments will be amplified by PCR, and DNA prepared for sequencing. Bioinformatic approaches will then be used to create frequency tables of the different V, D and J exons that comprise these gene segments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1- To validate B cell assays and assess the kinetics of HepB specific B cell subsets following administration of a booster dose of HepB vaccine given to previously immunised healthy adults.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after immunisation</time_frame>
    <description>HepB specific B cell subsets will be identified using both ELISPOT and flow cytometry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1 • To measure HepB surface antigen-specific antibody concentration following administration of a booster dose of HepB vaccine given to previously immunised healthy adults</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 28 days after immunisation</time_frame>
    <description>Antibody concentrations will be determined from blood plasma using an ELISA</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1 • To assess B-cell receptor VH/L gene sequences used in HepB specific and non-antigen specific B-cells prior to and following administration of a booster dose of HepB vaccine given to previously immunised healthy adults</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after immunisation</time_frame>
    <description>VH/L gene segments will be amplified by PCR, and DNA prepared for sequencing. Bioinformatic approaches will then be used to create frequency tables of the different V, D and J exons that comprise these gene segments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1 • Comparison of B cell receptor VH/L gene segment usage as determined by two different next-generation sequencing methods (RNA-sequencing and 454).</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after immunisation, as required</time_frame>
    <description>Different sequencing protocols introduce different types of error and bias into the resulting sequence datasets. VH/L gene segments will sequenced using two different techniques. Bioinformatic approaches and descriptive analysis will then be used to compare the effects of the two different protocols. Frequency tables of the different V, D and J exons that comprise these gene segments will be generated, for comparison.</description>
