    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of etomidate versus ketamine during rapid
      sequence intubation (RSI). RSI refers to the process by which patients who require emergency
      airway management undergo sedation and paralysis prior to insertion of an endotracheal
      tube(airway tube). Patients who require intubation will be randomized to have intubation
      performed with either ketamine or etomidate. All other care will be at the discretion of the
      treating physicians. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of
      ketamine and etomidate during rapid sequence intubation.

    <description>Evaluate mortality for the sub-group diagnosed with sepsis and septic shock, defined as:
- Suspected infection, and at least 2 of 4 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria:
Temperature &gt;38C or &lt;36C
Respiratory Rate &gt;20 or PaCO2 &lt;32 mmHg
Heart Rate &gt;90
White blood cell count &gt;12,000 or &lt;4,000, or &gt; 10% bands
Septic shock:
defined as sepsis plus either: 1) Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 after 1L of intravenous fluid or 2) lactate &gt;=4mmol/L</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>First-pass success</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes (average time frame)</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of first pass success, defined as successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt. An attempt is defined as the insertion and subsequent removal of the laryngoscopic device from the patient's mouth, regardless of whether an endotracheal tube was inserted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of intubation attempts</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes (average time frame)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of total attempts required to intubate each patient will be compared. One attempt is defined as the insertion and subsequent removal of the laryngoscopic device from the patient's mouth, regardless of whether an endotracheal tube was inserted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-intubation sedation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The number of bolus doses of sedative administered post-intubation will be compared up to 6 hours (including morphine, dexmedetomidine, propofol , etomidate, ketamine, lorazepam (Ativan), midazolam (Versed), diazepam (Valium), fentanyl, hydromorphone (Dilaudid)). Infusions of these medications will be recorded separately but will not be part of this outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-intubation hypoxemia</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The following will be compared between the two groups:
Hypoxemia and severe hypoxemia during and the 5 minutes immediately following intubation
Hypoxemia within the first 2 hours intubation
Hypoxemia is defined as SpO2 less than 90%. Severe hypoxemia is defined as SpO2 less than 90% for 60 seconds or more.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypotension</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The following will be compared between the two groups:
Hypotension in the ED post-intubation
Hypotension within the first 6 hours of the hospital stay
Hypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak and Plateau pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes (average time frame)</time_frame>
    <description>The Peak and plateau pressures will be compared between the two groups, with a pre-defined subgroup analysis of patients who are being intubated for severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Days or Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Mortality will be assessed at 30 days or at discharge from the hospital, whichever occurs first. This study is not powered to detect a significant difference in mortality, however; this will primarily be a safety study comparing the use ketamine versus etomidate as sedative agents for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the Emergency Department (ED).</description>

             illness.

          -  Patient declines participation in the trial by wearing a bracelet marked &quot;KvE
