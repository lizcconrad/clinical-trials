    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness characterized by persistent widespread muscle pain with
      generalised hyperalgesia and allodynia. It can be accompanied by other concomitant symptoms:
      fatigue, sleep disturbances, musculoskeletal disorders, distress and psychological disorders.
      The prevalence has been reported to be between 2 and 5%.

      The hypothesis of this study is that women with fibromyalgia present high risk of falls and
      balance disorders compared with healthy women. The objective of this study was to investigate
      wether gait pattern changes in single and dual task conditions were associated with the risk
      of falling in women with fibromyalgia.

      Falls and fall-related injuries are a common health problem. A fall is often a result of
      intrinsic physiological ageing and underlying chronic disease interacting with the external
      and challenging environment. Disturbances in physical function, muscle strength, range of
      motion, poor balance, affectation in sensory system, a loss of proprioception, alteration
      concerning visual and vestibular aspects, dizziness, decreased endurance and cognitive and
      mobility impairment are the most common risk factors for falls. Postural control in a dual
      task setting is especially relevant to daily life situations. Attending to that, we propose
      an assessment based on these parameters in women with fibromyalgia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up &amp; Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This test timed in seconds measure the time taken by the participant to stand up from an arm chair, walk 3 metres at normal pace, turn around, walk back and sit down. They start to the order of &quot;Go!&quot; A stopwatch was used to measure the time. The TUG is a frequently used test to assess mobility and fall risks in older adults and is recommended by American Geriatrics Society (2011) as a screening tool.
The timed up and go combined with a cognitive task was also measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional reach test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is a quick and simple test. It score the maximal distance one can reach forward beyond arm's length, while maintaining a fixed base of support in the standing position. The subject is asked to reach forward as far as possible without taking a step or touching the wall. It measure the ability of maintain balance during a functional task. It has been shown to be predictive of falls. It was tested with a tape measure on the wall using the head of the metacarpal of the third finger as the reference point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single leg stance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a frequently clinical tool used to assess balance and postural steadiness. In the start position the person stand erect with arm folded across chest and the head facing straight ahead; shoes off. The subject is asked to lift one leg off the floor, based on preference of subject and keep the leg raised as long as possible without touching the other leg. Timer is stopped whether the subject's raised foot either touches the floor, makes contact with other leg or moves the stance foot to create a new base of support,if the arms move out of the test position or when a maximum balance time of 30s take place. The time was measured with a stopwatch.</description>
