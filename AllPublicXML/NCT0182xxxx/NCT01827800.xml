      This purpose of this trial is to determine whether a 12-month eHealth behavioral intervention
      that includes interactive self-monitoring and feedback, tailored skills training materials,
      telephone counseling calls, and primary care physician (PCP) counseling will produce greater
      weight change at 12 months than a standard primary care control.

    <textblock>
      This is a patient randomized trial in which patients will be randomized into one of two
      treatment arms: 1) standard primary care; or 2) primary care plus a 12-month eHealth
      behavioral intervention (iOTA), which includes interactive self-monitoring and feedback,
      tailored skills training materials, 18 telephone counseling calls, and primary care provider
      counseling. The primary outcome is weight change at 12 months. Participants will be 351 adult
      male and female patients from local community health centers with obesity and a related
      comorbidity.

    <measure>An evaluation of the intervention's impact and dissemination potential using the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>RE-AIM was originally developed as a framework for consistent reporting of research results and later used to organize reviews of the existing literature on health promotion and disease management in different settings. The acronym stands for Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance which together determine public health impact. More recently, RE-AIM has been used to translate research into practice and to help plan programs and improve their chances of working in &quot;real-world&quot; settings. The framework has also been used to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to health promotion and chronic disease self-management-such as in-person counseling, group education classes, telephone counseling, and internet resources.</description>

    <description>This trial involves a multi-level, systems-change weight loss intervention. At the provider level, we make it easier for PCPs to deliver weight loss counseling by embedding patient progress data and counseling recommendations in the electronic health record. At the patient level, we provide engaging self-monitoring interfaces, immediate tailored feedback, skills training, and evidence-based lifestyle counseling from trusted care providers.</description>
