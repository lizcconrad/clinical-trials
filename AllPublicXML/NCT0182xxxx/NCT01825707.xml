    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the absorption, metabolism, and excretion (AME)
      kinetics of YH4808 and to determine and characterize metabolites present in plasma, urine,
      and feces in man following a single dose of [14C] YH4808 200 mg (~100 µCi ±20 µCi)
      administered as a single oral dose.

      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28
      days prior to Study Entry (ie, prior to Check-in [Day -1]). Subjects will be confined at the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from Check in (Day -1) until Discharge Criteria have been met
      (as early as Day 6 and as late as Day 11). In this study design, physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, How do you feel? (HDYF?) Inquiries, and clinical
      laboratory evaluations will be performed at Screening, at specified times during the study,
      and/or at Clinic Discharge. All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical
      examination, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from dosing on Day 1 until Clinic
      Discharge [Day 11]).
