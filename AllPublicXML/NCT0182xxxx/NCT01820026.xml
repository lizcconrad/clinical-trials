  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial infections are a frequent complication in liver cirrhosis with a bad prognosis.
      However, the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients with serious infections is significantly
      improved over the last 30 years due to early diagnosis and to the use of a more appropriate
      antibiotic therapy.

      As in the general population, empirical treatment should be initiated soon after diagnosis,
      after making the necessary sampling and should be based on the use of an antibiotic with low
      toxicity and broad spectrum antibacterial efficacy, taking into account the local
      epidemiology and prevalence of antibiotic resistance.

      The third generation cephalosporins are considered the gold standard in the treatment of most
      infections in cirrhotics due to their effectiveness against enterobacteriaceae and against
      non-enterococcal streptococci and due to their low toxicity.

      However, the recommendations for the antibiotic therapy are currently based on results of
      trials of '80s and '90s, when the proportion of resistant pathogens was lower. Similarly to
      nosocomial infections, the increasing rate of infections due to multidrug resistant (MDR)
      bacteria represents the rational for a different choice of empirical antibiotic therapy with
      a higher resistance barrier. This change in the epidemiology of community acquired infections
      is mainly due to the increased contacts with healthcare system of these patients and for the
      larger use of antibiotic prophylaxis. With this regard, it was recently proposed to introduce
      a third epidemiological class of infection &quot;Health care-associated&quot;: Infections occurring in
      community in patients who have been in contact with the health system shortly before the
      infection.

      This epidemiological class of infection should be distinguished from &quot;community-acquired&quot;
      because they are more similar to&quot;nosocomial&quot; in terms of their sensitivity to antibiotics.
      Therefore for this class should be taken into consideration the use of a different empirical
      antibiotic therapy.

      The investigators aim was to evaluate prospectively the effectiveness of a broad spectrum
      antibiotic treatment in a cohort of cirrhotic patients with &quot;healthcare-Associated&quot;infections

      Cirrhotic patients with &quot;Healthcare Associated&quot; admitted to the gastroenterology department
      of the Policlinico Umberto I and in the Department of Hepatology of the Hospital of Marino
      will be consecutively enrolled.

      Randomized controlled trial with randomisation stratified by epidemiological class of
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unblinded randomized controlled trial with randomisation stratified by epidemiological class
      of infection.

      After obtaining informed consent at enrollment, participants will undergo medical examination
      with a detailed anamnesis and will begin collecting data on the following parameters:

        -  Demographic characteristics (age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, when the diagnosis was
           made).

        -  Severity of liver disease(defined by the Child-Pugh classification, MELD score), indices
           of renal function and serum electrolytes.

        -  APACHE score in the case of development of sepsis

        -  Compensated cirrhosis / decompensated cirrhosis

        -  If decompensated, will be listed complications (ascites, esophageal-gastric varices,
           hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, variceal bleeding).

        -  Treatment and dosage (eg Î²-blockers, diuretics)

        -  Hemodynamic parameters (heart rate / blood pressure)

      Patients enrolled will be randomized and treated with conventional therapy provided for
      community-acquired infections or with the &quot;2nd line antibiotic therapy&quot;, based on use of of
      imipenem-cilastatin.

      The protocol of antibiotic therapy chosen for this category of patients will be based on a
      antibiotic class recommended for a specific site of infection in international guidelines for
      the treatment of nosocomial infections and / or healthcare associated with a high safety
      profile and is already used in the investigators hospital. The cost of empirical treatment
      with imipenem / cilastatin is roughly comparable to that with the currently used first-line
      antibiotics for such infections, and frequently used drugs in the forefront of these patients
      are ineffective is therefore necessary to embark on a new antibiotic with higher costs also
      in terms of days of hospitalization.

      During the hospitalization will be recorded the type of infection, empirical therapy, its
      duration, side effects, isolated pathogens and their resistance, when available, the
      occurrence of complications related to infection and mortality.

      The efficacy of therapy will be assessed based on the resolution of infection attested by
      normalization of clinical , biochemical and microbiological parameters and the instrumental
      tools.
