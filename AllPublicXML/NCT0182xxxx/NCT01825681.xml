  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life Enhancing Activities for Family Caregivers is a six-week program designed to increase
      positive affect in people who care for a family member with dementia. The intervention
      consists of 6 weekly one-hour sessions conducted one-on-one with a trained facilitator to
      teach simple skills that are practiced at home in a study-supplied workbook. The program is
      preceded and followed by a 30-45 minute questionnaire. Follow-up assessments will be
      conducted at 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months post intervention.

      Primary hypothesis is that experimental subjects who participate in LEAF will demonstrate
      significantly greater improvements in psychological outcomes and will engage in more problem
      focused and positive appraisal forms of coping compared to the wait-list control condition.

      All study activities can be conducted from the participant's home, making participation
      possible for any qualified caregiver with computer and wifi access, in any U.S. state. The
      LEAF study will supply the tablet computer, software, and workbook required for
      participation.

    <measure>repeated measures of the modified version of the Differential Emotions Scale(DES) (Izard 1977)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and weeks 6 and 10; 3-months and 6-months post.</time_frame>
    <description>The DES will be used to assess positive and negative affect. This 20-item version of the DES was modified to include additional positive affect items as well as those that are likely to tap into trait positive affectivity. The full scale assesses interest, enjoyment, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, guilt, shame, shyness, amusement, awe, contentment, gratitude, hope, love, pride, sympathy, and sexual feelings (e.g., &quot;I felt sexual, desiring, and flirtatious&quot;). The scale can be scored for total positive and negative affect,grouped according to where they would fall on the circumplex model of affect (e.g., high activation vs. lower activation),or individual affects can be examined. In student samples this modified DES has shown acceptable reliability with the positive affects subscale (α = .79) and the negative affects subscale (α = .69).</description>
