    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study tests an adapted critical time intervention model for
      veterans discharged from a psychiatric inpatient unit. It is hypothesized that veterans on
      the inpatient unit who are assigned to such a community-based team will have shorter lengths
      of inpatient stay and better mental health. There have been few developments of
      community-based models of care in the post-deinstitutionalization era of short inpatient
      stays and the results of the study may inform how inpatient stays can be further reduced.
