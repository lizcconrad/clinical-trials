      The aim of is to test the effects of a model for care (case management) to older people with
      high healthcare consumption and functional dependency on healthcare consumption, quality of
      life, functional ability and experiences of care.

    <description>Nurses and a physiotherapist (PT) worked as case managers (CM). The intervention lasted 12 months and comprised 4 dimensions. The first was traditional CM tasks: assessment, planning, monitoring, care coordination and evaluation. Home visits were made at least once a month. The second and third was general and specific information related to the participants' situation. The fourth part included aspects of continuity and safety. The PT also paid home visits and made an assessment regarding physical function and balance. The intervention consisted of multidimensional prevention of falls and/or consequences of falls, and supporting and motivating the participant to increased physical activity. When those in the control group had participated for 12 months they were offered the intervention.</description>
