    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the HOPE-4 Phases (HT and CVD) is to develop, implement and evaluate
      an evidence-based, contextually appropriate programme for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
      assessment, treatment and control involving: (1) simplified algorithms implemented by
      non-physician health workers (NPHW) and supported by e-health technologies (tablets
      programmed with decision and counselling support software); (2) initiation of evidence-based
      cardiovascular (CV) medications and (3) treatment supporters to optimize long-term medication
      and lifestyle adherence.

      Study design: open-label, parallel cluster randomized controlled trial design.

      HT Phase: Up to 30 urban and rural communities in Canada, Colombia and Malaysia will be
      randomized to participate in an intensive CV risk detection and control programme by NPHW or
      to care as usual for 12 months. NOTE: Canada will serve as a pilot study, which will be used
      to evaluate feasibility, time, cost and program improvements.

      CVD Phase: If funded, this phase will be a continuation and expansion of HT Phase to include
      up to 190 urban and rural communities in countries within Asia, South America, Sub-Saharan
      Africa, and Canada that will be allocated to participate in an intensive CV risk detection
      and control programme supported by NPHWs or to care as usual for up to 6 years. NOTE: CVD
      Phase - currently not initiated.

      Communities will be randomized 1:1 with a central randomization system to either a)
      intervention or b) control, after screening in the community is complete.

    <description>In intervention communities, management plans will be developed by the NPHW for all enrolled participants. The NPHWs will educate participants about CVD, HT treatment, lifestyle modifications and initiate therapy according to the modified WHO CVD risk-management algorithm, including referral of high-risk patients to physicians and safety monitoring where appropriate. Participants in intervention communities will have support from family or friends (treatment supporters) and will receive educational materials and treatment reminders using text-messaging, email, and printed materials, as appropriate for the participant and the community setting. Evidence-based CV medications will be made available to the NPHWs and supervising physicians for participant treatment.</description>
