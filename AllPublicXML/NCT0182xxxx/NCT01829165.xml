  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this research program is to elucidate causal and directional neural
      network- level abnormalities in depression, and how they are modulated by an
      individually-tailored, circuit-directed intervention. By using concurrent TMS and fMRI, the
      investigators can overcome a major limitation of neuroimaging - the inability to demonstrate
      causality. The investigators' findings will serve as a platform for future studies wherein
      TMS treatment can be directly guided by the investigators' ability to image and causally
      manipulate specific neural networks.

      Aim 1: To examine causal interactions between two major brain networks in depression.

      Aim 2: To examine the impact of antidepressant TMS on causal network abnormalities in
      depression.

      Hypothesis 1: Depressed subjects will show blunted responses, compared to healthy controls,
      in two targeted and interacting networks, using concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      Hypothesis 2: Treatment of patients with high-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) will result in
      normalization of baseline network-level deficits, and be predicted by degree of baseline
      network abnormalities.

    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a 24-item clinician-administered assessment utilized as a way of determining a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. It takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete the interview and score the results. Subscale scores are 0-2 (10 questions), 0-3 (2 questions), and 0-4 (12 questions). Subscales are totaled for an overall score (range 0 -76). For the overall score and all subscales, lower scores correspond to fewer symptoms, and higher scores correspond more symptoms.</description>

          <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a 24-item clinician-administered assessment utilized as a way of determining a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. Subscale scores are 0-2 (10 questions), 0-3 (2 questions), and 0-4 (12 questions). Subscales are totaled for an overall score (range 0 -76). For the overall score and all subscales, lower scores correspond to fewer symptoms, and higher scores correspond more symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a 24-item clinician-administered assessment utilized as a way of determining a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. It takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete the interview and score the results. Subscale scores are 0-2 (10 questions), 0-3 (2 questions), and 0-4 (12 questions). Subscales are totaled for an overall score (range 0 -76). For the overall score and all subscales, lower scores correspond to fewer symptoms, and higher scores correspond more symptoms.</description>

            <description>rTMS was to be delivered for 20 sessions over 4 weeks. Active 10 Hz rTMS was delivered using neuro-navigation based on participants' own fMRI images. Daily treatment regiments were to last 36.5 minutes and rTMS was delivered at 120% of the participant's motor threshold. Participants were monitored during the rTMS sessions for adverse events and/or side effects.

Upon completing the sham 20 sessions participants are unblinded and offered 20 further treatments of guaranteed open-label treatment. The open-label treatment would follow the active rTMS treatment protocol.
