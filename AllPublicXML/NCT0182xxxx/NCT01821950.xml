      This study will evaluate the efficacy of yoga taught during school to positively influence
      risk and protective factors of substance use and the initiation and severity of substance
      use. The study hypothesis is that, compared to a control group participating in regular
      physical education classes, subjects who participate in 32 yoga sessions across an academic
      year will improve in negative internalizing behaviors and self-regulatory skills that are
      known risk and protective factors for substance use. This study will also test the hypothesis
      that the yoga intervention will reduce both severity of substance use and the degree of
      substance use initiation.

      The long-term, programmatic goal of this research is to advance prevention of addictive
      behaviors especially substance use in normal adolescent psychological development. The
      overall goal of this proposal is to pilot test a novel, preventive intervention for
      adolescent substance use. More specifically, it will evaluate the efficacy of yoga taught
      during school to positively influence risk and protective factors of substance use and the
      initiation and severity of substance use.

      This study involves a group randomized, controlled trial of yoga compared to physical
      education-as-usual for one school year, with a 6-month and 1-year follow-up, in order to
      accomplish the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1 - To evaluate the efficacy of a school-based yoga program for reducing
      negative internalizing behaviors (negative mood, perceived stress, impulsivity) which are
      risk factors for adolescent substance use.

      Specific Aim 2 - To evaluate the efficacy of this yoga program for promoting self-regulatory
      skills as protective factors against substance use in adolescence.

      Specific Aim 3 - To conduct a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of this yoga program for
      reducing substance use initiation and severity of use.

    <measure>Change in self-reported mood as measured by the 24-item Brunel University Mood Scale (BRUMS, total and 6 sub-scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 week post-intervention; 6 months post-intervention; 1 year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Brunel University Mood Scale (BRUMS) will be used to measure change in self-reported mood. The BRUMS is designed specifically for assessing mood in adolescents. It contains 24 adjectives that are all rated on a four-point scale to give a total mood score and scores for six subscales: tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. In a validation sample of nearly 2,000 British adolescents (12 to 18 years of age), multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis showed high factor validity. Criterion and construct validity were also acceptable. Furthermore, BRUMS is sensitive to short-term changes. More recently, the BRUMS has been successfully used in a large sample of American adolescents. Negative affective states, such as mood, are clearly linked to substance use trajectories.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-reported stress levels as measured by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 week post-intervention; 6 months post-intervention; 1 year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the degree to which events are appraised as stressful during the last month. Construct and convergent validity is adequate, since it is moderately correlated with other measures of stress and self-reported health status. The 10 items in this scale were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. It is psychometrically sound based on epidemiological sampling that evaluated reliability and validity. Furthermore, the PSS has been administered to mid-adolescents (8th and 9th graders) with good internal consistency. Psychological stress has been associated with substance use in studies of adolescents and college students.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-reported impulsive behavior as measured by the 59-item Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, and Sensation Seeking Plus (UPPS-P) Impulsive Behavior scale (4 sub-scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 week post-intervention; 6 months post-intervention; 1 year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, and Sensation Seeking Plus (UPPS-P) Impulsive Behavior scale is a 59-item self-report scale developed by Whiteside and Lynam to measure the multi-dimensional nature of impulsivity. Items are scored based on a four-point Likert-type scale as follows: 1) agree strongly, 2) agree somewhat, 3) disagree somewhat, and 4) disagree strongly. Factor analysis of eight other established scales that address impulsivity (in whole or part) revealed four factors that became the subscales in the UPPS-P: (lack of) Premeditation (11 items), Negative Urgency (11 items), Positive Urgency (14 items), Sensation Seeking (12 items), and (lack of) Perseverance (10 items). Internal consistency for these subscales showed alpha coefficients that ranged from 0.82 to 0.91.</description>

    <description>Anger Control. Adolescents' anger management is assessed by the Anger Control subscale (4 items) of Children's Anger Management Scale (CAMS). Sample items include, &quot;I can stop myself from losing my temper.&quot; Anger Rumination. The Anger Rumination subscale of the CAMS is used to measure an anger management domain of emotional SR.

    <measure>Change in self-reported sadness control and sadness rumination as measured by the Children's Sadness Management Scale (CSMS) (2 sub-scales)</measure>

The Sadness Control subscale includes items such as, &quot;When I'm feeling down, I can control my sadness and carry on with things.&quot; Sadness Rumination. This 3-item measure for Sadness Rumination adapted from the CSMS assesses adolescents' emotional capabilities in dealing with sadness. Items include, &quot;When people do something to make me sad, I don't forget about it.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in self-reported present and future time perspective as measured by the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (2 sub-scales)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 week post-intervention; 6 months post-intervention; 1 year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Future Time Perspective. An orientation toward present occurrences (e.g., seek out activities that produce immediate satisfaction such as alcohol use) versus future occurrences (e.g., invest in activities that require more effort but have positive long-term consequences such as physical exercise) has been considered to have significant effects on adolescent substance abuse: future orientation to have preventive effects and present orientation to have harmful effects on adolescent substance abuse and risky behaviors. This 7-item scale on Future Time Perspective is adapted from the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI). Items include &quot;I am able to resist temptation when I know there is work to be done&quot;. Present Time Perspective. A 7-item scale on Present Time Perspective is derived from the ZTPI. Sample items include, &quot;I think it's useless to plan too far ahead, because things hardly ever turn out the way I planned.&quot;</description>

    <description>Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) Middle School Version (http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/yrbs/index.htm). This is a nationally validated scale that measures substance use in children and adolescents. There are 16 questions in the substance use category of the 2013 middle school version of the YRBS for use of tobacco (8 questions), alcohol (2 questions), marijuana (2 questions), and other drugs (4 questions), taking approximately 10 minutes to complete. Each question includes an answer that allows participants to indicate whether they have ever used the substance, which will serve as a measure of use initiation over the time course of the entire study.</description>
