  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether partial sleep deprivation, as compared with
      normal sleep, influences certain metabolic and cognitive parameters, related to food intake,
      hunger and memory functions, when participants are shielded from external time cues.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is predicted that partial sleep deprivation negatively affects the hormonal status, e.g.
      upregulating ghrelin and other hunger-promoting hunger hormones, while showing impaired
      memory functions. It is also predicted that participants will tend to increase their desired
      portion sizes after partial sleep deprivation, compared with after a normal night's sleep.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory tasks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in memory performance between learning (at 2230 hours in NS and PSD condition) before going to sleep, and at 0800 and 0930 hours (following PSD or NS)</time_frame>
    <description>Procedural memory performance after learning a procedural memory task close to going to bed, followed by either partial sleep deprivation (PSD) or normal sleep (NS), and comparing the performance the following morning at two time points. Participants spatial memory performance in the morning at two time points, following PSD will also be compared with that following NS, after having learned such a memory task in the evening before going to bed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circulating hormone levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in circulating hormone levels and other metabolism-linked and neurodegeneration-associated molecules at 0730, 0830, 0910, 0925, 0940, 1010, 1040, 1105, and 1150 hours following the respective nighttime intervention and after the interference task</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intake task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in intake at around 1200 hours, following the respective nighttime intervention (NS or PSD)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with an ad libitum meal choice and can select the amount to ingest during a limited time window. Amount and selection will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working memory function task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in memory performance at 0800 hours and after the interference task again at 0930 hours (between and following PSD or NS)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated on their working memory performance in the morning following either nighttime intervention (NS or PSD) and before and after an interference task</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Portion Size Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in selected portion size from baseline (at 0800 hours following the nighttime intervention), to one hour later, i.e. after an interference task</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated on their tendency to choose larger or smaller portions of a variety of meal items on a computer screen. This will be conducted both following partial sleep deprivation and normal sleep, and changes before and after a short interference task will be compared between these two conditions.</description>
