      Although liver resection, liver transplantation, a-interferon, Transarterial Chemo
      Embolization (TACE), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), Percutaneous microwave coagulation
      therapy (PMCT), Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) provide options to treat patients with HCC, the
      high recurrence rate of mid-late stage liver cancer still exists. The safety of autologous
      Immune Cell Therapy in Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Patients Following Resection
      and TACE Therapy will be evaluated.

      The study is a single center,open label trial. To obtain safety information on toxicities and
      adverse events attributable to the subcutaneous injections of autologous dendritic cells
      incubated with irradiated autologous tumor stem cells and suspended in GM-CSF in patients
      with HCC.
