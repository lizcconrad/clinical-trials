  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, open-label, two part, parallel group study. This study is being
      conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of GSK2336805 in
      subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Part 1 of the study will enroll subjects
      with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and healthy control subjects matched to the
      subjects in the moderate hepatic impairment category. The decision to commence Part 2 will be
      based on a review of the preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from subjects with
      moderate hepatic impairment. Part 2 will enroll subjects with severe hepatic impairment.
      Additionally, based on emergent data from Part 1, matched controls to the severe hepatic
      group may be enrolled (optional). Due to the potential difficulty in identifying eligible
      subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the study may be stopped prior to full enrollment in
      Part 2, provided that a minimum of 4 evaluable subjects with severe hepatic impairment have
      been enrolled. The study will consist of a Screening visit, a single dose Treatment Period
      and a Follow-up visit. Subjects will be screened for eligibility criteria within 30 days of
      enrolment. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1; each subject will
      receive a single dose of GSK2336805 on Day 1 and will remain in the clinical unit for 5 days
      (check-out on Day 4). The follow-up visit will be conducted within 7-10 days after Day 1
      dosing.
