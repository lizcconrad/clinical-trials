  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of clinical indices that signals increased risk
      for cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
      were associated with MetS and insulin resistance. Cluster analysis was a useful tool for
      identifying groups of women sharing similar metabolic risk factor patterns. Oligomenorrhea,
      hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovary morphology were the three major components of PCOS.
      Obesity is a main risk factor in metabolic syndrome. the investigators are interesting to
      evaluate the relationship between risk of metabolic syndrome and their clinical and/or
      biochemical characteristics in women with reproductive age.

      Design: Retrospective study; medical records reviewed. Participants and setting: The
      investigators retrospectively reviewed the medical records of female patients who visited our
      Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic from Jan. 1, 2009 to Jun. 31, 2012.

      Definitions of the metabolic syndrome based on arbitrary cutoff points for several
      quantitative variables, where each variable is related linearly to cardiovascular risk. Even
      consensual definitions differ between international authorities and continue to change.
      Moreover, such cutoff s should be gender and ethic difference. Cluster analysis is a
      statistical method base on algorithms, which seek to minimize within-group variation and
      maximize between-group variation for the clustering variables. This technique is suitable for
      defining groups, reflecting the natural structure of data without relying on inappropriate
      arbitrary cutoffs. We conduct this retrospective study to review the medical records of
      female patients who visited our Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic from Jan. 1, 2009 to Dec.
      31, 2012. Cluster analysis was performed in our studied cases to evaluate the correlation
      between clinical/biochemical characteristic and risk of metabolic risk in women with
      reproductive age.
