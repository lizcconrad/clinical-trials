  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of an investigational new drug
      called PLX3397 when used in combination with Vemurafenib (Zelboraf™) at different dose
      levels. Vemurafenib has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)/European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of a specific category of
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

    <description>Subjects will take oral doses of PLX3397 and vemurafenib twice a day. Physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), adverse events, hematology and serum chemistry will be used to assess safety throughout the study. Adverse events will be monitored and reviewed for safety issues/abnormal changes in the above mentioned tests.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female ≥18 years old.

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed unresectable Stage III or Stage IV metastatic
             melanoma who have not been previously treated with a selective BRAF inhibitor.

          -  Presence of a BRAF V600 mutation in the tumor tissue using the cobas BRAF mutation
             assay or comparable standard of care methodology.

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST v. 1.1 criteria.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiation therapy within 14 days of C1D1.

          -  Investigational drug use within 28 days of C1D1.

          -  Patients with active CNS lesions are excluded (i.e., those with radiographically
             unstable, symptomatic lesions). However, patients treated with stereotactic therapy or
             surgery are eligible if they remain without evidence of disease progression in the
             brain for ≥3 weeks.
