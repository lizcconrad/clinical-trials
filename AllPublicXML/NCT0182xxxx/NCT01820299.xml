  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for subjects with solid cancers (gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate,
      lymphoma or cancer of the lymph nodes). The overall goal of this study is to identify
      plant-derived phytochemicals that can safely reduce systemic inflammation (inflammation
      throughout the entire body) in subjects with advanced cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at oligomeric procyanidin complex (OPC) and vitamin D3. OPC is the major
      part of Grape Seed Extract (GSE). Researchers are in looking at the combination of GSE and
      vitamin D in subjects with solid cancers (gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma
      or cancer of the lymph nodes). Researchers will examine the safety of the GSE and vitamin D
      when GSE is given at different doses. Researchers will also look at the effects of GSE and
      vitamin D on your quality of life and your body. In particular, they will look at differences
      in biomarkers in your blood and urine.

    <measure>Maximally-tolerated dose of Grape Seed Extract in Patients with Solid Tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Decisions to escalate or expand a dose level will be based only on the GSE-only treatment period (day 1-21). To be evaluable for toxicity, a patient must receive at least 3 weeks of GSE treatment, or have experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). All patients enrolled are to be fully followed for toxicity, but any patients who are not evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IL6 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma IL-6 levels before and after 21 days and 63 days of GSE treatment will be quantified to estimate the dose response relationship between GSE dose and reduction in inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of Other Inflammatory Markers</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Other markers that will be measured will include serum CRP, albumin, AGEs (advanced glycation end products), rAGE (soluble receptor for AGEs), 25-OH-vitamin D3, and urine for oxidative damage DNA biomarkers (urinary 8-oxoGua and 8-oxodG). Correlations between dose and change in these parameters from before to 21, 63 days after start of GSE dosing will be described.</description>

    <description>The ability of a fixed dose of vitamin D3 (4000 IU daily) to further suppress IL-6 levels in subjects on GSE treatment will be evaluated.</description>

             procedures).

          -  Subjects may not initiate a new form of cancer therapy, non-steroidal or steroid
