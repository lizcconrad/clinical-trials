  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of combining abiraterone with medicines
      that may block some of the ways that cells become resistant to abiraterone. The investigators
      hope that these combinations of medicines will result in prostrate cancer cells dying.

      This study will see if overcoming diseases resistance to abiraterone will restore sensitivity
      to androgen deprivation therapy.

      Subjects will be either treated on one of the earlier dosing regimens or randomly assigned to
      one of two groups or ARMs of this study.

      ARM A will receive Abiraterone with ABT-263.

      ARM B will receive Abiraterone with both ABT-263 and Hydroxychloroquine

      In the beginning of the study a total of 18 patients may get one of three dose levels. A
      total of nine (9) patients per each arm will be started at a low dose and given increasing
      doses if no side effects are seen. In this part of the study three patients will be enrolled
      at each dose level for each individual arm starting with Arm A followed by Arm B.

                  (whichever was lowest) confirmed on a second determination at least 1 week later
                  that must be higher than the first and must have reached ≥2ng/ml (if no other
                  evidence of progression); or

               2. New Metastases on bone scan (at least 2); or

               3. Progression of measurable disease on CT scan by RECIST criteria

          -  Age &gt;18 years and an estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  Treatment with at least 2 months of abiraterone prior to progression

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2. (See Appendix A)

          -  Patients must be ≥ 4 weeks since completing their prior therapy (including surgery,
             radiation therapy or investigational therapy (including targeted small molecule
             agents)). All previous clinically significant treatment-related toxicities have
             resolved to ≤ Grade 1. Patients must be ≥ 4 weeks since prior therapy with an
             anti-androgen

          -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥50
             ml/min)

          -  Total bilirubin must be within 1.5 X the normal institutional limits. If total
             bilirubin is outside the normal institutional limits, assess direct bilirubin. The

             any screening or study-specific procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known infection with HIV or subject has tested positive for HIV (due to potential
             drug-drug interactions between anti-retroviral inhibitors and ABT-263, as well as
             anticipated ABT-263 mechanism based lymphopenia that may potentially increase the risk
             of opportunistic infections and potential drug-drug interactions with certain anti
             infective agents). Patients without prior HIV testing will not be required to be
             tested.

             previously with no evidence of recurrence.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

             instability, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant pericardial effusion,
             or congestive heart failure.

             received a biologic agent for anti-neoplastic intent within 30 days prior to the first
             dose of study drug.

          <description>Dose level 0: Abiraterone 1000 mg po daily and ABT-263 150 mg po daily Dose level 1: Abiraterone 1000 mg po daily and ABT-263 250 mg po daily* Dose level 2 (maximum planned phase II dose): Abiraterone 1000 mg po daily and ABT-263 350 mg po daily*
* All patients at the 250 mg/day and 325 mg/day doses will start at 150 mg/day for the first 7 days (on Day -7) and escalated to their respective full dose on Day 1 if no DLT is observed and platelets are &gt;50,000/mm3.
NOTE: The dose escalation for ABT-263 combined with abiraterone was completed first prior to dose escalation with ABT-263 combined with hydroxychloroquine and abiraterone. Following both dose escalation portions of the trial, patients will then, and only then, be assigned to Arm A or Arm B of the phase II portion of the trial on a rotating basis of every other patient.</description>

NOTE: The dose escalation for ABT-263 combined with abiraterone was completed first prior to dose escalation with ABT-263 combined with hydroxychloroquine and abiraterone. Following both dose escalation portions of the trial, patients will then, and only then, be assigned to Arm A or Arm B of the phase II portion of the trial on a rotating basis of every other patient.</description>
