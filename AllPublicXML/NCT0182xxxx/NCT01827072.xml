    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with Multifocal Motor Neuropathy were confirmed based on the European
      Federation of Neurological Societies/ Peripheral. Nerve Society Guideline. Patients who meet
      all inclusion criteria and do not conflict with the exclusion criteria will receive NPB-01
      (intravenous immunoglobulin) 400mg/kg/day for five consecutive days. Subsequently, patients
      receive NPB-01 1g/kg every 3weeks and evaluate the Medical Research Council（MRC） score and
      the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale（GNDS） et al.

      As a safety endpoint, the safety of NPB-01 will be investigated the occurrence of adverse
      events by one year after the start of the study treatment.
