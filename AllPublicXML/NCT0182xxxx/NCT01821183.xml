  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At this investigation we want to find out whether there is a difference in muscle strength of
      the internal and external rotation hip muscles between soccer players and non-soccer players
      caused by typical movement patterns seen in soccer sport.

      Nontraumatic hip injuries are a problem often seen in Soccer Players. A biomechanical
      formation mechanism is probably. Little research has focused on the measurement of hip
      external and internal rotation strength at soccer players. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the influence of soccer sports at the isometric force and force ratio of the hip
      rotator muscle system. Two samples of Athletes will be compared: Soccer Players (N15) and
      Non-soccer players (N15) matched in sex, age and level of physical activity to investigate
      hip rotator force in 3 different angles of hip flexion (0°/45°/90°). The measurement will be
      made with a handheld dynamometer.
