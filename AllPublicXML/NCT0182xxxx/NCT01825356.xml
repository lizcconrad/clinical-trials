  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients undergoing a dorsal cheilectomy
      procedure with implementation of amniotic membrane tissue results in improved clinical and
      functional outcomes compared to a standard dorsal cheilectomy procedure.

      Specific Aim 1:

      To compare American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores between patients
      undergoing dorsal cheilectomy to patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of
      amniotic membrane tissue.

      Hypothesis 1: Clinical and functional outcomes, as measured by the AOFAS , in the patients
      undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue will be superior
      to those without.

      Specific Aim 2:

      To compare range of motion between patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy to patients
      undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue.

      Hypothesis 2: Patient to undergo dorsal cheilectomy and implantation of amniotic membrane
      tissue will demonstrate less postoperative stiffness as measured from the pre-and
      postoperative radiographs.

      Specific Aim 3:

      To compare Foot Function Index (FFI) scores between patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy to
      patients undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue.

      Hypothesis 3: Clinical and functional outcomes, as measured by the FFI, the patients
      undergoing dorsal cheilectomy with implantation of amniotic membrane tissue will be superior
      to those without.
