  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cortisol is essential for survival. The importance of cortisol response is most apparent in
      patients with partial or complete deficiency of glucocorticoids during stressful events such
      as illness or surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that cortisol and other stress hormones increase during acute myocardial
      infarction as well (9-11). Cardiac catheterization is an essential tool for the management of
      acute coronary syndrome, and for the evaluation of the burden of coronary artery disease in
      cardiac patients.

    <description>On the day of the procedure a total of 4 venous blood samples for random plasma cortisol level will be obtained. Blood will be drawn at 5 minutes prior to the procedure, at 30 minutes and 60 minutes during the cardiac catheterization. Another sample will be drawn in 3 hours after cardiac catheterization prior to the patients discharge. a cortisol level will be drawn at a &quot;nonstressful&quot; visit</description>
