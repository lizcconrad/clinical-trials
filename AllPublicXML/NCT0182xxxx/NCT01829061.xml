    <textblock>
      The Quo-Test A1C Analyzer and Reagent Test System (Quo-Test A1C System) are intended for the
      in-vitro quantitative determination of glycated hemoglobin in whole blood samples obtained
      from fingerstick or venous samples for point-of-care testing. The Quo-Test A1C System is
      indicated in the management and treatment of diabetes and for monitoring long term glycemic
      control by diabetics. It is for multiple patient use. Only auto-disabling, single use lancing
      devices should be used with this system.

    <description>The objective is to conduct a method comparison between both the Quo-Test and Quo-Lab investigational devices and the reference method [Tosoh G8 (K071132)]. The reference method also serves as the predicate for the premarket notifications for both investigational devices. Both capillary and venous samples will be tested on the Quo-Test A1C System and Quo-Lab A1C Test, while only venous samples will be tested on the reference method.</description>
