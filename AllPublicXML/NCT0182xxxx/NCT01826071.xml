      The purpose of this study is to compare three different treatments for these types of lower
      extremity apophysitis- Osgood-Schlatter syndrome (OSS), Sinding-Larsen and Johansson syndrome
      (SLJ), or Sever's disease.

      The investigators hypothesize that adolescents who perform a home exercise program (HEP)
      consisting of active elongation exercises will have decreased pain and earlier return to
      sports and activities as compared to those who perform a HEP that consists of static
      stretching exercises or those who use symptomatic treatment with ice, acetaminophen or NSAIDs
      and activity modification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osgood-Schlatter syndrome (OSS), Sinding-Larsen and Johansson syndrome (SLJ), or Sever's
      disease are three types of apophysitis, or secondary growth center irritation, that
      frequently affect children and teens. Although these conditions are common, there is very
      little data from high quality studies to support a particular treatment method in affected
      patients. The purpose of this study is to compare three different treatments for these types
      of apophysitis. The investigators plan to compare two types of home exercise program (HEP),
      one involving active elongation exercises and one utilizing static stretching, with
      symptomatic treatment consisting of icing, over-the-counter medications and relative rest.
      The investigators hypothesize that the active elongation HEP will result in improvement in
      pain and earlier return to athletic activities when compared to the static stretching HEP and
      symptomatic care. This pilot study will recruit subjects at the Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie
      Children's Hospital outpatient sports medicine and orthopaedic clinics with any of the
      following types of lower extremity apophysitis: OSS, SLJ or Sever's disease. Subjects will
      complete a baseline evaluation and questionnaire and will be randomized into one of the three
      treatment groups. At 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, subjects from all groups will use a secure website
      to complete an online survey to complete questions regarding current pain level, compliance
      with their home exercise program, if applicable, use of other forms of treatment or pain
      management (e.g. splinting, icing, rest from activities) and current activity level. The
      investigators will compare results from each group to determine which treatment(s) resulted
      in the largest improvements in pain scores and the highest rates of participation in sports
      and recreational activities.
