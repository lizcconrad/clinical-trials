      This study is designed to observe the long term clinical outcomes of patient-specific knee
      arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the patient has previously received a standard total knee replacement in their
      contralateral knee, the primary endpoint questionnaire and some secondary endpoint
      questionnaires will be completed regarding BOTH their iTotal® CR knee and their standard
      total knee for all time points where questionnaires are required by the protocol.
