      This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical outcomes and toxicities of adjuvant
      treatment including S-1/cisplatin chemotherapy followed by S-1 based CRT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the only possible curative treatment of gastric cancer. However, the high
      recurrence rate makes gastric cancer a disease difficult to cure by surgery alone. Despite
      the benefit of CRT on local recurrence, the distant recurrence is the leading pattern of
      failure. We hypothesized that gastric cancer outcome could be improved using a more effective
      chemotherapy regimen. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical outcomes and toxicity
      of adjuvant treatment including S-1/cisplatin chemotherapy followed by S-1 based CRT.

    <description>Pts with radically D2 resected adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GEJ in AJCC stage Ib-IV (M0) were eligible for this study. Pts were treated with S-1 (40-60 mg depending on BSA) b.i.d. for 3 wks, and cisplatin (60 mg/m²) iv on day 1, followed by a 2-wk rest period, within a 5-wk cycle. Subsequently, radiotherapy (RT) started which consisted of 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy to a total dose of 45 Gy in 5 wks (5 fractions/wk). On RT days, S-1 (40-60 mg depending on BSA ) b.i.d., 5 days/wk was given. One month after the completion of RT, two 5-wk cycles of S-1/ciplatin chemotherapy were given.</description>
