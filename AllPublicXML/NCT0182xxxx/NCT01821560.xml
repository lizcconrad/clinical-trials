  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will utilize perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a
      functional candidate gene association approach (of dopaminergic addictions-targeted
      polymorphisms), and the dopamine-modulating and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor
      agonist, baclofen, to examine the brain and behavioral responses in smokers to appetitive
      smoking reminders (cues that motivate continued smoking and relapse). These studies will
      provide a means to identify an appetitive cue-sensitive pharmacologic-responsive
      endophenotype. Once brain/behavioral/genetic endophenotypes can be determined prior to
      treatment, smoking cessation treatments can be structured to meet individual needs, which
      will significantly improve treatment outcome.

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline (prior to randomization) brain and behavioral responses to smoking cues will be significantly greater in 9-repeats compared to 10/10-repeats. While on medication (3 weeks later), 9-repeats receiving baclofen will demonstrate greater reductions in brain activity and smoking behavior compared to 10/10-repeats. 9-repeats receiving placebo will exhibit responses similar to baseline responses.</description>

    <description>Subjects receiving baclofen will have greater success in smoking cessation compared to subjects receiving placebo as evidenced by reductions in urine cotinine (primary metabolite of nicotine) at end of treatment.</description>

    <description>Baclofen will be dispensed in pill form. Baclofen will be prescribed at 20 mg 4 times per day. Each baclofen pill will be 10 mg. Thus, 2 pills will be taken at each scheduled dose for a total of 8 pills a day over a period of 8 weeks. In this way, the titration schedule, taper and potential dose reductions can be managed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Physically healthy, as determined by a comprehensive physical examination and approval
             of the study physician males or females who smoke cigarettes, ages 18-60.

          -  Smoke ≥ 6 cigarettes per day for at least 6 months prior to study start date.

          -  Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating and either be of non-childbearing
             potential (i.e. sterilized via hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or at least 1
             year post-menopausal) or of child bearing potential but practicing a medically
             acceptable method of birth control. Examples of medically acceptable methods for this
             protocol include barrier (diaphragm or condom) with spermicide, an intrauterine device
             (IUD), the Nuvaring, oral contraceptives, levonorgestrel implant, hormonal injection
             or complete abstinence.

          -  Provide voluntary informed consent.

          -  Must be able to read. [Subjects are required to be able to read because there are
             several self-administered measures that they must read, understand and provide written
             answers.]

          -  Intelligence quotient of ≥ 80.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of head trauma or injury causing loss of consciousness, lasting more than five
             (5) minutes or associated with skull fracture or inter-cranial bleeding or abnormal

             retainer, bullets, etc. (unless a radiologist confirms that it's presence is
             unproblematic). An x-ray may be obtained to determine eligibility given the
             possibility of a foreign body.

          -  History of psychosis.

          -  Claustrophobia or other medical condition preventing subject from lying in the MRI for
             approximately one (1) hour.

          -  Vision problems that cannot be corrected with glasses.
