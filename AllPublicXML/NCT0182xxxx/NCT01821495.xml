  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the main treatment method for patients with
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, Relapse remains the major cause of treatment
      failure. A series of studies reported that dendritic and cytokine-induced killer cells
      (DC-CIK) have a broad anti-tumor spectrum. We suppose that DC-CIK will improve the prognosis
      of NPC. In this study, the patients with NPC will be treated with DC-CIK cells after
      concurrent of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of DC-CIK for NPC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 60 patients with staging Ⅱ-Ⅲ of NPC, after accepting concurrent radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy, will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK treatment) or group B
      (just regularly follow up), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will
      receive 2-3 cycles of DC-CIK cells treatment (every 4 weeks). Patients in group B will have
      no anti-tumor therapy.
