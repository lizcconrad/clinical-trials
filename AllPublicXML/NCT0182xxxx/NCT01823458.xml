  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incentives are increasingly being used to motivate health behavior in medical studies. Small
      cash payments conditional on certain health and welfare promoting behaviors have shown
      efficacy in both real world and experimental settings. Furthermore, in incentive studies,
      behavioral economics has been shown to amplify behavior change beyond what is possible with
      simple cash payments, but little is known about how varying incentive payment design may
      impact health behavior. The goal of the present study is to evaluate a new incentive payment
      instrument, lottery insurance, to determine its impact on adherence to the target health
      behavior, attendance at free exercise classes provided by QueensCare Family Clinics, a
      safety-net medical clinic.

    <description>All participants receive a one time, $10 payment for attending the first exercise class of the 12 week session. Participants in the 'Lottery Insurance' arm receive a lottery ticket valued at $20 for attending either a Monday or Tuesday exercise class. They have the option to insure their lottery ticket by attending a second exercise class during the week on either Wednesday or Thursday. If they do not attend the second class, they have a 90% chance of winning the weekly lottery. This sequence is repeated each week over the 12 week exercise session.</description>

    <description>All participants receive a one time, $10 payment for attending the first exercise class of the 12 week session. Subjects in the 'Standard Lottery' arm receive a lottery ticket valued at $20 for attending either a Monday or Tuesday exercise class. They also receive the expected value of the insurance ($2) for attending a second exercise class during the week on either Wednesday or Thursday. They have a 90% chance of winning the weekly lottery. This sequence is repeated each week over the 12 week exercise session.</description>
