      The investigators are doing this study to see if &quot;positive psychology&quot; can help adults with
      depression or bipolar disorder.

      Positive psychology involves exercises—short tasks—that try to increase good feelings and
      emotions, like optimism, happiness, personal strengths, and well-being. Positive psychology
      exercises might include imagining a bright future, being grateful for good events, forgiving
      others, and doing kind acts for others.

      The investigators want to see if practicing positive psychology exercises after leaving the
      hospital can increase feelings of hope, optimism, and positive thinking. The investigators
      are asking you to take part in this research study because you are in the hospital for
      depression or bipolar disorder.

      This research study will compare &quot;positive psychology exercises&quot; to &quot;control condition
      exercises.&quot; During the study, you may take part in control condition exercises instead of
      positive psychology exercises.
