  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to estimate the bioavailability of amlodipine and enalapril maleate
      fixed dose combination (FDC) relative to co-administration of amlodipine and enalapril
      maleate tablets. The rational for this study is to provide a more convenient dosing regimen
      for patients. This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study, in
      which 16 healthy adult male and female subjects will be enrolled and dosed under fasting
      conditions. Each subject will participate in two treatment periods of 7 days each. There will
      be at least 14 days of wash out period between the two dosing periods and a follow-up period
      of up to 21 days after treatment period 2. The total duration of study will be approximately
      35 days from the start of the first treatment.
