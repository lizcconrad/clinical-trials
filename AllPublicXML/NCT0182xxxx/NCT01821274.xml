      The primary objective of this study will be to determine the potential of Diltiazem
      Hydrochloride 2% Cream to cause irritation after repeated topical application to the healthy
      skin of humans under controlled conditions.

      In addition, safety will be assessed by evaluation of any adverse events (AEs) reported
      during the study.

    <measure>Mean cumulative irritation score of Diltiazem Hydrochloride 2% Cream in healthy skin of humans.</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary variable of interest is the mean cumulative irritation score. The mean cumulative irritation score for each subject, product and site will be calculated as the sum of the irritation scores divided by the number of readings. The total cumulative irritation score for each subject and product will also be calculated as the sum of irritation scores on each of 21 evaluation days. A normalized total score for each patch will be calculated by summing the total irritation scores for all subjects, dividing by the number of readings and multiplying by 210. These parameters will be tested pairwise for product differences using Fisher's protected least significant differences in the context of the analysis of variance (ANOVA), including effects of subject and product (ie, randomized complete blocks). All pairwise differences will be tested. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made.</description>
