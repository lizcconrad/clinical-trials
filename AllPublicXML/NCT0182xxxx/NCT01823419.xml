  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty
      acids on executive functions. The investigators hypothesize that participants ages 7-9 years
      with a ratio closer to 4:1 will do better on tests of executive function than participants
      with a ratio closer to the purported Western diet norm of 15:1.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relation between executive function and n-6/n-3 fatty acid intake</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function will be measured using a validated and standardized system known as CANTAB (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) and correlated with the ratio of fatty acid intake. 24-hour diet recalls will be completed using the NDSR (Nutrient Data System for Research) software. Across one week, the children will be interviewed 3 times (two weekdays, one weekend day) about what they ate in the previous 24 hours. The dietary data will be averaged to arrive at the n-6/n-3 intake. The children will then come to lab for one visit where they will be assessed using the CANTAB.</description>
