      Purpose: a retrospective study of all Paediatric patients who presented to Ziv Medical Centre
      with injuries of all systems, major and minor, in order to determine the exact circumstances
      of the injury, whether this might have been preventable and design a Haddon Matrix of risk
      factors for injury to target prevention.

      Hypothesis: injury prevention interventions can be targetted by finding out local causes of
      Paediatric Trauma

      A Trauma Registry is already kept in the hospital. It is confidential and data is supplied to
      the government from this registry.

      The procedure is to be granted access to the database and access data stored on the mechanism
      and outcome of Paeditric Trauma. This data will be stored on the work computer of the
      principal investigator and will be password protected.

      Methods: Identify from the Trauma database all patients assessed at Ziv Medical Centre with
      Trauma, consult their medical notes and document the exact injury, the mechanism of injury,
      the circumstances, whether the child was alone or supervised, the nature and complications of
      the injury, treatment required and short and long term progress and disability.

    <description>This is a retrospective study. We approximate that since the Trauma registry began in 2007, there have been 200 Paediatric injuries every year. By the end of this year's data collection, therefore, we estimate that we would have collected data from 1000 patients.</description>
