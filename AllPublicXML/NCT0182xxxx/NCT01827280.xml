  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased progressively in
      the past decades, and consequently, a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases is
      observed. As this process develops, the endothelial dysfunction is present at early stages of
      the atherosclerotic disease. Studies conducted at BioVasc/UERJ show the occurrence of
      endothelial and microvascular dysfunction in obese carriers, even in the absence of
      dysglycemia. New concepts indicate the endothelium as a possible therapeutic target, and
      drugs which act not only on diabetes mellitus pathophysiology but also acting as direct
      cardiovascular protectors bring new therapeutic possibilities. The dipeptidyl-peptidase-4
      inhibitors (DPP4), such as vildagliptin, are drugs used on the T2DM treatment. Its incretin
      mimetic and insulinotropic effects are already well established and several other studies
      show its effectiveness in reducing glycated hemoglobin, even in monotherapy.

      Currently, fat rich foods are being increasingly introduced in the western way of life and
      recent evidence suggests that the postprandial lipemia (LPP) is related to cardiovascular
      risk. A better glucose control using vildagliptin can reduce the oxidative stress, and
      consequently promote a better microvascular and endothelial reactivity. However, vildagliptin
      can have an additional cardiovascular protective action, not only because of its effect on
      glycemia and oxidative stress reduction, but maybe because of its direct effect on intestinal
      peptides with postprandial lipemia reduction. To test this hypothesis, we will proceed the
      following exams: venous occlusion pletysmography, nailfold videocapilaroscopy and
      laser-Doppler flowmetry aiming to evaluate vascular reactivity on muscle and at cutaneous
      site. Anoter group of patients with the same clinical charactherisitics will use metformin,
      in order to compare its effects with those obtained from the use of Vildaglitpin. Our purpose
      is to determine whether vildagliptin, evaluated in obese and diabetic women, has vascular
      protective effects, and whether the regulatory mechanisms of these actions correlate with
      oxidative stress, inflammatory markers and intestinal peptides in baseline state and after a
      lipid overload.

    <description>LDF is a method for continuous non invasive determination of the microvascular perfusion, where the study of cutaneous vasomotion by spectral analysis of Laser Doppler signal allows the exploration of five frequency components: endothelial, myogenic, sympathetic, respiratory and cardiac, involved in answers to the stimuli. Therewith vasomotion during the whole study period will be assessed, to find differences in baseline, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after the meal rich in lipids.</description>
