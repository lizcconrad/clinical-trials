      The main aim is to validate and improve the predictive model for survival and toxicity in
      patients with cervical cancer through multicentric prospective data collection. The data
      contain information on patient, tumor and treatment characteristics. For this study,
      additional health related QOL scores will be assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life
      Questionair-CX24 and C30. The long term aim, beyond this specific study, is to build a
      Decision Support System based on the predictive model validated in this study.
