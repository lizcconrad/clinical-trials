    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the antiviral combination of
      telaprevir, pegylated Interferon Alfa 2a (PegIFN alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV) can prevent the
      virus from coming back after the liver transplant.

      Telaprevir, PegIFN alfa-2a, and RBV are different antiviral drugs that work in combination at
      different stages of the HCV infection to stop the virus.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take telaprevir 3 times
      a day. You will take RVB by mouth 2 times a day. You will receive PEGIFN alfa-2a by an
      injection under the skin 1 time a week.

      Study Visits:

      On the first day you take the study drug:

        -  You will have an eye exam performed by the study doctor.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood
           pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check for the hepatitis
           virus.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking or side effects you may be having.

      Every Week while you are on study:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check for the hepatitis
           C virus. If part of the blood sample is left over after the Hepatitis C testing, it will
           be stored in the laboratory as a back-up sample, in case the original samples get lost.
           This sample may also be used to check if the Hepatitis C virus has become resistant to
           the study drug. No extra blood will be drawn for this storage.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking or side effects you may be having.

        -  At Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 42, urine will be collected to check for infection and any
           other side effects to the drugs.

      If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test every 4 weeks

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue receiving the antiviral therapy for up to 48 weeks, as long as the doctor
      thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Beginning the day after you stop taking antiviral therapy (or the day of transplantation,
      whichever comes first), you will have up to 24 weeks of follow-up testing performed. About 4
      and 20 weeks after your last dose:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check for the hepatitis
           C virus.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

        -  At week 4 only, urine will be collected to check for infection and any other side
           effects to the drugs.

      This is an investigational study. Telaprevir, PegIFN alfa-2a, and RBV are all FDA approved
      and commercially available for the treatment of HCV infection. The use of these drugs in
      preventing the HCV infection is investigational.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Undetectable Viral Load 12 Weeks Post-transplant</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post-transplant, up to 48 weeks for overall monitoring</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is number of participants with undetectable viral load at 12 weeks post-transplant (Post-transplant virological response, (PTVR)) which is defined as undetectable Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) 12 weeks after liver transplantation). In order to have undetectable HCV RNA viral load after transplant, participants need to have undetectable viral load before the liver transplant.
Response rate based on the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population where ITT population is defined as those patients who have achieved an undetectable HCV-RNA level before the transplant. If patients drop out the study early due to severe toxicity or treatment failure including treatment-related death, they will be counted as non-responders when evaluating the response rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained Virological Response (SVR)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) defined as a single undetectable HCV-RNA measurement 12 weeks after the 48-week treatment period for those still waiting for transplantation. The treatment duration will be summarized with descriptive statistics. Additional analyses based on evaluable patients also conducted regarding the PTVR response rate. The evaluable patients are defined as those patients who complete at least 16 weeks of treatment and have the 12 weeks post-transplant response measurement. The rate will also be computed stratified by the HCV treatment time (i.e., the 48-week HCV treatment versus less than 48 week HCV treatment) considering the different times under HCV. The SVR rate will be estimated, along with the exact 95% confident interval.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Undetectable Viral Load 12 Weeks Post-transplant</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is number of participants with undetectable viral load at 12 weeks post-transplant (Post-transplant virological response, (PTVR)) which is defined as undetectable Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) 12 weeks after liver transplantation). In order to have undetectable HCV RNA viral load after transplant, participants need to have undetectable viral load before the liver transplant.
Response rate based on the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population where ITT population is defined as those patients who have achieved an undetectable HCV-RNA level before the transplant. If patients drop out the study early due to severe toxicity or treatment failure including treatment-related death, they will be counted as non-responders when evaluating the response rate.</description>

Starting doses for standard of care Pegylated Interferon (PegIFN) alfa-2a 180 mcg subcutaneously once weekly, for Ribavirin (RBV) 1,000 mg orally daily (&lt; 75 kg) and 1,200 mg orally daily (≥ 75 kg), and for Telaprevir 750 mg taken orally 3 times a day.</description>

        <title>Sustained Virological Response (SVR)</title>
        <description>Sustained virological response (SVR) defined as a single undetectable HCV-RNA measurement 12 weeks after the 48-week treatment period for those still waiting for transplantation. The treatment duration will be summarized with descriptive statistics. Additional analyses based on evaluable patients also conducted regarding the PTVR response rate. The evaluable patients are defined as those patients who complete at least 16 weeks of treatment and have the 12 weeks post-transplant response measurement. The rate will also be computed stratified by the HCV treatment time (i.e., the 48-week HCV treatment versus less than 48 week HCV treatment) considering the different times under HCV. The SVR rate will be estimated, along with the exact 95% confident interval.</description>
