  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have evaluated the transplantation of pigment cells (melanocytes)and skin
      cells (keratinocytes) for the treatment of vitiligo. This procedure is known as MKTP
      (Melanocyte Keratinocyte Transplantation Procedure). Multiple studies have found this
      procedure to be both safe and effective for the treatment of vitiligo. The majority of these
      studies utilized trypsin to help isolate melanocytes and keratinocytes. Trypsin is enzyme
      that helps to separate the different layers of skin. However, some cell biologists believe
      that the enzyme dispase (which can be used to separate the epidermis from the dermis) is less
      toxic to cells of the epidermis and can result in a greater number of viable melanocytes and
      keratinocytes for transplantation.

      This study will look at the repigmentation rates of MKTP using trypsin to isolate cells,
      versus MKTP using dispase to isolate cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be at least 18 years old

          2. Have a diagnosis of generalized vitiligoâ€”vitiligo affecting both sides of the body on
             one or more areas of the body (extremities, trunk, etc.)

          3. Have stable vitiligo, defined as no new lesion development (or expansion of existing
             lesions) in the 6 months prior to proposed procedure date

          4. Be able to understand the requirements of the study, the risks involved, and be able
             to sign the informed consent form

          5. Agree to follow and undergo all study-related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients self-reported to be lactating, pregnant, or planning to become
             pregnant

          2. Patients with a history of developing vitiligo or hypertrophic scars at sites of
             trauma

          3. Patients self-reported as having HIV or Hepatitis C

          4. Patients self-reported as having uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus

          5. The investigator feels the patient should not participate in the study for any reason

          6. Patients with acral vitiligo, defined as significant involvement of the fingers and/or
             toes

          7. Patients with focal or segmental vitiligo, defined as vitiligo affecting only one area
             of the body on only one side of the body

          8. Patients with vitiligo affecting greater than 30% of their body surface area
