      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tadalafil in
      pediatric participants with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Participants will receive study
      treatment for 6 months in the double-blind period (Period 1), and then will be eligible to
      enroll into an open-label 2 year extension period (Period 2) during which participants will
      receive tadalafil.

               -  related to connective tissue disease

               -  related to anorexigen use

               -  associated with surgical repair of at least 6-month duration of congenital
                  systemic to pulmonary shunt (eg, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect,

             pressure (mPAP) ≥25 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg), pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤15
             mm Hg, and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥3 Wood units via right heart
             catheterization (RHC). In the event that a pulmonary artery wedge pressure cannot be
             obtained during RHC, participants with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure
             (LVEDP) &lt;15 mm Hg, with normal left heart function, and absence of mitral stenosis on
             echocardiography can be eligible for enrollment

          -  Have a World Health Organization (WHO) functional class value of II or III at the time
             of screening

          -  All participants must be receiving an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) (such as
             bosentan or ambrisentan) and must be on a maintenance dose with no change in dose
             (other than weight-based adjustments) for at least 12 weeks prior to screening and
             have a screening aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt;3 times the
             upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  If on conventional PAH medication, including but not restricted to, anticoagulants,
             diuretics, digoxin, and oxygen therapy, the participant must be on stable doses with
             no changes (other than weight-based adjustments) for at least 4 weeks before screening

             screening. Furthermore, female participants must agree to abstain from sexual activity
             or to use two different reliable methods of birth control as determined by the
             Investigator during the study. Examples of reliable birth control methods include true
             abstinence as a lifestyle choice (periodic sexual abstinence method is not
             acceptable); the use of oral contraceptives; a reliable barrier method of birth
             control (diaphragms with contraceptive jelly; cervical caps with contraceptive jelly;
             condoms with contraceptive foam; intrauterine devices)

          -  Written informed consent from parents (and written assent from appropriately aged
