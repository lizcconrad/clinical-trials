    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic and management concordance of
      face-to-face dermatologist versus a store-and-forward teledermatologist at a skin cancer
      screening event.

      The investigators' hypotheses include the following:

        1. Compared to in-person assessment, store-and-forward teledermatology assessment will
           result in adequate diagnostic concordance.

        2. Compared to in-person assessment, store-and-forward teledermatology results in adequate
           management concordance.

        3. The sensitivity and specificity of store-and-forward evaluation to detecting lesions
           that are either premalignant or malignant will be similar to that of in-person
           evaluation.
