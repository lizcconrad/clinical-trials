      The purpose of this study is to examine whether vilazodone attenuates the memory and mood
      effects of corticosteroids on the human hippocampus in 18 healthy controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In animals and humans, stress and corticosteroid excess are associated with changes in
      hippocampal structure and functioning. These findings have important implications to the
      millions of patients taking prescription corticosteroids and to patients with major
      depressive disorder or bipolar disorder who have elevated cortisol levels and memory
      impairment. The investigators believe that vilazodone may be a medication that can block the
      effects of hydrocortisone on the human hippocampus. The investigators propose to examine
      whether vilazodone attenuates the effects of corticosteroids in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled pilot study using a within-subject crossover design.
