  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the successful perinatal depression
      intervention among mothers (Thinking Healthy Programme, THP) has led to improved
      developmental outcomes in the children 6 years later. Economic and human resources aspects of
      the intervention will also be evaluated to determine overall societal benefits from
      investment in such a program, feasibility of scaling up the intervention and its
      sustainability in the long-term. The primary hypothesis is that children of mothers who
      participated in the THP will have better cognitive outcomes and socio-emotional functioning
      when compared to children of mothers randomized to the control group.
