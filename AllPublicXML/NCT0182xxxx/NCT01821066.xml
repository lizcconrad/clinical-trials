  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single 125 mg oral dose of the investigational compound PD-0332991 will be administered
      alone and after steady-state dosing of tamoxifen to determine if coadministration of
      tamoxifen alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of PD-0332991 in healthy male volunteers.

    <time_frame>0-144 hrs post PD-0332991 dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) of PD-0332991</measure>
    <time_frame>0-144 hrs post PD-0332991 dose</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of PD-0332991</measure>
    <time_frame>0-144 hrs post PD-0332991 dose</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

    <description>This arm is comprised of two treatment periods in fixed sequence. Period 1 is 7 days long, while Period 2 is 28 days long. In Period 1 the subjects receive a single 125 mg oral dose of PD-0332991 on Day 1. In Period 2 the subjects receive 4 daily 60 mg oral doses of tamoxifen (Days 1-4), followed by 23 daily 20 mg oral doses of tamoxifen (Days 5-27). On Day 22 of Period 2 the subjects receive a second 125 mg oral dose of PD-0332991.</description>
