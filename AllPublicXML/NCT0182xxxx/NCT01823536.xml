    <textblock>
      In this extension study, V59P20E1, the sponsor was planning to assess 5-year antibody
      persistence in subjects who received one or two doses of MenACWY conjugate vaccine at 2 to 10
      years of age, and to evaluate response to a booster dose administered 5 years after primary
      vaccination in the parent study V59P20 (NCT00616421).
