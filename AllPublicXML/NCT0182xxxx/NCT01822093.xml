  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Adenovirus-specific T-cells can persist and augment impaired adenovirus immune response
      post allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant, and reduce the requirement for antiviral
      therapy without toxicity or increasing the occurrence of Graft Versus Host Disease. This is a
      Phase I/IIa open-label safety study, assessing the effects of administering
      adenovirus-specific T-cells (Cytovir ADV) to paediatric patients post haematopoietic stem
      cell transplant.

    <description>A single dose 1x10e4 CD3+ T cells/kg patient weight of Cytovir ADV is prescribed to patients on exhibiting two consecutive PCR positive Adenovirus viraemia results &gt; 1000 copies/ml. Patients are followed up by continued monitoring of Adenovirus viraemia results. If patients exhibit uncontrolled ADV viraemia at ≥ 4 weeks following the first cell dose, they will be prescribed a second cell dose of 10e5 CD3+ T cell/kg. Patients will be monitored for 6 months following infusion of Cytovir ADV.
