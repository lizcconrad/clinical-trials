    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SBRT) in
      selected patients with stage I Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic lung cancer
      to demonstrate the feasibility and risks of using an ablative dose-adapted scheme with FFF
      beams. Other aims are To evaluate the incidence of acute and late complications; To evaluate
      tumour response to local radiation therapy by means of CT, PET/TC and MRI and To evaluate the
      impact of local therapy on overall and disease-free survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention (dose and fractions) depends on topographical parameters: lung disease
      (primary, peripheral nodes or mediastinal nodes), distance to chest wall, tumour size and
      distance to main bronchus.
