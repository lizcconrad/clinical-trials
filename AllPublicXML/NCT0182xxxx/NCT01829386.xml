    <textblock>
      This study will determine if MRI imaging can be used to estimate the amount of iron in areas
      of the brain affected by a stroke. This may help future patients if the scan can be used to
      predict the amount of brain damage and therefore the effects on the patient.

      New research treatments are being used to reduce the amount of iron build-up in the brain.
      The effects of that treatment may also be estimated using new MRI techniques.

    <textblock>
      Hemorrhagic stroke has devastating consequences. The mechanisms resulting in early and
      delayed brain injury following a hemorrhagic stroke is poorly understood. One of the
      mechanisms demonstrated in

      animal studies points towards deposition of iron in the brain tissue following hemorrhage.
      Preliminary data in animal studies also support a favorable effect of iron chelate agents.
      Iron chelate agents are compounds that bind iron to them and may show the extent of neural
      tissue damage.

      Initial results of human trials based on this hypothesis demonstrated the safety of
      increasing amounts of desferroxamine given to human patients. The evaluation of iron chelate
      agents for hemorrhagic stroke is entering into phase II/III trials.

      There is no modality at this date that can quantify the iron in tissue non invasively. Some
      preliminary studies have demonstrated the role of MRI in identifying parenchymal iron
      deposition in traumatic brain injury.

      We propose to validate an MRI based method to not only identify but also quantify the non
      heme iron levels deposited in brain tissue following hemorrhagic stroke. Once validated this
      method will be a robust mechanism to reliably quantify tissue iron in the brain which then
      can be closely followed through iron chelate therapy in a trial setting.

    <description>MRI scans of the head will be performed to determine the amount of Non heme iron in areas of the brain of hemorrhagic stroke patients and hopefully predict the amount of brain damage.
Each MRI will take up to 1 hour to complete and will be done on day 3, day 14 and day 30. Some of the (MRIs) Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be clinically indicated and sequences will be added to the clinical scan with each sequence adding 10 minutes to the scan. Some sequences will be done only for research.</description>

        The study population includes men and women, aged 18-85 who have had a hemorrhagic stroke
        and who can safely have an MRI scan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Males and females between the age of 18 and 85 who have suffered a stroke confirmed by a
        CT of the head.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. You cannot take part in this study unless you have evidence of having a stroke
             (hemorrhage in your brain).

          2. You cannot take part in this study if you are not able to safely have an MRI exam.

          3. Women cannot take part in this study if they are pregnant.

          4. Women may not participate in this study if they are attempting to become pregnant or
             think they might be pregnant. We will provide a one-time pregnancy test for anyone who
             is uncertain about being pregnant.

          5. You cannot take part in this study if you have evidence of a large amount of
             calcifications found on CT exams that have been performed as part of the clinical
             evaluation for your current condition.
