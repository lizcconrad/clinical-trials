    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness characterised by persistent,widespread muscle pain with
      generalised hyperalgesia and allodynia. It can be accompanied by other concomitant symptoms
      like fatigue, sleep disturbances, musculoskeletal disorders, distress and psychological
      disorders. This condition is very prevalent. It has been reported to be about 2-5% of the
      general global population.

      Fibromyalgia have been reported to have neurodynamic disorders. The purpose of this
      prospective study was to examine the combined effects of soft tissue mobilization and nerve
      slider neurodynamic technique on pain and pressure sensitivity in women with fibromyalgia.

      Fibromyalgia affects women nine times more than men.The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia is
      being studied nowadays in order to understand the mechanisms implicated in it.

      The treatment propose in this study is a neurodynamic intervention. Neurodynamics is the term
      used to describe the integration of the morphology, biomechanics and physiology of the
      nervous system.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nervous assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention measured with neurodynamic tests This is to test upper extremities. It moves most of the nerves between the neck and hand, including the median nerve, radial and ulnar, brachial plexus, spinal nerves and cervical nerve roots.
The patient is placed supine position. It is measured with a goniometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention in dexterity. This is assessed using the Purdue Pegboard Test.
The Purdue pegboard test is a timed physical test used to measure manual dexterity. Test subjects are asked to place small pins into holes in the pegboard using a specific hand and following a specific process.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention in grip strength. This is measured using a Jamar dynamometer with a standard protocol allowing three attempts on each side. During each measurement, patients were sitting with their shoulder adducted and elbow flexed to 90°. The maximum value achieved from all six attempts was used in analyses.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pain pressure threshold from baseline to 8-weeks intervention. This is going to be measured in three points in upper extremities using the pressure algometer. All assessments were made by the same investigator. All the subjects were trained to familiarize the subjects with the pressure algometry procedure before the measures in an anatomical site different from the chosen sites for this study.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention in anxiety and depression in the participants. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in order to assess these parameters.</description>
