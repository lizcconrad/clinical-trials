  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although contemporary cataract surgery has made tremendous strides in technological
      advancement, posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is still the most frequent long-term
      complication leading to decreased visual functions and thereby dissatisfying results. A great
      deal of effort has been made to develop new ways to prevent the formation of PCO. A key
      factor, widely discussed in literature, is the material and design of the intraocular lense
      (IOL) edge that can lead to PCO prevention. It is still not clear whether the sharp-edged IOL
      produces less PCO because of its optic geometry alone or whether the biomaterial contributes
      to the inhibition of PCO. With the clinical introduction of the single‐piece acrylic
      hydrophobic IOLs with some optic and haptic design differences compared with three‐piece
      acrylic hydrophobic IOLs, it has become possible to determine the influence of IOL material
      and design on PCO prevention. It is well established that the development of PCO is a dynamic
      process and that a longer follow-up time is correlated with a higher degree of PCO. So far,
      there have been prospective clinical studies on the clinical results of single and
      three‐piece acrylic hydrophobic foldable IOLs. However, the question as to as to whether the
      PCO further increases or becomes stable or regresses on a long-term basis has not yet been
      answered. Since there is paucity of available literature that prospectively evaluates the
      development of PCO with the implantation of the single-piece SN60AT hydrophobic acrylic IOL
      on a long-term basis, the investigators decided to observe the degree of development of PCO
      at 5 years after cataract surgery.
