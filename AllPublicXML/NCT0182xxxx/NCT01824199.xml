      If CYP2C19 genotype can predict the efficacy of healing erosive esophagitis and gastric acid
      secretion in patients taking once a day omeprazole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proton pump inhibitors are metabolized through the CYP2C19 hepatic enzyme system. Several
      variant genotypes of this enzyme exist which may lead to decreased, normal or increased
      metabolism of the proton pump inhibitor. With alteration of metabolism, the degree of gastric
      acid suppression achieved and efficacy in treating reflux could be affected. For example,
      Asian populations who have low activity of CYP2C19, commonly need lower doses of proton pump
      inhibitors to manage gastroesophageal reflux because of more sustained blood levels and
      availability of the drug. Theoretically, those patients who are rapid metabolizers would
      receive less effective treatment with proton pump inhibitors

    <description>Patients will undergo whole blood testing for CYP2C19 genotype and will be started on omeprazole 40 mg once daily in the morning 30 minutes before breakfast. The Mayo Dysphasia Questionnaire 30 day (MDQ-30day) will be used during the study. At the end of 8 weeks, patients will undergo dual probe pH/impedance testing on therapy and a clinically indicated endoscopy to rule out Barrett's esophagus and assess healing. CYP2C19 genotyping will be performed in the Mayo laboratory.</description>

    <description>Patients with LA Grade B-D erosive esophagitis identified at the time of endoscopy will be prospectively recruited. Patients will undergo whole blood testing for CYP2C19 genotype and will be started on omeprazole 40 mg once daily in the morning 30 minutes before breakfast. The Mayo Dysphasia Questionnaire -30 day (MDQ-30day) will be used during the study. At the end of 8 weeks, patients will undergo dual probe pH/impedance testing on therapy and a clinically indicated endoscopy to rule out Barrett's esophagus and assess healing.
