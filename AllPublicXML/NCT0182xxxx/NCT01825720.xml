  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperlactatemia, occuring 10-20% in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery, is known to
      be associated with hemodynamic instability, organ dysfunction and increased postoperative
      morbidity and mortality. Glucose-Insulin-Potassium(GIK) has been constantly used as an
      adjuvant therapy in patients with myocardial infarction or in the patients undergoing
      valvular heart surgery to reduce the low cardiac output syndrome and mortality. GIK is known
      to prevent excretion of lactate and to increase the extraction of lactate after reperfusion
      with various mechanism. In addition, it is also known to decrease ischemic-reperfusion injury
      of myocardium after CPB, to improve myocardial contractility, insulin resistance and
      hyperglucemia. As a result, it brings hemodynamic stability and sufficient oxygen supply to
      the tissue, which might reduce the incidence of hyperlactatemia after valvular heart surgery.
