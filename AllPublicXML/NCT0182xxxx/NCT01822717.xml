  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to find out whether a method of nonvisual foot inspection,
      using the senses of touch and smell, helps people with diabetes and visual impairment to find
      new foot problems when they are in early, easily-treated stages. All people in the study had
      regular foot inspections by podiatrists. The results include how people feel about the
      method, whether they actually did check their feet it, and whether the method helped them to
      discover foot problems themselves.

      Data gathered over the course of 1 year:

        -  bimonthly phone calls to ask about foot care practices at home over the last week

        -  a baseline comprehensive foot evaluation and 4 additional comprehensive evaluations
           every 3 months

      Qualitative data:

      - Focus groups immediately after comprehensive diabetes self-management education, and 1 year
      later, to determine acceptability of foot care procedures and patient perceptions about
      effectiveness
