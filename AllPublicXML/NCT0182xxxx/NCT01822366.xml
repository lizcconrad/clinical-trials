  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to study the effectiveness of Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (TF-CBT) in treating traumatic grief and traumatic stress for orphaned children and young
      adolescents in two East African sites with high prevalence HIV, Moshi, Tanzania (TZ) and
      Bungoma, Kenya (KE), through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In a previous feasibility
      study of TF-CBT with orphans in Tanzania, the investigators have found a group-based TF-CBT
      intervention to be feasible and acceptable, with promising clinical outcomes. In the
      feasibility study, lay counselors with no prior mental health experience delivered the
      intervention with training and supervision by our team of mental health and TF-CBT experts.

      Building on this initial study, the investigators are conducting a RCT to test the
      effectiveness of TF-CBT for traumatic grief and traumatic stress compared to receipt of usual
      care orphan services in TZ and KE. The study involves collaboration with HIV/AIDS grassroots
      organizations and local Co-Investigators in TZ and KE, both of whom are longstanding
      collaborators with the investigators' US team and are located in mixed urban and rural areas,
      allowing examination of effectiveness in two countries and two settings (urban/rural). Using
      a task-shifting approach, in which lay individuals are trained as counselors, the
      investigators will train six counselors in each country, who deliver 20 groups in each site
      (10 rural, 10 urban), resulting in 320 children and adolescents (ages 7-13) who receive
      TF-CBT and 320 who receive usual care. Outcomes for children are assessed at 12-14 weeks
      (i.e., corresponding with the end of TF-CBT), 6-months post-treatment, and 12-months
      post-treatment. TF-CBT experts from the investigators' team partner with the lay counselors
      from the feasibility study (e.g., local trainers) to train the TZ and KE counselors, and
      these local trainers provide the TF-CBT supervision, while supervised themselves by the
      US-based TF-CBT and mental health experts. The investigators expect this trial to yield
      recommendations regarding an effective intervention for orphans that is acceptable, feasible,
      and includes local responsibility as a means to enhance potential sustainability in Low- and
      Middle-Income Countries (LAMICs). Findings will inform other efforts to scale up mental
      health interventions to address the substantial mental health gap.
