    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a disease where muscles in the affected body part are abnormally active. This may
      result in abnormal postures. The underlying mechanisms are not known. One proposed mechanism
      is located in the motor area of the brain that controls the coordination of muscles, called
      the motor cortex. It is well known that the motor area of one hemisphere of the brain (motor
      cortex) controls the movement of the opposite side of the body. When people perform tasks
      such as picking up an object or writing there are mechanisms in motor cortex that focus the
      level of activity so that they can do these tasks with a high level of precision. Focusing
      activity in motor cortex seems to be disturbed in people with dystonia. Transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) is a device that allows the non-invasive stimulation of the brain. When
      applied to the motor cortex it can upregulate or down regulate its activity. In the present
      study the investigators will conduct experiments on subjects with task specific focal hand
      dystonia (such as writers cramp) using TMS to decrease unwanted motor activity. The
      investigators will assess the effects of this intervention using objective, subjective and
      kinematic measures. This is a pilot study and will require further research to assess the
      long-term effects of repetitive TMS on task-specific focal hand dystonia.
