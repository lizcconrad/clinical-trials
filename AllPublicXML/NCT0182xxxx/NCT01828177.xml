    <description>IGA Score Success Rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieve &quot;Clear&quot; (score = 0) or &quot;Almost Clear&quot; (score = 1) and have at least a 2-grade improvement on the IGA score at the End of Treatment. IGA score is used to evaluate the overall severity of rosacea using a 5-point scale from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).</description>
