  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with acute coronary syndromes scheduled for cardiac catheterization will be enrolled
      in this study. Subjects that are to be treated clinically with coronary artery stenting will
      be randomized to receive a loading dose of clopidogrel versus ticagrelor after diagnostic
      angiography but prior to stenting. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be performed after
      stenting and the presence of blood clots inside the new stent will be measured and compared
      between the groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient Characteristics:

          1. Males and non-pregnant females &gt; 18 and &lt; 79 years of age presenting with acute
             coronary syndrome defined as having two of the following criteria:

               1. Signs and symptoms consistent with accelerated angina or prolonged angina
                  (lasting greater than 20 minutes) either at rest or with minimal exertion

               2. ECG changes indicative of new ischemia

               3. Levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponin-T) above the upper limit of the normal
                  range.

          2. Patients scheduled to undergo coronary angiography with possible percutaneous coronary
             intervention (PCI)

             preclude inclusion in this study

          4. Subjects with NYHA class III or IV heart failure or known left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt; 30%

          5. Subjects with an ST elevation myocardial infarction

          8. Subjects who are or may be pregnant

          9. Subjects with known allergies to contrast media

         10. Subjects with renal failure as defined by eGFR &lt; 60.

         11. History of TIA or stroke &lt; 6 months

         12. History of hemorrhagic stroke

         13. Hepatic insufficiency defined as liver cirrhosis, AST/ALT/Alkaline Phosphatase greater
             than 3 times the upper limit of normal or hyperbilirubinemia.

        Lesion Specific Exclusion Criteria These exclusion criteria apply to the target lesion to
        be imaged by OCT.

          1. Lesion located in the left main coronary artery

          2. Lesions that are heavily calcified

          3. Lesions where OCT cannot be performed due to technical difficulties

          4. Other lesions that the investigator deems inappropriate for the procedure such as
             sites with excessive tortuosity or low flow by TIMI grade.

          5. Lesion in saphenous vein or arterial conduit
