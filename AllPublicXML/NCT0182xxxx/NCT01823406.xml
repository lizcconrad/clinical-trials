  <brief_summary>

      We will perform blood sugar studies to assess changes in metabolic (biochemical processes
      that occur within us) profiles associated with high blood sugar and diabetes.

      Objective: To assess steady state and dynamic metabolite changes in subjects with type 1
      diabetes with and without microvascular complications and to understand intrinsic differences
      from non-diabetics in metabolite levels and flux.

      The hypothesis is that diabetic complications arise from tissue-specific metabolic
      reprogramming resulting in alterations in fuel utilization which lead to dysfunction of the
      tissue. To test this hypothesis, we will use sensitive and specific mass spectrometer based
      metabolomic analysis to measure steady state metabolite levels in plasma and urine from
      controls subjects and subjects with T1DM, without and with diabetic complications during
      euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies.

    <description>Investigators will perform 4 hour Euglycemic and 4 hr hyperglycemic glucose clamps on each subject once. The Investigators will have 4 different groups of subjects. At specific time points during the clamps, the investigators will draw blood samples for measurement of metabolic assays and flux . The investigators will also collect spot urine samples for metabolic assay and flux.</description>

    <description>Each cohort group will be admitted to the Michigan Clinical Research Unit for Blood glucose Clamp studies. Each subject will have a Euglycemic clamp (normal blood sugar clamp) for 4 hours and a hyperglycemic clamp (elevated blood sugar to 300) for 4 hours. Once the subject is clamped, bloods and urine will be collected to assay for specific metabolomics and proteomic biomarkers. We will perform the same clamps for each cohort.</description>
