  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and influence of an intervention
      (COGNUTRIN) using nutritional supplements (n-3 fatty acids and blueberry anthocyanins) on
      cognitive performance in breast cancer survivors following chemotherapy. The investigators'
      goal is to treat or lessen the late effects of cancer treatment. The supplement to be used
      will be a combination of the following: (1) VitaBlue (40% polyphenolics, 12.5% anthocyanins
      from blueberries (BB) and (2) n-3 fatty acids - Lovaza.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of administration of the nutritional
      supplement and placebo in this patient population and performing cognitive function testing
      at baseline and post supplementation.

      This is a randomized, double-blind pilot study of COGNUTRIN vs. Placebo.

      Participants have an equal chance (like flipping a coin) of being in either of the study
      groups. Neither the participant nor the study doctor will be able to choose which study group
      the participant is in. Participants will not know and the study doctor will not know which
      study group the participants are in.

    <measure>Number of Impaired Neuropsychological Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from baseline +/- 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is to compare the number of impaired neuropsychological tests. The planned intervention period is three months. Neuropsychological outcomes will be examined using a 2 (group; COGNUTRIN, placebo) X 2 (time; baseline, three-months) repeated measures ANOVA to functioning, depression and fatigue will be evaluated for association with neurocognitive performance and entered as covariates in statistical analyses if a marginally significant association (p&lt;.10) is observed. Changes in cognitive function: Number of impaired neuropsychological tests after 3 months of intervention with COGNUTRIN vs. placebo.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Related Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from baseline +/- 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoint is incidence and severity of AEs occurring during intervention with either COGNUTRIN or placebo. All AEs that are reported by the subject, detected during a visit, physical examination, or laboratory work-up will be recorded in the participant's medical record and recorded on the case report form (CRF). All AEs that occur after the informed consent is signed will be recorded on the AE CRF whether or not related to study agent, using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) version 4.0.</description>
