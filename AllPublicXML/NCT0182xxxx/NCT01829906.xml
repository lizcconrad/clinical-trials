  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the only long-term established treatment for morbid obesity. However,
      some patients experience suboptimal weight loss after surgery and/or experience a significant
      weight regain. Unfortunately there are very few studies in this area and little is known
      about the causes for lack of success or the best approach to treat this group of patients.
      The main aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of two different lifestyle treatment
      programs in this group of patients: 1) Hospital-based outpatient program or 2) an inpatient
      treatment program consisting of 3 - 3-week stays at a rehabilitation center over a 1-year
      period. Secondary aim is to determine potential reasons for suboptimal weight loss after
      bariatric surgery.

    <description>Multidisciplinary outpatient programme including both individual and group-based therapy. During the first visit, every patient will have an individual consultation with the dietician, physiotherapist and psychiatric nurse. After this, the patients will be followed up in groups every month for the first four months and every two months afterwards up to one year. The intervention will focus on nutritional education, healthy eating, increased physical activity levels (aiming initially at 10 minutes/day, then increasing to 30 minutes/day) and cognitive therapy.</description>
