      Options for large-scale preventive distributions include fortified blended flours,
      ready-to-use foods and direct cash transfer either alone or in combination with family
      protective rations. Finding the most appropriate strategy is essential to prevent child
      malnutrition in countries like Niger with annual hunger gaps. Here, the investigators compare
      different preventive strategies on the incidence of acute malnutrition among children 6 to 23
      months.

    <description>Severe acute malnutrition was defined as : Weight for Height Z-score (WHO Standards 2006)&lt; -3 and/or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt; 115mm and/or bipedal oedema. MUAC was measured at the midpoint of a child's left arm with a plastic measuring tape with a precision of 1 mm.
These indicators were evaluated monthly during the entire follow-up (15 months).</description>
