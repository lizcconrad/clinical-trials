    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effect of oral fast-dissolving formulations of paracetamol and
      ibuprofen on the lining of the stomach and duodenum (gastrointestinal mucosa). Endoscopic
      examinations were conducted to determine the gastrointestinal damage produced post a 7 day
      treatment regimen.

          <description>This was a randomized, 4-way crossover study. Participants received two fast dissolving paracetamol tablets (500 milligrams [mg]/tablet) four times daily (QID); two liquid-filled gelatin capsules containing ibuprofen (200 mg/capsule), three times daily (TID); two ibuprofen tablets (200 mg/tablet), TID; and, two fast dissolving placebo tablets QID. All the treatments were administered orally with water. There was a washout period of 7 days following every treatment session.</description>
