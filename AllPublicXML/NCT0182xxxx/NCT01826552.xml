      The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, open label, parallel arm study whether the
      newest 3rd generation stent - Orsiro hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent is noninferior to the
      newest 2nd generation stent - Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent in terms of 9
      months in-stent late lumen loss. 345 Korean patients with a wide variety of coronary heart
      disease will be enrolled to this &quot;all-comers&quot; trial to give definite answer to the above
      hypothesis that is urgently needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rate of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has dramatically
      decreased since the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES). However, restenosis still
      remains a problem and some papers reported that the rate of restenosis can even go up to
      nearly 20% after the first-generation DES implantation, depending on the complexity of target
      lesion. Furthermore, there arises a concern about thrombogenic risk of these DES at the
      expense of reduced restenosis. Therefore, works aiming to reduce both restenosis and
      thrombosis are on-going, and there has been a rush of various second-generation DES with
      &quot;biocompatible but non-absorbable polymer&quot; and third-generation DES with &quot;bioabsorbable
      polymer&quot;.

      Recently, Orsiro hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent (Orsiro SES, Biotronik AG, Bulach,
      Switzeland) has been developed. It has a unique hybrid combination of polymers coated on thin
      cobalt-chromium struts (60um). The BIOlute® active component is a bioabsorbable polymer
      matrix combined with an anti-proliferative drug, sirolimus, and elutes the drug in a
      controlled manner after implantation, degrades over time and leaves only the PROBIO® coated
      stent behind in the long-term. The PROBIO® passive coating encapsulates the stent and
      protects interaction between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue. Although Orsiro SES
      showed excellent results in terms of late lumen loss at 9 months in first-in-man single arm
      trial (BIOFLOW-I trial), randomized controlled trials evaluating its efficacy and safety are
      limited to date.

      The ORIENT Trial will evaluate the angiographic and clinical outcomes of the innovative
      third-generation DES, Orsiro SES, compared with the latest second-generation DES, Resolute
      Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES-I, Medtronic Cardiovascular, Santa Rosa, California,
      USA), for treatment of patients with coronary artery disease.

TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel performed for restenosis or other complication of the target lesion. All TLRs should be classified prospectively as clinically indicated* or not clinically indicated by the investigator prior to repeat angiography. An independent angiographic core laboratory should verify that the severity of percent diameter stenosis meets requirements for clinical indication and will overrule in cases where investigator reports are not in agreement. The target lesion is defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal to the stent and to 5 mm distal to the stent.</description>

    <description>ARC definition of stent thrombosis is classified and defined as follows. Definite/Confirmed stent thrombosis refers angiographic or pathologic confirmation of partial or total thrombotic occlusion within the per-stent region with either i) acute ischemic symptoms, ii) ischemic EKG changes, iii) elevated cardiac biomarkers. Probable stent thrombosis is defined as any unexplained death within 30 days of stent implantation or any myocardial infarction, which is related to documented acute ischemia in the territory of the implanted stent without angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis and in the absence of any other obvious cause. Possible stent thrombosis is defined as any unexplained death beyond 30 days of stent implantation.</description>
