      This study assessed the impact of a task-focusing strategy on perceived stress levels and
      performance during a simulated CPR scenario.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) causes significant stress, which may cause
      deficiencies in attention and increase distractibility. This may lead to misjudgements of
      priorities and delays in CPR performance, which may further increase mental stress (vicious
      cycle).

      Aim: This study assessed the impact of a task-focusing strategy on perceived stress levels
      and performance during a simulated CPR scenario.

      Methods: This is a prospective, randomized-controlled trial

      Setting: Simulator-center of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.

      Participants: A total of 124 volunteer medical students

      Intervention: Randomization to receive a 10 minute instruction to cope with stress by loudly
      posing two task-focusing questions (&quot;what is the patient's condition?&quot;, &quot;what immediate
      action is needed?&quot;) when feeling overwhelmed by stress (intervention group) or a control
      group.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome is the perceived levels of stress and feeling
      overwhelmed (stress/overload); secondary outcomes were hands-on time, time to start CPR and
      number of leadership statements.

    <description>Students in the intervention group received a 10 minute instruction to cope with stress. They were informed that an emergency situation is a stressful experience for health care workers and that perceived stress may interfere with their decision-making abilities and performance. Particularly, feeling overwhelmed by stress may cause cognitive impairment potentially leading to loss of concept how to deal with an emergency situation, which in turn further increases stress (vicious cycle). However, it is possible to overcome this situation by focusing on the basic conditions of the situation and the immediate actions that are needed. They were instructed that they should ask two task-focusing questions aloud (&quot;what is the patient's condition?&quot;, &quot;what immediate action is needed?&quot;) to overcome the negative consequences of feeling overwhelmed by stress.</description>
