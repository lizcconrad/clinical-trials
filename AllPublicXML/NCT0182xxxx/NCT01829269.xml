  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The average survival rate of a defibrillation lead is 91 to 99% at 2 years, 85-95% at 5 years
      and 60-72% at 8 years. We must also manage alerts for defibrillation probes with a higher
      complication rate than average. We will therefore be increasingly confronted with faulty
      sensors or at risk to be replaced.

      There are no standardized approach for replacing defibrillation lead. A record made in the
      United States showed significant differences according to the teams strategy in case of
      failure of defibrillation lead in particular with regard to the decision to explant or
      abandon the probe.

      The risk of extracting a defibrillation lead are well known with a major complication rate of
      1.6 to 1.95%.

      Regarding the risk of complications related to the abandonment of a probe we have less data.
      For some there is no risk to abandon a defibrillation lead. But others reported a
      complication rate of 5.5% related to pacing discontinued.

      Main objective: Collect the attitude of different centers and different operators when
      replacing a failed defibrillation lead or &quot;at risk.&quot; Explantation or abandonment of the
      sensor replaced.

        Centers are hospitals recruiters French public or private, authorized to ask defibrillators
        and who agreed to participate in the study. A cardiologist referral will be designated for
        each hospital.

        Patients with a defibrillator will be recruited during their hospitalization for change
        probe. Patients will receive full information about the purpose and conduct of the study.
