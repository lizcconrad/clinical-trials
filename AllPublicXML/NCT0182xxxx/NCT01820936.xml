  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of food and two modified fasting regimens
      on the pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug) of PCI-32765 in healthy adult
      participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (individuals will be assigned by chance to study treatments), open-label
      (identity of assigned study drug will be known), 4-way crossover study to compare the effect
      of food and two fasting regimens on the pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765 in healthy adults.
      There will be approximately 52 (at least 25% women) participants (11 in each sequence in the
      4-way crossover and 8 in an optional cohort). A screening phase will be followed by an
      open-label treatment phase consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods of 420 mg PCI-32765
      administered with or without food. Doses in successive open-label treatment periods will be
      separated by a washout period of 7 days. Participants will be confined to the study center
      from Day -1 of each treatment period (at least 10 hours before each study drug
      administration) until completion of the 72 hour pharmacokinetic blood sample collection on
      Day 4 of Period 4. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of PCI-32765 and metabolite
      PCI-45227 will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after dosing in each treatment
      period. A follow-up visit approximately 10 days after the last dose will be made to measure
      lymphocyte count and to capture any additional adverse events. After completion of the 4-way
      crossover portion of the study, and in absence of significant safety observations at the 420
      mg PCI-32765 dose, an additional separate cohort of 8 participants may be enrolled to
      participate in one treatment period and receive a dose of 840 mg in combination with a
      high-fat breakfast. Safety will be assessed throughout the study. The total study duration is
      a maximum of 85 days.
