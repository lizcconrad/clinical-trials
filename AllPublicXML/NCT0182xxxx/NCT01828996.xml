  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is an extremely common urologic diagnosis
      and accounts for approximately 2 million outpatient visits to urology practices in the United
      States alone. Up to 6% of men in Canada recently experienced at least moderate to severe
      prostatitis-like symptoms with two thirds having symptoms lasting more than one year. There
      are a myriad of therapies for prostatitis, some of which work on some of the men but none
      works for all the men. Recently, a number of centres have been using low energy shock waves
      applied on the skin to target the prostate and the muscles around the prostate. The initial
      reports showed a significant reduction in the pain experienced by the men with prostatitis.
      However, this potentially highly promising therapy has not been widely used at least in part
      due to a lack of properly designed studies to validate this therapy. The investigators plan a
      randomized control trial using shock wave therapy on men with prostatitis. The goal is to
      provide some solid evidence that either shock waves are or are not of clinical benefit.

      The investigators hypothesize men with chronic prostatitis/ chronic pelvic pain syndrome will
      have a reduction in pain and improved voiding and sexual function following low power
      transdermal shock wave therapy to the prostate and surrounding pelvic muscles.
