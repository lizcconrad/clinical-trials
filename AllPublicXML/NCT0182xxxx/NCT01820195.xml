  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many controversies about the role of N-Acetyl Cystein in preventing of contrast
      nephropathy. These contradictory results may be due to different criteria for patients'
      selection, different end points, different type and dose of N-Acetyl Cystein administration
      and finally different prophylactic measures other than N-Acetyl Cystein. The investigators
      try to enroll a double blind double dummy study with a good power to compare the effect of
      this drug both in the form of oral and intravenous against the placebo in preventing the
      contrast nephropathy in the patients whom undergo coronary angiography/angioplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast Nephropathy is the third cause of acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients. The
      morbidity and mortality of this disorder is considerable. There is no treatment for this
      condition and all measures should be taken into account to prevent this complication. Among
      the all prophylactic measures hydration and the dose ant type of contrast are the only
      factors that have been proved to be effective in preventing contrast nephropathy. N-Acetyl
      Cystein is an antioxidant agents that may be effective in different aspects of medicine, but
      it,s use in this condition is controversial. While some studies showed it is effective in
      prevention of contrast nephropathy, others showed no benefit. Different studies used
      different dose and route of administration. So more clinical trials with good power are
      needed to compare different oral Vs IV administration of the drug in a randomized double
      blinded clinical trial. In this study we allocate the eligible patients with chronic kidney
      diseases stages 2 to 4 to three groups. Oral N-Acetyl Cystein group, IV N-Acetyl Cystein
      group, placebo group. All group will be matched according to stages of chronic kidney
      diseases, diabetes, anemia, heart failure, age and sex.
