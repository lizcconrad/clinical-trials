  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are reasons other than medical
      reasons that could limit access to liver transplantation in alcoholic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators perform a study combining the follow up of a previous cohort of 450
      patients and the inclusion of 150 new patients.

      The study is performed in medical or hepatogastroenterology departments of nine French public
      hospitals mostly non-teaching. They lay in three French area, selected according to the
      density of patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in the area, respectively, &quot;high&quot; as
      in Brittany-Loire, 'average' in Ile de France and &quot;low&quot; as in the Languedoc-Roussillon.

      The patients included in the cohort must respond to the following criteria: having liver
      cirrhosis of whatever origin and age over 18 years. The cirrhosis must be confirmed by the
      morphological or histological criteria.

      Structured forms and questionnaires will allow the collection of data. Information collected
      from patients include socio demographic characteristics, medical history, history of
      consumption of psychotropic (i.e., alcohol or drugs), clinical, biological, histological
      characteristics and psychological. Inpatients complete a self-assessment structured
      questionnaire &quot;Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale&quot; (HAD).

      Patients are followed until they are registered or not on the national waiting list or die,
      every 6 months after inclusion until 2 years.

      Statistical analysis will focus on descriptive analysis, survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier,
      and analytic analysis. Association with registration on the national waiting list of
      inpatients will be searched using Cox and logistic regression models. Further analyzes will
      be conducted for example on the differences of opinion between physicians and patients, on
      regional differences.
