      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ADH-1 when given together with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin in treating patients with pancreatic or biliary tract
      cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally
      advanced) or spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and cannot be removed by surgery.
      ADH-1 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving ADH-1 together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and
      cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities and determine the recommended dose of ADH-1 given twice weekly
      for 3 weeks in combination with cisplatin and fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride) given on weeks 1 and 2 of the 3 week schedule for 3 cycles in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic or biliary tract adenocarcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1),
      E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble vascular endothelial growth
      factor receptor (VEGFR) and basic fibroblast growth factor (B-FGF) during therapy with ADH-1,
      cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      II. Radiographic assessment of disease status after 3 cycles of chemotherapy with ADH-1,
      cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic or biliary tract adenocarcinomas treated with ADH-1 given with
      cisplatin and fixed dose rate gemcitabine for 3 cycles. Patients with stable or responsive
      disease after 3 cycles will continue on maintenance cisplatin and fixed dose rate
      gemcitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ADH-1.

      Patients receive ADH-1 intravenously (IV) over 20-80 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18,
      cisplatin IV and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with stable or responsive disease may receive maintenance therapy with
      cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

             administration in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, or serious, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, that might
             jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the chemotherapy program outlined in
             this protocol with reasonable safety

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study

          -  Patients with prior malignancy will be excluded except for adequately treated basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, adequately treated noninvasive carcinomas, or other
             cancers from which the patient has been disease-free for at least 5 years
