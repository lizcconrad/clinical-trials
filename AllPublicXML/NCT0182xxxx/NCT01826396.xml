  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current treatment of colon cancer, the definition of locally advanced colon cancer
      (LACC) is controversial, and the clinical trial evidence which support treatment for LACC is
      not clear. Irinotecan (CPT-11) combined with fluoropyrimidine (5FU, capecitabine) is main
      chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Whether this regimen also
      could be effectively applied for patients with locally advanced colon cancer? It is worthy of
      clinicians to conduct research. In recent studies, the literature indicated that the the
      uridine diphosphate glucuronide transfer enzyme (UGT1A1) is an important metabolic enzymes
      associated with drug metabolism of CPT-11. The gene polymorphism of UGT1A1 is related to
      delayed diarrhea and neutropenia caused by irinotecan. Irinotecan dose-exploration study
      found that the maximum tolerated dose for irinotecan in patients with UGT1A1*28 homozygous
      variant genotypes was significantly lower compared with the wild genotype. The studies based
      on Asian patients suggested that the gene variant of UGT1A1*6 also have similar impacts. At
      present, the studies of irinotecan dose adjustment based on the UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms has
      not yet come to the consistency of conclusions. The frequency of UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms
      between different races is significant different, irinotecan dose exploratory study based on
      Chinese patients has not been carried out.

      This study focus on prospectively adverse reactions, optimal efficacy and R0 resection rate
      of the patients with LACC who treated by dose-adjusted irinotecan based on the genotypes of
      UGT1A1.
