  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess if the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of iOWH032 are
      grossly different in 1) Bangladeshi healthy population and 2) Bangladeshi cholera patients.
      This is not a hypothesis-driven research study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts.

      The first part (Part A) will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
      iOWH032 in healthy, adult Bangladeshi volunteers.

      The second part (Part B) will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
      iOWH032 in adult Bangladeshi patients with cholera. While female participants will be
      included in Part A, only male patients will be enrolled in Part B. The rationale for
      excluding women in Part B is the difficulty in separating urine from stool in severely
      dehydrated females with rapid rates of purging. Moreover, it has been difficult to retain
      adult females in the hospital after improvement of their diarrhoea because of their household
      responsibilities, which might impact compliance in this small study. Further, no sex
      differences in the pharmacokinetics of iOWH032 were found in the study conducted in healthy
      subjects in the US, which included 42 males and females, nor have sex differnces been
      observed in preclinical studies.

For Part B, patients with culture-proven V. cholerae O1 infection will be evaluated independently of those with a negative culture. Those who are culture negative for V. cholerae but have received iOWH032 will remain in the study and the same protocol will be followed for their management including the follow up visit.</description>

    <description>The safety and tolerability endpoint for this study is adverse events (AEs). All participants and patients receiving investigational product (iOWH032) will be included in the safety analysis. Laboratory values, physical examinations and vital signs will be summarized over time and treatment group using the descriptive statistics and plots.</description>

    <description>Part A: This initial part of the study will be conducted in adult Bangladeshi healthy volunteers (4 males, 4 females) to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single doses of iOWH032. Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) of icddr,b (located at a 10 minute drive from the icddr,b main campus) the day prior to dosing and remain for 48 hours after dosing, unless treatment and/or follow-up of an adverse event (AE) require longer in-unit observation or treatment.</description>

    <description>Part A: Participants will be randomized at a 3:1 ratio to receive treatment with iOWH032 or placebo. A randomisation code will be generated. Each participant will be assigned the next participant number available and thereby will be assigned randomly. Active treatment will consist of an oral tablet containing 300 mg of iOWH032. The placebo will consist of identical looking tablets.
Part B: There will be no randomization during this trial. All eligible patients will receive 300 mg of iOWH032.</description>
