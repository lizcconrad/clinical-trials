      The objective of this trial is 1) to evaluate the safety and clinical acceptability of a
      5-day course of mupirocin applied every 8 hours (± 2 hours) to the nares, umbilical and
      perianal areas of infants residing in the ICU. 2) to examine the efficacy of mupirocin in
      eradicating SA colonization of infants in the ICU, defined as the absence of SA in cultures
      of the nares, umbilical, and perianal areas on day 8 (± 2) (primary decolonization) 3) to
      examine the efficacy of mupirocin in achieving persistent eradication of SA colonization
      among infants residing in the ICU,defined as the absence of SA in cultures of the nares,
      umbilical, and perianal areas. Duration is 36 months. Enrolled infants will continue to
      receive medical care as they otherwise would if they were not enrolled in the trial. The
      study will be powered with a primary endpoint with 126 participants. Enrollment may continue
      to 500 participants to power secondary and exploratory endpoints and assist design subsequent
      studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open label, multi-center, randomized trial to determine the safety and
      efficacy of mupirocin in eradicating colonization with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and
      preventing the occurrence of invasive and other clinically significant SA infections among
      critically ill infants in the ICU. Infants hospitalized in an ICU at any one of the 6
      participating centers with a positive nasal culture for SA will be eligible to enroll.
      Infants will be stratified by birth gestational age (&lt; 28 weeks and &lt;8 weeks of post-natal
      life or &gt; /= 28 weeks / &lt; 28 weeks and &gt; /=8 weeks of post-natal life) and colonizing strain
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
      aureus (MSSA) and then randomized 1:1 to receive a 5 day course of mupirocin applied to the
      nares, umbilicus and perianal (NUP) areas every 8 hours (± 2 hours) vs. no treatment.
      (Stratification by birth gestational age is performed to minimize bias that could result from
      a higher risk for developing infection due to prematurity or prolonged length of stay due to
      prematurity.) The primary objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the safety and clinical
      acceptability of a 5-day course of mupirocin applied every 8 hours (± 2 hours) to the nares,
      umbilical and perianal areas of infants residing in the ICU 2) to examine the efficacy of
      mupirocin in eradicating SA colonization of infants in the ICU, defined as the absence of SA
      in cultures of the nares, umbilical, and perianal areas on day 8 (± 2) (primary
      decolonization) 3) to examine the efficacy of mupirocin in achieving persistent eradication
      of SA colonization among infants residing in the ICU, defined as the absence of SA in
      cultures of the nares, umbilical, and perianal areas on days 8 (±2) and 22 (±2) (persistent
      decolonization). The secondary objectives of this study are to 1) To examine the efficacy of
      mupirocin in preventing clinical SA infection during days 1-22 or until discharge, whichever
      occurs first, among SA colonized infants who are residing in the ICU 2) To compare time until
      SA decolonization between the mupirocin and placebo groups: Time from Day 1 until the first
      NUP collection with no SA is detected in the nares, umbilical, and perianal areas 3) To
      examine whether mupirocin affects the frequency of non-SA clinical infections by comparing
      the frequency of these infections in the treatment and control groups during the 85 day
      observation period 4) To examine whether mupirocin affects the frequency of severe (stage
      II-III) necrotizing enterocolitis by comparing the frequency of occurrence in the treatment
      and control groups during the 85 day observation period.

      Each participant will be enrolled for up to 12 weeks (Day 85) or until the time of discharge
      from the hospital, death or withdrawal from further participation, whichever occurs first. It
      is anticipated that it will take at least 2 years to enroll all participants. Study duration
      is 36 months. Enrolled infants will continue to receive medical care as they otherwise would
      if they were not enrolled in the trial. The study will be powered toward the primary endpoint
      with 126 participants. Enrollment may continue up to a maximum of 500 participants to inform
      the secondary and exploratory endpoints and to help design any subsequent study.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Adverse Events (AEs) During Days 1-7</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were evaluated for solicited adverse events while in the NICU/ICU on days 1-7. Participants were counted if they experienced the symptom at any severity during the reporting period. Although participants received only 5 days of mupirocin, solicited events were collected through day 7.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Moderate and Severe Unsolicited Adverse Events; During Days 1-7</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were evaluated for moderate and severe unsolicited adverse events (that were not otherwise considered pre-defined trial endpoints) while in the NICU/ICU on days 1-7. Although participants received 5 days of mupirocin, unsolicited events were collected until day 7. Moderate events were defined as those that may cause some interference with functioning and daily activities. Severe events were defined as those that interrupt the participant's usual daily activities and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events were usually incapacitating.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) During Days 1-7</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 7</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were evaluated for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) while in the NICU/ICU on days 1-7. Although participants received only 5 days of mupirocin, SAEs were collected through day 7. An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction was considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; a life-threatening adverse event (an event that places the participant at immediate risk of death; it doesn't include an adverse event, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death); inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; or any other event that when based upon appropriate medical judgement may have jeopardized the participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

    <measure>Primary Decolonization Efficacy- Number of Participants in the Treatment and Control Groups Who Have no Detectable S. Aureus (SA) on Direct Nasal, Umbilical, and Perianal (NUP) Cultures Obtained on Day 8.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Colonization was defined as the presence of SA identified by NUP culture without signs of illness or infection. On day 8, participants were swabbed in each of three areas: nasal, umbilical, and perianal. These swabs were cultured by direct plating. If SA did not grow on any of these cultures the infant was considered to be decolonized. If SA grew on any one of these cultures the infant was considered to be colonized with SA.</description>

    <measure>Persistent Decolonization Efficacy- Number of Participants in the Treatment and Control Groups Who Have no Detectable S. Aureus (SA) on Direct Nasal, Umbilical, and Perianal (NUP) Cultures on Days 8 and 22.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 and Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were admitted into the study based on being colonized with SA. Participants who were decolonized both on day 8 and day 22, as determined by NUP cultures were considered to have persistent decolonization. Colonization was defined as the presence of SA identified by NUP culture without signs of illness or infection. NUP swabs were collected on day 8 and on day 22 and cultured by direct plating. If the cultures were negative for SA at both day 8 and day 22 the participant was considered to have persistent decolonization. Colonization with SA was a prerequisite for enrollment, because of this there was no baseline measure.</description>

    <description>Relative risk of occurrence of non-SA clinical infection in the treatment compared to the control group using the intent to treat (ITT) cohort for analysis. The time periods in the table correspond to the study days having scheduled collection of nasal, umbilical, and perianal (NUP) cultures. At risk participants were eligible for the non-SA clinical infection to occur at the start of the interval, were still on study and had not yet had a non-SA clinical infection but were still being watched for the event. Non-SA clinical infection was the development of a non-SA clinical infection due to an identifiable organism as evidenced by culture of an organism other than SA from a normally sterile body site or an infant who met the clinical diagnosis of localized infection as defined in the protocol. Censored participants were at risk for some of the interval, did not have a non-SA clinical infection but were removed from eligibility for the event at some point after the interval started.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Infants less than 24 months of age were recruited from among those admitted to the NICU or ICU at one of the participating centers found to have a surveillance nasal swab culture positive for SA. Recruitment was performed sequentially as infants became eligible without regards for race, ethnicity, gestational age or gender.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Infants were screened for nasal SA colonization (MRSA or MSSA) and only those who were colonized (not infected) were offered enrollment.</pre_assignment_details>

Although participants received 5 days of mupirocin, unsolicited events were collected until day 7. Moderate events were defined as those that may cause some interference with functioning and daily activities. Severe events were defined as those that interrupt the participant's usual daily activities and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events were usually incapacitating.</description>

        <description>Colonization was defined as the presence of SA identified by NUP culture without signs of illness or infection. On day 8, participants were swabbed in each of three areas: nasal, umbilical, and perianal. These swabs were cultured by direct plating. If SA did not grow on any of these cultures the infant was considered to be decolonized. If SA grew on any one of these cultures the infant was considered to be colonized with SA.</description>

If SA did not grow on any of these cultures the infant was considered to be decolonized. If SA grew on any one of these cultures the infant was considered to be colonized with SA.</description>
          <population>The analysis population included all infants with a site-specific pre-randomization NUP culture that was positive for SA by direct culture and who either had a complete set of NUP cultures collected on Day 8 or else had discontinued NUP cultures prior to day 8 due to a clinical SA infection.</population>

        <title>Persistent Decolonization Efficacy- Number of Participants in the Treatment and Control Groups Who Have no Detectable S. Aureus (SA) on Direct Nasal, Umbilical, and Perianal (NUP) Cultures on Days 8 and 22.</title>
        <description>Participants were admitted into the study based on being colonized with SA. Participants who were decolonized both on day 8 and day 22, as determined by NUP cultures were considered to have persistent decolonization. Colonization was defined as the presence of SA identified by NUP culture without signs of illness or infection. NUP swabs were collected on day 8 and on day 22 and cultured by direct plating. If the cultures were negative for SA at both day 8 and day 22 the participant was considered to have persistent decolonization. Colonization with SA was a prerequisite for enrollment, because of this there was no baseline measure.</description>

        <description>Relative risk of occurrence of non-SA clinical infection in the treatment compared to the control group using the intent to treat (ITT) cohort for analysis. The time periods in the table correspond to the study days having scheduled collection of nasal, umbilical, and perianal (NUP) cultures. At risk participants were eligible for the non-SA clinical infection to occur at the start of the interval, were still on study and had not yet had a non-SA clinical infection but were still being watched for the event. Non-SA clinical infection was the development of a non-SA clinical infection due to an identifiable organism as evidenced by culture of an organism other than SA from a normally sterile body site or an infant who met the clinical diagnosis of localized infection as defined in the protocol. Censored participants were at risk for some of the interval, did not have a non-SA clinical infection but were removed from eligibility for the event at some point after the interval started.</description>

        <description>Relative risk of occurrence of non-SA clinical infection in the treatment compared to control groups using the according to protocol (ATP) cohort. The time periods in the table correspond to the study days having scheduled collection of nasal, umbilical, and perianal (NUP) cultures. At risk participants were eligible for the non-SA clinical infection to occur at the start of the interval, were still on study and had not yet had a non-SA clinical infection but were still being watched for the event. Non-SA clinical infection was the development of a non-SA clinical infection due to an identifiable organism as evidenced by culture of an organism other than SA from a normally sterile body site or an infant who met the clinical diagnosis of localized infection as defined in the protocol. Censored participants were at risk for some of the interval, did not have a non-SA clinical infection but were removed from eligibility for the event at some point after the interval started.</description>

        <description>Time until decolonization: Count of participants from Day 1 until the first NUP collection with no SA is detected in the nares, umbilical, and perianal areas using the modified intent to treat (mITT-8) cohort. The time periods in the table correspond to the study days having collection of nasal, umbilical, and perianal (NUP) cultures. At risk participants were eligible for the SA decolonization to occur at the start of the interval, were still on study and had not yet had SA decolonization but were still being watched for the event. SA decolonization was the absence of SA detected from the NUP cultures through direct plating. Censored participants were at risk for some of the interval, did not have SA decolonization but were removed from eligibility for the event at some point after the interval started.</description>

        <population>The mITT cohort includes all infants with a site-specific pre-randomization NUP culture that was positive for SA by direct culture.

Censored participants were at risk for some of the interval, did not have SA decolonization but were removed from eligibility for the event at some point after the interval started.</description>
