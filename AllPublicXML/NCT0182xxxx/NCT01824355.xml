      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that untrained subjects who have diabetes can
      operate the Investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) and obtain valid glucose
      results.

    <measure>Percent of Self Test Fingerstick Blood Glucose Results Within ±15 mg/dL (&lt; 75 mg/dL) and Within ±20% (≥ 75 mg/dL) of the Laboratory Glucose Method</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Untrained subjects with diabetes who self-tested fingerstick blood used the Ninja 3 PLUS investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS). BGMS results were compared with capillary plasma BG results obtained with a reference laboratory glucose method - YSI Life Sciences (YSI) Analyzer. BG meter results were used to calculate the number of BGMS results within +/- 15mg/dL (for reference BG results &lt;75mg/dL) and within +/- 20% (for reference BG results &gt;=75mg/dL) of the YSI reference method results.</description>
