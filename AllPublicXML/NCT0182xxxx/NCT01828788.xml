  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain after cardiac surgery is a risk factor for postoperative complications. In
      cardiac surgery, pain is more intense during the first 48 hours and disturbs the patient's
      capacity of coughing, deep breathing, and early mobilisation. It may be responsible for
      respiratory complications such as bronchial or pulmonary infection, and may also delay the
      patient's rehabilitation and therefore prolong the duration of in-hospital stay. A previous
      pilot study performed in our department showed a sensible improvement of analgesia at
      movement and of rehabilitation with a continuous bilaterosternal infusion of local
      anaesthesia [Eljezi et al.. Reg Anesth Pain Med 2012; 37:166]. Such strategy shall be tested
      in a subpopulation of patients at risk for respiratory complication.

      Prospective, controlled, randomised, parallel, single-centre, single-blinded trial, comparing
      to a control (conventional care with no locoregional anaesthesia) an infusion of ropivacaine
      through two multihole catheters placed lateral to the sternum. In both groups, postoperative
      analgesia will be achieved by paracetamol plus titrated then self-administered intravenous
      morphine.
