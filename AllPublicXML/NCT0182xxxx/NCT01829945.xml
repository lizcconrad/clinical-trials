  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence indicate that a significant proportion of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) events are attributable to the presence of a cluster of metabolic abnormalities and
      perturbations, defined as the metabolic syndrome. It has been estimated that approximately
      25% of the North American adult population is living with the metabolic syndrome. Recent
      studies show that overaccumulation of atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) seen
      in insulin-resistant patients is partly due to increased production rate of intestinally
      derived apolipoproteinB-48-containing lipoproteins. This is of interest because substantial
      evidence exists indicating that elevated levels of intestinal lipoproteins are associated
      with increased CVD risk. However, as indicated in the body of this grant proposal, the
      underlying mechanisms that lead to intestinal overproduction of lipoproteins in
      insulin-resistant states are poorly understood.

      The general objective of the proposed research is to investigate the mechanisms by which the
      metabolic syndrome affects apolipoproteinB-48 secretion in human. The primary hypothesis is
      that insulin resistance will be associated with higher levels of intestinal lipoproteins
      because of an increased secretion of these particles.
