      This study is randomized controlled trial in which urgency incontinent women (approximately
      150-160) will be randomized to hypnotherapy or pharmacotherapy and evaluated at months 2, 6
      &amp;12; a subset of women will have pre-treatment brain activation and connectivity compared to
      controls using functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) with 2 month post-treatment brain
      activation and connectivity compared to pre-treatment in the UUI subset using fMRI.

      Hypotheses: Among patients with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), hypnotherapy decreases
      abnormal perception of bladder distension outside the hypnotic state and is at least as
      effective as pharmacotherapy in diminishing symptoms of urgency and severity of UUI. On fMRI
      in UUI, hypnotherapy will decrease hyper-activation of brain areas in response to bladder
      distension and/or modulate functional connectivity within the brain. Normalization of
      hyper-activation and connectivity will be greater in hypnotherapy compared to
      pharmacotherapy. Additionally, women who have greater improvement in UUI will have greater
      normalization of hyper-activation and connectivity on fMRI. UUI participants will exhibit
      increased activation within portions of the brain and abnormal functional connectivity
      relative to controls.

      Study Objectives Primary: To compare change in Urgency Urinary Incontinence (UUI) episodes at
      2 month follow-up on voiding diaries between hypnotherapy and pharmacotherapy groups (to
      determine whether hypnotherapy is at least as effective and durable in treating UUI as
      pharmacotherapy) and change in brain activation and connectivity on functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in the subset of UUI participants who have undergone fMRI

      Secondary:

        -  To determine whether hypnotherapy is at least as effective and durable, in treating UUI
           as pharmacotherapy comparing change in UUI episodes on voiding diary at 6 and 12 month
           follow-up

        -  To determine whether hypnotherapy is at least as effective and durable, in treating UUI
           as pharmacotherapy comparing change in questionnaire results and urinary frequency and
           pad counts on voiding diaries

        -  To determine baseline symptoms occurrence of concomitant syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel
           syndrome, constipation, anal incontinence, painful bladder syndrome) in this UUI
           population based on medical history and questionnaires. And to explore whether these
           symptoms change following treatment, assuming sufficient numbers of women at baseline.

        -  To confirm differences in brain activation and connectivity on fMRI in UUI compared to
           controls at baseline

      Overview: Women with UUI meeting criteria will give informed consent and be enrolled
      following administration of the OAB Awareness tool. Participants will keep voiding diaries
      then be randomized to either pharmacotherapy and conventional behavioral therapy or
      hypnotherapy and conventional behavioral therapy. Approximately 150-160 women will be
      randomized. Randomization will occur using a computer-generated randomization scheme in
      varying permuted block sizes. Investigators analyzing fMRI results, investigators analyzing
      RCT results and study personnel performing data entry will be blinded to participants'
      treatment. Blinding participants to treatment is not feasible. UUI participants will be
      followed in the study approximately 1 year. Measurements will be performed before treatment,
      following completion of treatment visits (approximately 8 weeks), and at 6 and 12 months. RCT
      primary analysis will be intention to treat. Secondary analyses will be per protocol. A
      subset of approximately UUI 60-70 participants (from both treatment groups) will undergo
      functional MRI (fMRI) pre and post-treatment. Approximately 20-30 controls will undergo fMRI.
      Outcomes will be differences in baseline brain activation and resting connectivity in UUI
      compared to controls, and post-treatment differences in brain activation and connectivity in
      UUI.

      Study Visits: UUI participant screening: Study information given. Screening questionnaire
      given. Visit 1 Enrollment: Formal screening for eligibility, voiding diary reviewed, if
      eligible, written consent obtained followed by 1) study questionnaires, demographic and past
      medical history administration 2) Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation (POP-Q) exam 3)
      cystometry, hypnotic susceptibility testing scheduled 4) those willing/able to undergo fMRI
      are screened and scheduled 6) behavioral interventions discussed, hand-out given. Visit 2:
      Cystometry performed. FMRI subjects also undergo brief fMRI task simulations. Subjects
      undergo hypnotic susceptibility testing (if not feasible, testing performed at separate visit
      before randomization). Visit 3: fMRI UUI participants: Baseline fMRI performed.
      Randomization: Participants randomized to treatment and contacted, treatments arranged.

      Visits 3-10 for Hypnotherapy (for non-fMRI group), Visits 4-11 (for fMRI group) for
      Hypnotherapy—Women assigned to Hypnotherapy undergo weekly treatments over 8 weeks. Visits
      3-10 for Pharmacotherapy (for non-fMRI group), Visits 4-11 (for fMRI group) for
      Pharmacotherapy--Medication Counseling Sessions: Women assigned to pharmacotherapy have
      weekly counseling sessions over 8 weeks. Visit 12 (for FMRI group)—follow-up fMRI performed.
      Post Therapy visit--Visit 11 (for non-fMRI group), Visit 13 (for fMRI group): Following
      hypnotherapy or medication counseling completion participants return voiding diaries and
      administered study questionnaires.

      6 &amp; 12 month follow-up: conducted via phone, in person, or mail. Pharmacotherapy subjects
      receive medications for 1 year and Hypnotherapy subjects encouraged to continue self-hypnosis
      for 1 year.

      Controls in FMRI study: screened with OAB Awareness Tool, voiding diary, and give informed
      consent. Undergo POP-Q exam, answer demographic questions, undergo cystometry and simulation
      of fMRI tasks. FMRI performed at separate visit.

      Interventions: Hypnotherapy: Administered over approximately 8 weeks by certified, trained
      clinical hypnotherapists. Participants informed sessions are audio-recorded and reviewed
      ensuring hypnotherapy standardly administered, receive digital recordings specially prepared
      for them for self-hypnosis. Pharmacotherapy: Counseling sessions administered over
      approximately 8 weeks by trained medication counselor who reviews medications and side
      effects. Participant informed sessions are audio-recorded and reviewed ensuring counseling is
      standardly administered. Majority of 8 weekly visits may occur via phone if in-person visits
      are burdensome. One of two long acting anti-cholinergic medications and dosages offered (Long
      acting Tolterodine or Extended Release Oxybutynin or equivalent generic substitutes).
      Participants continue to receive medications for one year.

      FMRI Description: FMRI Data Acquisition: High resolution T1 anatomic images collected at
      beginning of each session. Echo-planar images collected using a single-shot, gradient-echo.
      FMRI Task: Presentation software programmed to control stimulus presentation, synchronize
      stimulus events and collect data. Subjects instructed to maintain visual fixation on
      centrally presented cross and eye-tracking device records saccades while scanned while
      undergoing bladder filling and emptying. Image Processing: fMRI data obtained during tasks
      include slice, temporal auto-correlations and motion corrections. Voxel-wise multiple
      regression analysis used to estimate beta weights corresponding to functional activation
      resulting from each of the conditions. Multiple regression contains individually tailored
      demeaned regressors corresponding to subject's desire to void (urge regressor), resembling a
      step function; each button press signals increasing/decreasing levels of desire to void which
      are convolved with a gamma variate function derived from parameters of the hemodynamic
      response. A regressor corresponding to bladder emptying/filling created by convolving the
      experimental time-course with a gamma variate function, and connectivity analyses are
      performed. Functional connectivity is measured between specific points and the remainder of
      the brain. Averaged individual residualized time-courses from these spheres are the primary
      regressor in whole-brain BOLD connectivity analyses. Pearson's correlation coefficients will
      be converted to z-scores using Fisher's method and blurred using a 10 mm Gaussian kernel
      contrasted across the groups using independent sample T-tests.

      Statistical Analysis: For RCT- Investigators performed sample size calculations for change in
      UUI episodes and change in OABq-SF scores based on investigators' pilot data &amp; the
      literature.6,7 The study will use a non-inferiority design for the primary outcome (UUI
      episode changes in hypnotherapy versus pharmacotherapy). A one-sided non-inferiority test
      with alpha = 0.25 and a non-inferiority margin of 5% will be used. If μ_h is the population
      mean percent reduction in UUI episodes for hypnotherapy, and μ_m is the population mean
      percent reduction in UUI episodes for medication, investigators will test H_0:μ_h-μ_m≤-5
      against the one-sided alternative H_0:μ_h-μ_m&gt;-5 using significance level 0.025. If the null
      hypothesis is rejected, investigators may conclude hypnotherapy is not inferior to
      medication, on average, by more than 5%, and in fact may be superior to medication therapy,
      in percent reduction in incontinence episodes. The test may be performed by computing the
      lower 97.5% one-sided confidence bound for μ_h-μ_m. If the lower confidence bound exceeds -5%
      investigators will conclude non-inferiority of hypnotherapy. Superiority will be concluded if
      the lower bound exceeds zero. Assuming drop-out, withdrawal, missing data rates as high as
      33%, 52 subjects will be available for analysis in both groups. If μ_h-μ_m≥9%, sample size
      would provide power ≥ 80% for non-inferiority testing. Improvement between groups will be
      compared at baseline and 2, 6, 12 month follow-up. Parameters will be compared using a
      generalized linear mixed model analysis. If baseline differences between groups are found,
      appropriate variables will be added to the analysis as covariates. Primary analyses will be
      performed using intention to treat. Per protocol analysis will additionally be performed.
      Similar analyses will be performed comparing group differences in change in questionnaire
      scores.

      For FMRI analysis: Change in anterior cingulate cortex and insula activation between groups
      at 2 month follow-up. A 2x2 (GroupxTime) mixed model ANCOVA to correct for potential
      differences in group characteristics will be performed. Analysis will focus on the anterior
      cingulate cortex and insula based on preliminary data suggesting the effect size for
      activation changes will be highest in these regions. Study size will be able to detect
      differences between pre and post-treatment signal within groups with an approximate effect
      size of 0.5 and a power of 0.8. Minimal effect size would be approximately equivalent to a
      60% decrease in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Investigators predict a main effect
      of time, suggesting both treatments reduce activity within these regions. Investigators also
      predict a significant GroupxTime interaction, indicating change in activity will be greater
      for hypnotherapy. Minimum detectable effect size for the GroupXTime interaction is 0.7;
      power=0.8, alpha=0.05. Simple effects tests will be conducted to ensure randomization to
      treatment arm was successful. Similar analyses will be conducted to evaluate treatment
      effects on functional connectivity. Study size will be able to detect within-group
      differences between pre and post-treatment signal; minimal effect size of approximately 0.5,
      power=0.8, lower than the effect size of &gt;3 in the pilot. Minimum effect size would be
      reached with a 15% decrement in anterior cingulate cortex to insula connectivity. For evoked
      activity investigators predict a main effect of time and a significant Group x Time
      interaction (change in functional connectivity will be greater for hypnotherapy relative to
      pharmacotherapy). Minimum detectable effect size for Group X Time interaction=0.7; power=0.8,
      alpha=0.05.This minimum effect size will be reached when between group differences in
      anterior cingulate cortex to insula connectivity are ≥ 30%.

      Baseline analysis: Controls vs. UUI at baseline. Regions of interest containing the insula
      and anterior cingulate cortex will be analyzed using two way ANCOVA with group as the between
      subject's factor. Pre-treatment β weights for bladder filling and urgency regressor effect on
      anterior cingulate cortex and insula signal among controls will be compared to UUI. Study
      size allows detection of between group differences with effect size &gt;0.8, power=0.8, smaller
      than that in the pilot study.43 The effect size in the pilot (Cohen's d= 0.8-1.5) suggests
      the study will be adequately powered to reject the null hypothesis. Group-wise whole brain
      contrast will be performed using the same statistical model. False positives will be
      corrected at significance of p &lt;.005,with a minimum cluster size of 32 voxels (p &lt; 0.05)
      derived from 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.80 Functional connectivity will be performed
      similarly to that used to analyze task brain activation.
