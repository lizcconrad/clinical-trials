    <textblock>
      Radiation and androgen deprivation is a common modality for patients with localized prostate
      cancer. Unfortunately for patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer incomplete
      tumor eradication and subsequent relapse occurs in 50-75% of patients. The Src pathway
      appears to be integral to the pathobiology of prostate cancer and may be fundamental to
      radioresistance.

      Radiation and androgen deprivation is a common modality for patients with localized prostate
      cancer. Unfortunately for patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer incomplete
      tumor eradication and subsequent relapse occurs in 50-75% of patients. The Src pathway
      appears to be integral to the pathobiology of prostate cancer and may be fundamental to
      radioresistance.

      The primary objective of this trial will be to establish the safety of dasatinib with
      androgen deprivation and radiation for prostate cancer. Three dasatinib dose levels will be
      evaluated, 50 mg/day, 70 mg/day and 100 mg/day. Dasatinib will begin with day #1 of radiation
      and will be discontinued once radiation is completed. The study treatment period, therefore,
      will be when patients receive concurrent dasatinib, hormone therapy and radiation to 30 days
      after the last radiation/dasatinib treatment. However, it will be highly recommended that,
      prior to entering the study, patients receive 2 months of androgen deprivation with a LHRH
      agonist. Furthermore, it will be highly recommended that, after completion of dasatinib
      /hormone therapy/radiation, patients with intermediate risk disease receive approximately 2
      additional months of hormone therapy (to complete 6 months of hormone therapy) and patients
      with high risk disease receive 20 additional months of ADT to complete 2 years of hormone
      therapy. If casodex was given at onset of diagnosis, patient must be off drug for 6 weeks
      prior to beginning radiation therapy

        PATIENT ELIGIBILITY

        -Conditions for Patient Eligibility

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  Histologically or pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate to be
             treated with radiation therapy and hormone therapy.

          -  Intermediate, high or very high risk disease

               -  Intermediate-risk disease (clinical T2b or T2c stage or PSA 10 to 20 ng/mL or
                  Gleason score 7)

               -  High-risk disease (Gleason score 8 to 10, serum PSA &gt; 20 ng/mL or T3a disease)

               -  Very high-risk disease (T3b or T4)

          -  No prior pelvic or prostate radiation or chemotherapy for prostate cancer.

          -  Clinically negative lymph nodes as established by imaging (pelvic CT or pelvic MR),
             nodal sampling or dissection within 8 weeks prior to registration. Patients with lymph
             nodes equivocal or questionable by imaging are eligible if the nodes are &lt; 1.5 cm.

          -  Bone scan within 12 weeks prior to registration. Equivocal bone scan findings are
             allowed if plain films are negative for metastasis.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Required entry laboratory parameters within 14 days of study entry: Granulocytes ≥
             1500/µl; platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl; Hgb &gt; 8.0 g/dl; Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x the
             institutional ULN, mg/dl; Bilirubin ≤ 2x institutional upper limit of normal; AST ≤
             2.5 x upper limit of normal, Serum Na+, K+, Mg2+, Phosphate and Calcium within
             institutional normal range; PT and PTT &lt; 1.5 ULN

          -  Life expectancy of at least 1 year

        Conditions for Patient Ineligibility

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study:

          -  Evidence of distant metastases (M1).

             different cancer is allowable.

          -  Prior radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, to the region of the study cancer that
             would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields

          -  Medical History and Concurrent Diseases

          -  No malignancy [other than the one treated in this study] which required radiotherapy
             or systemic treatment within the past 5 years.

          -  Concurrent medical condition which may increase the risk of toxicity, including:

          -  Pleural or pericardial effusion of any grade

          -  Cardiac Symptoms; any of the following should be considered for exclusion:
