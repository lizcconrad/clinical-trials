      Primary:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability and to find the maximum tolerated dose of the
           combination administration of RAD001 plus docetaxel when given to patients with
           metastatic breast cancer who are being considered for standard docetaxel treatment
           (phase I).

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of RAD001 and docetaxel when co-administered (phase
           I).

      Secondary:

        -  To assess the clinical efficacy of the combination regimens in this patient population
           as shown by response (according to the modified RECIST criteria) (phase II).

        -  To determine the phosphorylation status of the components of the mTOR signaling pathway
           and the expression of modifiers of apoptosis in the primary breast tumors, in order to
           determine whether these markers can be used as predictors of sensitivity to the
           combination of RAD001 and docetaxel

        -  To determine the effect of the combination of RAD001 and docetaxel on the expression and
           phosphorylation of mTOR's targets in the accessible tumor tissue, in order to identify
           potential pharmacodynamics markers of response to this drug combination

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is a drug approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who
      are either newly diagnosed or have failed earlier chemotherapy. RAD001 is an investigational
      drug that has shown to have anticancer properties. It also works by weakening the immune
      system. RAD001 works by blocking some of the steps required for cancer growth. The researcher
      hopes that RAD001 may increase the anticancer activity of docetaxel.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive docetaxel by
      vein on Day 1 over one hour. RAD001 will be given by mouth on Days 1 and 8. RAD 001 will be
      given on an empty stomach or after a light meal. You will repeat this treatment every 21
      days. Three (3 ) weeks equals 1 cycle.

      Patients who participated on the first phase of study numbered 2004-0758 will be eligible for
      the study. The study will done using the highest dose of RAD001 and docetaxel that was found
      to be safe and effective during the first phase of the study.

      Dexamethasone will be given by mouth twice a day for 3 days, starting the day before you
      receive docetaxel. Dexamethasone helps decrease the risk of and control nausea, vomiting, and
      fluid retention.

      Blood (between 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests at each visit. X-rays and scans
      (CT or MRI) will be done every 6 weeks to see if the tumor is responding to treatment.

      After 6 cycles of the combination, docetaxel will be stopped and you will continue to take
      RAD001 alone. However, you may be able to take more than 6 cycles of the combination if you
      are not having any side effects and is found to be of benefit by your primary doctor.

      Once you go off treatment, you will have a physical exam, including routine blood tests (1-2
      teaspoons).

      This is an investigational study. Docetaxel is approved by the FDA and commercially available
      for the treatment of breast cancer. RAD001 is authorized for use in research only. About 65
      patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
