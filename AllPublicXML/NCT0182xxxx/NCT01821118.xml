  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) is a condition caused by the build-up of a protein called
      amyloid, predominantly Aβ40, within the walls of brain blood vessels, especially those blood
      vessels in the occipital lobe of the brain. Probable CAA may be defined as two or more
      hemorrhages in the brain cortex in individuals 55 years of age or older. This study will
      examine the study drug (PF-04360365) vs. placebo (saline) at 10 mg/kg - Day 1 and the
      maintenance dose of the study drug (PF-04360365) vs. placebo (saline) at 7.5mg/kg on Days 30
      and 60. Subjects will be followed for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study
      medication.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Day 2 in Cerebrovascular Reactivity as Measured by the Slope (Amplitude Over Time to Peak) From Visual Task-evoked Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Blood Oxygen Level Dependant (BOLD) fMRI was performed at Screening (Baseline) and on Days 2 and 90. During each of these sessions, BOLD fMRI images were acquired in rapid succession as a flashing radial black and white checkerboard was presented alternately with a gray screen. This well established visual stimulus is known to produce a reliable increase in BOLD fMRI signal within the visual cortex region of the occipital lobe. The time course of the BOLD fMRI signal was used to assess the vascular reactivity. Imaging sites also acquired cerebral blood flow data using Arterial Spin Labeled (ASL) scans at Screening and on Days 2 and 90. A standard T1-weighted image was also acquired to aid image analysis. All efficacy scans were analyzed centrally. Geometric means are presented in the original scale and standard errors (SE) are presented in logarithmic (log e) scale.</description>

    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used as a safety outcome measure to assess any changes in cognition. The MoCA is a 1-page 30-point test administered in approximately 10 minutes. The MoCA assessed short term memory, visuospatial abilities, multiple aspects of executive functions, attention, concentration, working memory, and language, as well as orientation to time and place. The total scale ranges from 0 to 30, with lower numbers indicating lower cognition performance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 2 in Cerebrovascular Reactivity as Measured by the Slope (Amplitude Over Time to Peak) From Visual Task-evoked Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)</title>
        <description>Blood Oxygen Level Dependant (BOLD) fMRI was performed at Screening (Baseline) and on Days 2 and 90. During each of these sessions, BOLD fMRI images were acquired in rapid succession as a flashing radial black and white checkerboard was presented alternately with a gray screen. This well established visual stimulus is known to produce a reliable increase in BOLD fMRI signal within the visual cortex region of the occipital lobe. The time course of the BOLD fMRI signal was used to assess the vascular reactivity. Imaging sites also acquired cerebral blood flow data using Arterial Spin Labeled (ASL) scans at Screening and on Days 2 and 90. A standard T1-weighted image was also acquired to aid image analysis. All efficacy scans were analyzed centrally. Geometric means are presented in the original scale and standard errors (SE) are presented in logarithmic (log e) scale.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 2 and Day 90 in Cerebrovascular Reactivity as Measured by the Time to Peak From Visual Task-evoked fMRI</title>
        <description>BOLD fMRI was performed at Screening (Baseline) and on Days 2 and 90. During each of these sessions, BOLD fMRI images were acquired in rapid succession as a flashing radial black and white checkerboard was presented alternately with a gray screen. This well established visual stimulus is known to produce a reliable increase in BOLD fMRI signal within the visual cortex region of the occipital lobe. The time course of the BOLD fMRI signal was used to assess the vascular reactivity. Imaging sites also acquired cerebral blood flow data using ASL scans at Screening and on Days 2 and 90. A standard T1-weighted image was also acquired to aid image analysis. All efficacy scans were analyzed centrally. Geometric means are presented in the original scale and SEs are presented in log e scale.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 2 and Day 90 in Cerebrovascular Reactivity as Measured by the Time to Return to Baseline From Visual Task-evoked fMRI</title>
        <description>BOLD fMRI was performed at Screening (Baseline) and on Days 2 and 90. During each of these sessions, BOLD fMRI images were acquired in rapid succession as a flashing radial black and white checkerboard was presented alternately with a gray screen. This well established visual stimulus is known to produce a reliable increase in BOLD fMRI signal within the visual cortex region of the occipital lobe. The time course of the BOLD fMRI signal was used to assess the vascular reactivity. Imaging sites also acquired cerebral blood flow data using ASL scans at Screening and on Days 2 and 90. A standard T1-weighted image was also acquired to aid image analysis. All efficacy scans were analyzed centrally. All values are presented in log e scale.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all participants who received at least 1 post-dose efficacy measurement. n=number of evaluable participants for the specified ROI at the specified day.</population>

        <title>Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Total Score Over Time</title>
        <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used as a safety outcome measure to assess any changes in cognition. The MoCA is a 1-page 30-point test administered in approximately 10 minutes. The MoCA assessed short term memory, visuospatial abilities, multiple aspects of executive functions, attention, concentration, working memory, and language, as well as orientation to time and place. The total scale ranges from 0 to 30, with lower numbers indicating lower cognition performance.</description>

          <title>Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Total Score Over Time</title>
          <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used as a safety outcome measure to assess any changes in cognition. The MoCA is a 1-page 30-point test administered in approximately 10 minutes. The MoCA assessed short term memory, visuospatial abilities, multiple aspects of executive functions, attention, concentration, working memory, and language, as well as orientation to time and place. The total scale ranges from 0 to 30, with lower numbers indicating lower cognition performance.</description>
          <population>All 36 participants who received study treatment were included in the analysis. On Day 240, the number of evaluable participants in the placebo group was 11 instead of 12.</population>
