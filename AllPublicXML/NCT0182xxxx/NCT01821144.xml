      The study is to test whether an education programme targeted at school children can lower
      salt intake in children and their families. In this study, the investigators will educate
      children on how to reduce salt intake, and the investigators will empower children by asking
      them to deliver the salt reduction message home to their families, particularly children need
      to persuade the person who does the cooking for the whole family to cut down on the amount of
      salt used during food preparations. The study will involve children aged about 11 years, and
      their parents and grandparents in Northern China.
