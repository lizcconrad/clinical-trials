  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the radiotracer [11C] PIB in participants with
      probably Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy age-matched controls.

  <detailed_description>

      The objectives of the study are:

        1. To perform PET scans with [11C]PIB to use for direct (i.e., same-subjects) comparison of
           [11C]PIB and [18F]AV-45

        2. To establish the most effective and reliable PET imaging method to detect amyloid
           deposition in AD, in order to understand disease progression and subsequently evaluate
           treatment effects.

        3. To ascertain a PET imaging method that will minimize discomfort for subjects, thus
           increasing the potential for clinical follow-up scans, by reducing the patient burden
           and potential cost of future PET examinations.

      A separate protocol/study will be conducted using [18F] AV-45. Participants who enroll in
      this protocol using [11C] PIB will be consented to participate in the [18F] AV-45 (IRB #
      NA_00033155) protocol/study as it is a mandatory requirement that participants participate in
      both protocols.Up to 20 participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease and 10 healthy
      volunteers will participate in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects at least 18 years of age

          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator based on medical history and physical
             exam can tolerate the PET scan procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have clinically significant hepatic, renal, pulmonary, metabolic, or endocrine
             disturbances

          -  Have current clinically significant cardiovascular disease.

          -  Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the last year, or prior prolonged
             history of abuse

          -  Have a clinically significant infectious disease, including Acquired Immune Deficiency
             Syndrome (AIDS) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection or previous positive
             test for hepatitis

          -  Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant (negative urine beta-hCG at the
             time of screening and negative urine beta-hCG on the day of imaging) or lactating at
             screening or at day of imaging

          -  Have a history of relevant severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity (Relevant severe
             drug allergies should be determined by the PI, and any questions about a subject's
             eligibility can be directed to Avid. If a subject has a history of severe drug
             allergies, it may be dangerous for them to participate in a study with a novel
             compound

          -  Have received an investigational medication within the last 30 days. Current
             clinically significant or unstable medical comorbidities, as indicated by history or
             physical exam

          -  Have received a radiopharmaceutical for imaging or therapy within the past 7 days
             prior to the imaging session for this study

          -  Body weight &gt; 300 pounds

          -  History of significant radiation exposure

          -  Participants with pacemakers, implanted electronic hearing devices, aneurysm clips,
             shrapnel, unallowed prosthetic or other metallic device in their bodies

          -  Pre-existing CNS disease (other than dementia), endocrine, or severe cardiovascular
             disease (MI, CABG, angioplasty)
