    <textblock>
      This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 2-parallel group, controlled trial aims to
      investigate whether oral milk protein supplements led to increase in serum Insulin-like
      Growth Factor-I levels (IGF-I) as compared with a control group fed with an iso-caloric
      supplement, in women with anorexia nervosa. Subjects receive either 150g/day of tested
      product or control product for 4-week, followed by a 4-week follow-up.
