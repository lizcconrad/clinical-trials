  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though ursodeoxycholate acid (UDCA) is the well known effective therapy for PBC,clinical
      effectiveness of UDCA may be limited by its poor absorption and extensive
      biotransformation.The more hydrophillic bile acid tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) is the active
      ingredients of UDCA,and has been approved by state food and drug administration in China for
      treatment of cholesterol stones.So it is necessary to verify the efficacy and safety of TUDCA
      in the treatment of adult primary biliary cirrhosis. In this randomized, double-blinded,
      double -dummy, parallel-controlled and multicenter clinical trial, we detect the proportion
      of patients who had AKP decline more than 25% as the primary outcome;decline of ALP,total
      bilirubin, GGT,ALT and AST as secondary outcomes after patients were treated with TUDCA or
      UDCA for 24 weeks.

      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel controlled, multicenter, clinical trial.
      Subjects inclusion by randomization after passing the screening, continuous administration
      the test drug (Taurolite) or control drug (Ursofalk) treatment for 24 weeks. Compare the
      safety and efficacy of Taurolite vs Ursofalk.

      At the end of the double-blind period，enroll 100 subjects from both two group randomly ,for a
      consecutive treatment use TUDCA up to 24 weeks. Further evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in the treatment of adult primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
      for a long time up to one year. Also evaluate the regimen's efficacy and safety that udca
      take placed by TUDCA in the treatment of adult primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) for the
      patients who use udca treatment for 24 weeks.
