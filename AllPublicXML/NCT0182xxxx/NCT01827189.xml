      Examines staff size and composition of the 496 advanced primary care practices participating

      Participating practices all have electronic health records, submitted applications to
      participate in this demonstration program designed to improve primary care practices, and
      were selected as the most advanced of the applicants in terms of use of health information
      technology and certification as a medical home or possessing features similar to those of a
      medical home. Participating practices will receive monthly payments from Centers for Medicare
      &amp; Medicaid (CMS) for Medicare patients attributed to the practice, and from other payers in
      the market taht are participating in the initiative. The demonstration began in October 2012
      and will continue for 4 years. This early paper focuses on describing these practices at the
      outset of the demonstration.
