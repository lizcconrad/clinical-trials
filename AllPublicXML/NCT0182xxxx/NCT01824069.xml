  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cells
      derived from lipoaspirate for treating various pathologies fistula. With this project we will
      address a study population with critical ischemia of lower limbs without possibility of
      revascularization, either by technical criteria (no intervention possible to compensate for
      the lack of irrigation of a limb) criteria or risk / benefit (intolerable surgical risk for
      the type of intervention required). It will almost always elderly patients with multiple
      comorbidities and high surgical risk who have a lower limb ischemia in critical degree, with
      very high probability of major amputation in the short term or immediate.

      Hypothesis: mesenchymal stem cells obtained by lipoaspirate expanded &quot;ex vivo&quot;, are capable
      of promoting angiogenesis de novo to improve critical limb ischemia lower nonrevascularizable
      a safe manner

      The primary endpoint of safety and feasibility study will be done when the patient has
      received treatment at 12 months after implantation. It defines that the process is safe when
      in the development and monitoring of the trial there has been no adverse events that may be
      related to the proposed therapy in the trial. All adverse events will be collected during the
      same time monitoring the clinical evaluation. The main objective will be assessed the
      cumulative incidence of adverse effects attributed to the study therapy.

      Secondary endpoints: As part of the evaluation of the quality of life of patients and
      clinical evaluation of the treatment will be at 6, 9 and 12 months after implantation a Test
      SF-12, a magnetic resonance angiography, and tissue oximetry records ankle-brachial index
