  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to determine if tyrosine, an amino acid found in
      protein-containing foods, will mitigate the cognitive deficits and adverse effects on
      behavior and mood produced by exposure to military stress. This study will be conducted at
      the Army Survive, Evade, Resist, Escape (SERE) school at Fort Bragg, NC.

      Tyrosine is the dietary precursor of the catecholamine norepinephrine, a key brain
      neurotransmitter that is critical for the central nervous system (CNS) response to various
      types of acute stress. Psychological stress increases catecholamine turnover in the brain,
      increasing the requirement for tyrosine to support synthesis of norepinephrine. Animal and
      human studies have shown that tyrosine supplementation can produce beneficial effects on
      cognitive and physiological functions during exposure to a variety of acute stressors.

      This project will determine if volunteers treated with supplemental tyrosine during stressful
      phases of SERE training experience less degradation in cognitive performance and mood than
      volunteers treated with placebo. Tyrosine or placebo will be administered in a specially
      developed food bar provided to volunteers. The bar is part of a prototype of ration-component
      designed for use during assault operations. A between-subjects, double blind experimental
      design will be employed. Tyrosine, an amino acid found in most protein-containing foods, has
      been tested in hundreds of volunteers without adverse effects.

      Approximately 100 volunteers will be recruited from several SERE classes to ensure up to 82
      volunteers complete the study. They will be tested during several portions of SERE. A
      comprehensive but brief battery of cognitive tests, as well as saliva and blood samples, will
      be collected in a manner that does not interfere with ongoing training.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The adverse effects of psychological stress on cognitive performance and mood during
           SERE school will be reduced when volunteers are given supplemental tyrosine compared to
           placebo treatment.

        2. Supplemental tyrosine will reduce release of proinflammatory cytokines that may be
           increased by the stressful activities of SERE school.
