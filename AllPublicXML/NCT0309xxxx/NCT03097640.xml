  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical outcomes of a novel program designed to target patients who
      are high-utilizers of hospital services. Patients who are frequently admitted to medical
      services - &quot;high-utilizers&quot; - present a unique set of challenges to providers and the health
      care system that require a different way of approaching chronic illness. The Complex High
      Admission Management Program (CHAMP) is an innovative model of care consisting of a small
      team of providers who establish continuity relationships with high-utilizer patients. CHAMP
      strives to provide effective, high value care via a longitudinal relationship-based care
      model through provider continuity, intensive case management, and personalized care plans. To
      better understand the potential outcomes of CHAMP, this study is a longitudinal, prospective,
      randomized, controlled trial of medical high-utilizers enrolled in CHAMP compared to a group
      of high-utilizer patients receiving usual care.

  <detailed_description>

      Frequent users of hospital services, otherwise known as hospital &quot;high-utilizers,&quot; comprise a
      diverse patient population that pose unique challenges to the current US health care delivery
      model. The Complex High Admission Management Program (CHAMP), implemented at Northwestern
      Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL, seeks to improve care for high-utilizer patients through
      provider continuity, intensive case management, and developing personalized care plans that
      span inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care environments.

      Preliminary evaluation of CHAMP has shown a 38% decrease in 30-day unplanned hospital
      readmissions and an 18% decrease in ED encounters over a 6-month time period, when compared
      to an equal time period pre-CHAMP.

      Patients are eligible for the program if they are readmitted to the hospital three times
      within a twelve-month period. Due to the time and resource limitations of the CHAMP team, not
      all patients meeting these criteria can be enrolled at once. Patients will thus be randomly
      selected to be enrolled in CHAMP or will receive usual care. This study plans to evaluate the
      difference in outcomes between patients enrolled in CHAMP and those receiving usual care by
      answering the following questions:

      To what extent do high-utilizer patients enrolled in CHAMP differ in their level of trust in
      providers, self-assessed coping skills, daily symptom burden, perceived functionality, and
      attitudes about the healthcare system when compared to a control group of high utilizer
      patients receiving usual care? We will assess patient responses to a series of surveys
      assessing trust, feelings of discrimination, activation, satisfaction with care, and level of
      social functioning.

      What are the healthcare utilization rates of high-utilizer patients enrolled in CHAMP
      compared to a control group of high-utilizer patients receiving usual care? We will compare
      rates of (a) hospital admission and (b) utilization (including length of stay) among
      high-utilizer patients enrolled in CHAMP as compared to high-utilizer patients not enrolled
      in the program.

    <description>Participants enrolled in CHAMP are followed by a team of a social worker and physician across the care continuum. CHAMP team members visit patients in the ED and on inpatient floors. Along with the patient's input, the team develops an Individualized Care Plan outlining the patient's medical and social history and providing recommendations to other providers on specific aspects of their care. Care plans are reviewed with patients on an individual basis and reviewed periodically by the CHAMP providers. CHAMP-enrolled participants are scheduled for physician and social worker follow-up appointments at the CHAMP clinic; this time is used to provide intensive case management, medical care, and psychosocial support.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Adults (18 yrs of age or older) who are admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital
             (NMH) and identified by EDW search as having two unplanned 30-day inpatient
             readmissions to NMH within the prior 12 months with one of two additional criteria:at
             least 1 readmission in the last 6 months, or a referral from one of that patient's
             medical providers.

          -  Admission to NMH during the study period (October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2018) and
             meeting criteria described above for CHAMP

          -  Ability to consent for this study (including ability to read materials printed in
             English, understanding and communicating in English, and able to understand the risks
             and benefits of participating in the study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, patients admitted to Oncology
             services (as we have found that this latter group has a multidisciplinary care team
             already in place), or patients actively followed by the Heart Failure Bridge and
             Transition (BAT) Team, a different quality improvement intervention designed to reduce
             readmissions among patients admitted for acute decompensated heart failure.

          -  Participants will be excluded if they are disoriented to person, place, or time, or
             are unable to consent for any other reason.
