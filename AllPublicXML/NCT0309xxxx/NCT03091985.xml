  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of breast drainage of the healthy
      breast with the new Medela pump set breast shield (Brownie).

      The objective of the study is to verify the Brownie breast shield to be non-inferior to the
      current PersonalFit breast shield in emptying the healthy lactating breast.
