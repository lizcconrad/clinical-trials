      This study is designed as post market clinical follow-up study with CE-marked products to
      evaluate the AV Opt and LV VectorOpt features in the respective Edora family pacemakers under
      clinical conditions. Furthermore, adverse events will be evaluated to identify residual risks
      associated with the use of the BIOTRONIK Edora family pacemakers. The study is further
      designed to address potential regulatory needs of clinical data for countries and regions not
      covered by the CE approval.

      Study Design

        -  Open-label, prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, international

        -  about 13 study sites

      Study Endpoints

      The following endpoints are defined and will be assessed with descriptive analysis:

        1. AV Opt feature:

           The feature's AV delay recommendation was

             1. used as basis for the device programming or is at least considered to be clinically
                acceptable or

             2. other AV delay values were chosen by the investigator and the recommendation was
                rated as not clinically acceptable.

        2. LV VectorOpt usability using an overall score (categories: excellent, good, average,
           fair, poor).

        3. (S)ADEs and calculation of the SADE free rate until the 6-month follow-up
