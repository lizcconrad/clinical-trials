      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab is
      associated with superior response rate compared to Nivolumab alone in patients with advanced
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer who have
      failed one line of standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and not more than one line of
      chemotherapy regimen. This study also aims to determine predictive biomarkers of
      response/benefit in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC.

      This study examines the outcome of nivolumab single agent versus nivolumab-ipilimumab
      combination in patients with advanced EGFR+ NSCLC who have failed one line of standard EGFR
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) and not more than one line of chemotherapy regimen. The use
      of 3rd generation EGFR TKI for patients with acquired mutation that substitute a threonine
      (T) with a methionine (M) at position 790 of exon 20 (T790M) is allowed.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either nivolumab monotherapy
      (Arm A) or nivolumab/ipilimumab combination therapy (Arm B) and will be stratified according
      to the following factors:

        -  Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PDL1) status: &lt;1% vs â‰¥1%

        -  Presence of brain metastasis

        -  Institution: National Cancer Centre Singapore, National University Cancer Institute, and
           Johns Hopkins Singapore-Tan Tock Seng Hospital

      Both arms will continue with treatment regimen till disease progression or discontinuation of
      treatment due to adverse events.

      Arm A patients are allowed to cross over to Arm B in the event of clear-cut disease
      progression.

      On-study tumor assessments will be conducted every 6 weeks for 24 weeks and then every 12
      weeks till clear-cut disease progression.

      The radiologist will be blinded to the treatment arm that the patient is randomised to ensure
      an objective response evaluation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30
             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last
             dose of investigational drug

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the
             start of nivolumab

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7
             months after the last dose of investigational product Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception

          -  WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not
             postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman
             over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women
             under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             level less than 40 milli-international units per millilitre (mIU/mL).

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) receiving nivolumab will be instructed to
             adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of
             investigational product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with
             WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the
             last dose of investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the
             upper limit of the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol
             requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are
             sexually active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days.

        iii. Advanced EGFR+ NSCLC

             last therapy before recruitment

          -  A 28-day washout period is required for chemotherapy for patients who received this as
             the last therapy before recruitment. All drug-related toxicities should have returned

        biopsy as baseline upon clear-cut disease progression and on-treatment repeat biopsy before
        they are allowed to cross over to receive ipilimumab in addition to nivolumab.

        xi. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of
        childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective
        form(s) of contraception and to continue its use for 90 days after the last dose of
        nivolumab

        xii. Women who are not postmenopausal (â‰¥12 months of nonâˆ’therapy-induced amenorrhea) or
        surgically sterile must have a negative serum pregnancy test result within 14 days prior to
        initiation of study drug

        xiii. Available for follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i. Symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases (patients who have treated stable brain

        iii. Tumour sites not amenable to CT-guided core biopsies or trucut biopsies; However
        waiver for this criterion can be given for selected patients on a case-by-case basis for
        patients with sites of disease that are technically difficult to access after discussion
        with interventional radiologist. Waivers are allowed for not more than 70 patients for this
        study in order to allow sufficient number of quality tumour biopsies for biomarker analysis
        in this study. Waivers would have to be approved by the Principal Investigator.

        necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents) within 2 weeks prior to randomization

          1. Patients who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications
             (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled in the study.

          2. Patients with history of allergic reaction to IV contrast requiring steroid
             pre-treatment should have baseline and subsequent tumor assessments done by MRI.

          3. The use of inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension,

             (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBc Ab) and absence of HBsAg)
             are eligible. HBV DNA must be obtained in these patients prior to randomization.

          2. Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if Polymerase
             chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA.

        xi. Active tuberculosis

        xii. Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human
        immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
