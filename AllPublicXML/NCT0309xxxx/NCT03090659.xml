    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase 1/2 study, to determine the safety and
      efficacy of LCAR-B38M CAR-T cells in treating patients diagnosed with refractory/relapsed
      multiple myeloma (r/r MM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a usually incurable malignancy of plasma cells. Current therapies
      for multiple myeloma often cause remissions, but nearly all patients eventually relapse and
      die, an clear unmet clinical needs. As early as mid-2014, the investigators have started to
      develop a series of proprietary CAR-T products to target B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a
      cell surface molecule which the investigator believes to be a desirable target antigen for
      multiple myeloma. All pre-clinical data and CMC data for LCAR-B38M CAR-T cell technology has
      been established by mid-2015 and a phase I proof-of-concept clinical trial has been planned
      since then.

             fatal viral and bacterial infection.

          -  Systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid are not allowed within 2 weeks prior to
             either the required leukapheresis or the initiation of the conditioning chemotherapy
             regimen.

             disorder.

          -  Patients with CNS metastases or symptomatic CNS involvement (including cranial
             neuropathies or mass lesions and spinal cord compression).

          -  History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Have active acute or chronic
             graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), or require immunosuppressant medications for GVHD,
             within 6 months of enrollment.
