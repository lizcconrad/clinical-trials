  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advances in stroke rehabilitation, post-stroke upper extremity impairment is
      still a major challenge. Increasing evidence can be found supporting stimulation of the
      afferent receptor enhances neuroplasticity in the brain. Studies have suggested multisensory
      stimulation could promote motor learning by re-establishing the disrupted sensorimotor loop
      due to stroke and enhance neuroplasticity.

      The objective of the study was to examine the effect of multisensory stimulation on
      upper-extremity motor recovery and self-care function in stroke patients.

    <textblock>
      Stroke patients referred to occupational therapy division of geriatric day hospital will be
      recruited and randomly assigned to a multisensory therapy group or a conventional training
      group. The Multisensory therapy group received 12 weeks (two sessions/ week; 90
      minutes/session) training. Each session began with 15 minutes of sensory stimulation (cold
      and vibration), 45 minutes of motor training and 30 minutes of self-care training. The
      conventional training group included 12 weeks (two sessions/ week; 90 minutes/session)
      training. Each session included 60 minutes of upper extremity motor practice and 30 minutes
      of self-care training.

      Outcome measures included: Brunnstrom's stage, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale and Functional
      Test for the Hemiplegic Upper Extremity were used for upper limb motor control and function;
      and Manual muscle testing was used for muscle strength. The modified Barthel Index was used
      for self-care performance
