  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of the aging society, dementia becomes the focus of common people. As for the
      neurodegeneration dementia, no disease modifying treatments have been discovered. Idiopathic
      normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is considered as one of reversible dementia, which can
      be hint by the surgery. In addition, dementia of iNPH is the typical subcortical dementia.
      Therefore exploring the pathogenic mechanism is conducive to the early diagnosis and
      treatment. This research is to monitor the changing of iNPHGS, cognitive function, walking
      ability as well as brain construction imaging and neural network before and after
      ventriculo-peritoneal shunting in order to demonstrate the pathogenesis of triads. In the
      process, the supplementary test, for instance, CSF tap test, will be validated the predictive
      value.
