  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to collect a series of patients with gliomas which were involved in
      motor cortex to analyze difference accuracy of motor cortex localization between BOLD-fMRI
      and ZOOMit-fMRI.

    <textblock>
      Gliomas will lead motor dysfunction when they are involved in motor cortex. However, tumor
      resection also have risk to lead postoperatively motor function deficits if destroy patients'
      motor cortex when tumor removed. Hence, it is important for neurosurgeon to realize the
      situation of patients' motor cortex locations in order to determine personal operative
      protocol.

      The blood oxygen level dependent fMRI (BOLD-fMRI) is a prevalent preoperative method to
      localization motor cortex. It shows motor relevant cortex by the change of blood oxygen level
      when patients cooperate to finish motor tasks. The advantage of BOLD-fMRI includes higher
      time and spatial resolution, higher sensitivity, non-invasive. However, its accuracy of
      localization has not been satisfactory because neurovascular uncoupling. The ZOOMit-fMRI is a
      novel technic which is evolved from conventional BOLD-fMRI to localize motor functional
      cortex.The advantage of ZOOMit-fMRI is smaller field of view (FOV) and higher spatial
      resolution comparing with BOLD-fMRI. That helps to reduce other region of brain interference
      and elevate accuracy of localizations.

      In this study, the investigators plan to enroll 60 patients, whose gliomas are involved in
      motor cortex, to acquire their BOLD-fMRI and ZOOMit-fMRI data in order to analyze their
      difference in the accuracy of motor cortex localization.

    <measure>The accurate rate for hand motor cortex localization with BOLD-fMRI and ZOOMit-fMRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>From scanning with BOLD-fMRI and ZOOMit-fMRI to getting the overlap indexes,assessed up to 2 weeks in each patient.</time_frame>
    <description>To illustrate the accurate rate of hand motor cortex localization, the overlap indexes in BOLD-fMRI or ZOOMit-fMRI will be calculated. The results in BOLD-fMRI and ZOOMit-fMRI will be defined with 300 maximum value voxels via SPM8 software. According to the photographs and records of direct cortical stimulation (DCS) during awaken craniotomy, the DCS results will be confirmed as a global region with 5 mm diameter. Subsequently, we will overlap the BOLD-fMRI/ZOOMit-fMRI and DCS results then calculate the number of voxels overlapping. In this way, the overlap indexes can be calculated as a ratio between the number of voxels overlapping and the number of total voxels in BOLD-fMRI and ZOOMit-fMRI. We defined if the overlap index is larger than 0, the localization result is accurate. In contrast, if the overlap index is equal to zero, the localization result is inaccurate. Finally, the accurate rate of hand motor cortex localization can be calculated.</description>
