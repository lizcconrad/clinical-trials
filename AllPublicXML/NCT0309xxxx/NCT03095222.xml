    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the optimal dosing strategy for low-dose ketamine
      infusions in adult acute burn injury patients when used with usual pain medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Aim will identify the safest and most optimal dosing strategy for low-dose ketamine
      infusions. While the hourly rate for low-dose ketamine infusions used for adjunctive
      analgesia appears to be well-established both in the medical literature and our institutional
      protocols, there is no information available for this specific population of patients (adult
      acute burn injury) to know whether the infusions should be utilized for discrete periods of
      time or should be given continuously. Findings from this study will help provide preliminary
      data on the optimal dosing strategy of this medication for adjunctive analgesia in this
      population.

    <measure>Change in pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity measured using the 11-point Visual Numerical Scale (VNS). Scores range from 0 to 10. A score of 0 represents no pain. A score of 10 represents the worst pain imaginable. The score will be collected each day. An average of the score will be calculated for all days of the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Analgesic Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects will be on some form of opioid analgesic. All opioid usage will be recorded. For each 24 hour period, the total daily opioid consumption will be calculated and converted to oral morphine equivalents. The outcome will be reported as an average over all days of participation.</description>
