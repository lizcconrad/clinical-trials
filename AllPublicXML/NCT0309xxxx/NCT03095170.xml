  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral interventions currently provide the most useful approach to addressing the
      behavioral and social needs of those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's
      or other diseases. This randomized, multisite, 3-arm study will investigate the impact of
      computerized brain fitness vs yoga vs an active control group (wellness education) on changes
      in cognitive function, daily functioning and quality of life in persons with Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI) and their partner. In addition, in vivo neuroimaging measures of plasticity
      during the pre- and post-intervention periods will be measured and compared between the three
      different treatment groups. These neuroimaging measures of plasticity will be investigated in
      their relationship to the cognitive outcomes within each group.

Learning phases. three training stages from learning theory: 1) an acquisition phase in which use of the memory compensation system is learned, 2) an application phase in which a participant is taught to apply to his/her daily life, and 3) an adaptation phase in which a participant practices incorporating into his/her daily life so as to make its use habitual.</description>
