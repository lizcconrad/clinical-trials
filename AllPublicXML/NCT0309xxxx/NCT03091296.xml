    <textblock>
      In this case‐controlled, observational study, 24 subjects will participate in a 12‐hour blood
      collection with a single blood draw at +24 hours. 12 men will have low testosterone levels
      (hypogonadism) and 12 men will have normal testosterone levels. Blood samples will be drawn
      every 2 hours and later analyzed for total testosterone and calculated free testosterone. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess the degree of diurnal variation in men with
      testosterone deficiency.
