  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this non-randomized, multi-center study in subjects with severe hereditary
      haemophilia B was to determine and compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of BeneFIX
      in subjects having had 2 prior pharmacokinetic assessments with AlphaNine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two pharmacokinetic assessments (studies) were carried out in the same subjects during a
      previous clinical trial. The first pharmacokinetic study (PK1) was performed after a single
      dose of AlphaNine. The second pharmacokinetic study (PK2) was performed following 26 Weeks of
      AlphaNine treatment after PK1. To compare AlphaNine with BeneFIX, a third pharmacokinetic
      study (PK3) (current study) was performed after a single dose of BeneFIX administered
      following a 7- to 15-day wash-out period.

      The main objective of the PK3 study was to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of BeneFIX and
      compare to the pharmacokinetic profile of AlphaNine from the PK2 study.
