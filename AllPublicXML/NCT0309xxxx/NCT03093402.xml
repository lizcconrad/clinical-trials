    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of JBT-101
      (also known as lenabasum) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

        -  One hundred adults with active joint disease and at least moderate pain will be enrolled
           in this study to evaluate treatment of their systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with
           JBT-101. JBT-101 is a synthetic endocannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) agonist and an
           activator of the body's normal processes, to resolve innate immune responses without
           immunosuppression.

        -  Participants will receive 2 doses of JBT-101 by mouth (three groups of varying doses)
           or, placebo, for 84 days and will continue to be followed for an additional 28 days.
           Participant visits to assess endpoints occur on Day 1, then every 2 weeks twice, then
           every 4 weeks three times, for a total of six visits.

        -  The change in maximum daily pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score from Baseline (Visit
           1) will be assessed at every visit.

    <description>The numeric rating scale for pain (NRS-Pain) consists of an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). A rating of 1-3 is considered mild pain; 4-6, moderate pain; and 7-10, severe pain.
Participants will be asked to report their maximum daily pain using the NRS-Pain. Participants will call into an interactive voice response e diary system (IVRS) and record the number that best reflects their maximum amount of pain experienced in the last 24 hours. Participants will be asked to call at the same time each day, preferably before bedtime. Baseline: Pre-treatment; Day 84: Last Day (Visit 5) of a 12-week course of assigned treatment.</description>

          -  History of chronic pain requiring treatment with narcotic analgesia for more than 14

          -  Current evidence of alcohol abuse (defined as 4 or more drinks per day on at least 4
             days of the week) or history of abuse of illegal and/or legally prescribed drugs such

               -  A positive pregnancy test (also at Visit 1);

               -  A newly positive QuantiFERON(R) blood test for tuberculosis, without: 1)
                  completing a course of appropriate treatment; or ) having received at least one
                  month of appropriate treatment prior to Visit 1 and continuing to receive
                  appropriate treatment during the study. If the subject has a previous documented
                  positive tuberculosis skin, then this testing does not need to be repeated. If
                  the subject has a documented negative test result within the last year, testing
                  does not need to be repeated, at the discretion of the site investigator.

               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL;

               -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 50 ml/min according to modified Cockcroft-Gault equation:
                  Creatinine clearance = [weight (kg) x (140 - age)/72 x serum creatinine
                  concentration] x for male: x 1, for female: × 0.85;

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or alkaline
                  phosphatase &gt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal; or

               -  Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Any other conditions that, in the opinion of the site investigator, are clinically
             significant and may put the subject at greater safety risk, influence response to
             study product, or interfere with study assessments. When in doubt, the site
             investigator or qualified designee should discuss the situation with the Protocol
             Chairs.
