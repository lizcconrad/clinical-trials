        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are able to read, understand and provide written informed consent on an Informed
             Consent Form (ICF) approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics
             Committee (IEC).

          2. Be a non-smoking male or female at least 18 years of age on the date the ICF is signed
             and with the capacity to provide voluntary informed consent.

          3. Be in general good health and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that
             could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study
             observations/results, or place the subject at increased risk during the study.

          4. Be willing/able to return for all required study visits and follow instructions from
             the study Investigator and his/her staff.

          5. Are able to self-administer eye drops or have a clinical staff member deliver the
             single dose of investigational product (IP) on specified study days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a history/presence of chronic generalized systemic disease that the Investigator
             feels might increase the risk to the subject, confound the result(s) of the study, or
             preclude study treatment or follow-up.

          2. Have any current disease or medical condition that requires medicinal therapy.

          3. Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse in the last 6 months.

          4. Have a positive urine screen for alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
             cocaine (or cocaine metabolite), cannabinoids, methadone, methamphetamine, opiates
             and/or phencyclidine.

          5. Are known to have a prior positive blood screen for hepatitis B surface antigen,
             hepatitis C antibody, or human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2.
