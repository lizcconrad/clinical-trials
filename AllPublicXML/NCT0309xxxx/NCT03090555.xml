  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of translational manipulation under interscalene block, to
      a course of orthopaedic manual physical therapy for treatment of adhesive capsulitis of the
      shoulder. Half the patients will receive a translational manipulation under interscalene
      block, plus 6 sessions of orthopaedic manual physical therapy. The other half will receive 7
      sessions of physical therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the translational
      manipulation under interscalene block will provide additional benefit beyond the effect of
      in-clinic orthopaedic manual physical therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both translational manipulation under interscalene block and in-clinic orthopaedic manual
      physical therapy are thought to be useful for treating adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder.
      However, no single intervention for this condition has been proven to be superior to others.

      The translational manipulation under interscalene block may improve pain-free motion of the
      involved shoulder, by releasing tight tissue without the guarding and motion-limiting effect
      of active muscle tension. The interscalene block prevents the patient from actively
      contracting the muscles that control the involved shoulder, during the manipulation
      procedure.

      One additional possible benefit of the translational manipulation under interscalene block,
      is that the technique loads the joint structures--bone, joint capsule--in a safer way with
      less angular torque than conventional/traditional manipulation under anaesthesia. This
      minimizes the risk of physical/mechanical harm from the procedure.

    <description>Participants received an interscalene block on the affected side. Then, a physical therapist performed thrust manipulations on the affected shoulder until full passive physiologic motion was restored. These participants returned to the clinic approximately 3 days later for the first of 6 manual therapy (MT) sessions.
The first clinic treatment session included instruction in a home program of static stretching, resistive exercise, and ice, issue of an illustrated handout and digital video disc detailing the same program, and manual therapy (MT) by a physical therapist that included all indicated grades of non-thrust manipulation. Subsequent clinic treatment sessions included additional MT, progression of the strengthening exercises, and reinforcement of the home program.</description>

    <description>Participants in the comparison group did not undergo a session of translational manipulation. In order to equalize the number of intervention sessions, members of this group underwent 7 in-clinic sessions of manual therapy (MT). The first clinic treatment session for all study participants included instruction in the home program of static stretching, resistive exercise, and ice, issue of an illustrated handout and digital video disc detailing the same program, and MT by a physical therapist that included all indicated grades of non-thrust manipulation. Subsequent clinic treatment sessions included additional MT, progression of the strengthening exercises, and reinforcement of the home program.</description>

    <description>After the patient receives an interscalene block on the affected side, a physical therapist performs a series of thrust manipulations on the participant's affected shoulder. The participant's identified limitations of physiological and accessory motion revealed during manual examination guided the physical therapist's choice of technique, which primarily consisted of an accessory superior to inferior accessory gliding motion performed in a physiological position of limited motion. Additional gliding manipulations in combined movement positions such as increased flexion or abduction plus internal or external rotation were utilized until full passive physiologic motion was restored.</description>

The MT intervention was targeted toward any identifiable upper quarter pain or movement impairments. Subsequent clinic treatment sessions included additional MT, progression of the strengthening exercises, and reinforcement of the home program.</description>
