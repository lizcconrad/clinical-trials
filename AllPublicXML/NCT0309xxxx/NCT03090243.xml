    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a complicated disease in which damage to the optic nerve leads to progressive,
      irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness and associated
      with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) as a major risk factor.

      IOP is influenced by many factors, including ethnicity, heredity, various chemical substances
      (existing body and external body like drugs), physical changes (postures, neural and vascular
      autoregulation) and more.

      Virtual colonoscopy is a common screening test for the early detection and diagnosis of colon
      cancer. The test is performed by computed tomography (CT) after inflating the colon with
      carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. The procedure is performed by inserting a Foley catheter through
      the anus. As a result of gas inflating of the bowel, consequently, there is an increase in
      the abdominal pressure.

      Raising intra-abdominal pressure may cause a rise in intraocular pressure. The aim of this
      research is to examine the changes in IOP before and after the virtual colonoscopy, with the
      aim to improve the understanding of the relationship between intra-abdominal pressure and
      IOP.

      The study will include 100 patients, men and women, that are scheduled for virtual
      colonoscopy test both in a hospital and in ambulatory.
