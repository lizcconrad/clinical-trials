      Newborn infants have blood work procedures for newborn screening and bilirubin testing in
      their first days of life that cause pain, distress and physiological changes. Breastfeeding
      (BF), skin to skin care (SSC), or giving small amounts of sweet solutions (sucrose or
      glucose) with or without a pacifier, effectively and safely reduce pain and distress in
      newborn infants during painful procedures. However, studies of neonatal pain management
      practices in Ontario and throughout Canada demonstrate inconsistent use of these strategies.
      There is a clear need for developing and testing acceptable parent-targeted interventions,
      alongside health care provider-targeted knowledge translation (KT) interventions, to support
      parents' involvement in comforting their infants during painful procedures. To address this
      knowledge to action (KTA) gap, Denise Harrison's Be Sweet to Babies team developed the
      BSweet2Babies video, which demonstrates the effectiveness of BF, SSC, and sucrose during
      infant bloodwork and how parents can use and advocate for these pain management strategies.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a parent-targeted and mediated KT strategy, the
      BSweet2Babies video, when shown to parents of newborns prior to newborn screening or
      bilirubin testing, on subsequent use of the three pain reduction strategies during the blood
      test.

      The target sample size for the study is 20 hospitals. Following consent, hospitals will be
      randomized to one of two groups: the intervention group (showing parents the BSweet2Babies
      video prior to their baby's newborn screening blood test) or the control group (no education
      or information provided). Hospitals in the intervention group will show all parents the 5
      minute BSweet2Babies video before newborn bloodwork. BORN Information System (BIS) data will
      subsequently be analyzed to evaluate the use of BF, SSC and sweet solutions.

      The investigators hypothesize that hospitals randomized to the BSweet2Babies video will have
      a higher rate of use of BF, SSC or sucrose as measured by the systematically collected Better
      Outcomes Registry &amp; Network (BORN) Ontario pain data elements during newborn screening or
      bilirubin testing, compared to hospitals randomized to usual Health Care Provider
      (HCP)-targeted education.

      Background: Newborn infants have blood work procedures for newborn screening and bilirubin
      testing in their first days of life that cause pain, distress and physiological changes.
      Breastfeeding (BF), skin to skin care (SSC), or giving small amounts of sweet solutions
      (sucrose or glucose) with or without a pacifier, effectively and safely reduce pain and
      distress in newborn infants during painful procedures. However, studies of neonatal pain
      management practices in Ontario and throughout Canada demonstrate inconsistent use of these
      strategies. There is a clear need for developing and testing acceptable parent-targeted
      interventions, alongside health care provider-targeted knowledge translation (KT)
      interventions, to support parents' involvement in comforting their infants during painful
      procedures. To address this knowledge to action (KTA) gap, Denise Harrison's Be Sweet to
      Babies team developed the BSweet2Babies video, which demonstrates the effectiveness of BF,
      SSC, and sucrose during infant bloodwork and how parents can use and advocate for these pain
      management strategies.

      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a parent-targeted and mediated KT strategy, the
      BSweet2Babies video, when shown to parents of newborns prior to newborn screening or
      bilirubin testing, on subsequent use of the three pain reduction strategies during the blood
      test.

      Study design and methods: This study is a two-armed cluster RCT that will enroll hospitals in
      Ontario providing Level 1 and Level 2 maternal/newborn care contributing data to the BORN
      Information System (BIS) and with a birth volume of at least 50 per year. The target sample
      size is 20 hospitals which will involve BIS pain data for approximately 15,000 newborns.
      Following consent, hospitals will be randomized according to our planned stratification to
      one of two groups: the intervention group (showing parents the BSweet2Babies video prior to
      their baby's newborn screening blood test) or the control group (no education or information
      provided). Hospitals in the intervention group will show all parents the 5 minute
      BSweet2Babies video before newborn bloodwork. BIS data will subsequently be analyzed to
      evaluate the use of BF, SSC and sweet solutions.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the proportion of newborn screening or bilirubin
      testing where BF, SSC or sucrose was used. These data are systematically collected from all
      newborns and entered into the BIS along with other BORN Ontario maternal newborn data. The
      secondary outcome is the number of unsatisfactory newborn screening samples, as
      systematically collected in the BIS.

      Statistical Analysis: All data analysis for the primary outcome will be conducted by BORN
      Ontario data analysts in consultation with CoI Taljaard. Descriptive statistics will be used
      to compare characteristics of sites and births between the study arms, including unit type,
      size of hospital, infant sex, and parity. Analysis of the primary outcome will be performed
      using marginal logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) and an
      exchangeable correlation structure to account for clustering by hospital. The identity link
      function will be used to express the effect of the intervention on the risk difference scale.
      Fixed effects in the model will be study arm (control compared to intervention), type and
      size of hospital and a hospital-level summary measure of the primary outcome at 6 months
      pre-intervention. All analyses will be by intention-to-treat.

      Subgroup analyses:

      To examine if the intervention has differential effects depending on:

        -  Type of maternal/newborn organization (Level 1 compared to Level 2);

        -  Sex of the newborn;

        -  Parity (first-born babies compared to second or subsequent born babies);

        -  Gestational age at birth

        -  Maternal age at time of birth

        -  Hospital location (LHIN)

        -  Hospital volume

        -  Type of birth

        -  Maternal hospital length of stay

        -  Maternal mental health concerns

      Subgroup analyses will be performed using interaction terms in the regression models.

    <intervention_model_description>Two-armed cluster RCT. Hospitals in Ontario providing maternal/newborn care are the units of randomization. The intervention is targeted at the 'cluster' (hospital providing maternal/newborn care) and the maternal and newborn care units within the randomized hospitals. The cluster RCT design is appropriate for this project as it minimizes the risk of contamination, which could occur if individual mothers/parent dyads were randomized to different study arms within one organization. Although the video is publicly available for viewing on YouTube, this alone is a passive means of disseminating knowledge and the effect on clinically important outcomes has not been systematically evaluated.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The video portrays three babies having blood tests while being i) BF, ii) held SSC with the mother, and iii) receiving sucrose. The calming effects of these strategies are powerfully portrayed. Voice-over in user-friendly language explains how parents can help their babies by partnering with clinicians to use these strategies. As per the definition of patient-targeted and mediated interventions, this video is: i) patient (parent)-targeted, as it actively engages parents to improve their knowledge, positively affect their experience (during newborn screening), change their behavior and their baby's outcomes; ii) patient-mediated, as the video enables parents to change health professional behavior.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for hospitals include:

          -  Hospitals providing Level 1 and Level 2 maternal/newborn care contributing data to the
             BIS

          -  A birth volume of at least 50 per year

        Hospitals will be excluded if they:

          -  Already have &gt;85% use of pain management (BF, SSC, sucrose) during newborn screening
             or bilirubin sampling, as per BIS data These hospitals will be excluded to avoid a
             ceiling effect.

          -  Have &gt;50% missing data for the pain management data element in the BIS. The primary
             outcome from this study is based on the pain management data in the BIS and thus sites
             who are not able to enter this data will be excluded. Fifty percent data entry for
             this data element as considered sufficient as it shows the site already has some data
             entry systems already in place for this data element.

          -  In addition, two hospitals are excluded (Headwaters Health Care Centre and St Thomas
             Elgin General Hospital) as they will be our 'model' Level 1 and 2 hospitals. Our
             health care representatives from these hospitals, Gilmore and McCullough, in
             collaboration with their local interdisciplinary teams, will advise on all aspects of
             the delivery of the video to the units and parents, thus optimizing the intervention
             being delivered as planned (fidelity of the intervention).
