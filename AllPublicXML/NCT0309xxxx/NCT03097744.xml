  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study of meniscal tear repairs at least one-year post repair status.
      All patients were treated with Ceterix NovoStitch devices. The primary objectives of this
      study are to assess the clinical repair success rate via reoperation and PROs at greater than
      12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a retrospective, non-randomized, single-group assignment, open-label study of
      repairs of meniscal tears status post repair. The following clinical efficacy endpoints will
      be evaluated at greater than 12 months:

        -  Reoperation rate

        -  Validated patient-reported outcomes measures

        -  Contribution of the following retrospective covariates on failure and outcomes when
           available: Type of tear, Location of tear (lateral versus medial), Chronicity of
           symptoms, Nature of tear (degenerative versus traumatic), Length of tear, Patient age,
           Patient gender, Length of rehabilitation protocol, Performance of trephination,
           Inclusion of biologic enhancement, Meniscal repair alone versus meniscal repair combined
           with ACL reconstruction.

    <intervention_name>Ceterix NovoStitch</intervention_name>
    <description>The device allows the physician to place a circumferential compression stitch around meniscal tears. This stitch is placed by passing suture from the tibial side to the femoral side of the meniscus and across the tear. This allows compression across the entire tear surface.</description>
