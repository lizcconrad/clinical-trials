  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effects of a Single and Double Dose of
      Fermented Dairy Beverage on immune health and inflammatory status in healthy adults
      undergoing stressful exercise.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a &quot;pilot&quot; study. A total of 45 male subjects will be randomized to receive either
      Active product (in 2 doses) or placebo. This is a single-blind design (subjects are unaware
      of product type they are receiving). Randomization is in a 1:1:1 ratio for active test
      product (in different doses) versus placebo. Products will consume the beverages for a 10-day
      period. The subjects will be subjected to a defined strenuous exercise protocol on Days 1 and
      10 of the study. Blood will be collected on the exercise days (pre- and post-exercise) on
      Days 1 and 10.

      Blood will be analyzed for markers of Immunity and Inflammation, to assess the
      immuno-supportive and anti-inflammatory properties of the Active product. Product acceptance
      and tolerability will also be assessed using a VAS scale.

      Outcome analysis will be based upon changes over time (from time-point 0) for within group
      changes as well as between group differences. That is, study will examine differences in
      end-points from baseline to end-of-study; as well as differences among the three groups.

As there are multiple variables, statistical Outcome analysis for &quot;within and between group differences&quot; will be based upon changes over time (from time-point 0) for within group changes [in each outcome measure] as well as between group differences. P value for significance is set at P&lt; 0.05 for significance and will include 95% Confidence Intervals where appropriate. As this is a pilot study, no corrective factors for multiple sets of analysis will be employed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of consumption (tolerability) of products</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10 of study</time_frame>
    <description>Product ease of consumption (tolerability) will be measured by a Visual Analog Scale. On the VAS scale of 1-10, each subject is asked: &quot;How would you rate your tolerability, your acceptance of this product?&quot; This will be done to compare tolerability of the two product types.</description>
