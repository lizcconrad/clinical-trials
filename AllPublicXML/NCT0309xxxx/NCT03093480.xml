    <measure>Time to Tolerization With rFVIIIFc</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Time required for participants to achieve ITI success where ITI success is defined as achieving all 3 of the following criteria: Negative titer for inhibitor (less than [&lt;] 0.6 Bethesda units/milliliter [mL] by the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay) at 2 consecutive visits; FVIII incremental recovery (IR) &gt;66 percent (%) of the expected IR at 2 consecutive visits; FVIII half-life (t½) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 7 hours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who achieve ITI success where ITI success is defined as achieving all 3 of the following criteria: Negative titer for inhibitor (&lt;0.6 Bethesda units/mL by the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay) at 2 consecutive visits; FVIII incremental recovery (IR) &gt;66% of the expected IR at 2 consecutive visits; FVIII half-life (t½) &gt;=7 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of Participants with ITI success who reaches the criteria for relapse (defined as inhibitor titer &gt; 0.6 BU/mL or abnormal recovery after tolerance is achieved) will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bleeding Episodes During ITI and During the 48-week Period After Successful ITI performed with rFVIIIFc</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>A bleeding episode started from the first sign of a bleed and ended no more than 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleed, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location or injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart were considered the same bleeding episode.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consumption of rFVIIIFc</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104</time_frame>

Participants who meet the criteria for immune tolerance induction (ITI) success will enter the tapering period and will receive rFVIIIFc at a dose adjusted according to Investigator judgement (50 or 100 IU/kg) once a day from Week 1 to 6 and every other day thereafter through Week 16.</description>
