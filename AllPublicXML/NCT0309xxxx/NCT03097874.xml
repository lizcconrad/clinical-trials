  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial using an adaptive design for
      adolescents (ages 12-18) with anorexia nervosa to compare standard Family Based Treatment
      (FBT) to adaptive FBT with an Intensive Parental Coaching (IPC) component. If participants do
      not reach expected milestones by session 4 of treatment, participants may be randomized to
      receive additional IPC or continue treatment as usual with regular FBT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects aged 12 to 18 with anorexia nervosa (AN) will be recruited from Stanford
      University, University of California, San Francisco, and other bay-area medical programs and
      clinics. If participants are deemed eligible, participants will be invited for a baseline
      interview (about 2 hours in duration) during which the investigators will conduct interviews
      and collect questionnaire measures. Then, participants and participants' families will begin
      Family Based Treatment (FBT) with a study therapist at Stanford University or University of
      California, San Francisco, respectively.

      At session 4, if participants have not gained 2.4kg, an indicator of early treatment
      response, participants and participants' families will be randomized to receive either
      treatment as usual (FBT) or an adaptive form of FBT, during which families will receive
      additional Intensive Parental Coaching (IPC). If participants have reached weight milestones
      (i.e., 2.4kg at session 4), participants will continue FBT as usual.

      At 3 months of treatment and end of treatment, the investigators will collect the same
      measures taken at baseline. The investigators also ask that families participate in 6- and
      12-month follow-up, respectively.
