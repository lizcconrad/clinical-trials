  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, open-label, single-dose study to assess the PK of a single oral
      dose of 3 mg CC-122 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment as compared
      to sex, age (± 15 years), and weight (± 20%) matched control subjects with normal renal
      function. Estimated renal function for the purpose of group assignment will be determined at
      screening. Matched control subjects will have normal renal function, defined using the
      Cockcroft-Gault (C G) equation, as an estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) of ≥ 90 mL/min.
      Subjects with impaired renal function will be classified by stage of renal impairment (mild,
      moderate, or severe) using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Each group will enroll at least 2
      subjects of each sex

      During the course of the study, each subject will participate in a Screening period (Days -
      21 to -2), Treatment Period (including baseline visit), and a follow-up telephone call
      between Days 11 to 18. Subjects will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will
      return to the clinical site on Day 1 for baseline assessments, and will be domiciled at the
      clinical site from Day 1 to Day 4. PK samples will be collected through 72 hours post dose.
      Safety will be monitored throughout study.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

             hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) and 12-lead ECGs must be within normal limits
             or clinically acceptable as judged by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion Criteria for all subjects.

          -  The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          -  Subject has any condition or circumstance that prevents the subject from understanding
             and signing the Informed Consent Form.

          -  Subject has any condition that places the subject at an unacceptable risk from
             participating in the study or would confound the ability to interpret data from the
             study.

          -  Subject has any surgical or medical condition(s) possibly affecting drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, excretion, eg, bariatric procedure. Subjects with
             cholecystectomy and appendectomy may be included.

          -  Subject is a female of childbearing potential, pregnant, or breastfeeding.

          -  Subject donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before dose administration to a blood
             bank or blood donation center.

          -  Subject has a history of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 6 months before the first dose
             administration, or positive alcohol screen.

          -  Subject has a history of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM)
             within 6 months before the first dose administration, or positive drug screen that is
             not consistent with the patient's prescribed medication and or/medical history.

          -  Subject is known to have serum hepatitis or known to be a carrier of the hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) or have a positive result to
             the test for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening. If a positive
             result for HCV AB is reported, the Investigator may assess the suitability of the
             subject based upon normal liver function test results and either no history of
             Hepatitis C, or documented sustained viral response (ie, undetectable HCV viral load
             during and 12 weeks after completion of accepted HCV treatment). If the subject meets
             both criteria, and the Investigator determines this as acceptable, the subject can be
             considered for enrollment into the trial.

          -  Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days
             before dosing, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known (whichever is
             longer).

          -  Subject smokes more than 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco
             products (self-reported).

          -  Subject used approved medications or herbal medicines that are moderate or strong
             cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2 or 3A4/5 inducers and/or inhibitors (including St. John's
             wort) within 14 days or 5 half-lives of dosing, whichever is longer. The Indiana
             University &quot;Cytochrome P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be utilized to determine
             inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5.
             (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx).

             related complications.

          -  History of renal transplant.

          -  Subjects with renal impairment should be excluded from study if laboratory values are
             outside the following ranges and, in the opinion of the Investigator, are considered
             to prevent the subject from safely completing the study:

        Exclusion Criteria for Subjects with Mild, Moderate, or Severe Renal Impairment.

          -  Each matched healthy subject will be excluded from entry if ANY of the criteria listed
             below are met:

          -  Subject has any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that in the opinion of
             the Investigator, is considered to prevent the subject from safely completing the
