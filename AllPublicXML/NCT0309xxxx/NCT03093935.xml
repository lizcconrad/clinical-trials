  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      StimRouter Neuromodulation System includes an implanted lead which provides peripheral nerve
      stimulation for chronic pain. Post-stroke shoulder pain patients will be the focus of this
      study. After meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, approximately 50 enrolled patients will
      participate in the study through 6 months of follow-up. Various measures will be used to
      assess patient response to use of the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults age 18 or over with severe intractable chronic shoulder pain subsequent to stroke will
      be included. Pain relief will be measured after using StimRouter stimulation therapy
      targeting the axillary nerve. Existing/pre-study pain medications must be either maintained,
      reduced throughout the trial.

      Study Design is prospective, multi-center and will include 50 subjects The primary endpoint
      will be a clinically relevant pain reduction (30%) in pain score at 3 months after initiating
      stimulation in at least 50% of patients with no increase in pain medication.

      Primary Outcomes: Reduction of average pain at rest measured by numeric scale (BPI-SF5)

      Secondary Outcomes

        1. Change in Worst Pain (BPI-SF3)

        2. Least Pain &amp; Pain Right Now (BPI - SF 4,6)

        3. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)

        4. Patient Satisfaction questionnaire

        5. Shoulder Q Data Collection Points

      1) Baseline 2) Month 1 post-programming 3) Month 2 post-programming 4) Month 3
      post-programming 5) Month 6 post-programming Data Analysis Analyses will be made to evaluate
      differences in outcomes compared to baseline measures, with primary endpoint at Month 3

        -  Standard statistical estimation and inference will be undertaken for the observed
           treatment effect.

        -  All adverse events will be tabulated by their frequencies and proportions.

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) form is a standard pain assessment tool based on a 0 to 10 scale. The Average Pain at Rest (BPI question number 5) score will be assessed at Baseline and approximately 3 months after programming (therapy start) to determine if there is a significant reduction in average pain with the addition of StimRouter TM treatment to standard of care.</description>

    <description>The StimRouter Neuromodulation System is indicated for pain management in adults who have severe intractable chronic pain of peripheral nerve origin, as an adjunct to other modes of therapy (e.g., medications). The StimRouter is not intended to treat pain in the craniofacial region.</description>
