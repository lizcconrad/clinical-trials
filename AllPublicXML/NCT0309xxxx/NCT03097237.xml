  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate whether a diet rich in rye fiber from
      wholegrain rye, compared to refined wheat, as part of a hypocaloric diet leads to larger
      weight loss and lower body fat content after 12 weeks of intervention. Furthermore the study
      will investigate the effect on appetite as a potential underlying mechanism for differences
      in weight loss and body fat reduction.

    <description>Investigate if satiety differs between groups after 12 weeks of intervention and investigate if appetite correlates with changes in body weight. Measurements will be conducted through visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire, where participants log into a homepage and respond to their perceived satiety, hunger and desire to eat every 30-60 min during a day at base line, after 6w and 12wk.</description>
