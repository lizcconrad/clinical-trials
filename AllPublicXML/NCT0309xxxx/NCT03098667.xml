  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients will be allocated to 2 groups: the LMA group and the endotracheal tube (ET)
      group. Airway management will be done with the LMA Protector for the patients of the LMA
      group and with the classic endotracheal tube for the patients of the ET group. The main
      purpose of the study is to determine if the application of the LMA Protector causes less
      laryngopharyngeal symptoms than the endotracheal tube after minimally invasive thyroidectomy.
      The secondary purpose is to confirm that the LMA Protector is a safe alternative airway
      management device for minimally invasive thyroidectomy.

The size of the laryngeal mask will be chosen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lubricant gel will be applied to the dorsal side of the mask to ease the insertion to the oropharynx. The cuff of the mask will be filled with air by syringe until the indication of the integrated cuff pressure indicator is appropriate according to the manufacturer (green indication). If the indication changes during surgery, air will be added or removed accordingly. If the ventilation of the patient is inadequate at the beginning or anytime during the operation, the mask will be removed and the patient will be intubated</description>
