      the purpose of the study was to the compare pharmacokinetic profile of BIA 6-512 in healthy
      elderly subjects versus healthy young subjects after single and repeated oral administration
      of 200 mg BIA 6-512.

      Single-centre, open-label study in healthy young (18-40 years) and elderly (65 years or
      older) subjects. The study consisted of a single-dose phase followed by a repeated dose phase
      (3 times daily, at 8-h intervals). Subjects were admitted on the day prior to the first dose
      (Day 1). On day 1, a single dose of 200 mg BIA 6-512 (Dose 1) was administered in the
      morning. On day 2, the repeated dose phase started 24 h post first dosing. In the repeated
      dose phase (Doses 2 to 8) subjects received 200 mg BIA 6-512 every 8 hours until the morning
      of day 4 (approximately 72 hours post first dosing).

    <description>The study was performed in two consecutive phases: single-dose and multiple-dose.
Subjects were institutionalised on Day 0, the day prior to the single-dose administration (Day 1). Single dose (dose 1) of BIA 6-512 200 mg was administered on Day 1 and subjects remained confined in the Unit until the 24 h post-dose procedures (Day 2). Then, subjects started being administered BIA 6-512 200 mg thrice-daily until the morning of Day 4 (Dose 8). Blood samples were taken at pre-determined time-points for the assay of BIA 6-512</description>
