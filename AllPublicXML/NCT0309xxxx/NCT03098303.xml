  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the variables associated with patient
      acceptation or refusal to participate in a clinical research protocol when seen in during a
      pneumology consultation (excluding oncology and tobaccology).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To compare patient acceptance rates for participation in a clinical research protocol
           before and after January 15, 2016.

        -  To determine the variables associated with accepting or refusing to participate in a
           clinical research protocol for patients seen during a pneumology consultation (excluding
           oncology and tobaccology) before January 15, 2016.

        -  To determine the variables associated with accepting or refusing to participate in a
           clinical research protocol for patients seen during a pneumology consultation (excluding
           oncology and tobaccology) after January 15, 2016.

        -  To describe the patient population seen during pneumology consultations.

        -  To determine the variables associated with accepting or refusing to participate in a
           clinical research protocol sponsored by a pharmaceutical laboratory.

        -  To determine the variables associated with accepting or refusing to participate in a
           clinical research protocol sponsored by an academic institution.

        -  Construct clusters (homogeneous groups) of patients seen during the pneumology
           consultations.
