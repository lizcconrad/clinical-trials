  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the feasibility and efficacy of anti-B-Cell
      Maturation Antigen (BCMA) expressing T cells in treating patients with multiple myeloma.

      Primary Objectives

        1. To determine the feasibility ad safety of BCMA CAR-T cells in treating patients with
           multiple myeloma.

        2. To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of BCMA CAR-T cells.

        3. To access the efficacy of BCMA CAR-T cells in patients with multiple myeloma.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To assess the bone marrow and tumor migration of BCMA CAR-T cells.

        2. To investigate the tumor killing capability of BCMA CAR-T cells in vitro

        3. To investigate the possibility of host immune response to the mouse derived BCMA scFv,
           and evaluate its correlation to CAR-T persistence.

        4. To correlate the subsets and differentiation of BCMA CAR-T cells to observed anti-tumor
           efficacy.
