  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival of lung transplant patients (PD) is limited mainly by Infections, graft
      dysfunction in the immediate postoperative period and chronic dysfunction. Up to 36% have an
      episode of acute rejection after transplantation. For the diagnosis of these pathologies,
      transbronchial lung biopsy (BPTB) is essential. The classical method is the realization of
      BPTB with conventional clamp, but the performance diagnosis is limited. However, the use of
      cryoprobes for sampling in other pulmonary pathologies have been shown to achieve a higher
      diagnostic yield. The BPTB performance is variable and depends on factors such as sample size
      and the presence of artifacts (crushing) produced by the forceps tweezers. The objective
      principal is to compare the diagnostic yield of samples obtained with cryoprobe compared to
      those obtained with conventional biopsy tweezers. A prospective, randomized, and comparative
      study is proposed for all patients in the intensive care unit after lung transplantation in a
      24-month period, at Vall de Hebron Hospital. Patients will be divided into two groups:
      symptomatic and asymptomatic. The exclusion criteria are the contraindications of the
      procedure and the factors which increase the hemorrhagic risk. A flexible bronchoscope
      (BF-18BS) will be used and the procedure will be performed according to the technique
      conventional. The patient undergoing the procedure will be intubated, sedated and relaxed
      under supervision and continuous monitoring by an intensivist. A bronchoalveolar lavage and a
      maximum of 6 samples will be obtained. Morphological study (middle area, artifacts,
      components, diagnosis), microbiological, histological and anatomopathological according to
      the usual protocol. The duration of the procedure, the complications and the frequency with
      which the diagnosis obtained after the procedure modifies the therapeutic behavior will be
      monitored. These data will allow to evaluate the potential benefits of this procedure in the
      diagnosis of pulmonary pathology in lung transplantation.

      Bronchoscopic examinations will be performed with intubated patients under continuous
      monitoring (pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate), Oxygen therapy with
      high flows and surveillance by anesthesiologist. The bronchopulmonary lobe where the biopsies
      will be performed is determined prior to the procedure based on an imaging study (chest x-ray
      or computed tomography). Transbronchial biopsies will be obtained using a flexible
      bronchoscope (Pentax, 3.2 mm working channel), which approaches the subsegment where the
      affected area is located. The 2.4 mm diameter cryoprobe is placed (Erbokryo®), and moves
      forward until it encounters a soft resistance. The cryoprobe is removed between 5-10 mm and
      the freezing is applied for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds, the probe is gently removed together
      with the bronchoscope and frozen tissue sample at the tip of the probe. In the case of strong
      resistance, the process is stopped and then repeated. In the case of the use of forceps, the
      conventional technique is used.
