      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory
      into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to
      kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is relapsed (after stem cell
      transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-CD19/CD20 vector (referred to as tanCART-19/20 cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of tanCART-19/20 cells. RT-PCR (reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and
      quantify survival of tanCART-19/20 TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over
      time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to tanCART-19/20
      cell infusions.

      II. To determine if the CD137 transgene is superior to the TCR zeta only transgene as
      measured by the relative engraftment levels of tanCART-19/20 TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta
      cells over time.

      III. Estimate relative trafficking of tanCART-19/20 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph
      nodes.

      IV. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells (such as patients with active chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia(CLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), etc) determine tumor cell
      killing by tanCART-19/20 cells in vitro.

      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19/20,
      and assess correlation with loss of detectable tanCART-19/20 (loss of engraftment).

      VI. Determine the relative subsets of tanCART-19/20 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment. Patients receive
      anti-CD19/20-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced
      autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.
