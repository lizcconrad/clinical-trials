      Efficacy and safety of OctaplasLG® administration vs. crystalloids (standard) in patients

    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized (1:1, active : standard of care), controlled, open-label,
      investigator-initiated pilot phase IIa trial in patients with septic shock investigating the
      efficacy and safety of administrating OctaplasLG® as compared to crystalloids, such as
      Ringer-Acetate (standard of care) in a total of 40 patients.

      40 patients will be enrolled:

        -  Patients in the active treatment group (n = 20 patients) will receive OctaplasLG® as
           volume support according to trial algorithm.

        -  Patients in the standard of care group (n = 20 patients) will receive crystalloids, such
           as Ringer-Acetate, as volume support according to trial algorithm.

      All patients will be treated according to the standard ICU care.

    <description>OctaplasLG® is an industrial donor plasma product pooled from 630 -1520 single donor units. It possesses unique features when compared to standard FFP, such as having a standardized concentration of natural pro- and anti-coagulation factors, a standardized volume as well as being pathogen-free.12 Most importantly, the manufacturing method of OctaplasLG® removes immune complexes and cells in several steps of microfiltration. The manufacturing process also inactivates viral, bacterial and prion pathogen by immune neutralization, solvent-detergent treatment and a prion specific ligand affinity chromatography step.</description>
