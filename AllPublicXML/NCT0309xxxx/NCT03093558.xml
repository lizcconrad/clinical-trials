  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AF is associated with significant social and medical costs, including diminished quality of
      life (QOL) and increased health care utilization (HCU). This pilot study will enroll 200
      adults with prevalent, non-valvular AF of ≤3 year's duration at University of Pittsburgh
      Medical Center (UPMC). The primary objective at present is to obtain extensive feasibility
      and pilot data in implementing the Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) in concert with the
      Kardia (KAC) heart rhythm monitor.

      This pilot study is a single-center, two-arm randomized study that by design is unblinded.
      200 total participants are planned. Each participant will be randomized in an unblocked
      manner to receive &quot;usual care&quot; or the ECA/KAC intervention. Participants will have study
      visits at baseline and time 30 days. Adherence to using the ECA/KAC in combination over 30
      days will be quantified. Following participation study participants randomized to the ECA/KAC
      intervention will undergo an interview to determine their experience with the ECA/KAC.
      Participants and their physicians will receive a summary of ECA use and symptoms and
      correlated findings by KAC.
