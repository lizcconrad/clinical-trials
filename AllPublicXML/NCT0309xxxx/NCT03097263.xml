  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the prevalence of chronic low back pain, functional symptomatology of this disease
      remains poor and treatment decisions are based mainly on subjective data (importance and pain
      tolerance). However, there are some experimental elements that involve objective assessment
      of locomotor capabilities - at forefront objectives which the walking velocity in the
      evaluation of this pathology in terms of severity of functional impairment. Recent evidence
      suggest the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation program for improving patients
      functional capacities and their reintegration in socio-professional life. This retrospective
      study aims to quantify the evolution of the parameters collected during standardized walking
      tests performed before and after rehabilitation program. These patients have systematically
      carry out a comfortable walk test (400m walk test) and a brisk walk test (200m) at the
      beginning and end of their program. Furthermore, a maximal stress test on a treadmill was
      performed before the program in order to detect any cardiovascular events and to allow the
      personalization of the effort level required (target heart rate) during rehabilitation. In
      this study the evolution of the comfortable and fast speed will be collected and compared
      with the stress test data, and other measured parameters (functional score of Quebec, muscle
      Tests Shirado and Sorensen).
