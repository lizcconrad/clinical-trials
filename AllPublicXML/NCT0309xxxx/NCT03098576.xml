  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the usefulness of matching patients to targeted
      therapy by analyzing a tumor sample taken at diagnosis and testing it against 50
      cancer-associated genes. Targeted therapy is a highly personalized, newer approach to cancer
      treatment that aims to more precisely identify and attack cancer cells, in an effort to do
      less damage to normal cells.

      Targeted therapy in this study can be either off label-use of a U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved drug or a clinical trial that includes investigational drugs.
      Matched targeted therapy outcomes will be compared to the outcomes of patients who were not
      matched to a treatment.

      In order to find a matched treatment, a patient's sample will undergo a test known as a &quot;gene
      chip algorithm.&quot; This is will be done by having a sample of a patient's tumor analyzed at a
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) laboratory that specializes in molecular profiling.
      Molecular profiling is a process used to study a tumor's genetic characteristics. DNA will be
      taken from the tumor sample and will be screened for &quot;actionable genes.&quot; These genes are
      called actionable because mutations (structural changes) in these genes have FDA-approved
      matched therapies or are eligible for current clinical studies.
