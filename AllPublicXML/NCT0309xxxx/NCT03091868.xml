    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of rising oral single-doses of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and
      200 mg) on levodopa pharmacokinetics when administered in combination with a single-dose of
      immediate release levodopa/carbidopa 100/25 mg (Sinemet® 100/25) or with a single-dose of
      Sinemet® 100/25 plus a single-dose of entacapone (Comtan®) 200 mg and to assess the
      tolerability and safety of rising single oral doses of BIA 6-512 when administered in
      combination with a single-dose of Sinemet® 100/25 or with a single-dose of Sinemet® 100/25
      plus a single-dose of Comtan® 200 mg.

      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in four sequential groups
      of healthy subjects. Eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH on the day prior to receiving
      the first study medication. On the morning of the first dosing day (Day 1), subjects received
      BIA 6-512/Placebo concomitantly with Sinemet® 100/25; on the morning of the second dosing day
      (Day 2), subjects received BIA 6-512/Placebo concomitantly with Sinemet® 100/25 and Comtan®
      200 mg. Products were administered in fasting conditions (at least 8 hours). Subjects
      remained confined in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last dose (Day
      3); then, they were discharged and will return for the follow-up visit.
