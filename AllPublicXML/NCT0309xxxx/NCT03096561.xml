  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum Potassium Rate (PR) is a key indicator for medical management of patients with
      accidental hypothermia particularly for hypothermia related cardiac arrest (CA).

      Experts recommend a cut-off value for PR of 12 mmol/l for all hypothermic victims and 8
      mmol/l for avalanche casualties. Any patient presenting a PR lower than the cut-off value
      should be considered for Extracorporeal Rewarming. This therapeutic strategy is vital for
      patient survival.

      However, there is no consensus about what type of vessels should be punctured in order to
      obtain an accurate potassium rate and what type of measurement technics should be used to
      measure this potassium rate.

      The investigators hypothesize that potassium rate in these patients will differ by 1 mmol/l
      in blood samples collected from a peripheral vein in contrast to a central vein.

      The investigators study is a prospective observational, multicentre study.

    <description>For each sample, the apparent strong ion difference (SIDa) will be calculated as SIDa =(Na+ +K+ +Ca2+ +Mg2+)−(Cl− +Lac−)
The amount of weak plasma acid (A−) will be calculated as:
A− = [Alb] × (0.123 × pH − 0.631) + [PO4] × (0.309 × pH − 0.469)
The effective strong ion difference (SIDe) will be calculated as:
SIDe = 1000 × 2.46 × 10−11 × PaCO2/(10−pH) + [A−]
To quantify unmeasured charges, the SIG will be calculated as:
SIG = SIDa − SIDe</description>
