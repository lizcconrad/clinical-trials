  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease in the Western world. It is caused by
      progressive narrowing of the aortic valve leading to increased strain on the heart muscle
      which has to work increasingly hard to pump blood through the narrowed valve. Over time the
      heart muscle thickens to generate more force, but eventually the heart fails leading to death
      if the valve is not replaced with an operation. No medical treatments exist to stop or
      reverse the heart valve narrowing. Current clinical guidelines suggest that an operation
      should be performed only when symptoms develop or the heart muscle is visibly weak on cardiac
      ultrasound scanning. However, symptoms can be difficult to interpret and in many patients the
      heart muscle has become irreversibly damaged and the heart fails to recover following
      surgery.

      Using MRI scans of the heart, the investigators have identified heart scarring which seems to
      develop as the heart muscle thickens. Several studies now show that people who have developed
      this scarring are more likely to suffer poor outcomes including death. The investigators have
      also identified clinical risks that predict the presence of scarring.

      The investigators propose a study where patients with severe aortic stenosis but no
      indications for valve replacement as per current guidelines are assessed for those clinical
      risks. If a participant's risk of having scarring is higher they will undergo a cardiac MRI
      scan. If scarring is present participants will be randomised to routine clinical care, or
      referral for valve replacement surgery. Participants with no evidence of scarring will be
      randomised routine care with study follow or not. The investigators of this study hypothesize
      that early surgery will lead to fewer complications and reduced risk of death compared to
      standard care.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomised based on the result of the cardiac MRI. Participants who have mid wall fibrosis (heart scarring) are randomised to receive either early surgical intervention (group A) or routine care (group B). Participants who have no mid wall fibrosis are randomised to routine care with study follow up (group C) or without study follow up (group D).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The result of the cardiac MRI will be blinded to care provider, participant and investigator. Group A will be unblinded, as participants can only enter group A if mid-wall fibrosis is present. Groups B and C will appear identical and the groups combined so the presence of mid-wall fibrosis will be blinded. Group D will be unblinded, as participants can only enter group D if mid-wall fibrosis is not present.
Outcome assessors will be blinded to allocation in all groups where outcome is adjudicated (groups A, B and C)</masking_description>

    <description>The first event of all-cause mortality or unplanned aortic stenosis-related hospitalisation
Unplanned aortic stenosis-related hospitalisation is defined as an unplanned admission with syncope, heart failure, chest pain or arrhythmia (ventricular arrhythmia or second or third degree heart block) attributed to aortic stenosis. This endpoint will be adjudicated by two independent investigators blinded to the details of randomisation following review of the case notes and hospital records.</description>

    <description>The choice of either surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) will be made by the local clinical team according to local policies. In patients undergoing surgical replacement the choice of surgical technique and type of valve replacement used will be at the discretion of the operating surgeon. Patients found to have significant coronary artery disease requiring concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery will not be excluded. Similarly the choice of TAVI valve and need for percutaneous coronary intervention will be made by the TAVI heart team. The procedure should be performed as soon as possible and ideally within four months of randomisation and allocation to group A.</description>
