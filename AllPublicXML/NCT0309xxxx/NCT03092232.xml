    <textblock>
      The current study is the first clinical trial proposed with PF-06865571. It is designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) following administration of
      single doses of PF-06865571 to healthy adult subjects.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

             For optional Cohort 3 only, AST or ALT greater or equal to 1.5 × ULN, provided that
             data from Cohorts 1 and 2 support this limit; (3) • Subjects with a history of
             Gilbert's syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this
             study provided the direct bilirubin level is less than or equal to ULN plus ALT and
             AST are less than or equal to ULN plus alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, and

             of this protocol.

          -  Subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of

          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.
