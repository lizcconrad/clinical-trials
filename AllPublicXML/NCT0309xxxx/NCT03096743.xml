      Investigators will compare magnetic resonance (MR) elastography measurements to other forms
      of noninvasive methods of detecting raised intracranial pressure, including optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) imaging measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and indirect
      signs of raised intracranial pressure on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the brain elasticity in patients with idiopathic
      intracranial hypertension (IIH) and other forms of raised intracranial pressure, such as
      obstructive hydrocephalus. Investigators will evaluate for a correlation between brain
      stiffness and opening pressure on lumbar puncture. Investigators will also evaluate for
      changes in brain stiffness after interventions that are aimed at lowering intracranial
      pressure, including lumbar punctures, medications, and surgical interventions, such as
      ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Lastly, investigators will compare MR elastography measurements
      to other forms of noninvasive methods of detecting raised intracranial pressure, including
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and
      indirect signs of raised intracranial pressure on MRI.
