  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In light of the widespread organ shortage, dynamic preservation by means of Machine Perfusion
      (MP) has been proposed as a strategy to increase the pool of suitable grafts for liver
      transplantation. Reproducing more physiological conditions than traditional Static Cold
      Storage (SCS), MP may allow a better preservation and evaluation and perhaps even the
      resuscitation of high risk grafts. As a consequence, unnecessary discard of organs could be
      avoided and quality and safety of transplantation could be improved as well.

      Hypothermic MP (HMP) seems to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury. In fact, hypothermia slows
      down the metabolic rate and the oxygenation of the perfusate leads to re-synthesis of
      Adenosine TriPhosphate (ATP), which results in the restoration of cellular energy.

      Four series about the use of HMP in the clinical setting has been published so far. They all
      report acceptable outcomes after transplantation of human liver grafts from extended criteria
      Brain Dead Donors (BDD) and from Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD) donors preserved by
      HMP, thus proving its feasibility and safety. The efficacy of HMP, instead, is still under
      investigation in a phase II randomized trial.

      This is an observational, prospective, monocentric study aiming at verifying the feasibility
      and safety of post-SCS Hypothermic Oxygenated PErfusion (HOPE) in the setting of our liver
      transplant program. Extended criteria grafts from BDD and grafts from DCD donors will be
      preserved by post-SCS HOPE prior to transplantation. The recipients of these grafts will be
      followed-up for at least 1 year.

      This is an observational, prospective, monocentric study aiming at verifying the feasibility
      and safety of post-SCS HOPE in the setting of our liver transplant program.

      20 consecutive patients with written informed consent will be enrolled. They will be
      transplanted with grafts from extended criteria BDD or from DCD donors preserved by post-SCS
      HOPE.

      The HOPE procedure will be performed in our operating room after regular procurement,
      transport and back-table preparation. University of Wisconsin Machine Perfusion Solution
      (UW-MPS) will be used. Two pumps will provide dual pressure-controlled perfusion through the
      portal vein and the hepatic artery. Portal flow will be continuous and will be adjusted to
      keep portal pressure below 5 mmHg. Instead, arterial flow will be pulsatile and will be
      regulated to maintain arterial pressure between 25 mmHg and 30 mmHg. The perfusate will be
      oxygenated with the goal of a partial Pressure of Oxygen (PO2) of 50-70 kilopascal. The
      perfusate temperature will be kept between 4°C and 12°C by a heat exchanger. pH, PO2 and
      partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PCO2) of the perfusate pumped to the graft and drained
      from the vena cava will be monitored. HOPE will be maintained for 3 to 4 hours.

      Patients will be followed-up for at least 1 year according to a scheduled timetable.

      Data about HOPE and transplant procedure, about donors and recipients' characteristics and
      about patients' follow-up will be collected in a dedicated electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)
      according to Good Clinical Practice.
