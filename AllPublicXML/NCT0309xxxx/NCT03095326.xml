    <textblock>
      Splenectomized thalassemia major subjects were provided with PCV pneumococcal vaccine
      (Prevenar 13®) at the start of the trial, following which they were randomly assigned to 2
      groups (zinc and placebo group). After 8 weeks, the subjects received PPV pneumococcal
      vaccine (Pneumovax®). Zinc syrup was provided to the zinc group at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day
      (maximum of 50 mg/day). Pneumococcal IgG examinations were conducted at the start of the
      trial and after 12 weeks.

      This study is a single blinded randomised-control trial. Splenectomized thalassemia major
      patient samples were provided with PCV pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar 13®) at the start of
      the trial, following which they were randomly assigned to 2 groups (zinc and placebo group).
      After 8 weeks, the subjects received PPV pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax®). Zinc syrup was
      provided to the zinc group at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day (maximum of 50 mg/day). Placebo
      containing sucrose syrup of the same form, taste, consistency and color was given to the
      other group. Everyone except the primary researcher are blinded to which of the treatment is
      placebo and which is actual zinc syrup. Pneumococcal IgG examinations were conducted at the
      start of the trial and after 12 weeks.

      Sample size was measured using:

      n1=n2=n= {((Zα+Zβ) Sd)/d}^2 where N = number of subject Za = degree of significance (5%), a =
      5% Zb = strength of study (80%). b = 20% Sd = standard deviation d = meaningful difference
      between the two groups The measured sample size is 816, but due to limited patient total
      population sampling was used instead.

    <intervention_model_description>All splenectomized thalassemia major subjects were provided with PCV pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar 13®) at the start of the trial. The subjects were then randomly assigned into one of 2 groups (the zinc group and the placebo group). Zinc was provided in the form of syrup at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 50 mg/day. The placebo was also provided in the form of syrup, with similar shape and flavor.</intervention_model_description>
