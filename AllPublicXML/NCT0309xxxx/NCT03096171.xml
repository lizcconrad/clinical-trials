      This protocol proposes a well-being program, delivered through an application for mobile
      devices, based on meditation and positive psychology principles such as human development,
      the improvement of virtues, quality of life and well-being. The investigators hypothesize
      that this program offered in mobile application may promote well-being and reduce stress
      related problems in the participants. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a
      well-being program delivered through an application for mobile devices in a sample of high
      school students. Methods: Sixty high school students will be recruited. The participants will
      be randomized in two groups of 30 participants each one, half of them in the control group
      (GC) and the other half to the intervention group (GI).

      Introduction: Some very successful stress management programs are based on the principle of
      Mindfulness. This protocol proposes a well-being program, delivered through an application
      for mobile devices, based on meditation and positive psychology principles such as human
      development, the improvement of virtues, quality of life and well-being. In the modern world,
      young people are connected to new technologies and the use of applications can be a fun way
      to learn how to cope with stress and promote well-being. In this sense, the investigators
      hypothesize that this program offered in mobile application can be considered an interesting
      alternative for high school students who want to reduce symptoms related to stress and also
      promote well-being. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a well-being program
      delivered through an application for mobile devices in a sample of high school students.
      Methods: Sixty high school students will be recruited. The participants will be randomized in
      two groups of 30 participants each one, half of them in the control group (GC) and the other
      half to the intervention group (GI). The GI will participate in the Flourishing App Program,
      for eight weeks, while the GC will have access to a Control App. Then, after the evaluations,
      the GC will receive the intervention (Flourishing App Program), while the first group will
      repeat the use of the Flourishing App Program. Questions will be applied to evaluate the
      levels of stress and well-being of participants before and after the program and before and
      after each training period.
