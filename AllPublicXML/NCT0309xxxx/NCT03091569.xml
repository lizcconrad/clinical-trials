  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether topical Vitamin K application
      reduces the grade of erythema in comparison with a vehicle cream (placebo) through
      physicians' assessment and participant self-assessment.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate in this study population: effects of
      Vitamin K in reducing the burning sensation and local pain; effects of Vitamin K in reducing
      the erythema diameter; and the evaluation of participants' satisfaction related to the
      injection treatment.
