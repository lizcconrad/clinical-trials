  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients of GIST (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor), Imatinib has been widely used in GIST
      with KIT or PDGFRA sensitive mutations. From clinical points of view, individual differences
      often occur between different patients, leading diverse effect in ADR and drug effect.
      Meanwhile, the drug effect and adverse drug reaction was significantly influenced by the
      pharmacokinetic factors and pharmacodynamic and other factors. In this research, we try to
      establish a more sensitive method to detect sensitive mutations in plasma and discover the
      correlation between somatic and germline mutations, plasma trough concentration and drug
      effect, the association between ADME-associated SNP, Target/Receptor/Pathway-associated SNP,
      trough concentration and TKI adverse effect. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro research is
      also crucial for rational explanation for these clinical phenomenon.

      The plasma concentration of Imatinib were established. The ADME-associated SNPs included are
      CYP3A4, CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ABCB1, ABCG2, ABCC4, SLC22A1, SLCO1B3 and so on. The
      Target/Receptor/Pathway-associated SNP s included KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FLT1, FLT3, MAPK1,
      SHC1, CCL5, CXCL14 and so on. The somatic mutations included are KIT, PDGFRA, BRAF and so on.

      1. FFPE samples of tissue needle biopsy were used for KIT and PDGFRA mutation detection.

        2. EDTA-whole blood was centrifuged at 4000rpm*10min,plasma was separated within four hours
           for somatic mutation detection.The remaining samples were used for germline mutation
           detection. All the blood samples were frozen in -80℃ until analysis.
