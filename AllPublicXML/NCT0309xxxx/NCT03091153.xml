  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop, implement and evaluate a deprescribing initiative at a Canadian Long
      Term Care (LTC) Facility. Residents currently undergo an annual medication review as part of
      the clinical pharmacy services provided in the LTC facility. For this study, eligible
      residents will be randomized to receive either a deprescribing focused medication review or
      usual care.

      The deprescribing focused medication therapy assessments will be done on half of the 143
      residents residing on the second and third floors of the facility. The other half of
      residents will serve as the control group and continue to receive their annual medication
      review and regular care from the attending physicians and nurses.

      The deprescribing intervention will be delivered by final year pharmacy students completing
      their practice experiences, under the supervision of clinical pharmacists at the LTC facility
      and clinical pharmacists from Memorial University's Medication Therapy Services (MTS) Clinic.
      Currently the clinic has a well developed procedure for providing in depth medication therapy
      reviews for residents of the community, upon referral by their primary care physician.
      Students will adapt this model of medication review to have a stronger deprescribing focus
      and be applicable to elderly residents of a LTC facility. The intervention will consist of an
      in depth medication therapy review with a focus on identifying any medications that may no
      longer be required or are deemed to be inappropriate or potentially unsafe in the elderly
      based on currently guidelines/criteria. The students will work closely with members of the
      resident's care team on a daily basis, as well as the resident and their family, to develop
      and implement a deprescribing plan.
