      This is a prospective, observational study to evaluate the utility of removing Dysplastic
      Nevi (DN) with a defined 2 mm margin. This is a non-interventional study that will observe
      the pathology results following a standard of care biopsy. Principal Investigator (PI)
      hypothesize that the majority of lesions removed with this technique will have margins free
      of nevus cells on examination of histopathological sections. Hence, pathologists will not
      suggest that an additional excision be performed to remove any residual nevus. PI also
      hypothesize that if biopsy sites are followed over time, the rate of nevus recurrence will be
      low, because investigators would have removed the majority, if not all of the lesion at the
      time of initial biopsy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patents seen in the practices of the study physicians are eligible to participate
             in the study.

          -  Patients must be over 18 years of age.

          -  Patients who are able to provide informed consent.

          -  Patient must have a lesion in which the differential diagnosis includes a DN and for
             which the study dermatologist deems it is appropriate to perform a saucerization
             biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are less than 18 years of age.

          -  Patients who are unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Lesions for which a saucerization biopsy is impractical in the judgment of the study
             dermatologist based on certain clinical factors (e.g. patient on anticoagulation
             therapy, lesion size and/or anatomic location).
