  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-institutional phase II randomized study comparing neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy followed by surgical resection to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab with concurrent
      radiotherapy, followed by surgical resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab. The total duration
      of pembrolizumab will be one year in the experimental arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized phase II trial with an initial safety run-in to test the
      safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab with image-guided radiotherapy and adjuvant
      pembrolizumab compared to radiation therapy alone in patients with clinically localized
      extremity soft tissue sarcoma at high risk for developing metastatic disease (tumor size &gt; 5
      cm, intermediate- to high-grade; approximately 50% risk for distant disease at 2 years).
      Histologies will be limited to undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and
      dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma based on preliminary data from SARC028. Other terms
      for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma may include, but are not limited to. pleomorphic
      undifferentiated sarcoma, unclassified spindle cell sarcoma, spindle cell sarcoma not
      otherwise specified, pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma, pleomorphic fibroblastic sarcoma,
      undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma, pleomorphicsarcoma with prominent
      inflammation, pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (including
      storiform-pleomorphic and inflammatory subtypes), fibrosarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma (located
      deep to the fascia in muscle). Radiation therapy with three cycles of pembrolizumab will be
      administered as neoadjuvant therapy for patients randomized to the experimental arm. These
      patients will also receive up to fourteen cycles of adjuvant pembrolizumab after surgical
      resection. Patients in the standard of care arm will receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy (50 Gy
      in 25 fractions) followed by surgical resection as in RTOG 0630.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of grade 2 or 3 out of 3 UPS or
             dedifferentiated/pleomorphic LPS of the extremity (including limb girdle, i.e.
             shoulder or hip) that measures greater than 5 cm in any direction as assessed by
             imaging; Alternative terms for UPS meeting inclusion criteria include but are not
             limited to the following

          -  Patients with non-melanomatous skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or low-risk prostate
             cancer can be enrolled.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1

          -  Resectable primary tumor with no evidence of metastatic disease by imaging. Imaging
             must be performed within 45 days of Day 1 of study.

          -  Adequate organ function within 10 days of Day 1

          -  Written, voluntary informed consent

          -  Fertile men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method
             of birth control from Day 1 of study and for 120 days after last pembrolizumab
             administration in both sexes. Women of childbearing potential include pre-menopausal
             women and women within the first 2 years of the onset of menopause. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test ≤ 72 hours prior to Day 1

             diagnosis of sarcoma

          -  Prior radiation therapy in excess of 20 Gy to the site of the current diagnosis of
             sarcoma. No overlap with prior radiation fields in excess of 20 Gy is allowed.

             opinion of the investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise
             compliance with the protocol

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing/breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or men who
             are expecting to father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting
             with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of
             pembrolizumab.

          -  Inability to comply with protocol required procedures

          -  Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other

          -  Known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients

          -  Metastatic disease or regional lymph node involvement. Chest CT will be mandatory
             prior to enrollment to evaluate for the presence of metastatic disease. Pulmonary
             nodule(s) &lt; 5 mm without a histological diagnosis may not be the basis for study
             exclusion given the lack of specificity of chest CT. If pulmonary nodule(s) &gt; 5 mm are
             noted on chest CT but appear stable relative to prior chest imaging of at least 6
             months duration, then this is permitted.

          -  Unresectable disease or medically inoperable

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, systemic corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required systemic steroids or
             current pneumonitis.

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
