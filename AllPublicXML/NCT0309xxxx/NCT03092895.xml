    <textblock>
      This an open-label，Non-Randominzed Phase 2 study to evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of
      SHR-1210 in combination with Apatinib or FOLFOX4 regimen in subjects with Advanced PLC.

      Participants with advanced PLC who failed or intolerable to prior systemic therapy will be
      treated with SHR-1210 plus Apatinib; Participants with advanced PLC who have never received
      prior systemic therapy will be treated with SHR-1210 plus FOLFOX4 regimen.
