               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) within 1.5 x
                  normal range (or =&lt; 3.0 x upper limit of normal [ULN] if liver metastases are
                  present)

               -  Serum bilirubin within normal range (or =&lt; 1.5 x ULN if liver metastases are
                  present; or total bilirubin =&lt; 3.0 x ULN with direct bilirubin within normal
                  range in patients with well documented Gilbert syndrome)

               -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN or 24-hour clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with poor-controlled arterial hypertension (systolic pressure ≥ 140 mmHg
             and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg) despite standard medical management;

          2. Suffered from grade II or above myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction,
             uncontrolled arrhythmias (including QT interval male ≥ 450 ms, female ≥ 470 ms). Grade
             III-IV cardiac insufficiency according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteria
             or echocardiography check: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&lt;50%;

          3. Patients who have had prior allergic reaction to Apatinib;

          4. The subject has had another active malignancy within the past five years except for
             cervical cancer in site, in situ carcinoma of the bladder or non-melanoma carcinoma of
             the skin;

          5. Clinically significant and uncontrolled major medical conditions including but not
             limited to: active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             Unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/ social situation
             that would limit compliance with study requirements; any medical condition, which in
             the opinion of the study investigator places the subject at an unacceptably high risk
             for toxicities;

          6. Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents.

          7. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding;

          8. Patients with any other concurrent disease which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for participation in the study.
