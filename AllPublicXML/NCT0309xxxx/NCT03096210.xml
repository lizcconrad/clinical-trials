  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the radiographic, histological and clinical comparisons of the
      completely autologous T-PRF or allograft effectiveness at the maxillary sinus elevation
      procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants randomly divided into 2 groups and the test group had a Schneiderian membrane
      elevation with using balloon lifting technique and after that sinus was filled with T-PRF
      produced from the patients' blood and 4 months waiting period has been entered. At the end of
      the 4th month, the bone samples were received from the implant slots and sent to histological
      evaluation. After 3 months, implant stability was measured and recorded. In the control
      group, the same procedures were followed and sinus was filled with only allograft. Waiting
      period was changed to 6 months for this group.

    <description>Blood samples were collected from the each participant's arm in the test group by 20 ml syringe and then was transferred into 10ml grade IV titanium tube without anticoagulant. After centrifugation of blood samples (2800 rpm, 12 minutes) at room temperature, the T-PRF clot was removed from the tubes with sterile tweezers. 6 blood tubes were collected for a sinus floor elevation/lifting operation and 6 T-PRFs were prepared for each participant.</description>
