  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if azacitidine in combination with
      pembrolizumab can help to control myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The safety of this drug
      combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Azacitidine is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of MDS. The use of the study drugs in combination is
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson
      Cancer Center.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 4 weeks (28 days).

        -  Participant will receive azacitidine either by vein over about 10-40 minutes or as an
           injection under the skin for 7 days starting on Days 1 of each cycle. If participant is
           receiving azacitidine at a clinic that closes over the weekend, alternate dosing
           schedules (such as receiving azacitidine on Days 1-5 and 8-9 of each cycle) are
           possible.

        -  Participant will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of Cycle
           1, and then every 3 weeks after that.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will receive the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks is in participant's
      best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study
      directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after the long-term follow-up period.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, or within 72 hours of the first dose of study drugs, if participant is
      able to become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a pregnancy
      test.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and then every 3 weeks after that, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine
      will be collected for routine tests and a physical exam performed before the dose of
      pembrolizumab.

      On Day 1 of every cycle, the following tests and procedures will be performed. The Day 1 of
      Cycle 1 tests can be done within 72 hours of the first dose of study drugs.

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      Between Days 22-28 of Cycles 1 and 3 and then 1 time every 3 cycles after that, participant
      will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to check the status of the disease and for
      cytogenetic testing.

      If your doctor thinks it is needed, at any point in the study, participant may have
      additional bone marrow biopsies and aspirations.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After participant stops the study drugs:

      Â°Participant will have a physical exam.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 30 days after participant's last dose of the study drugs, participant will be called
      by a member of the study team and asked how participant is feeling and about any other drugs
      or treatments participant is receiving. The phone call should last about 10 minutes.
      Participant will continue having these calls every 12 weeks for 1 year and then every year
      after that.

             be allocated to specific patient cohorts based on their prior exposure. Patients that
             had received prior hypomethylating agent therapy should have at least received 6
             cycles of therapy and not achieved any response or had progressed after any given

             heterosexually intercourse. Female patients who are postmenopausal for at least one
             year before the screening visit or are surgical sterile or if they are of child
             bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of treatment of

             bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN (unless considered
             due to Gilbert's disease or leukemia disease) or &lt;/= 5 x ULN for subjects with liver
             metastases.

          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
