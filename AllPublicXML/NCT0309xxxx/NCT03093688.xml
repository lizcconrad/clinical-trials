  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invariant Natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that express
      homogeneous TCR recognizing KRN7000 which was up-regulated by many kinds of cancer cells.
      PD-1+CD8+T cells of patients with advanced tumor are most likely tumor-specified. Our
      hypothesis is that immunotherapy strategy of infusion of iNKT cells and PD-1+CD8+T cells may
      decrease the tumor burden and improve overall survival. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the safety and efficacy of treatment of patients with advanced solid tumor by infusing
      of iNKT cells and PD-1+CD8+T cells.

      Treatment of patients with advance solid tumor is great unsolved challenge to the physicians.
      Efficacy of conventional treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is
      limited. AS novel therapy, immunotherapy shows great prospects.

      Human iNKT cells can directly lysis tumor cells by a perforin-dependent mechanism,and
      intracellular granzyme B expression may also potentiate cell killing. Tumor cells expressing
      CD1d may be especially susceptible to direct NKT cell lysis. iNKT cells play important role
      in immune regulation by secreting various cytokines. PD-1+CD8+T cells are most likely
      tumor-specific in patient with advanced tumor. Expansion method of iNKT cells and PD-1+CD8+T
      cells in vitro is developed as published in our patent. Infusions of iNKT cells and CD8+T
      cell have been proved safe in mice.

      In this clinical trial, the safety and efficacy of the immunotherapy of infusion of iNKT
      cells and CD8+T cells are assessed.
