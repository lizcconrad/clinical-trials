  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to prospectively estimate the median PFS of African American and
      Caucasian men with mCRPC taking apalutamide, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone. Secondary
      objectives include: PSA kinetics: to determine the duration of PSA response, time to nadir,
      and percent of men who achieve a PSA &lt; 0.1; Radiographic assessments: to estimate the rate of
      objective response and incidence of bone flares; Safety (NCI CTC v4.0) and tolerability,
      particularly incidence and grade of hypertension in the two populations.

      This is a non-comparative pilot open-label, parallel arm, multicenter study of apalutamide
      and abiraterone acetate in African American and Caucasian men with mCRPC. It is anticipated
      that 3 additional sites will be needed to accrue 100 subjects (50 African American and 50
      Caucasian) over a 24 month accrual period. The study agents will be administerd at the
      following doses: apalutamide 240mg orally once daily, abiraterone acetate 1000mg orally once
      daily, and prednisone 5 mg BID in 4-week cycles throughout the treatment period.

      Fifty (50) patients will be enrolled in each group (AA and Caucasians). The proportion of
      patients who experience PSA decline of 30%, 50% and 90% will be estimated with exact 95%
      confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution will be computed. In addition, post
      therapy changes in PSA will be explored as a continuous outcome. The Kaplan-Meier product
      limit method will be used to estimate the rPFS, biochemical PFS and overall survival
      distributions.
