  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the durability of Sustained virologic response
      (SVR) in participants who achieved SVR at last post-therapy visit of parent studies (LPVPS)
      with NCT Numbers NCT02569710 and NCT02765490.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre study will not provide any study treatment but collect follow-up data for up
      to 3 years to assess the long term durability of SVR achieved in one of the parent studies
      [phase 2 or 3 with AL-335 and Odalasvir (ODV) with or without Simeprevir (SMV]. In addition
      participants who failed to achieve an SVR in the parent study can be enrolled to assess the
      presence of resistance associated substitutions (RAS) and their persistance over time. It is
      expected that the vast majority of approximately 250 participants will enrolled in the study.
      Safety parameters and Liver disease status will be assessed in all participants over time.

    <description>Late viral relapse is defined as: participants who achieved SVR at LPVPS but have confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to (&gt;=) LLOQ during follow-up in this study. SVR at LPVPS is defined as participants who achieved SVR12 in the parent study, and maintained HCV RNA&lt;LLOQ until LPVPS.</description>

    <measure>Liver Disease Status in All Participants who Achieved or did not Achieve SVR at LPVPS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Liver disease status will be evaluated using child pugh assessment score and laboratory tests including aspartate amino transferase to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and Metavir. Child Pugh score includes 5 clinical measures: 1) Encephalopathy grade, 2) Ascites, 3) Serum bilirubin, 4) Serum albumin, 5) Prothrombin time for assessing status of liver disease. Each measure is scored 1 to 3, with 3 indicating most severe derangement. The individual item scores will be summed to yield total score ranging from 5 to 15. Child-Pugh A (mild): 5-6 points, Child-Pugh B (moderate): 7-9 points, and Child-Pugh C (severe): 10-15 points.</description>
