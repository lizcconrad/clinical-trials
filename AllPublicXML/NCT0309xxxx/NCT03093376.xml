  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically significant anxiety affects up to 20% of preschool-aged children and often fails
      to respond to currently available treatments. Emerging science suggests that increasing brain
      capacity for &quot;effortful control&quot; (EC) may help anxious children to regulate emotion and
      behavior to improve outcomes. Thus, in the proposed study, children will be trained on EC
      tasks (including selective attention, response inhibition, etc.) to increase capacity for
      effortful control (EC) over fear behaviors. To determine whether EC training improves brain
      capacity to regulate fear, investigators will assess neurophysiological and behavioral
      indices of effortful control and fear reactivity before and after this training.

    <textblock>
      This experiment will randomize child participants with clinical to subclinical anxiety across
      two conditions to test the effects of a piloted effortful control (EC) training intervention.
      Up to 40 preschool age children (4-6.99 years) with clinical to subclinical anxiety symptoms
      will complete either a weeklong, camp-like EC training (n=20) or a waitlist control (n=20).
      Before and after the active and control conditions (time 1 and time 2, respectively), an
      EEG-based measure, the error-related negativity (ERN), will be collected while children play
      a simple computer game. The ERN indexes neural mechanisms underlying EC. Other measures to be
      collected before and after the EC training include a blink reflex known as the fear
      potentiated startle (FPS); laboratory-assessed EC and fear behaviors; and, clinically
      assessed anxiety symptoms.

      The EC intervention or &quot;EC camp&quot; will occur over 4 mornings (Saturday and Sunday over two
      consecutive weekends) from 9AM to 12PM. These times were chosen to maximize child focus and
      energy as well as convenience for families. EC camp is comprised of short, game-like
      exercises that teach effortful control skills (e.g., response inhibition, selective
      attention, set shifting skills). Of the 40 participants enrolled in the study, 20 will be
      randomized to receive the EC training intervention and 20 to wait list control. Wait list
      participants will be given a set of written materials (adapted from the EC camp protocol) to
      complete at home with their caregivers after the post-wait list assessment.

      Primary analyses will test for group mean differences in ERN and FPS changes (i.e. from time
      1 to time 2) among children assigned to EC training compared to those in the control
      condition. Secondary analyses will test relationship of changes in neurophysiological targets
      with change in EC and Fear behaviors and change in anxiety severity.

      This study hopes to examine the mechanistic plausibility of a precise,
      neuroscientifically-derived treatment for childhood anxiety, promoting developmental
      trajectories towards health and away from chronic illness.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Error Related Negativity (ERN) at Post-Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Error-related negativity (ERN) is assessed through the &quot;Zoo task&quot;, a &quot;Go/No-Go&quot; paradigm assessing effortful control. Children view a series of animals on a computer screen and are asked to press a button when a new animal appears (Go trials), unless the animal is an orangutan (i.e., inhibit button response, No-Go trials). The task includes 8 blocks, each containing 30 unique animals (Go trials) and 10 orangutans (No-Go trials) in random order.
Event related potentials (ERP; direct responses to stimuli measured using electroencephalography) will be examined from fronto-central recording sites time-locked to error and correct response. Differentiation between these trial types is the primary ERN measure, but ERN in error trials will also be considered, as well as ERPs in correct trials. The number of No-Go errors and response times (RTs) to Go trials will also be considered in analyses, as performance can affect ERN amplitude.</description>

    <description>An interactive, child-friendly &quot;camp&quot;. Effortful control (EC) camp is comprised of short, game-like exercises taught by &quot;camp counselors&quot; to groups of approximately 4-6 children. In total, 12 different exercises that teach inhibitory and attentional control, as well as visuospatial and working memory skills, will be administered.
Tasks will allow for &quot;scaffolding&quot; (Halperin et al, 2013), or incremental increases in difficulty of the games over time. EC camp will occur over 4 mornings from 9AM to 12PM, on two consecutive weekends.</description>
