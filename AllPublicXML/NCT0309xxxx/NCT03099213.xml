      Primary Objective:

      To document the tolerability of patients receiving study medication at 12-week of therapy in
      terms of the scoring system assessed by the investigator.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To document drug safety at 12-week of treatment in terms of number of Adverse Drug
           Reaction or Serious Adverse Drug Reaction reported.

        -  To describe the population treated as per the HOPE study indication in current clinical
           practice (demographics, cardiovascular risk-factors at treatment initiation, concomitant
           treatments patterns).

    <description>Receiving ramipril with the recommended initial dose of 2.5 mg once daily; depending on the tolerability, the dose should be gradually increased. The increase should be implemented by doubling the dose after one to two weeks. Three or four weeks later, the dose should be doubled again up to the usual maintenance dose of 10 mg once daily.</description>

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Man or woman, age 55 years old or more.

             least one of the following underlying conditions:

          -  Clinical evidence of coronary artery disease (examples: previous myocardial infarction
             [MI], positive stress test or significant stenosis at coronary angiography, previous
             Percutaneous Trans-Luminal Coronary Angioplasty [PTCA], previous Coronary Arterial
             Bypass Grafting [CABG]);

          -  Clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease (examples: history of intermittent
             claudication with positive Doppler or angiography, previous limb bypass surgery,
             previous percutaneous trans-luminal angioplasty, previous limb or foot amputation);

          -  Previous stroke;

          -  Diabetes (insulin-dependent or non-insulin dependent) with at least one of the
             following cardiovascular risk factors:

          -  hypertension (blood pressure [BP] &gt;140/90 mmHg, or patients on antihypertensive
             treatment);

          -  hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol &gt; 5.2 mmol/L [&gt;200 mg/dL]);

          -  low HDL cholesterol (&lt; 0.9 mmol/L [&lt;3.5 mg/dL]);

          -  current cigarette smoking;

          -  documented microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 hours);

          -  Evidence of previous vascular disease.
