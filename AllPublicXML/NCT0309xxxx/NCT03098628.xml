      This is a single-blind, open-label, randomised controlled trial with five groups. There are
      four different PCV schedules to be evaluated: a 0+1 schedule of PCV10 at 12 months of age
      (Group V), a 0+1 schedule of PCV13 at 12 months of age (Group W), a 1+1 schedule of PCV10 at
      2 and 12 months of age (Group X), and a 1+1 schedule of PCV13 at 2 and 12 months of age
      (Group Y); along with a control group that receives a dose of PCV10 at 24 months of age
      (Group Z). Additionally, all participants will receive four doses of Infanrix-hexa at 2, 3, 4
      and 18 months of age.

    <masking_description>This is a single-blind, open-label, randomised trial, with laboratory staff blinded to study group allocation as all the outcome measures that address the study objectives are laboratory based. Laboratory samples will be labelled with a unique trial identification number that does not identify the study group. Given the different timing of the vaccine schedules in the different study arms, the study nurses, vaccine administrators and participants will not be blinded to the study group allocation of each infant.</masking_description>
