  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in need of an endovascular or open operative
      restructuring will be asked to participate in this study. After obtaining written consent a
      central venous catheter and a liquor drainage will be routinely placed during surgery. The
      catheter and the drainage will stay in the patients for at least 72 hours postoperatively. In
      total, nine measurements of the liquor and serum will be performed within a week in order to
      determine the following parameters: neuropeptide P, neuropeptide Y, neurofilament triplet
      protein (NFL), S100B, glial fibrillary protein (GFAp), lactate, glucose, or oxygen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with complex aortic diseases receiving an operative treatment are under risk of
      spinal cord damage due to insufficient blood circulation of the spinal cord during surgery.
      The risk depends on comorbidities, extent of surgery, and the perioperative management.
      Despite an adequate preoperative imaging, assessment of the blood circulation of the spinal
      cord during endovascular or open operative restructuring is struggling. Beside the monitoring
      possibilities of the spinal cord functions during surgery, insufficient approaches regarding
      early detection of spinal ischemia by using laboratory parameters exist. Several biomarker,
      e.g. neuropeptide P, neuropeptide Y, neurofilament triplet protein (NFL), S100B, glial
      fibrillary protein (GFAp), lactate, glucose, or oxygen, will be evaluated singularly or as a
      bundle of markers in small patient groups. Surgeries of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms are
      associated with high risks despite already existing high standardized procedures (Cowan et
      al. 2003). The major complications are cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal
      complications, and ischemias of the spinal cord. Especially, the ischemia of the spinal cord
      is a feared complication caused by the irreversibility and the small time frame.

      During the study samples of liquor and tissues (serum, urine) will be drawn pre-, peri- and
      postoperatively. Patients will receive a routinely placed liquor drainage due to the temporal
      duration in surgery. The liquor drainage stays in the patient also in the early postoperative
      phase. Hence, the patient will not be bothered with additional examinations. Additionally,
      biomaterial (blood) will be drawn routinely and used for the biomarker measurement as well as
      biobanking.
