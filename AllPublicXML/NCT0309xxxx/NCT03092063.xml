  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to construct an adaptive intervention that integrates
      family members and patients as partners in care while promoting diabetes self-management for
      Mexican Americans with Type 2 diabetes. The project incorporates four evidence-based,
      culturally tailored treatments using a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial to
      help determine what sequence of intervention strategies work most efficiently and for whom.

      The project evaluates four culturally adapted, family-based treatments designed to improve
      health status, self-management behaviors and self-efficacy among Mexican-Americans with Type
      2 diabetes using a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial in a public health
      setting. In the first phase of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to six 2.5 hour
      sessions (three months) of either: 1) Tomando Control de su Diabetes (TC), a culturally
      tailored, community-based, Diabetes Self-Management program delivered in a group format by
      community health workers (promotoras) working with individual patients and families; or 2) TC
      delivered by health professionals (licensed nurses). Evaluations will be made at baseline,
      three months, six months and 12 months. After six weeks of treatment (at the midway point of
      the intervention), subjects will be assessed for improvement in diabetes self-management
      behaviors (the primary outcome). In the second phase of the study, those subjects who have
      improved their diabetes self-management behaviors by 50% over baseline will be continued in
      their assigned treatment for the duration of three months. Those subjects who do not meet
      this target will be re-randomized to receive either: 1) an augmented version of TC that has a
      specific focus on engaging family members; or 2) a multifamily group treatment led by nurses
      specially trained in teaching diabetes self-management skills for an additional three months.

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors (Revised Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities)</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at baseline, six weeks, three months, six months and 12 months. The primary outcome is change from baseline as compared to the subsequent assessment points.</time_frame>
    <description>This 11-item scale assesses ADA-recommended health activities in diet, exercise, glucose self-monitoring, medication adherence and foot care. The mean number of days in the past week that activities are performed is calculated on a scale of 0-7; a high mean score indicates better diabetes self-management.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Self-Efficacy (Stanford Self-Efficacy Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at baseline, three months, six months and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-item measure that assesses the confidence of a person with diabetes to manage diet, exercise, knowledge of blood glucose and the illness, and control over diabetes. Scores range from 1-10, from no confidence to totally confident; higher scores indicate greater confidence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes knowledge (Spoken Knowledge in Low Literacy Patients with Diabetes scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at baseline, three months, six months and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This 10-item scale assesses knowledge of glucose management, lifestyle modifications, recognition and treatment of hyper- and hypoglycemia, and activities to prevent long-term consequences of the disease. Correct answers receive a score of 1. Each item score is summed ranging from 0-10, with a high score indicating better knowledge about diabetes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Support (Diabetes Family Support Behavior Checklist)</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at baseline, three months, six months and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This 17-item scale uses a 5-point Likert range to assess perceptions of family member support of the person with T2DM in medication taking, glucose self-monitoring, exercise and diet. Positive and negative items are summed separately and higher scores indicate stronger perception of family support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Collaborative goal setting (Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care)</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome measure will be assessed at baseline, three months, six months and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item patient survey that evaluates the quality and patient centeredness of chronic illness care received according to the Chronic Care Model paradigm. The questionnaire is divided into five subscales to reflect the key components of the Chronic Care Model: patient activation, delivery system design &amp; decision support, goal setting &amp; tailoring, problem-solving &amp; contextual, and follow-up/coordination. Each item has a score from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Patients self-report how often they received specific types of medical care during the past six months.</description>

    <description>Tomando Control de su Diabetes-Nurse is a community-based intervention given in six 2.5 hour sessions. The Spanish-language sessions are led by two trained Registered Nurses. Subjects covered in these sessions include: 1) techniques to deal with the symptoms of diabetes and associated conditions; 2) appropriate exercise; 3) healthy eating; 4) correct use of diabetes medications; and 5) working more effectively with health care providers in a collaborative partnership. Participants make weekly action plans, share experiences, and help each other solve problems they encounter in creating and carrying out their self-management strategies.</description>
