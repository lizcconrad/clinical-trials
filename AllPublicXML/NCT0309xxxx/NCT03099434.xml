  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be a clinical trial to test the feasibility and effectiveness of an
      educational intervention and a mobile health intervention in adults with end stage renal
      disease (ESRD) who have not yet identified a potential live donor.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transplant candidates are hesitant to discuss their illness and the difficulties associated
      with dialysis, and are therefore reluctant to pursue live donor kidney transplant (LDKT). The
      investigators will conduct a prospective 3-arm randomized controlled trial with two novel
      interventions to increase live donation. Arm 1 includes LDC program and the Facebook app, Arm
      2 includes just the Facebook app, and Arm 3 includes standard of care. The investigators
      primary objective is to demonstrate the the effectiveness of these interventions in
      increasing live donor transplantation rates for candidates with no prior potential live
      donor.

    <description>The LDC program consists of 6 monthly sessions of approx. 1 hour each. Each LDC session is led by a transplant physician or clinical coordinator. LDC sessions incorporate formal didactics, active-participant learning, personal stories, moderated group discussions, role-playing, and other skill-building exercises. LDC sessions are as follows: 1) education about ESRD, KT, and LDKT 2) communication skills building 3) Exploring social networks 4) sharing successful donor and recipient stories 5) encouraging candidate self-efficacy. At session 3, the the Facebook app will be incorporated and given to candidates. The Facebook app provides step-by-step instructions for creating a Facebook post that details each waitlist candidate's struggle with ESRD and their need for a live donor. The post is then uploaded to Facebook so it can be shared with the candidate's Facebook social network.</description>

    <description>The Facebook app provides step-by-step instructions for creating a Facebook post that details each waitlist candidate's struggle with ESRD and their need for a live donor. The post is then uploaded to Facebook so it can be shared with the candidate's Facebook social network. The Facebook App prompts users with specific questions to create a narrative. Links to supplemental resources are auto-populated into the post to provide anyone that views the post with vetted information about the risks, benefits, and process of live donation. Candidates using the Facebook app attend one focus group session held at the transplant center where they are provided with verbal instructions and visual demonstrations of installation and use of the Facebook app.</description>

    <description>A &quot;Live Donor Champion&quot; (LDC) is a friend, family member, or community member who serves as an advocate for the candidate in their pursuit of live donation. The investigators have developed a six-month program that provides education and advocacy training to waitlist candidates and their LDCs.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Kidney transplant candidates agedâ‰¥18 added to the waitlist in the last year with no
             potential live donors are eligible.

          -  If there is an individual willing to donate, but the candidate is unwilling to
             consider this option or this particular individual, the candidate is eligible for the
             trial and may still benefit from identification of new donors or increased comfort
             accepting donation from others.

          -  Participants at Johns Hopkins University or University of Alabama must speak English.
             Participants at Northwestern University must speak English or Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Candidates with live donors currently under evaluation for donation will be excluded.

          -  Those with a previous kidney transplant will be excluded
