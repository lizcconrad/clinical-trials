    <description>acupoint selection: Zhengguang 1, Zhengguang 2, GB20, GV14, LI4.
plum-blossom needle manipulation methods: After the skin has been wiped with 75 % alcohol, plum-blossom needles will be tapped perpendicularly on the skin at the selected acupoints with wrist force and then lifted immediately. Each point will be tapped repeatedly for 20 to 50 times and both sides of cervical vertebra and temporal region, Suprao-infraorbital margin will be tapped repeatedly. Acupuncturists should tap the points gently to make patients feel only a little pain and stop when the skin gets flushed but is not bleeding.</description>
