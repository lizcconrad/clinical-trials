      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 milligram
      (mg) compared with intranasal placebo in addition to comprehensive standard of care in
      reducing the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including suicidal ideation, in
      participants who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change
      from baseline on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at 24
      hours post first dose.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 Hours post first dose (Day 2)</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to be used in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) to measure depression severity and detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. The test consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through the end of the double-blind treatment phase (Day 25)</time_frame>
    <description>BHS is a self-reported measure to assess one's level of negative expectations or pessimism regarding the future. It consists of 20 true-false items that examine the respondent's attitude over the past week by either endorsing a pessimistic statement or denying an optimistic statement; 9 are keyed false and 11 are keyed true. For every statement, each response is assigned a score of 0 or 1. The total BHS score is a sum of item responses and can range from 0 to 20, with a higher score representing a higher level of hopelessness. Total scores that range from 0 to 3 are considered within the normal range, scores 4 to 8 identify mild hopelessness, scores 9 to 14 identify moderate hopelessness, and scores greater than 14 identify severe hopelessness.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The participant selects an answer for each of the 5 dimensions considering the response that best matches his or her health &quot;today.&quot; The descriptive system can be represented as a health state. The EQ-VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his or her overall health status at the time of completion, on a scale of 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health). EQ-5D scores include EQ-5D valuation index score (a weighted scoring of the 5 dimension scores with a possible range from 0 to 1) and EQ-5D descriptive system scores (five scores reflecting each of the 5 EQ-5D health dimensions ranging from 1 [no limitation] to 5 [incapacity]).</description>
