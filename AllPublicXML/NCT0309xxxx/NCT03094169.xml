  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 male and female patients with documented solid tumor malignancies of
      epithelial origin that are locally advanced or metastatic, and either refractory to standard
      therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available, will be entered into this Phase 1a/2a,
      multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, cohort study of AVID100.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On Day 1 of study, patients will receive study drug administered by 1-hour IV infusion in a
      fixed 100 mL volume. AVID100 will be administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W) with
      administration on Day 1 of the first week, followed by a 3-week recovery period.

      Evidence of progressive disease at any point in the study will necessitate withdrawal of the
      patient from further participation so that alternative management of their malignancy may be
      considered.

        Inclusion Criteria (Phase 1):

          1. Patients with a documented (histologically- or cytologically-proven) solid tumor
             epithelial carcinoma that is locally advanced or metastatic

          2. Patients with a malignancy that is either refractory to standard therapy, or for which
             no standard therapy is available

          3. Patients with a malignancy that is currently not amenable to surgical intervention due
             to either medical contraindications or non-resectability of the tumor

          4. Phase 1a Dose-Escalation Cohorts: Patients with measurable or non-measurable disease
             according to RECIST, v1.1 criteria. To include patients reasonably likely to express
             EGFR.

        Patients to be Excluded (patients must not meet any of the following criteria Phase 1 only)

          1. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and
             fertile men with WOCBP partner(s), not using and not willing to use a medically
             effective method of contraception.

          2. Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastases, or
             spinal cord compression not controlled by prior surgery or radiotherapy, or patients
             with symptoms suggesting CNS involvement for which treatment is required

          3. Patients with a malignancy other than that of epithelial origin

          4. Patients with hematologic abnormalities at baseline

          5. Patients with a significant cardiovascular disease or condition

          6. Patients with a significant ocular disease or condition

        Drugs and Other Treatments to be Excluded

          1. Any antineoplastic agent for the primary malignancy (standard or investigational),
             without delayed toxicity, within 4 weeks, 5 plasma half-lives, or twice the duration
             of the biological effect, whichever is shortest, prior to first study drug
             administration and during study with the exception of: Nitrosoureas and nitrogen
             mustard within 6 weeks prior to first study drug administration and during study

             medical device or other therapeutic intervention clinical trials.

          3. Radiotherapy for target lesions within 4 weeks prior to first study drug
             administration and during study

          4. Herbal preparations or related over-the-counter (OTC) preparations/supplements
             containing herbal ingredients aimed at treating the underlying malignancy within 2
             weeks prior to first study drug administration and during study

          5. Strong inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 within 2
             weeks prior to first study drug administration and during study

          6. Immunosuppressive or systemic hormonal therapy within 2 weeks prior to first study
             drug administration and during study.

             drug administration and during Cycle 1 of study; thereafter prophylactic use of growth
             factors is allowed as clinically indicated
