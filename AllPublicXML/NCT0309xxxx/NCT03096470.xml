      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of closed reduction with anesthesia and
      no anesthesia for developmental dislocation of the hip &lt; 6 months
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We treated children (&lt;6 months) with prolonged traction before an attempted closed reduction.
      And compare the efficacy of closed reduction with anesthesia and no anesthesia for
      developmental dislocation of the hip. All the patients were followed up for a minimum of 18
      months in order to identify any avascular changes in the femoral head. The presence of
      avascular necrosis was assessed by the criteria of Salter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients with GrafⅢ/Ⅳtype DDH diagnosed by ultrasound or if they were IHDI
             (International Hip Dysplasia Institute) grade III or IV on radiographs，and The infants
             who were &lt;6 months of age. Patients were followed for at least 18 months,by which time
             they had either completed treatment with no evidence of requiring further treatment or
             were treated surgically after failing brace treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants were excluded if they had multiple congenital abnormalities, had prior
             treatment in other centres, or showed teratological dislocations. The last were
             defined as fixed dislocation of the hip in association with either a recognised
             syndrome or a neurological disorder.
