  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study is to identify types of bacteria that reside in the intestine of
      healthy individuals and compare them to individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). There has
      been a lot of research in other autoimmune diseases which has demonstrated the importance of
      stomach &quot;gut&quot; bacteria because it has an important relationship with the immune system, but
      this has never been studied in MS patients. In this study investigators aim to show
      differences in the gut bacteria between healthy individuals and those with MS, to provide a
      basis for future research studying how diet can affect MS through its effects on the &quot;gut&quot;
      bacteria.

      Additionally, this study will be looking at the effects of dimethyl fumarate on cerebrospinal
      fluid, plasma and MRI in MS patients taking dimethyl fumarate as compared to those with MS
      not on dimethyl fumarate or other disease modifying therapy and those who do not have MS
      (normal controls).
