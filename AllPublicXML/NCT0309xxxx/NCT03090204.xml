  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The analysis of the systolic function (contractility) of the right ventricle (RV) is
      fundamental and central in many pathologies in intensive care unit. It can guide physicians
      in choosing therapeutics. The conventional ultrasound markers of RV function evaluation
      currently used are influenced by RV loading conditions, impairing their capacity to
      approximate a true contractility analysis. Myocardial strain imaging is a recent echographic
      technique that allows, among other things, to evaluate RV systolic function. It is a
      reproducible index with early variations which, if it proved to be independent pre-load,
      would help to better appreciate the RV contractility.
