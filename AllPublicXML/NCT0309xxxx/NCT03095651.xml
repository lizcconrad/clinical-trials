  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, active- and placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of MK-5160 in
      participants with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This
      is a two-part trial, with three panels per part. T1DM (Part 1) and T2DM (Part 2) participants
      will be given daily fixed doses of MK-5160 in three predefined, increasing doses in each
      panel, or glargine (active comparator). The primary hypothesis of the trial is that at a dose
      with sufficient safety, the mean steady-state maximum level of glucose infusion rate (GIRmax)
      after MK-5160 administration in both T1DM and T2DM participants is between 1.5 and 4.5
      mg/kg/min.
