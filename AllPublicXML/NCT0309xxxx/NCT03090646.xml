  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in whether or not the use of a small financial incentive
      (gift card) increases the rate of follow-up compliance among live kidney donors. The
      investigators aim to test this by randomly assigning live kidney donors to the intervention
      (gift card at time of follow-up visit) or control arm (standard of care) upon discharge from
      their initial kidney donation hospitalization, and tracking follow-up compliance over time.
      The study population will be approximately 320 live kidney donors who undergo donor
      nephrectomy at Johns Hopkins Hospital (80/year for 4 years).

      Background and Scientific Rationale:

      Live kidney donors provide nearly 1/3 of the kidneys used for transplantation in the United
      States each year. While the surgical procedure for live donation poses minimal immediate risk
      to the donor, live donation has been associated with increased risk for development of
      chronic disease including hypertension and kidney disease. A meta-analysis of 5,145 live
      kidney donors demonstrated a larger increase in blood pressure than would be expected with
      normal aging. Preliminary data from the investigators' research groups recently demonstrated
      that the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at fifteen years post donation was 30.8
      per 10,000 donors compared to just 3.9 per 10,000 matched healthy non-donors. Utilization of
      healthcare resources plays an important role in the mitigation of chronic disease, and has
      the potential to effect development of chronic conditions in live donors. Kidney donors are a
      unique population. They are otherwise healthy individuals who have lost half of their renal
      mass and are at risk for long-term sequelae. As such, donors cannot be treated as healthy
      adults, and require greater surveillance following donation.

      There are over 5,500 new live kidney donors entering the organ transplant system each year,
      but centers have had historically poor follow-up. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation
      Network/United Network for Organ Sharing (OPTN/UNOS) has collected follow-up data on live
      kidney donors, including serum creatinine, blood pressure, and body mass index at 6 months
      and 1 year post donation since 1999. However, approximately half of live kidney donors had
      incomplete 1 year follow-up data and one-third were lost to follow-up. Results from a
      national survey in 2010 found that 40% of centers lost contact with more than 75% of donors
      by 2 years post-donation. By 2011, national efforts were underway to improve live donor
      follow-up, and in 2013, the OPTN implemented a national policy to improve follow-up by
      requiring transplant centers to reach certain thresholds for collecting and recording data on
      live kidney donors over time. Over the course of the last few years, compliance thresholds
      have increased, and OPTN now requires that 80% of clinical data (presence of hypertension,
      diabetes, dialysis, kidney related complications, recent hospitalizations, medical insurance
      status, income, and vital status) and 70% of laboratory data (serum creatinine and urine
      protein) are recorded and submitted for live kidney donors.

      Financial incentivization has been employed in other realms of healthcare to change
      health-related behaviors, encourage compliance with medications and to ultimately improve
      health outcomes. Monetary rewards have been shown to be associated with higher rates of
      abstinence from smoking at 6 months. However, other randomized clinical trials evaluating
      efficacy of lottery-based incentives showed benefit in only subgroups of patients who were at
      higher risk for poor adherence at baseline. While there is research demonstrating the
      benefits of lottery-based incentive schemes vs direct monetary incentives in raising
      participation among workers providing health risk assessments, the participation rates were
      still quite low even in the best groups (64% vs 40%).

      Rationale:

      With historically poor follow-up and increased risk for development of chronic diseases
      related to the loss of renal mass, live kidney donors are a vulnerable group in need of
      intervention to prevent poor outcomes. As transplant centers strive for follow-up compliance
      of 80%, new and creative incentives have a role in increasing compliance rates in this
      population. However, given the uncertainty of the impact of monetary incentives in the
      literature, the investigators believe it best to perform a randomized controlled trial of
      incentivization for live kidney donation follow-up compliance prior to implementing a
      center-wide action that would provide incentivization for every patient.

      The investigators hypothesize that live kidney donors who receive small-amount gift cards
      following completion of each follow-up requirement will have higher rates of follow-up than
      those patients who are not incentivized.

      Potential Risks and Benefits:

      There is a risk that information about the participants could become known. However, this
      risk is minimal, as all data gathered will be kept completely confidential to the best of the
      ability of the research team. Participant names and other identifying information will be
      known by the fewest number of personnel possible in order to carry out the study, and data
      will be de-identified prior to analysis in order to limit risk of exposure of protected
      health information.

      There is no direct benefit from study participation, other than the small-amount incentives
      themselves for those in the intervention arm.

      Participation in the study would help providers, patients, and future live kidney donors by
      contributing to the potential increase in follow-up for live kidney donors.

      Objectives and Purpose:

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the rate of follow-up compliance of live
      kidney donors receiving small-amount gift card incentives to the rate of those who do not
      receive an incentive. The investigators will compare rate of follow-up at 6 months, 1 year,
      and 2 years between intervention and control arms.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of these small incentives on overall
      compliance in the comprehensive transplant center, reaching the goal OPTN threshold of 80%
      clinical and 70% laboratory compliance for living kidney donors.

      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the utility of small-amount gift cards in both
      meeting national standards on a center-level, and to increase the provision of high-quality
      follow-up care to live-kidney donors.
