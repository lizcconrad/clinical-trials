  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess diagnostic predictive values of a light induced
      fluorescence intraoral camera versus those of the visual-tactile assessment method according
      to FDI criteria in clinical evaluation the margins of resin composite restorations
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient should have at least one resin composite restoration. The restoration will be
      evaluated by two diagnostic methods.

      Each examiner will record the dental findings using both the visual- tactile assessment
      method and the fluorescent-aided identification method. The visual-tactile assessment method
      includes the use of mirror, FDI probe under good illumination condition, while the
      fluorescent-aided identification method will be performed by light induced fluorescence
      intraoral camera then the reliability of each diagnostic tool will be assessed.
