  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is being done to adapt an effective 1 session phone coaching intervention
      for nonsmoking support persons to a low income population. This study will also pilot new
      intervention components including text messaging and health incentives. The goal of the
      intervention is for support persons to prompt their smoker to use quitline services. To see
      if these methods are effective, smokers in this study will be asked to complete assessments
      about their quit attempts and smoking status. The study will also evaluate if the smokers use
      quitline services or not. The preliminary findings will be used to provide data for an R01
      NIH grant submission.

    <textblock>
      This is a proposal to conduct a pilot study to adapt an effective 1 session phone coaching
      intervention for nonsmoking support persons to a low income population. The study will also
      pilot new intervention components including text messaging and health incentives. The goal of
      the intervention is for support persons to prompt their smoker to use quitline services. The
      study will also build on prior work by enrolling smokers for assessments of quit attempts and
      smoking abstinence. The study uses a non-randomized, single group design. Thirty
      nonsmoker-smoker dyads will be enrolled in three waves of 10 each. The nonsmokers will
      receive different intervention components depending on the time of their enrollment.
      Nonsmokers will complete assessments at baseline and at 1 month follow-up. Smokers will be
      enrolled for assessments only at baseline and 3 month follow-up. The vendor for the Minnesota
      state quitline, Alere Wellbeing Inc. (a sole subsidiary of Optum) will track if smokers use
      quitline services over 3 months of follow-up. The aims of this pilot study are to: (1) Assess
      the feasibility of enrolling low income, racially diverse nonsmoker-smoker dyads; (2) Adapt
      and refine the support person intervention components to a low income population with
      feedback from the nonsmoker participants; and (3) Assess the feasibility of obtaining
      assessments from the smokers on quit attempts and smoking abstinence outcomes. The
      preliminary findings will be used to provide data for an R01 NIH grant submission.
