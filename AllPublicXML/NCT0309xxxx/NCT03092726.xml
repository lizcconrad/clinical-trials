  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess analgesic efficacy of ASP8062 relative to placebo as
      well as the safety and tolerability. This study will also assess the treatment differences in
      physical function as well the improvements in overall subject status (e.g., fibromyalgia
      symptoms, global functioning) of ASP8062 relative to placebo.
