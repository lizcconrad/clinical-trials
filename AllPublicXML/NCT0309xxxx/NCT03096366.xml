  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy (PT) plus BFR
      training compared to PT alone (without BFR training) after ACL reconstruction in patients who
      require extended limited weight bearing through assessment of patient reported outcomes and
      functional testing. The hypothesis is that PT plus BFR training will mitigate the loss of
      quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area, strength, and function while also improving early
      clinical and functional results.
