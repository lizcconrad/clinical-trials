  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed research is to extend our understanding of how gesture and
      language interact, focusing on the role of cognitive embodiment in this interaction, and to
      explore the neural systems that support links between language and actions systems.

    <description>Attentional load task: Participants are presented with a 6 positions ring that includes different shapes, they have to press V when they see a square and N when they see a diamond. They will have to ignore any shapes other than square and diamond within the ring or distractors that appear outside the ring.
