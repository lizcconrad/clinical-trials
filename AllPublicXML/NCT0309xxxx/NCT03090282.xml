  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators planed to observe the microbiome of an aggressive periodontitis patient,
      during mechanical treatment, surgery(if indicated) and implant placement. The investigators
      designed to observe the changes after mechanical treatment.Then, the investigators will
      compare the sub-mucosa microbiome of implant and the subgingival community. The investigators
      expected a different community after treatment, and there could be similarity between implant
      and nature teeth.
