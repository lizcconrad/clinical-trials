      This study compared efficacy and safety of basic triple therapy including Noltec(Ilaprazole)
      10mg, Clapaxine(Clarithromycin) 500mg and Pamoxin Cap(Amoxicillin) 1000mg BID on the first
      line eradication treatment of H.pylori according to treatment period.

      Participants are defined as persons who have endoscopically confirmed on gastric or duodenal
      ulcer(including scar stage) and gastritis confirmed to be H.pylori positive patients in the
      UBT test. For 7 days or 10 days Participants treated as basic triple therapy including
      Noltec(Ilaprazole) 10mg, Clapaxine(Clarithromycin) 500mg and Pamoxin Cap(Amoxicillin) 1000mg
      BID. After treatment, The healing rate was evaluated in the UBT test at 49±5days from the
      first day dosing. The investigators would point out the impact of CYP2C19 genotypes on
      Clarythromycin-based first-line and rescue therapies.
