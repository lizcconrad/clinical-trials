    <textblock>
      The study aims to exam whether sinew acupuncture can relieve pain and symptoms of KOA and
      improve functional movement by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMasters
      University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Timed up &amp; Go Test (TUG) and 8-step Stair Climb Test
      (SCT) assessment, and Quality of life by Short Form-36 (SF-36). A randomized, sham
      acupuncture controlled, patient and assessor blinded, pilot study will be employed.

      Objective:

      The proposal aims to examine the efficacy and safety of sinew acupuncture for knee
      osteoarthritis (KOA).

      Hypothesis to be tested:

      Sinew acupuncture can reduce pain intensity, and improve knee function and health-related
      quality of life without significant side effects for KOA subjects compared to a sham
      acupuncture.

      Design:

      A randomized, subject- and assessor-blind, sham acupuncture-controlled clinical trial

      Participants:

      Subjects (N=86) will be randomized into sinew acupuncture or sham acupuncture group (in 1:1
      ratio).

      Study instrument:

      Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC), Timed up &amp; Go Test (TUG), 8-step Stair Climb Test (SCT) assessment, and the Short
      Form-36 (SF-36).

      Intervention:

      Sinew acupuncture group will receive 10 sessions of needling in 4 weeks. Sham group will
      receive the non-invasive intervention with the same procedures. All subjects are followed up
      for 6 weeks.

      Main outcome measures:

      VAS for knee pain intensity at week 4 serves as the primary outcome. VAS at other time
      points, WOMAC score, TUG, SCT and SF-36 will be analyzed as the secondary outcomes.

      Data analysis:

      Analysis will be on the 'intention to treat' principle. T-test and mixed-effect model
      analysis will be used to measure primary and secondary outcomes respectively.

      Expected results:

      Sinew acupuncture treatment can significantly reduce knee pain intensity, and improve knee
      function and quality of life without obvious side effects.

    <description>Sinew acupuncture: subject will sit on chair with knee joint flexion with a most comfortable angle nearest to 90 degrees. Acupoints (1-2cm away from the point of tenderness or pain) near the knee will be punctured through the skin by using sterile needles of size 0.30mm Ã— 40mm at the angle of 0-10 degrees pointing along the pain direction and meridian sinew. Immediately, needles will be retreated back just under the skin and inserted 10mm-20mm forward smoothly with minimal pain sensation. Walking and stepping will be advised and governed during acupuncture. The acupoint will be covered with non-allergic bandages to ensure sufficient blinding to the subject. The treatment will last 20 minutes for each session.</description>
