      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for multiple
      myeloma.

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Trametinib

        -  Dabrafenib

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study drug in this disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs is
      being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not
      approved the drugs for your type of cancer.

      The FDA has not approved Trametinib or Dabrafenib for your specific disease but they have
      been approved for other uses.

      Some cancers have changes (mutations) in a gene called BRAF or other genes, called KRAS or
      NRAS. These three genes tell the body to make a protein called BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS,
      respectively, which are all involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell
      growth. Certain mutations in these three genes cause a change in these proteins that can
      increase the growth and spread of cancer cells.

      Dabrafenib and trametinib work to prevent these altered proteins from working and sending
      signals in cancer cells, and thereby may block the growth and spread of cancer cells in
      people with cancers with BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS gene mutations. Dabrafenib and trametinib have
      been used in the treatment for other cancers in other research studies, and information from
      those research studies suggest that these agents may help to kill multiple myeloma cells.

      Dabrafenib and trametinib, which are investigated in this research study may or may not kill
      myeloma cells effectively. We would like to see if these drugs given alone or in combination
      safely and effectively kill these cancer cells.

             study participation and for 4 months after the last dose of study treatment. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A pregnancy test is not
             required for female participants over age 60 who have been postmenopausal for at least

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor or a MEK inhibitor. Treatment by localized
             radiotherapy is not an exclusion criterion if an interval of at least two weeks
             between the end of radiotherapy and initiation of protocol therapy is observed.

          -  Primary amyloidosis (AL) or myeloma complicated by amyloidosis

          -  Nonsecretory multiple myeloma based upon standard M-component criteria (ie, measurable

             be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.

          -  A history or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following:

               -  A QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Bazett's formula (QTcB; Appendix
                  E) ≥ 480 msec;

                  entered on study.

               -  Treatment refractory hypertension defined as a blood pressure of systolic&gt; 140

             study procedures.

          -  A history of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection (subjects
             with laboratory evidence of cleared HBV and/or HCV will be permitted.

             subjects with indolent second malignancies.

          -  Female participants pregnant or breast-feeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this
             study because dabrafenib, and trametinib may have teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the study drugs. Dabrafenib was
             teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human
             exposure at the recommended clinical dose.

          -  A history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)

          -  History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis

          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             dabrafenib and trametinib. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to the study treatments, their excipients, and/or dimethyl
             sulfoxide (DMSO).
