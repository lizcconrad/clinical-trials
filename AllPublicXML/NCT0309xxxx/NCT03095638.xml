  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this cross-over study is to compare the relative bioavailability and
      pharmacokinetic parameters of both 10 mg conventional tablets and 5 mg dispersible tablets of
      dolutegravir (DTG) with that of 25 mg or 50 mg conventional DTG tablets. The study will be
      carried out in 2 parts. Part 1 of the study will be open-label, 2 period designs with a wash
      out period of at least 7 days between the dosing periods. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive either single dose of five 10 mg DTG tablets or one 50 mg DTG tablet in a crossover
      manner in the fasting state. Part 2 of the study will be a 3 period crossover design with a
      wash out period of at least 7 days between the dosing periods. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive either single dose of five 5 mg DTG tablets (administered as dispersed with water or
      directly to mouth) or one 25 mg DTG tablet in a crossover manner in the fasting state.
      Subjects will have a follow-up visit 7-10 days post last dose of study treatment.
      Approximately 14 healthy subjects will participate in Part 1 and approximately 24 healthy
      subjects will participate in Part 2 of the study. The total duration of Part 1 will be
      approximately 7 to 8 weeks and that of part 2 will be approximately 8 to 9 weeks.
