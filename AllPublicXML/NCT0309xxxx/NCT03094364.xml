  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive intensive therapy through a video game in their own homes for 1
      month. The game is operated by movements of the body (no controller needed) and acts like a
      virtual therapist. Participants will agree to play the game for 30 hours. They will also
      receive 4 home visits from a therapist designed to increase use of their arm for daily
      activities that are important to them. Participants will also receive a smart watch that will
      measure use of their weaker arm and alert them when their arm is not participating in
      activities. Arm strength and function will be measured before and after the therapy program.

      Randomized waitlist control trial. One group will receive treatment immediately (50%) and the
      other group will receive treatment following a three-week delay (50%). Group 1 will be
      assessed by physical/occupational therapists and rehabilitation psychologists (blinded to
      treatment phase) before and after the virtual gaming treatment. Group 2 will receive two
      baseline assessments (baseline followed by three weeks of usual and customary care and then
      another baseline before starting the gaming treatment), and again after three weeks of
      virtual gaming treatment.

    <description>Patients will receive an in-home consultation with an occupational/physical therapist in which they are educated about the intervention, the system is set up, and they are guided through use of the system. After initial contact, therapist support will be available via telephone to address specific difficulties with operating the system, as well as three additional home visits throughout the 3 week intervention.
The rehabilitation program requires use of the rehabilitation gaming system for 1.5 hours daily for 21 consecutive days (equivalent dosage to standard CI therapy), limb activation device worn for 90% of waking hours, and completion of the automated transfer package to facilitate real-world arm use (e.g., problem-solving modules, daily monitoring of arm use). After completing the intervention, the patient will receive additional consultation with the therapist to formulate goals for follow-up. Follow-up assessments will be conducted to assess long-term retention of motor gains.</description>
