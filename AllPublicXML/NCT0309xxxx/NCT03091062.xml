      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an Airway Clearance System.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the effectiveness of The Monarch™ System and The Vest® Airway
      Clearance System. All subjects will receive treatment with both systems and endpoints will be
      compared.

    <measure>Wet Weight of Sputum Produced</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the wet weight of total sputum that is produced as a result of each of two therapy sessions. The total wet weight includes the wet weight of sputum collected each 30-minute therapy session + the wet weight of sputum collected during a 1-hour collection period following each therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Respiratory Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Respiratory Imaging will be completed utilizing CT scans. The CT scans are to be completed before airway clearance therapy on each day and after the one-hour sputum collection following the airway clearance therapy (a minimum of one hour following completion of the airway clearance therapy).</description>

    <measure>Lung Clearance Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of how much ventilation is required to completely clear the full residual capacity using the Inert Gas Multi-Breath Washout method completed pre- and post-therapy -- before the airway clearance therapy on each day and after the one-hour sputum collection following the airway clearance therapy (a minimum of one hour following completion of the airway clearance therapy).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective satisfaction surveys</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with therapy will be assessed post therapy. (survey will be completed a minimum of one hour following completion of the airway clearance therapy).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory spirometry maneuvers will be completed before and after therapy. -- before the airway clearance therapy on each day and after the one-hour sputum collection following the airway clearance therapy (a minimum of one hour following completion of the airway clearance therapy).</description>

    <intervention_name>Vest® Airway Clearance System</intervention_name>
    <description>High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) therapy is commonly prescribed to provide routine airway clearance in patients with a need for regular airway clearance therapy. HFCWO generates high velocity expiratory airflow that is thought to mobilize secretions by the sheer force created.</description>

    <description>Generates airflow at frequencies similar to those provided by HFCWO and also provides direct percussive therapy.</description>
