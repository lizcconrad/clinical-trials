  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use video technology in conjunction with in-person participation. This is a
      pilot project, where all enrolled participants will receive the multidisciplinary
      intervention. Participants (patients and caregivers) from Mayo Clinic Rochester will attend
      an in-person group session, and participants (patients and caregivers) from Mayo Clinic
      Florida or Northfield Mayo Clinic Radiation Oncology Center will participate through the use
      of video conferencing. The goals are to examine feasibility (percent of eligible patients and
      caregivers who enroll), attrition, and adherence (attend at least four of the six sessions),
      to determine any differences between the two formats, and to examine potential QOL
      differences as a result of the intervention.
