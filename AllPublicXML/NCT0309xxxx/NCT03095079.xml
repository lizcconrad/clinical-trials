    <textblock>
      The incidence of Melanoma is rapidly growthing,and in China,dacarbazine combined with
      cisplatin is conmendly used as the first-line chemotherapy of metastatic melanoma. But the
      response rate and survival results are very limited.This trial aim to add a safe and
      effective anti-angiogenesis drug,Human-recombinant endostatin,to find out a new strategy
      which may further extend the PFS and OS with a tolerated toxicity.
