  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to comprehensively investigate and objectively demonstrate the
      effectiveness of hyperdiltue Botox® Cosmetic in improving overall skin quality, more
      specifically evenness of skin tone, reduction of pore size and improvement in the appearance
      of preexisting skin scars.

      The purpose of this study is to comprehensively investigate and objectively demonstrate the
      effectiveness of hyperdiltue Botox® Cosmetic in improving overall skin quality, more
      specifically evenness of skin tone, reduction of pore size and improvement in the appearance
      of preexisting skin scars. The ability of hyperdilute Botox® Cosmetic to improve overall skin
      quality is likely optimized when it is injected uniformly in hyper-diluted small aliquots in
      order to &quot;saturate&quot; the dermis. We propose to prepare Botox® Cosmetic in a manner that is
      approximately 4 times more dilute compared to the typical Botox® Cosmetic preparation. A 4x4
      centimeter area located in the mid-cheek adjacent to the nose will be injected with
      hyperdilute Botox® Cosmetic. Botox® Cosmetic is not FDA-approved for this use. A maximum of
      15 subjects will participate in this study, all of whom will receive injections of Botox®
      Cosmetic during the course of this study.

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-masked study. This means neither
      the study doctor nor participant know the experimental agent (e.g., 0.9% saline solution and
      hyperdiluted Botox® Cosmetic) injected on each side of the patients' faces. The study will
      last for a total of 75 days. Evaluation of the study is based on the analysis of photographic
      images obtained during the study.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a longitudinal study in which patients will be initially treated with hyper-diluted Botox Cosmetic in the superficial dermis or they will be treated 0.9% saline. Then, on day 30 of the study patients initially treated with hyper diluted Botox Cosmetic will be treated with saline and patients initially treated with saline will be treated with hyper-diluted botox.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>An evaluation of the percent improvement in skin quality when the &quot;Onabotulinum Toxin Type A&quot; treated side of face is compared to the &quot;placebo&quot; treated side of the face. Good skin quality is defined as small pore size, evenness of skin texture, evenness of skin tone, minimal presence of wrinkles, and minimal presence of scars. We will measure improvement primarily by image analysis of the photos taken during each visit using the Canfield Scientific camera (or the Allergan provided alternative).</description>
