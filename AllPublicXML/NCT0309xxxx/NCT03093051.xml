      This observation study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of UPT therapy in subjects
      during either an indicated ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure or an ICD implant
      procedure.

      This non-blinded, single-arm open-label, non-significant risk, phase 1 pilot, acute research
      feasibility trial aims to demonstrate that the safety and effectiveness of Unpinning
      Termination (UPT) electrotherapy observed in the canine can be translated to humans and to
      demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of UPT electrotherapy in the human population most
      likely to benefit from this therapy. This observation study evaluates the safety and
      effectiveness of UPT therapy in subjects during either an indicated ventricular tachycardia
      (VT) catheter ablation or an indicated initial implant or device replacement of an
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).
