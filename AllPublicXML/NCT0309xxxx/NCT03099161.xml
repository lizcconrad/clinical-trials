  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of preladenant
      alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (pembro) in participants with advanced solid
      tumors that have not responded to prior therapy. This study will be done in 2 parts. Part 1
      will identify and confirm the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of preladenant when given
      alone or in combination with pembrolizumab. Part 2 of the study will determine the safety and
      efficacy of preladenant in combination with pembrolizumab at the RP2D in participants with
      select solid tumors .

    <description>During an initial dose evaluation phase, participants will receive dose A, B, C, D of preladenant on Day 1 of each infusion cycle (for a maximum of 35 cycles) until the RPTD has been established. The RPTD will be established based on the number of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at each dose level. Once the RPTD is established, participants will continue receiving the RPTD of preladenant on Day 1 of each infusion cycle until the 35-cycle limit is reached.</description>

The RPTD will be established based on the number of DLTs at each dose level.
