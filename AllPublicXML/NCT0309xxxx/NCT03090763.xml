  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish whether patients with aortic aneurysm, compared
      to general population, have higher levels of selected miRNAs and whether there is significant
      association between the level of miRNA in circulating blood and the size of the aortic
      aneurysm or the risk of its rupture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysm of the abdominal and thoracic aorta represents a major cause of cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality. The course of this condition can stay asymptomatic for long, and its
      first manifestation can be acute rupture of the aneurysm sac with life-threatening bleeding.
      Detection of patients at risk and their early treatment significantly reduce the percentage
      of this potentially lethal complications.

      Aortic diseases are most often degenerative processes with a varying involvement of genetic
      predisposition. In literature, a substantial number of genes were proved to affect the
      metabolism of the vessel wall and to determine production of structural proteins, which were
      associated with the vascular pathologies. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of lesions of the
      aortic wall have not been completely understood. Among other, they include endothelial
      dysfunction, chronic inflammation of the vessel wall, apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and
      degradation of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the loss of integrity of layers of the
      vessel wall and decrease in its strength, which leads to dilation, rupture or dissection.
      Apart from mutations in genes coding the structural proteins of the vessel wall, many other
      potential biomarkers were proposed for early diagnosis of aortic aneurysm. These include
      microRNA (miRNA), one-fibre chains of non-coding ribonucleic acid which are several
      nucleotides long and are involved in the gene expression through the mechanism of inhibition
      of mRNA translation or increase in its degradation. Recently, association of levels of these
      miRNAs to presence and growth of aortic aneurysms has been described.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Study population</arm_group_label>
    <description>100 Subjects followed in our department for the diagnosis of aortic aneurysm. On admission, the demographic data (see Appendix 1) will be recorded. Furthermore, within the routine clinically indicated laboratory samples, the levels of selected biochemical markers will be recorded (see Appendix 1). Follow up control laboratory will be performed one year, again within the routine samples.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Control population</arm_group_label>
    <description>The control population also includes 100 subjects in total. These will be chosen from aged and sex matched individuals seen in our clinic without disease of the aorta. All subjects included in trial must be at least 18 years old and must sign the informed consent to participation in the study. In the control population, also demographic data will be obtained and the levels of selected biochemical markers will be recorded within the routine clinically indicated laboratory samples.</description>

    <description>Blood will be subsequently added into a test tube containing RNA solution of a stabilizer, necessary for preservation of the circulating miRNAs. Subsequently, centrifugation will be performed in a cooled centrifuge and the material thus processed will be kept for the subsequent isolation. The isolation of miRNA will be performed using the High Pure miRNA Isolation Kit (Roche, Basel, CHE) according to the manufacturer's standardized procedure. Presence and quality of the miRNA isolated will be spectrophotometrically confirmed using the NanoDrop device (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). By means of the data available in the on-line gene data basis, primers that are necessary for amplification of miRNA through the RT-PCR method using fluorescent dyes will be suggested.</description>
