  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the feasibility of processes and instruments with an overarching purpose to
      guide the design of a larger study. To determine the feasibility of individuals with
      metastatic brain tumor(s) to engage in physical activity(PA) and cognitive rehabilitation
      (CR) as in an outpatient therapy setting.

    <textblock>
      Rolling recruitment for the study. Participants will be randomized into one of three
      treatment arms. All treatment arms will undergo physical &amp; cognitive testing prior to
      whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT)/stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Arm 3 will receive
      cognitive rehabilitation intervention sessions prior to, and concurrent with, WBRT/SRS.
      Approximately 14 days following WBRT/SRS: all arms will undergo physical and cognitive
      testing, and: Arm 1 will begin physical activity intervention. Arm 2 will begin physical
      activity intervention and cognitive intervention. Arm 3 will continue with cognitive
      intervention and begin physical activity intervention. All Arms will undergo physical and
      cognitive testing approximately 2.5 months post WBRT/SRS.

Negative scores indicate declined cognition. Composite scores derived from the following four standardized tests:
The Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT) is a 3-part measure that tests the executive function area of attention.
The Trail Making Test (TMT) is a 2-part measure that tests the executive function area of complex attention.
The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) is a 6-part measure that tests the executive function area of memory.
The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is a single measure that tests the executive function area of visuospatial relationships and praxis.</description>
