  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aim to assess the effect of an interactive web decision aid on informed
      choice - measured via knowledge, attitudes and intentions concerning breast cancer screening
      - comparing the decision aid with a standard information provided via web.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In Italy, women are invited to a
      population-based mammography screening programme for the first time at the age of 45 or 50
      years. Results from randomised controlled trials, observational studies, and systematic
      reviews continuously fuel the debate on the balance on benefits (reducing breast cancer
      mortality) and harms (overdiagnosis, overtreatment) of mammography screening. Physicians,
      policy makers, as well as laypeople or patient associations agree on the need to inform women
      about the potential benefits and harms in order to allow an aware decision process. Decision
      aids are an effective way to support lay people in their decisions about health.

    <measure>Knowledge measured using a questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>7-10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge will be measured using a questionnaire structured in 13 questions with multiple choice answers, with 2 to 4 options. Ten questions will be qualitative and 3 will be numerical. A score of 8 out of 13 (about 60%) or higher would be considered &quot;adequate knowledge&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitude measured through a scale</measure>
    <time_frame>7-10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Attitude will be measured through a scale of 6 items with 5 response options from 1 to 5, with a total score from 6 to 30. The investigators set the threshold for a positive attitude at 24 and consequently the score &lt;24 point a negative attitude.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention measured using 1 item with 5 responses</measure>
    <time_frame>7-10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Intention will be measured using 1 item with 5 responses: Definitely will, Likely to, Unsure, Not likely to, Definitely will not. The investigators classified &quot;definitely will&quot; and &quot;likely to&quot; as positive intentions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participation rate to the breast cancer screening programme</measure>
    <time_frame>15-60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participation rate to the breast cancer screening programme will be assessed as a percentage of women who actually participate, both in intervention and in the control group.</description>

    <description>Web platform with a multilevel information and an aid for the decision to be taken. The content is splitted in 16-20 screens; each screen contains the answer to a common question (i.e. What is mammography screening? What are its benefits and harms? What results can be expected from the participation to mammography screening? What is breast cancer?). The information covers also controversial topics as overdiagnosis, overtreatment and the disagreement among scientists about harms and benefits' quantification.</description>
