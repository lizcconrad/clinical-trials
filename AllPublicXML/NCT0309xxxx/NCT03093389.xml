  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the tolerability and safety of four multiple-dose regimens of BIA 6-512 (25
      mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg 6 times daily) in healthy volunteers and to characterise the
      steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg 6 times
      daily) in healthy volunteers.

      Single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of four multiple-rising
      doses in four sequential groups of 10 healthy volunteers each. Eligible subjects were
      admitted to the UFH on the day (Day 0) prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.
      On the morning of the next day (Day 1), subjects started receiving BIA 6-512/Placebo at 4 h
      intervals (6 times/day) for 48 h (13 investigational product administrations, in total).
      Subjects remained confined in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last
      dose (Day 4); then, they were discharged and were requested to return for the follow-up
      visit. At given time-points, subjects were submitted to vital signs recording, brief
      neurological examination, and 12-lead ECG. Blood samples for plasma drug assays were taken at
      the following times: Dose 1: pre-dose and ¼, ½, ¾, 1, 1½, 2, and 3 hours post-dose; Doses 2,
      3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11: pre-dose; Dose 13: pre-dose and ¼, ½, ¾, 1, 1½, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
      16 and 24 hours post-dose.

Products were administered orally, with approximately 240 mL of water in case of Doses 1 and 13, and at least 150 mL of water in case of Doses 2 to 12. First dose (Dose 1) and last dose (Dose 13) were administered in fasting of at least 8 hours and subject remained fasted until to 2.5 h post-dose.
