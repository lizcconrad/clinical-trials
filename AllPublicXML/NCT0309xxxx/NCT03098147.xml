    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms(LUTS) are the main symptoms of benign prostatic
      hyperplasia(BPH), a benign but progressive disease which can advance to be with overactive
      bladder(OAB) symptoms. Moreover, LUTS and OAB symptoms can badly influence patients'
      especially the elderly's quality of life. Therefore, it appears to be urge to carry out
      researches on the functional impairment of bladder along with the advance of BPH. Besides,
      the management aimed at improving the LUTS and OAB symptoms come to be the key one among the
      management of BPH. For a long period, medication and surgery sustain to be the two most
      common therapies for BPH patients. Both patients and urologists prefer pharmacotherapeutics
      to surgery，which contributes to the rising number of BPH patients companied with OAB symptoms
      and storing symptoms complaint post-surgery. In fact, investigators usually find bladder
      impairment macroscopically in the BPH surgery: mild may be the trabeculation, worse can be
      the cabin, and severe may be the diverticula. Furthermore, it's not uncommon that patients
      with a long BPH history continually suffer from dysuria after surgery due to the detrusor
      muscle weakness. Consequently, investigators need to catch a moment when investigators should
      operate on such a patient in order to harvest a satisfying outcome. And perhaps the moment
      should be ahead of the existing guideline suggests. Thus, for understanding the influence of
      BPH on bladder function, investigators plan to conduct a prospective, case-control study
      recruiting in-patients with different degree of obstruction. Our team wish that such a
      clinical trail could provide valuable evidence for us to find out relatively better operating
      timing and serial indications. For the purpose of improving the quality of life and prolong
      life-span, investigators design the study above to maximum the operating outcome and minimize
      the bladder dysfunction.
