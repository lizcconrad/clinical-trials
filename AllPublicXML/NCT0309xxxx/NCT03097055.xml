      This study will have acupuncture intervention in acute ischemic stroke patients and evaluate
      the effect in neurological function improving by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
      (NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index, and antiinflammatory actions by
      biomarkers.

      Acupuncture Treatment in Stroke is a widely practiced in Taiwan, mainland China, and around
      the world. The using in stroke group is countless. Numerous clinical trials have been
      conducted in the medical community to assess efficacy, and the results mostly suggest that
      acupuncture may be an effective, low side effects adjuvant therapy. Ischemic stroke is also
      associated with chronic inflammation-related diseases. In recent years, the anti-inflammatory
      effect of acupuncture was gradually found. So, whether in the basic or in clinical, the
      investigators can deduce that acupuncture may be helpful for stroke as an adjuvant therapy.

      This study evaluates the neurological function of patients with acute stroke by using the
      widely used National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)
      and Barthel Index. Also, the investigators assess the degree of inflammation by biomarkers.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the effect of acupuncture intervention on
      acute ischemic patients and its relationship in anti-inflammatory actions.
