      Identify individuals with greater absorption of oxalate based on increase in urinary oxalate
      excretion in response to a controlled oxalate-rich test meal.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective uncontrolled study in subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria. Subjects
      will visit the research center three times for outpatient visits (Screening, Test Day 3, Day
      4).

      Subjects will perform three 24-hour urine collections during Screening, Baseline Day 2, and
      Test Day 3. Test Day 3 includes the oxalate-rich test meal and the subject will collect a
      24-hour urine separated into 4 urine collection intervals that are timed in relation to the
      oxalate-rich test meal (Pre-test meal, 4-hr and 6-hr post test meal and remaining time to
      24-hours).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or non-pregnant and non-lactating females

          -  History of hyperoxaluria secondary to a known underlying enteric disease (e.g.,
             Crohn's disease, bariatric surgery, and others) or without a known underlying cause
             (idiopathic), and kidney stones.

          -  Urinary oxalate â‰¥ 40 mg of oxalate/24-hr at screening.

          -  If taking drugs for the prevention of stone disease, including pyridoxine, thiazides
             (chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, and indapamide), citrate supplements, and
             allopurinol, there must have been no changes in these medications for at least one
             month prior to screening and no changes are anticipated for the duration of the study.

          -  Able to understand and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Under or over-collection on screening 24-hour urine collection (mg creatinine/kg body
             weight outside of gender-specific range).

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;40 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or acute renal
             failure.

          -  Primary hyperoxaluria.

          -  Allergy, intolerance, or any other factors limiting ability to consume the study foods
             or adhere to the study meal schedule.

          -  Positive pregnancy test during Screening.

          -  Clinically significant findings (including acute renal colic), an ongoing clinically
             significant illness requiring changes in management, or any planned medical/surgical
             procedure during the study.

          -  Malignancy undergoing active therapy; patients in remission on chronic suppressive or
             maintenance therapies are not excluded.

          -  Investigational compound within 30 days prior to screening.
