  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I study with the hypothesis that Pulsed Low Dose Radiation (PLDR) radiation delivery
      technique can significantly decrease the rate of severe acute esophagitis in patients
      receiving concurrent Chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) for non-small cell lung cancer or
      esophageal cancer while maintaining similar efficacy. For these patients, the rate of severe
      acute esophagitis during concurrent CRT is high (approximately 20%) when conventional
      external beam radiation is utilized. Severe acute esophagitis can cause many adverse
      consequences such as severe discomfort, weight loss, hospitalization, interruption/early
      termination of treatment, and worse surgical complications for those who receive surgery
      after CRT. PLDR radiation has the potential to maintain the tumor control rates of
      conventional radiation while decreasing the toxicity to the surrounding normal tissue 29-35.

      We have completed accrual to a phase I PLDR radiation study, in which patient received
      palliative re-irradiation with PLDR technique for their metastatic disease in previous
      irradiated field. In that phase I study, PLDR demonstrated safety for acute toxicities in the
      setting of re-irradiation for a total dose of 50 Gy, with analysis of 60 Gy pending. The
      follow up time for that phase I study is limited as most enrolled patients have short overall
      survival due to their terminal illness.

      This proposed phase I study is, to our knowledge, the first clinical study with combination
      of PLDR radiation and concurrent chemotherapy for definitive treatment.
