  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find differences between patients who do and do not develop
      ICU-acquired hypernatremia (IAH). Therefore extended sodium and fluid balances will be
      performed. Also a couple of other factors that possibly contribute to the development of IAH
      and/or could give clues about the mechanisms in the development of IAH will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICU-acquired hypernatremia (IAH) is common in critically ill patients, but it's aetiology is
      still not fully understood. Sodium overload and inadequate fluid administration are generally
      considered important factors, but a previous retrospective study did not reveal differences
      in sodium or fluid balances between patients who did and did not develop IAH. Because this
      was retrospective these balances will be prospectively studied in this study to be more sure
      about the importances of these balances in the development of IAH. Previous studies indicated
      that (a lot) more factors contribute to the development of IAH. In this study these factors
      will be investigated, hoping to find differences between patients who do and do not develop
      IAH.
