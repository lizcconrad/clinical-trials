      This is an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study to obtain data for the
      evaluation of current used recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy released by IOM
      (2007) and investigate the association between maternal diet and the health outcomes of
      mother and offspring. 8000 pregnant have been recuited from the first trimester of pregnancy.
      All datas including the general information, sociodemographic facts, physical exam (body
      weight, height, blood pressure, etc), laboratory test (hemoglobin, glucose concentration,
      etc.) and dietary survey (FFQ, 24h food recall) have been collected during the cohort study.
      Blood sample leftover from the clinical use are remained and stored at -80â„ƒfor further
      measurements. Obstetric characteristics, maternal and perinatal outcomes have been observed
      and recorded. Growth and development paremeters such as weight, length and head circumference
      as well as disease information of infants have been collected , feeding pattern and feeding
      history will be surveyed. All data collected will be used for group analysis only and all
      private and individual records will be kept secret.
