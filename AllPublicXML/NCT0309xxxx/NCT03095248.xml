  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the researchers want to learn more about the effects (both good and
      bad) the study drug selumetinib has on participants with neurofibromatosis type II (NF2)
      related tumor.

      The researchers are asking patients with NF2 related tumors to be in the study, because their
      hearing has decreased and/or their NF2 related tumor has started to grow.

      The goals of this study are:

        -  Determine if selumetinib will stop NF2 related tumors from growing

        -  Measure the changes in hearing after receiving selumetinib for 6 months.

        -  Determine if selumetinib improves how participants feel (physically and emotionally) and
           how participants can perform daily activities.

        -  Examine tumor tissue, if available, in a laboratory to see if NF2 related tumors have
           targets of selumetinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 trial to assess the hearing response rate and radiographic response of VS
      in children and young adults with NF2 who are treated with selumetinib. Dosing will be based
      on age: For patients with NF2 who are 3 to &lt; 18 years of age, dosing will be based on BSA.
      Dosing is based on BSA calculated at the beginning of each course. For patients with NF2 who
      are ≥ 18 to 45 years of age, dosing will be the standard adult dose of 75 mg BID.

      Selumetinib is taken orally twice a day continuously. One course is equivalent to 28 days.
      Therapy may continue for up to two years (26 courses) in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      There will be two treatment strata. Stratum 1 is for those patients who have a target
      vestibular schwannoma which is causing hearing loss. Stratum 2 will be reserved for patients
      who exhibit growth of a tumor(s) besides vestibular schwannoma and are therefore not eligible
      for stratum 1.

             no limit to number of prior myelosuppressive regimen for these NF2 patients.

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or radiotherapy prior to entering this

          -  Bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for
             age

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;3 X institutional upper limit of normal for age

          -  Central Nervous System Function:

             - Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if they are receiving non-enzyme
             inducing anticonvulsants and the seizures are well controlled.

          -  Cardiac Function

        Adequate cardiac function defined as:

          -  LVEF ≥50% by ECHO

          -  QTc interval ≤450 msecs by EKG

          -  Hypertension

          -  Patients, 3 to &lt; 18 years of age must have a blood pressure that is ≤ 95th percentile
             for age, height and gender at the time of registration.

          -  Patients who are ≥18 years of age must have a blood pressure that is &lt;140/90 mm of Hg
             at the time of registration.

        Patients may be on blood pressure medication provided that it is not on the contraindicated
        list and that the medication has not been adjusted in the previous 3 months.

        - Growth factors: All colony forming growth factor(s) have been discontinued for at least
        one week prior to registration (filgrastim, sargramostim, and erythropoietin). For patients
        on long acting growth factors, the interval should be two weeks.

          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities Both males and females of all races and ethnic
             groups are eligible for this study.

          -  Informed Consent:

        All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent.
        Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of
             fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies. The effects of
             selumetinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation, and for four weeks after dosing with selumetinib ceases. The
             selumetinib manufacturer recommends that adequate contraception for male patients
             should be used for 16 weeks post-last dose due to sperm life cycle. Women of
             child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study
             registration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

        Note: Female subjects are considered &quot;of child-bearing potential&quot; if they are anatomically
        and physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. For girls of normal reproductive
        potential, the possibility of becoming pregnant requires ovulatory menstrual cycles and
        heterosexual intercourse. Although the timing of ovulation relative to menarche is
        variable, there is consistent evidence that some girls may have ovulatory cycles prior to
        menarche, and that, in healthy populations, regular ovulation may begin within a few months
        of menarche. Therefore, menarche is the most feasible clinical indicator of the biological
        potential for pregnancy.

          -  Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious
             infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction) that
             is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results

          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug within 4 weeks prior
             to the first dose of study treatment, or within a period during which the
             investigational drug or systemic anticancer treatment has not been cleared from the
             body (e.g. a period of 5 'half-lives'), whichever is the most appropriate and as
             judged by the investigator are not eligible.

          -  Patients who have taken another BRAF inhibitor such as Vemurafenib or Dabrafenib prior
             to study registration are not eligible. Prior treatment with selumetinib or another
             MEK inhibitor is not allowed.

          -  Patients with QTc interval of &gt; 450 msec

          -  Patients who require enzyme inducing anti-convulsants to control seizures.

          -  Anticoagulation: Patients receiving coumadin are eligible but must have their PT and
             INR monitored prior to each 4 week course.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.

          -  The following cardiac conditions:

             a. Uncontrolled hypertension in adults (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite medical therapy) b.
             Acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to starting treatment c. Uncontrolled

             f. Previous moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function (LVEF
             &lt;45% on echocardiography or equivalent on MuGA) if known even if full recovery has
             occurred.

             g. Severe valvular heart disease h. Baseline Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
             below the LLN or &lt;50% measured by echocardiography or institution's LLN for MUGA i.

             symptoms requiring immediate intervention with surgery or radiation therapy are not
             eligible.
