    <textblock>
      Subjects with hematologic malignancies or recipients of a first allogenic or autologus
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant, without any evidence or respiratory infection, will
      receive 4 doses of PUL-042 Inhalation Solution over a 2 week period. Subjects will be
      evaluated for tolerability of the drug. If tolerated, dose escalation may occur with up to 4
      dose levels tested

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multiple ascending dose study with a 3+3 study design to examine the
      safety and tolerability of PUL-042 Inhalation Solution in subjects with hematologic
      malignancies or recipients of a first allogenic or autologus hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant. Subjects will receive 4 doses over 2 weeks.

      Cohort size will be 3 subjects, once 3 subjects have completed treatment and follow-up at a
      dose level, subject data will be evaluated by an independent data safety monitoring committee
      prior to dosing additional subjects. The Committee may recommend increasing the dose,
      maintaining the same dose, or decreasing the dose.

      Once the maximum dose is determined, there may be up to 6 additional subjects dosed at that
      level.
