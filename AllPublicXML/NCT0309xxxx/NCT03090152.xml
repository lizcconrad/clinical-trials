  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty can be associated with significant postoperative pain. Side effects of
      pain management may impair participation in physical therapy and slow readiness for discharge
      from the hospital. In a previous study done by the investigators' group, epidural patient
      controlled analgesia (EPCA) with a hydromorphone containing solution appeared to have a more
      favorable pain profile with ambulation, but greater side effects compared to injection of a
      peri-articular cocktail. The use of opioid was greater in the peri-articular injection group
      (PAI). There was no difference in length of stay. In view of the controversy over opioid use,
      the investigators would like to develop an optimal opioid sparing pain management approach by
      comparing 3 different protocols 1) Plain local anesthetic EPCA; 2) PAI; 3) EPCA + PAI; all in
      conjunction with a multimodal opioid sparing pain regimen. The goal would be to maximize pain
      control while minimizing opioid use and side-effects.
