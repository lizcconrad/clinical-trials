  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overdose of xenobiotics (antihistamines, antipsychotics, or Jimson Weed) with resulting
      antimuscarinic toxidrome is a common scenario in medical toxicology. The result of antagonism
      of muscarinic receptors is a constellation of signs and symptoms (toxidrome): mydriasis,
      decreased sweat, decreased bowel sounds, agitation, delirium, hallucinations, urinary
      retention, tachycardia, flushed skin and seizures. Two treatment options are physostigmine or
      benzodiazepines.

      Although the antimuscarinic toxidrome occurs commonly, physostigmine has been used sparingly
      despite evidence of safety and efficacy. To demonstrate the utility and safety of
      physostigmine, the investigators propose a randomized clinical trial of physostigmine
      compared to benzodiazepine for antimuscarinic toxicity.
