  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Owing to effective treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), chronic myeloid leukemia
      (CML) has become a chronic disease with a rising prevalence globally. Although the
      possibility of stopping TKI therapy in CML patients who have achieved deep molecular
      responses is a topic of active debate and investigation, life-long treatment remains the
      current standard of care. It has been estimated that 3% to 56% of CML patients are not
      adherent to their prescribed TKI therapy. Poor adherence to TKIs could compromise the control
      of CML, and contributes to poorer survival. CML patients on long-term TKI therapy are prone
      to developing certain medication-related issues such as adverse reactions and drug
      interactions.Occurrence of adverse reactions even at low grades, has been shown to impact CML
      patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and adherence to treatment. However, there
      is no prospective high quality evidence showing adherence to TKIs and the associated clinical
      outcomes can be improved in CML patients. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that
      medication management intervention by pharmacist might improve adherence to TKIs, and
      translate into better disease response and HRQoL in CML patients, when compared to control
      arm who receive standard pharmacy service.
