  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the accuracy of the total thoracic fluid content (TFC) measured by
      cardiometry can predict weaning-induced pulmonary edema and subsequently weaning failure.
      Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) will be determined, sensitivity,
      specificity, and best cutoff value will be calculated for TFC in prediction of weaning
      failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weaning from mechanical ventilation is a serious and challenging process in critical care
      practice. Weaning failure is associated with poor patient outcomes. Increased mortality in
      patients with failed weaning was due to development of complications related to
      re-intubation. Detection and correction of the cause of failed spontaneous breathing trial
      (SBT) helps the intensives to improve the outcome of the next trials.

      Fluid overload and positive cumulative fluid balance is a risk factor of weaning failure.
      Weaning induced pulmonary edema (WIPE) has been reported in both cardiac and non-cardiac
      patients.

      Many tools for prediction of weaning induced cardiac edema have been reported. The gold
      standard for detection of WIPE was pulmonary artery catheter. More simple tools have been
      investigated for detection of WIPE in patients with or without previous cardiac dysfunction
      such as extravascular lung water, B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and biological signs of
      hemoconcentration.

      Although measurement of extravascular lung water is a reliable tool for prediction of WIPE,
      it has the disadvantage of the need of advanced monitor with invasive arterial line.
      Bioreactance is a new technology used for measurement of cardiac output and total thoracic
      fluid content (TFC). More recently, electrical velocimetry is a newer technology with good
      performance in cardiac output monitoring. The use of electrical velocimetry in measurement of
      TFC has the advantage of being non-invasive with no need for advanced skills. The aim of this
      work is to validate the use of TFC (measured by electrical velocimetry) and extravascular
      lung water (measured by lung ultrasound) in prediction of weaning success.
