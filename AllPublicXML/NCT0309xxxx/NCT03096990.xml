  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include a representative sample of 150 patients with active Psoriatic
      Arthritis (PsA) for whom the treating rheumatologist has decided to begin treatment with
      apremilast. This study is non-interventional, drug dosing and treatment duration will be at
      the sole discretion of the treating rheumatologist, in accordance with the local label and
      daily clinical practice. APOLO is a national (Belgium), multicentre, prospective,
      non-interventional, post-marketing study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient care will follow routine clinical practice, involving regular follow-up visits,
      without any mandatory visit. In daily practice, patients are usually seen by their treating
      rheumatologist every 3 months. In this study, patients will be followed-up for a least 6
      months and at most 18 months after apremilast treatment initiation. Considering that Belgian
      National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI) queries have to be addressed
      by 31st January 2019, patient data will be collected until May/June 2018. Assuming a
      recruitment phase of 12-month duration starting as of December 2016, individual patient
      follow-up times will range from 6 to 18 months, depending on the inclusion date.

      During the study, it is expected to collect data at inclusion and at 6 months after
      apremilast initiation in all patients. As per NIHDI recommendations, patients should consult
      their treating rheumatologists 6 months after apremilast initiation in order to evaluate
      treatment response and decide on treatment continuation for an additional period of 12
      months. For patients recruited early in the study, data will be collected during the next
      follow-up visits up to 18 months after apremilast initiation. Only data pertaining to visits
      occurring at 9 (± 1), 12 (± 1), 15 (±1), and 18 (± 1) months after treatment initiation will
      be collected. If a study visit occurs approximately 3 (± 1) months after treatment
      initiation, the data will also be recorded.

      All clinical data collected during this non-interventional study will be routinely documented
      in the patient's medical records, which are the main source of information. The study data
      will be collecting via an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Data from source documents
      including PRO-questionnaires will be entered in the eCRF by the investigator or other
      authorised appropriately designed and trained study site personnel. Data entered into the
      eCRF will be reviewed for consistency by the Data Manager using both automated logical checks
      (issuing in automatic queries generated by the system) and manual review (issuing in manual
      checks set by the Data Manager or the Monitor into the eCRF). All data collected within the
      eCRF will be approved and electronically signed and dated by the Investigator or designee. At
      the conclusion of the study, before the final statistical analysis, the eCRF and other study
      data will be locked to further additions or corrections.

      During the study, the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will contact each study site on a
      regular basis in order to check the progress and conduct of the study. If issues regarding
      study conduct arise, additional on-site visits may be performed. In particular, a quality
      analysis will also be performed and based on data quality, it will be decided whether on-site
      monitoring is necessary, for which site and on which percentage of patients. During
      monitoring visits, eCRFs, patient's source documents, and all other study documentation will
      be reviewed by the CRA. Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that
      is a direct comparison of the entries made onto the eCRF against the appropriate source
      documentation.

      Adverse events AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
      (MedDRA) terminology.

      The detailed methodology of the statistical analyses will be documented in a statistical
      analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be written by the Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) in
      charge of the study and will be validated by sponsor prior to performing the analysis and
      obligatory before the database lock. A scientific committee has been selected for this study.
      This committee will provide advice on the SAP.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index [HAQ-DI] score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) is a validated PRO questionnaire designed to measure health status and health-related quality of life. It consists of 20 items covering activities of daily living classified in 8 domains. Respondents indicate for every item whether they can do the activity 'without any difficulty', with 'some' or 'much difficulty' or are 'unable to do' the activity. The HAQ yields a disability index (HAQ-DI) score between 0 and 3, where, 0 means no functional disability and 3 represents severe functional disability.</description>

The patient's global self-assessment of disease activity is measured on a 0 to 10 unit NRS. The physician's global assessment of disease activity is also measured on a 0 to 10 unit NRS. For patient's assessment and for the physician's assessment, the NRS</description>

The VAS numeric values are the distances in millimeters from &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;no itch&quot; respectively to the points marked by the patient. The pain VAS consists of a 100-mm horizontal line anchored at one end with the words &quot;no pain&quot; and at the other end with the words &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.</description>

    <description>The LEI was developed specifically for use in PsA. It measures enthesitis at 6 sites (lateral epicondyle, left and right; medial femoral condyle, left and right; Achilles tendon insertion, left and right). Each site is assigned a score of 0 (absent) or 1 (present); the results from each site is then added to produce a total score (range 0 to 6).</description>
