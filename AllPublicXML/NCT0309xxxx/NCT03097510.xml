  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of the Transcendental Meditation
      program on emotional intelligence and perceived stress in supervisors and administrative
      staff in a public school system
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to determine whether a mind-body technique, known as the
      practice of Transcendental MeditationÂ® (TM), could significantly increase emotional
      intelligence and decrease perceived stress in supervisors and administrative staff in a
      public school system. For this purpose, 96 participants from the administrative offices of
      the San Francisco Unified School District were randomly assigned to either immediate start of
      the TM program or to a delayed start wait-list control group. Subjects learning TM were
      instructed to meditate for 20 minutes twice a day for the four month duration of the project.
      All subjects were administered the BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i) and Perceived
      Stress Scale (PSS) at baseline and posttest. If successful, these findings would suggest that
      TM could be used as a professional development program in organizations to increase emotional
      intelligence and decrease perceived stress, in turn enhancing leadership capacity and
      organizational effectiveness.

    <description>The TM technique is a simple, natural, effortless technique that allows the mind to experience finer levels of the thinking process until the mind transcends and experiences the source of thought, a state of deep, integrated relaxation. During the meditation session, the active mind settles down to a silent yet fully awake state of awareness. TM was taught to study participants by certified instructors, using standardized procedures for teaching.</description>
