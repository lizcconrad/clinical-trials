  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective open multi-centre non-interventional study initiated to document the
      up-dosing period of children and adults with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or allergic
      asthma treated with a SLIT containing purified, aqueous extracts of birch, alder, and hazel
      pollen. The following up-dosing schemes are freely selectable: scheme A consists of an
      up-dosing period of 12 days at the patient´s home using the standardized pollen extract in
      three different solution strengths to reach the maximum dose; scheme B is performed only with
      the highest solution strength at the physician's office within 2 hours; and the new scheme C
      which is a regimen for initiation at the physician`s office and continuation at the patient`s
      home also exclusively using the highest solution strength and takes 4 days. Data are
      documented by physicians and in patients´ diaries.
