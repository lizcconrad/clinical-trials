  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the toxicity profile of neratinib in combination with trastuzumab
      in patients with early stage breast cancer with the use of anti-diarrheal prophylaxis. The
      anti-diarrheal medications being tested in this trial are loperamide and crofelemer.
      Crofelemer is an anti-diarrheal, enteric-coated drug product for oral administration. It is
      the only botanical drug currently approved by the FDA for oral administration and is approved
      for the treatment of diarrhea associated with HAART. Crofelemer has a novel mechanism of
      action, acting directly and simultaneously on 2 distinct intestinal luminal chloride
      channels. It is an inhibitor of both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride ion (Cl-) channel found
      on the apical membranes, and the calcium-activated Cl- channels (CaCC) at the luminal
      membrane of enterocytes. The CFTR Cl-channel and CaCC regulate Cl and fluid secretion by
      intestinal epithelial cells. Crofelemer acts by blocking Cl- secretion and accompanying high
      volume water loss in diarrhea, normalizing the flow of Cl- and water in the GI tract.

      This is an open-label adjuvant/post neoadjuvant single arm phase 2 trial.

      Patients will receive:

      Neratinib 240 mg orally once a day for up to 52 weeks while receiving concurrent trastuzumab.
      After the completion of trastuzumab maintenance therapy (determined by treating physician),
      neratinib will continue as monotherapy for 12 months. Neratinib is to be taken continuously
      in 21-day cycles with no rest between cycles unless related to toxicity.

      Intensive daily loperamide prophylaxis for the first 2 cycles and then as needed.

      Crofelemer 125 mg bid for the first two cycles then as needed.

      Each cycle is 21 days. Clinic visits and laboratory studies are planned on day 1 of every
      cycle for the first 4 cycles, then q4 cycles thereafter. An end of treatment visit will occur
      28 days after the last dose of neratinib. Patients who permanently discontinue treatment due
      to unacceptable toxicity will be followed-up for 28 days after the last dose of neratinib.

             failure (New York Heart Association functional classification of ≥2; including
             individuals who currently use digitalis, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers
             specifically for congestive heart failure), unstable angina, myocardial infarction

         12. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational products.

         13. Unable or unwilling to swallow tablets.
