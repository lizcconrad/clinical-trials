      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if inotuzumab ozogamycin can help to
      control the disease in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The safety of this
      treatment will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Inotuzumab ozogamycin is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of ALL.

      Up to 48 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      There are 28 (+/- 7) days in each cycle.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drug
      by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 (+/- 3 days) of each cycle.

      If your doctor thinks it is needed, you may also receive drugs through a spinal tap
      (intrathecally) to help lower the risk of the disease coming back in the fluid surrounding
      your brain. You will sign a separate consent for these drugs and this procedure.

      You may be given other drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. Your doctor will tell
      you about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      If the disease gets worse after responding for at least 3 months, you may be able to be
      retreated for up to 6 additional cycles. If the disease responds to treatment, you may
      receive up to 5 additional consolidation cycles of treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin. You
      will continue to have study visits as described above. The study doctor will discuss this
      option with you. You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug. This could
      also delay starting other treatments. The disease may also get worse to the point that you
      are no longer able to receive other treatments.

      Study Visits:

      Before each treatment cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      One (1) time weekly during Cycles 1-6, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      On Days 14 and 21 of Cycle 1, then every 2-3 cycles, you will have a bone marrow biopsy
      and/or aspiration.
