    <textblock>
      This study investigates cold-induced brown fat activation in winter swimmers and not-winter
      swimmers by skin temperature measures assessed with infra red thermography imaging and skin
      temperatures. Winter swimmers and not-winter swimmers will participate in an acute cooling
      intervention and thermoneutral intervention for comparison of energy expenditure and skin
      temperatures at the supraclavicular area.

      The field of human brown adipose tissue (BAT) research is focused on activation of BAT as a
      means of manipulating energy expenditure and potentially anti-obesity and anti-diabetic
      properties of the tissue. This is well established in rodent studies and explained as due to
      the specific brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Despite increasing evidence that
      indicates a metabolic regulatory role of BAT in humans, BAT activation/recruitment is not
      fully understood.

      Cold induced brown fat activity will be measured by skin temperature measures by means of
      infra-red thermography imaging and skin temperature.

      15 healthy male winter swimmers and 8 healthy male non-winter swimmers (controls) will be
      included in the study.
