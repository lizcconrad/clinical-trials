  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of lipid lowering agents in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies is
      controversial. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to assess clinically and laboratory
      the impact of lipid-lowering agents in this population.

    <description>Ultrasound-based measurements of brachial reactivity were performed according to the guidelines of the International Brachial Artery Reactivity Task Force. The assessment of vascular reactivity was carried out by the same examiner. The left brachial artery was measured at a longitudinal section above the antecubital fossa, using a high-resolution ultrasound system Sequoia Echocardiography System, version 6.0, Acuson; Siemens, Vernon, CA) equipped with a multifrequency linear transducer (7-12 MHz) to produce two-dimensional images. This technique was used to evaluate the change in arterial diameter and blood flow after physical and pharmacological stimulation.</description>

    <description>This partially validated tool assesses muscle strength using manual muscle testing (MMT). A 0 - 10 point scale is proposed for use. An abbreviated group of 8 proximal, distal, and axial muscles performs similarly to a total of 24 muscle groups, and is also proposed for use for research studies.</description>

Histological (hematoxylin and eosin)/immunohistochemical (CD4, CD8, CD68, CD20, C5b-9, MHCI, MHCII, CD31) analysis will be performed in muscle samples (at baseline and after 12 weeks) in all patients (present study)</description>
