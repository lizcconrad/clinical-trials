  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if daratumumab is safe and effective in the treatment of
      proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immune deposits (PGNMID) and C3
      glomerulopathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy (C3GN). This is an inflammatory disease
      in the kidney due to the production of abnormal proteins. There are no known standard
      effective treatments for patients with PGNMID and C3GN secondary to monoclonal gammopathy.
      These diseases are caused by abnormal production of proteins (monoclonals) by abnormal
      clones. Daratumamb has been shown to be effective in treating patients with multiple myeloma
      a disease which also caused by over production of monoclonal proteins from abnormal clones.
      Everyone in this study will receive daratumumab.

      This study is an open-label phase 2 trial of the safety and efficacy of daratumumab, in the
      treatment of PGNMID and C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy. Subjects will be screened
      at outpatient Nephrology Clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will be
      consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been obtained baseline
      values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up for the next 12
      months. Daratumumab will be administered once weekly for 8 weeks and then once every 2 weeks
      for 8 additional doses. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months (6 months after
      the last infusion). A final visit for evaluation and collection of lab samples will be
      conducted at the end of the study.
