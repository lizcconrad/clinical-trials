  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial aims to test whether transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to modulate fear extinction learning during
      exposure therapy for pathological fear, including fear of spiders, snakes, tightly enclosed
      spaces, or germs / contamination. Participation takes place over three laboratory visits,
      including (1) a pre-treatment visit, (2) a treatment and post-treatment visit, and (3) a 1
      month follow-up visit. During treatment, participants will receive either 20 minutes of
      active or sham tDCS, followed by 30 minutes of in vivo exposure therapy.

      In a trans-diagnostic sample with marked pathological fear and behavioral avoidance, this
      study aims to: (1) evaluate whether excitatory tDCS of the mPFC and inhibitory tDCS of right
      dlPFC enhances exposure therapy relative to (a) tDCS using the same electrode positioning,
      but reversed polarity, and (b) sham tDCS; (2) determine whether reversed polarity tDCS
      impedes extinction learning; and (3) determine whether tDCS effects are mediated by pre-post
      changes in vigilance to threat, in-session fear reduction, and contextual memory for the
      exposure context. If successful, the project may discover a potentially effective exposure
      therapy augmentation, and may enhance knowledge of the behavioral, cognitive, affective, and
      neurobiological factors that moderate and mediate acute treatment response and maintenance of
      treatment gains. This knowledge may inform treatment development efforts for more
      debilitating forms of pathological fear.
