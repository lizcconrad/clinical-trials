  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the use of a respiratory device, the Acapella Vibratory Positive
      Expiratory Pressure (PEP) Therapy device, in patients admitted to the hospital with a chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the PEP-FV used as adjunctive therapy in patients
      hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD will result in decreased hospital length of
      stay and improvement of overall COPD-related health outcomes.

    <description>The acapellaÂ® Vibratory PEP Therapy System (PEP-FV) device is a handheld device that operates in same principle as standard FV. Unlike standard FV, it is not gravity dependent. It comes in two different devices to accommodate for different flows rates of the patient. It has similar properties of a standard FV and may be better tolerated.</description>
