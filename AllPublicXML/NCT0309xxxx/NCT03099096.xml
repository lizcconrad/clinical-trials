  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to assess the correct real-world use of an autoinjector for the repeat
      self-administration of mepolizumab SC, so to improve subject / physician convenience and to
      enable repeat dose self injection themselves or via caregivers. This Phase III study will be
      an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose, multi-centre study of mepolizumab liquid drug product
      in autoinjector (100 milligrams [mg]) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (3
      doses) in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will receive 100 mg mepolizumab
      SC as a single injection that is self-administered in the thigh, abdomen or administered in
      the upper arm (caregiver only). Each subject will participate in the study for up to 18 weeks
      including pre-screening visit, a screening visit and a 12-week treatment period which
      concludes with end of study assessments (Visit 5) 4 weeks after the last dose of mepolizumab.
      Approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled in the study.

             dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 with or without
             maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS), for subjects &gt;=18 years old, ICS dose must be

             receiving continuous ICS and the Investigator attest that the subject should have been
             treated with high dose ICS to mitigate the risk of exacerbations, or the subject has
             financial or tolerance issues that prevent the use of high-dose ICS. Such subjects
             should be discussed with GSK Medical Monitor prior to enrolment)
