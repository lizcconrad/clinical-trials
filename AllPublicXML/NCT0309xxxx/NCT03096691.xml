  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prematurity is the most important cause of obstetric morbidity and mortality. Health centers
      and obstetricians are trying to reduce the preterm birth rate by taking into account the
      permanent effects of premature birth on human life in the early and long term.

      The most effective solution of preterm delivery is to determine the patients entering the
      risk group and to prevent preterm labor by putting the correct diagnosis at the right time.
      Recently, there have been studies on the efficacy of pessary practice in preventing preterm
      birth, but with the positive results of these studies, there has been hope for early birth
      prevention as well as other treatments.

      The aim of this study is; To assess the effectiveness of pessary use in patients with high
      risk for preterm labor and prophylactic cervical length less than 25 mm below 25 weeks and
      with a history of cervical insufficiency.

      The aim of this study is; To assess the effectiveness of pessary use in patients with high
      risk for preterm labor and prophylactic cervical length less than 25 mm below 25 weeks and
      with a history of cervical insufficiency.

      100 pregnant women with a preterm delivery history and / or a cervical length of less than 25
      mm will be included among the pregnancies between 16 and 24 weeks of gestation referred to
      obstetric and perinatology clinics. Information will be given about the success of treatment
      in the prevention of early birth of the pessary and the use of the disease pessary. Urine
      culture and cervical culture samples will be taken from both groups of patients. In the
      presence of infection, the patient's treatment will be planned and out of work. If no
      infection is detected and the patient agrees to use the pessary, the pessary will be used to
      prevent premature birth.
