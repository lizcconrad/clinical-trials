  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study develops and pilot tests the efficacy of a home-based, self-administered
      acupressure intervention in improving cancer-related fatigue (proximal outcome), and physical
      functioning and other quality of life outcomes (distal outcomes) of Chinese immigrant breast
      cancer survivors (versus usual care control group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program, we will enroll 124 foreign-born,
      Chinese-speaking women from the Los Angeles area with moderate to severe levels of fatigue,
      diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer, aged 21-69, and 1-5 years post-primary treatment.
      Using an adaptive treatment strategy design, participants will be randomized to either the
      acupressure intervention or control groups. The acupressure group will learn how to press
      three chief energy acupoints on each side of the body through de novo 11-minute
      Chinese-language video and practice acupressure every day (one minute per acupoint; a total
      of 6 minutes per day) for an 8-week intervention period. Participants will be telephone
      interviewed twice: at baseline and 8-weeks post-intervention follow-up.
