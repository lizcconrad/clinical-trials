      Analyze inflammatory markers and islet graft function through blood samples collected from
      subjects with chronic pancreatitis who undergo total pancreatectomy with auto islet
      transplantation.

      A total of 100 subjects will be enrolled in this study; 85 subjects will be enrolled from
      patients who are scheduled for TP-AIT and 15 subjects will be for TP alone at Baylor
      University Medical Center at Dallas or Baylor All Saints Medical Center at Fort Worth. The
      patients who are enrolled in a clinical study, named 'A phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment study to assess the efficacy and safety
      of reparixin in pancreatic islet auto-transplantation (REP0112, IND# 117390)', can be
      enrolled in this study.
