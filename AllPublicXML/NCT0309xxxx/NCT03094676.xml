  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Performing physical exercise alters the body's homeostasis, and recuperative techniques seek
      to anticipate and potentiate the body's recovery. One of the ways to demonstrate a recovery
      of the organism is the resumption of autonomic cardiac modulation analyzed through heart rate
      variability (HRV), a method of global assessment of the behavior of the autonomic nervous
      system. Among the recovery techniques, massage is the most widely used technique in sports.
      Therefore, the objective of the study will be to measure the effects of massage as a
      recuperative technique on autonomic cardiac modulation at different moments of application.
      It will be a randomized clinical trial where there will be five stages of evaluation. In the
      first stage, the behavior of the baseline HRV will be evaluated, in the second stage the
      behavior of the HRV in front of the massage, in the third stage the behavior of the HRV in
      front of the stress protocol, in the fourth stage the HRV behavior after the stress protocol
      and immediately after Execution of the massage and finally in the 5th stage where the HRV
      behavior will be evaluated after the stress protocol and the massage application will be
      performed at the moment of HRV recovery. The stress protocol will be composed of squats
      followed by jumps and wingate test, and massage by slides in the anterior thighs and
      posterior trunk. The HRC indexes in the time domain, frequency domain and Poincaré plot, as
      well as cardiorespiratory parameters and a questionnaire on individual touch perception will
      be analyzed. The descriptive statistical method will be used and comparisons of
      cardiorespiratory parameters and HRV indices will be performed using the analysis of variance
      technique for repeated measures model in the two factor scheme. The level of significance
      will be p &lt;0.05 for all tests.

    <measure>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) - Linear indices - Frequency domain</measure>
    <time_frame>First 5 minutes of rest; During recovery 5 minutes initial; 10º to 15ºm; 20º to 25ºm; 30º to 35ºm; 40º to 45ºm; 50º to 55ºm; 60º to 65ºm; 70º to 75ºm; 90º to 95ºm; 115º to 120ºm.</time_frame>
    <description>HRV is a noninvasive and selective way of assessing the autonomic function being determined by analyzing the time series of the RR intervals. The HRV analysis will be performed by the Polar Electro Oy - V800 cardiofrequency meter.
In the analysis of the linear methods, 3 rMSSD, SDNN and pNN50 indices will be used within the time domain. RMSSD corresponds to the square root of the square mean of the differences between the adjacent normal RR intervals in a time interval expressed in milliseconds. The SDNN index represents the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals recorded over a time interval, expressed in milliseconds. And finally, the pNN50 index is the percentage of adjacent RR intervals with a duration difference greater than 50 milliseconds.</description>

In the analysis of the linear methods, 3 LF, HF and LF / HF indices will be used within the frequency domain. Low frequency corresponds to frequencies between 0.04 and 0.15 Hz (LF - frequency between 0.04 and 0.15 Hz), high frequency (HF - frequency between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz) and the ratio between these components ( LF / HF). These indices shall be expressed in ms² and standard units.</description>
