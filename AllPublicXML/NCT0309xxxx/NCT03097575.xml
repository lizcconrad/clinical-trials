  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the use of peritumoral injection of near-infrared dye
      indocyanine green to identify lung lesions and sentinel lymph nodes. The primary purpose is
      to determine if the use of ICG injected via navigational bronchoscopy, CT-guided or
      transthoracic allows us to identify the first lymph node that drains from the tumor, and thus
      would be the most likely site for metastatic disease, and remove it for analysis to improve
      the ability to detect tumor in this node and to remove this additional site that potentially
      contains tumor cells. Using this intraoperative imaging technique, we aim to improve the
      identification of lung nodules for resection and the intraoperative identification of
      sentinel lymph nodes in the event that a lymphadenectomy is performed.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients enrolled in the study will undergo peritumoral injection of near-infrared dye
      indocyanine green around the lung lesion or within the adjacent segmental bronchus at the
      time of surgery. ICG injection will be carried out via navigational bronchoscopy, CT-guided
      or trans-thoracic ICG injection (dependent on lesion location) and ICG imaging of the
      sentinel lymph nodes will be undertaken using an NIR-enabled camera.

        -  This study is designed primarily to determine the safety and feasibility of
           intra-operative localization of thoracic lesions following ICG injection, and second, to
           include an assessment of the predictive value of sentinel lymph nodes relative to the
           disease status of the greater lymphadenectomy specimen as well as disease recurrence
           rates.

        -  We are using a dose approximately 100 times lower than previously approved for injection
           in the blood. After a few minutes, the surgeon will look at these lymph nodes with
           near-infrared fluorescence and then remove any fluorescent and non-fluorescent lymph
           nodes near the tumor, as is standard for lung surgery.

        -  The &quot;filtered&quot; near-infrared light causes the indocyanine green dye to fluoresce so that
           the surgeon can identify the lymph nodes most likely to contain tumor cells. If the
           lymph node is not found in the group of nodes usually removed, we will use the
           near-infrared light to look near the tumor for the sentinel lymph nodes and guide the
           surgeon so that the sentinel nodes can be removed and studied. The surgeon will then
           continue with the operation and remove the tumor. The lymph nodes are processed for
           special analysis tailored to finding metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes.

        -  As is standard of care, patients will be monitored for evidence of recurrence by their
           surgeon. Recurrences will be recorded.

    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (safety and feasibility) of intraoperative NIR-image-guided localization of lung lesions using peritumoral ICG injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>In this initial proof-of-concept pilot trial for patients undergoing surgical resection of a suspicious lung lesion, we will translate the new technology of NIR-imaging to the OR and assess safety and feasibility of ICG delivery, optimize the ability to &quot;NIR tattoo&quot; and visualize lung lesions for targeted resection vs NIR-highlighted segmental resections, assess histology of the surgical margin and determine lesional characteristics which predict successful NIR imaging. Safety and feasibility will be measured quantitatively by the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, as assessed by CTCAE v4.0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigate whether SLNs can be identified using NIR-guidance following peritumoral ICG injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Technical difficulty and clinical complications have resulted in &lt; 50% of surgeons performing complete removal of tumor draining lymph nodes at the time of surgery. Therefore, we will assess the feasibility of SLN identification following ICG injection for &quot;targeted&quot; lymph node sampling and focused analysis staging. This Outcome will be addressed only in cases where a lymphadenectomy is performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess if NIR image-guided SLN excision enhances detection of metastatic disease and whether the presence of untreated occult metastatic disease/mutational analysis of primary tumors/secondary sites of disease including SLNs are predictors of outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Studies in stage I and II lung cancer have demonstrated &quot;occult&quot; nodal metastatic disease affects clinical outcomes, however, currently there is no accurate means to identify micrometastatic nodal disease in these patients prospectively. Therefore, we will analyze the SLN results to determine whether prospectively identified &quot;occult&quot; micrometastatic disease in the SLN is a &quot;predictor&quot; of disease recurrence. This Outcome is pertinent only to cases in which a lymphadenectomy was performed.</description>
