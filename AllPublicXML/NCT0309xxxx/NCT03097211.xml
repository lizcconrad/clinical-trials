  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the administration of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50
      mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) at steady-state affects the pharmacokinetics of levodopa when
      administered in combination with a single-dose of immediate release levodopa/benserazide
      200/50 mg or with a single-dose of immediate release levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg plus a
      single-dose of nebicapone 150 mg.

      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, rising multiple dose study in
      four sequential groups of healthy male and female subjects. Eligible subjects were admitted
      to the Human Pharmacology Unit (UFH)on the day prior to receiving the first study medication.
      Starting in the morning of Day 1 (first dose), subjects received BIA 6-512/Placebo thrice
      daily until the morning of Day 5 (last dose). Concomitantly with the morning dose of BIA
      6-512/Placebo on Day 4, a levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg (Madopar® 250) single-dose was
      administered. On Day 5, a Madopar® 250 single-dose and a nebicapone 150 mg single-dose were
      administered concomitantly with the morning dose of BIA 6-512/Placebo. In the morning of Day
      4 and Day 5, products were administered in fasting conditions of at least 8 hours and
      subjects remained fasted until 2 h post-dose. Subjects were resident in the UFH from
      admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last dose (Day 6); then, they were discharged and
      returned for the follow-up visit.
