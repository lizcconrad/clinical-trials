  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the response of Gamma Knife Surgery to Ktrans, Ve,
      and Vp, which are indicators of permeability map obtained from dynamic contrast enhanced
      (DCE) MRI in patients with vestibular schwannoma .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with vestibular schwannoma, who underwent gamma knife surgery and pre-op
             dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI

          -  Patients with vestibular schwannoma, who received consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In addition to the vestibular schwannoma, if the brain has other underlying or
             systemic disease

          -  During the observation period, other treatments were performed other than gamma knife
             surgery

          -  If patients have a contraindication to MRI (eg, pacemaker, cochlear implants,
             hemodynamically unstable)

          -  Concomitant use of gadolinium MRI contrast agents (eg, renal insufficiency [glomerular
             filtration rate &lt;30 ML / min]), or if there was a side effect when using a contrast
             medium.

          -  Adults with impaired ability to cope

          -  If the images and medical records required for this study are not available or are not
             appropriate
