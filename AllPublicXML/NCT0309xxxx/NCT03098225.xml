  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is a disfiguring and disabling disease that profoundly impairs the
      quality of life of affected patients. High dose intravenous (iv) glucocorticoids (GC) (ivGC)
      is a well established, widely used treatment for active GO. The use of systemic
      glucocorticoids takes advantage from their immune suppressive and antiinflammatory actions,
      resulting in an overall beneficial effect ranging from ~35 to ~60% of patients in various
      studies. The intravenous route of administration has been shown to be superior to the oral
      route, both in terms of GO outcome and side effect profile. The combination of ivGC and
      orbital radiotherapy (OR) is used routinely in patients with moderate-severe, active GO, as a
      second-line treatment, as also recommended in the recent Guidelines published by the European
      Thyroid Association/European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy. Thus, the majority of studies have
      shown that OR increases the response rate to GC. Those studies were performed using oral GC,
      whereas it is not known whether OR potentiate also the effects of ivGC.

      The present study is aimed at determining whether OR potentiate the effects of ivGC in the
      treatment of moderately severe and active GO, in terms of GO outcome and quality of life. A
      possible extension of the study can be foreseen, aimed at investigating the very long time GO
      outcome.

    <description>A composite evaluation of GO was described previously.
Improvement is defined as amelioration of two parameters in at least one eye, without deterioration of any parameters in both eyes:
Deterioration is defined as worsening in two parameters in at least one eye:
All other cases are defined as &quot;no change&quot;
The parameters are:
Eyelid swelling (improvement/worsening according to EUGOGO Atlas evaluation)
Lid aperture in mm (significant variation: 2 or more mm)
Clinical activity score (CAS) (7 items: spontaneous pain, evoked pain, eyelid edema, eyelid redness, conjunctiva redness, caruncle edema, chemosis; significant change: at least 2 points)
Exophthalmos in mm (significant variation 2 or more mm)
Eye muscle involvement - diplopia score (Gorman score) (significant variation: disappearance or change in the degree, or improvement of ≥12 degrees in motility)</description>
