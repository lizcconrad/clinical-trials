  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, Interleukin (IL)-17 has been identified as a key driver of chronic inflammation in
      Bullous Pemphigoid (BP). Ixekizumab is a recombinant high-affinity fully human monoclonal
      antibody that targets IL-17A Immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1)/kappa-class. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the effect of Ixekizumab on BP patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BP is the most common auto-immune blistering disease of the skin and causes significant
      morbidity. BP disproportionally affects the elderly population and the current, non-specific
      immunosuppressive therapies, in addition to patient comorbidities, are associated with a high
      risk of infection related mortality. Neutrophils and their proteases have been shown to play
      a major role in the cleavage of Bullous Pemphigoid 180 Antigen (BP180) in BP. Mast cells and
      other cellular mediators also contribute to the pro-inflammatory environment within and
      surrounding blisters of BP. However, the prior targeting of mast cells and basophils has
      resulted in unpredictable disease control. Recently, IL-17 has been identified as a key
      driver of chronic inflammation in BP. With the increasing aged population in the United
      States, BP will increase in prevalence and the development of a more targeted approach will
      be necessary to decrease morbidity and mortality. IL-17 inhibition with Ixekizumab may have
      targeted, disease-modifying effects on BP. The primary objective is to test the effect of
      Ixekizumab in the treatment of the autoimmune blistering disease, BP.

             blastomycosis and for subjects with underlying conditions that may predispose them to
             infection, such as advanced or inadequately controlled diabetes. Due to its endemic
             nature in Arizona, coccidioidomycosis screening is performed at baseline. A history of
             a disseminated coccidioidomycosis infection will exclude subjects.
