  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal and metabolic changes because of postmenopause increase body weight, central
      abdominal fat, alter lipid profile and insulin resistance, those factors increase the risk up
      to 60% to develop metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Because there is
      no efficient antioxidant therapy in postmenopausal women, this study proposes a therapy with
      resveratrol and vitamin C to increase the total antioxidant capacity; as well as to decrease
      insulin resistance and in consequence decreased the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome and
      cardiovascular disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are not studies that demonstrate an efficient antioxidant therapy in
      postmenopausal women, to increase the total antioxidant capacity and to decrease insulin
      resistance and biochemical parameters of cardio-metabolic risk. Therefore, the aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effect of the co-administration of resveratrol and vitamin C on
      insulin resistance and antioxidant capacity by a double-blind randomized clinical trial. A
      population of 270 postmenopausal women will be studied, stratified into 3 groups:

      Group 1: Three-month administration of vitamin C 500 mg daily + placebo Group 2: Three-month
      administration of resveratrol 500 mg daily + placebo Group 3: Three months administration of
      vitamin C 500 mg daily and resveratrol 500 mg daily as antioxidant therapy.

      All participants will be monitored monthly for a period of 3 months: glucose, insulin, uric
      acid, Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGC), High
      density lipoproteins-cholesterol (HDL- C), low density lipoproteins-cholesterol (LDL), blood
      pressure, body mass index (BMI). The antioxidant efficiency in erythrocytes by the
      quantification of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase
      and glutathione peroxidase), as well as total antioxidant capacity in plasma. In order to
      corroborate the oxidative damage, the product of the lipoperoxidation malondialdehyde and the
      carbonylation of proteins will be evaluated by spectrophotometric techniques before and three
      months after the intervention.
