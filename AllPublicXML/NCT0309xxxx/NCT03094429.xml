    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive, Phase II/III study in 2 parts (i.e. Part 1 (dose ranging) and Part 2
      (Hypothesis testing)). NaBen® is granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by US FDA as
      treatment for refractory schizophrenia.

      Part 1 Objectives: There are two primary objectives for Part 1 of this study:

        1. To evaluate, in terms of dose-response, the effectiveness of NaBen® (1000 and 2000
           mg/day) compared to Placebo (0 mg/day), when combined with clozapine, in improving the
           residual symptoms associated with refractory schizophrenia in adults, and; to determine
           the optimal dose to be used in Part 2 of this study.

        2. Sample size re-assessment to evaluate the final sample size needed to proceed with Part
           2 of the study The secondary objective of the Part 1 of this study is to evaluate the
           safety and tolerability of NaBen® (1000 and 2000 mg/day) compared to Placebo (0 mg/day),
           in combination with clozapine.

      Part 2 Objectives: The primary objective of the Part 2 of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of NaBen® (at the optimal dose determined in the Part 1 of this study) compared
      to Placebo (0 mg/day), when combined with clozapine, in improving the residual symptoms
      associated with refractory schizophrenia in adults. The secondary objective of the Part 2 of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NaBen® (at the optimal dose
      determined in the Part 1 of this study) compared to Placebo (0 mg/day), in combination with
      clozapine.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-part, dose-finding,
      Multi-center study, in which subjects with refractory schizophrenia will be enrolled.

      This study will be conducted in two parts:

      In Part 1 (i.e. dose finding portion) of the study One hundred seventy one (171) subjects
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (NaBen® 2000 mg/day: NaBen® 1000 mg/day: Placebo).

      All subjects, after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF), will be assessed during the
      screening phase. This screening phase is designed to exclude subjects who have had more than
      20 percent reduction in the PANSS total score using PANSS score evaluations at Visit 1 and
      Visit 2. Only those subjects who successfully complete the screening phase and still meet the
      study eligibility criteria will proceed with Randomization and the double-blind treatment.
      All randomized subjects will receive eight (8) weeks of randomized treatment (NaBen® 2000
      mg/day, NaBen® 1000 mg/day or Placebo). Study treatments will be given twice daily.

      An Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when 171 subjects in Part 1 of the study have been
      randomized and completed 8 weeks of treatment or early terminated, whichever occurs first.
      Randomization of subjects in the study will continue until the IA of the Part 1 data is
      completed. The data from the Part 1 analysis will be reviewed by an independent Data Safety
      and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) who would assess the data for both safety and efficacy
      trends. The DSMC responsibilities will be further elaborated in the DSMC charter. The DSMC
      will approve continuation of the study and recommend the optimal dose and sample size
      adjustment for the Part 2 of the study.

      Assuming no sample size adjustment was made as a result of the IA, for Part 2 of the study a
      total of 116 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, of which 58 subjects will be
      randomized to the NaBen® optimal dose group and 58 subjects to the Placebo group. The
      procedures and assessments for subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 of this study will be identical
      with the exception of the randomization schema.

             laboratory assessments (urine/blood routine, biochemical tests and ECG) which would
             exclude the subject from the study in the opinion of the Investigator. For ALT and
             AST, clinically significant is defined as above two and a half times the upper limit
             of normal

             the local regulations. The identified caregiver should be considered reliable by the
             Investigator and per the local regulations in providing support to the subject to help
             ensure compliance with study treatment, study visits and protocol procedures who
             preferably is also able to provide input helpful for completing study rating scales

         13. The subject must not be a danger to themselves or others per the Investigator's
