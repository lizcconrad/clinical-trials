      Primary Objective:

      To investigate the efficacy of the standard dose of Thymoglobuline® induction therapy for
      preventing acute rejection (AR) after transplantation among recipients of Donated after
      Cardiac Death (DCD) kidney transplant.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate delayed graft function (DGF), graft and patient survival after kidney
           transplant.

        -  To evaluate adverse events of Thymoglobuline® throughout the study.

        -  To explore possible risk factors of AR and DGF in patients with DCD kidney transplant.

        -  To evaluate AR and DGF under different risk stratifications and explore an description
           optimal induction therapy regimen for recipients of DCD kidney transplant.
