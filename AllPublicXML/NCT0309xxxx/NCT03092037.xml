  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate the relationship between genetic variants and serum
      contraceptive hormone levels, specifically the progestin etonogestrel. This study will
      provide the foundation for future pharmacogenomic investigations of more commonly used
      contraceptive methods with higher failure rates.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 350 reproductive age women (18-45) with an Etonogestrel (ENG) contraceptive
      implant in place for more than 1 year will be enrolled. Participants will undergo a blood
      draw for measurement of ENG concentration (serum) and genotyping (whole blood) and complete a
      questionnaire regarding their demographics and contraceptive, gynecological, and obstetrical
      history. The research investigators will also consent participants for use of their genetic
      samples and clinical data in future unspecified research.

      The serum samples will be de-identified for ENG analysis, which will be done using a liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Additional whole blood samples collected at the
      enrollment visit will undergo DNA extraction -- the research investigators have selected 120
      genetic variants for 10 target genes involved in progestin metabolism, regulation, and
      function.
