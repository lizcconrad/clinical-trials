  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sequential efficacy and safety study in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes.
      Subjects will be administered insulin to induce a low normal glycemic state and will then
      receive an age-appropriate dose of G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) in a clinical research center
      (CRC) or comparable setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 3 sequential efficacy and safety study in pediatric patients
      ages 2-17 with type 1 diabetes. Patients will complete the screening procedures up to 30 days
      before dosing to determine eligibility before enrollment to the treatment phase.

      The procedure to evaluate the efficacy of G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) consists of inducing a
      low normal glycemic state by administration of insulin. Subjects ages 2-11 will then be given
      a 0.5 mg dose of G-Pen™, while subjects ages 12-17 will receive a 1 mg dose of G-Pen™.
      Subjects ages 12-17 will return for a second visit 1-4 weeks later and will receive a 0.5 mg
      dose of G-Pen™ when in a low normal glycemic stare. Plasma glucose and glucagon levels will
      be monitored for 90 and 180 minutes post-dosing, respectively, at all visits.

      A follow-up phone call as a safety check will be conducted 3 - 14 days following
      administration of the final dose.
