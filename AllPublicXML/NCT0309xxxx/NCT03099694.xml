  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators compared advantages and disadvantages of two forms of noninvasive
      respiratory support —noninvasive high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV) or nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) —as a primary mode of ventilation in premature
      infants with RDS．

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with development of adverse
      pulmonary and non-pulmonary outcomes in very low birth weight infants. Various modes of
      non-invasive respiratory support are being increasingly used to minimize the incidence of
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of this trialis to compare the effect of
      noninvasive high-frequency oscillatoryventilation (NHFOV) and nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (NCPAP) in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) as a
      primary noninvasive ventilation support mode.

      Methods/Design:In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, 300 preterm infants at
      gestational age (GA) less than 34 weeks with a diagnosis of RDS will be randomized to NHFOV
      or NCPAP as a primary mode of non-invasive respiratory support. Study will be conducted in 18
      tertiary neonatal intensive care units in China.

      The primary outcome isthe need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)during the first 7
      days after enrollment in preterm infants randomized to the two groups. The secondary outcomes
      include days of hospitalization, days on noninvasive respiratory support, days on IMV, days
      on supplemental oxygen, mortality, need for surfactant, incidence of retinopathy of
      prematurity(ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD), occurrence of abdominal distention, air
      leaks, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH ≥ grade 3) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC&gt; II
      stage). Other secondary outcomes include scores of Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 2
      months and 2 years of corrected age.

    <description>NHFOV will be provided by a high frequency ventilator (CNO, Medin, Germany or SLE 5000, UK). NHFOV will be provided via binasal prongs. All participating centers have expertise with using these HFO ventilators. Guidelines for initial and maximum settings were provided to all sites. Initial nHFOV settingswill be: MAP of 6cmH2O, which will be equivalent with NCPAP group, frequency of 8 Hz, and amplitude will be adjusted until the infant's chest showsadequate chest wall vibrations. The FiO2will be adjustedto target oxygen saturation (SpO2) from 89% to 93% in preterm infants &lt;30 weeks GA and 90-94% in infants &gt;30 weeks GA by pulse oximeter</description>
