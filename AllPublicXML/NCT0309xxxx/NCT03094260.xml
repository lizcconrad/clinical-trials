  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is the most widespread food behavior disorder, with prevalence
      three times higher than anorexia. Its pathophysiology remains poorly understood and the
      investigators have few therapeutic options. Following a review of the literature, the
      investigators hypothesize that luminotherapy could be an innovative treatment of BED by its
      favorable effect on triggers of hyperphagic access, circadian disturbances, attention and
      impulsivity. The study is prospective, interventional, randomized, double-blind, monocentric
      (HCL). 52 patients with BED will be randomized to an active arm with intensive luminotherapy
      (1 daily 30 min, 10,000 lux in the morning) versus a placebo arm (&lt;500 lux). Treatment will
      be delver every day during 30 days. Assessments will take place on D0, D30 and D60. The main
      objective is to compare the evolution of the number of hyperphagic access before and after
      treatment between the two groups. Secondary objectives are to compare characteristics of
      hyperphagic access, bodily concerns, food dependence and impulsivity, mood, anxiety,
      cognitive and attentional profiles (STROOP, Go / No Go, SST, BART, Prospective Time
      Estimation Task, Switching Task), liking / wanted for different food categories and
      carbohydrate metabolism (CRP, glucose, insulinemia, insulin resistance, profile of lipid
      abnormalities, 25-OH vitamin D3).
