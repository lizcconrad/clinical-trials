      The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of sexual dysfunction in presence of
      dysthyroidism and the impact of restoring euthyroidism on female sexual function

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal component plays a crucial role in sexual function. Hypothyroidism and
      hyperthyroidism may be associated with any form of sexual dysfunction in men but only a few
      studies reported the relationship between thyroid dysfunction and female sexuality.

      The study is an observational study. An informed consent will be obtained from all patients
      before the study.

      The aim of the study is:

        -  to evaluate the incidence of sexual dysfunction in presence of dysthyroidism and the
           impact of restoring euthyroidism on female sexual function (evaluated with the Female
           Sexual Function Index)

        -  to evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the emotional and psychological
           wellness (evalueted with the Middle Sex Hospital Questionnaire)

        -  to evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the satisfaction of body image
           (evalueted with the Body Uneasiness Test)

        -  to evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the distress related to sexuality
           (evaluated with the Female Sexual Distress Scale).

      The investigators espect to enroll a total of 50 sexually active hyperthyroidic/hypothyroidic
      women in this study in about 7 months. Statistical analyses will be performed using the
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences

    <description>To assess the incidence of sexual dysfunction in the presence of dysthyroidism and the impact of restoring euthyroidism on female sexual function. The investigators will evaluate the difference between the scores of the FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index) questionnaire administered at baseline and after normalization of thyroid function. The test consists of six domains: desire, arousal, orgasm, pain, sexual satisfaction, lubrication. For each domain the total score goes from 0 to 6 (full sexual functionality).</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the emotional and psychological wellbeing considering the difference between the scores of the MHQ (Middle Sex Hospital Questionnaire) questionnaire administered at baseline and after normalization of thyroid function. The MHQ test is a self-administered questionnaire used for screening of mental disorders. It consists of six areas related to the free anxiety, phobic anxiety, obsessive compulsive symptoms, somatization, depressive symptoms and histrionic-hysterical traits.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the satisfaction of body image considering the difference between the scores of the BUT (Body Uneasiness Test) questionnaire administered at baseline and after normalization of thyroid function. The test consists of two parts (A and B) which respectively evaluate the degree of severity linked to body image and some sensory events derived from a precise area of the body. A reduction of the score between the baseline and the normalization of thyroid function would indicate an improvement in these aspects.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the influence of hormonal changes on the distress related to sexuality considering the difference between the scores of the FSDS (Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised) questionnaire administered at baseline and after normalization of thyroid function. A higher score (0-48) represents a greater sexual distress.</description>
