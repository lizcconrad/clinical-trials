  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the safety and tolerability of an investigational combination
      of drugs, radium-223 plus pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for castration-resistant
      prostate cancer.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Radium-223

        -  Pembrolizumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved radium-223 by itself as a
      treatment option for the participant's disease.

      The FDA has not approved pembrolizumab for the participant's specific disease, but it has
      been approved for other uses, such as a type of skin cancer called melanoma.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the immune response, safety and
      tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab (a type of immunotherapy drug) plus
      radium-223. Pembrolizumab works to block the PD-1 pathway, which plays an important role in
      lessening the activity of one's immune system to fight cancer. Pembrolizumab is therefore
      referred to as a PD-1 inhibitor, and acts by stimulating the patient's T cells, which are
      important immune cells, to attack tumors and treat cancer. Radium-223 targets cancer that
      exists in the bone directly. Radium-223 binds to minerals in the bone to deliver radiation
      directly to the cancer that has spread to the bones while limiting damage to the surrounding
      body tissues. Part of this study is to look at whether the investigators may more effectively
      control the participant's prostate cancer by combining these drugs. Radium-223 may kill
      cancer cells and release proteins specific to the tumor. The participant's immune system can
      then use those proteins to teach the T cells what the cancer looks like, and identify it for
      attack. Pembrolizumab can increase the number and activity of these immune cells, building a
      T cell &quot;army&quot; specialized to recognize and attack the cancer. The way these two drugs work on
      the cancer and the immune system may result in better control of the tumor than just
      radium-223 alone but needs to be investigated.

             agree to use a condom (even men with vasectomies) and another effective method of
             birth control if he is having sex with a woman of childbearing potential or agree to
             use a condom if he is having sex with a woman who is pregnant while on study drug and

          -  Prior treatment with a PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 blocking therapy

          -  Evidence of nodal disease greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis as these
             findings are concerning for metastases that would not be targeted with radium-223
             alone (Arm B). However, lymph nodes with short axis measurements between 1.5-3cm that
             have not enlarged more than 5mm (to account for reader variability) over the last 6
             months and which are not inducing symptoms, causing obstruction, or in the opinion of
             the investigator pose a risk of impending obstruction of any structures, will be
             allowed.

          -  Pulmonary nodules &gt;10 mm

             --Pulmonary nodules &gt;10mm that have been stable for &gt;6 months and are not clearly

             acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant medications (e.g., limited low-dose
             dexamethasone for nausea, multiple doses for contrast allergy) may be enrolled in the
             study and would not require a 7 day washout.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study

          -  Has had prior systemic therapy (exception: GnRH agonist or antagonist) or radiation
             therapy for prostate cancer within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1. There must be at
             least a 2 week washout period from last dose of any prior systemic or radiation
             therapy for prostate cancer prior to Day 1 of study treatment (including nonsteroidal
             antiandrogens). Screening may commence during this washout window.

             have possible endocrine effects on prostate cancer that have been started within the
             past 8 weeks, as they may affect PSA levels or response. These are allowed if the
             patient has been on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to C1D1.

          -  Receiving other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions to compounds with similar biologic or chemical

             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has is planned for curative therapy.

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis. A history
             of radiation pneumonitis which is asymptomatic with no signs of active process is
             allowed.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
             HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab. In addition,
             these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA is
             detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

          -  Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines
             and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, severe or unstable angina, myocardial infarction, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure (defined as New York Heart Association Grade II or greater), arterial or
             venous thromboembolic events (e.g., pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident
             including transient ischemic attacks) or clinically significant ventricular
             arrhythmias within 6 months prior to randomization; or significant vascular disease
             (e.g., aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection), symptomatic peripheral vascular disease

          -  Evidence of QTc prolongation as defined as QTcF &gt; 470 ms
