  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective registry study to surveil early liver injuries caused by Xianlin Gubao
      Capsule (XLGB Capsule) through a non-intervention observational way. And attempt to establish
      a predictive model to screen susceptibilities to XLGB Capsule.

      The primary objectives of this study include:

      (i) The detection of patients with serum liver biochemistry abnormalities within 8 weeks
      after intake of XLGB Capsule; (ii) The record of overall individuals with demographics,
      underlying diseases, physical status, medication information, clinical laboratory index, and
      so on; (iii) The specimen collection of surveiled individuals. (iv) The attempt to establish
      a predictive model to screen susceptibilities to XLGB Capsule.
