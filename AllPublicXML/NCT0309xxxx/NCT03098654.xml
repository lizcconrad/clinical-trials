  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on the integration of HIV and NCD screening and care. The investigators
      will conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
      the intervention strategy in Kisarawe District, Tanzania, a rural area 40 KM southwest of Dar
      es Salaam. The study will match two similar HIV care and treatment centers (CTC) in the
      District, one of which will be randomized to receive the enhanced intervention which will
      integrate diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN) screening with the existing HIV testing
      program, and integrate care for DM and HTN into the HIV care program. Comparisons of the
      community HIV testing rates in the two communities, engagement in HIV care among those
      testing positive, and 24-month retention in HIV care will be assessed among a cohort of 89
      newly enrolled patients per community.

      Specifically, the aims are to determine:

        1. Whether integrating DM and HTN screening with HIV testing will increase the uptake of
           community-level HIV testing.

        2. If integrating DM/HTN care with HIV care enhances engagement in HIV care.

        3. Whether integration of DM/HTN care with HIV care enhances retention in HIV care for
           those newly enrolled in HIV care.

        4. The cost-effectiveness of integrating NCD screening and care with HIV screening and care
           with regard to the incremental cost per HIV infected client engaged in HIV care, and
           cost per newly enrolled HIV client retained in HIV care over 24-months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Uptake of community-level HIV testing</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Uptake of HIV testing will be measured as the annual cumulative number of unique persons receiving HIV testing as a proportion of the community size in each HIV CTC venue using clinic records from the government CTC.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement in HIV care</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement will be measured as proportion of persons testing positive for HIV who advance to successful enrollment in HIV care at the CTC. Persons will be documented with biometric fingerprint matching against those who tested for HIV in the study area. Comparisons will be made across the enhanced and comparison CTCs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention in HIV care</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retention in HIV care will be measured in several ways, including the Human Resources and Services Administration HIV/AIDS Bureau definition of 2 or more outpatient visits at least 3-months apart during each year, the number of missed clinic visits, and appointment adherence (number of completed visits/number of scheduled visits) during the study period.</description>

The GPAQ is a 12-item survey created by the World Health Organization to measure physical activity (intensity, duration, and frequency) and domains of performance (related to occupation, transportation, and leisure).</description>

    <description>Members will have DM and HTN managed at the CTC together with their HIV care. Interventions include:
Community mobilization activities to inform community members of available services
Support at the local health center to aid clinicians in managing uncontrolled cases of DM and HTN, including training for clinical staff, glucometers/test strips, and BP monitors.
HIV counseling and serial rapid HIV testing
Blood glucose and blood pressure testing
DM/HTN medications as needed
Personalized diet and lifestyle counseling for all participants with elevated glucose or BP that includes education, dietary assessment and recommendations, advice on physical activity, and the need to regularly monitor their glucose/BP.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Members in the control arm will receive community-level rapid HIV testing at the CTCs, which is the standard of care. HIV testing performed by the CTC is according to the National HIV Testing Algorithm (serial rapid testing using Determine HIV 1/2 and Uni-Gold HIV 1/2) which follows Tanzanian and international (WHO/CDC) standards for provision of HIV counseling and testing. Those who test positive for HIV will be referred to the CTC for the standard Tanzanian level of HIV care, which includes counseling and ART medication managed at the CTCs.</description>

    <description>Diabetes will be assessed using a 6-question risk assessment on a 10-point scale (based on a field-tested and culturally adapted International Diabetes Federation formula on DM risk factors and symptoms) and a random blood glucose test with a portable finger stick glucose monitor. Those with either: (1) a risk score of 5 or more, or (2) a random blood glucose with a value greater than 140 mg/dl, will be asked to return after fasting for at least 8 hours to have a fasting glucose test taken. Blood pressure will be assessed using a portable battery operated automatic BP cuff. The BP test will include three values taken at least 5-minutes apart and the 3 will be averaged to determine the final value.</description>
