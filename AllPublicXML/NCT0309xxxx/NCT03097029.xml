  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with short bowel syndrome have a high mortality rate that is mainly attributed to
      complications from central lines and long-term intravenous (IV) nutrition. There are few
      medical therapies to date that improve gut absorption in patients with short bowel syndrome.
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if absorption from the GI tract improves
      in subjects with short bowel syndrome following therapy with pancreatic enzymes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study of subjects with short bowel syndrome to determine if enteral
      absorption improves following therapy with pancreatic enzymes. The study will assess enteral
      absorption and nutritional status at baseline through a series of stool tests, blood tests,
      and anthropometric measurements. Following approximately ten days of therapy with pancreatic
      enzymes, the study will reassess enteral absorption.

    <measure>Change in Coefficient of Fat Absorption</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the amount of fat excreted in the stool compared to how much fat was consumed over the course of 72 hours. This is a measure of fat absorption.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Coefficient of Nitrogen Absorption</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the amount of nitrogen excreted in the stool compared to how much nitrogen was consumed in a 72 hour period. This is a measure of protein absorption.</description>

    <measure>Change in Stool bomb calorimetry</measure>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Malabsorption Blood Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>This test will only be performed on subjects 18 years or older. This an isotope test. Subjects consume a high fat shake with two labeled fats. They have blood tests measured at baseline and then every 1 hour for 8 hours to check for serum levels of labeled fats. This helps determine how well the labeled fats are being absorbed by the intestine.</description>

             tract that impacts absorption or digestions

          -  motility disorder

          -  medications that directly alter fat absorption

          -  cholestatic liver disease defined as a serum conjugated bilirubin greater than 1.0
             mg/dL, chronic renal failure, gout, or hyperuricemia
