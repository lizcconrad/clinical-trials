  <brief_summary>

      This research study is investigating a drug as a possible treatment for metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma. The intervention involved in this study is TAK-228.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved TAK-228 as a treatment for
      any disease but it is being investigated as a treatment for advanced solid tumors, blood
      disorders, and inflammatory diseases. TAK-228 works to inhibit or interfere with cellular
      functions involved in cell growth and survival. TAK-228 specifically targets a type of
      protein that can make chemicals that trigger cell growth, including cancer cell growth. This
      protein may also cause cells to produce proteins that trigger the development of new blood
      vessels. Cancers need new blood vessels in order to grow. In some types of cancer, this type
      of protein (mTOR) is switched on, and it makes the cancer cells grow and produce new blood
      vessels. mTOR blockers (inhibitors) are a newer type of cancer growth blocker that can stop
      the growth of some types of cancer.

      Researchers hope to learn how participants with previously treated mRCC will respond to
      treatment with TAK-228. Other goals of this study include assessing the types of side effects
      associated TAK-228 and whether there is a relationship between certain genetic mutations
      (changes to your DNA) and participant responses to the drug.
