  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In health,adipose tissue stores fat from the diet. If the fat tissue stops storing dietary
      fat then this increases the chance of it being stored in the liver, which is related to
      increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. It has been suggested that having a diet
      high in sugars or certain fats, may cause the fat tissue and liver to change how they
      function; we would like to investigate this in detail.

      This research aims to investigate how the overconsumption of specific macronutrients may
      effect adipose tissue and liver metabolism and function. Liver and heart fat content and
      adipose tissue and liver metabolism fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism will be
      assessed before and after the specific dietary intervention.
