    <textblock>
      Heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is hardly studied.
      Though a reduced HRV in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has
      been associated with poor prognosis. Data on HRV in AF-patients without a reduced ejection
      fraction is lacking. We hypothesize that those patients with persistent atrial fibrillation
      and larger beat-to-beat variability would be more symptomatic than does those with smaller
      HRV. To asses this theory we intend to perform a prospective observational trial. Symptoms of
      Atrial fibrillation will be assessed using Quality of Life questionnaires and 6 minutes
      walking test. Heart rate variability will be assessed using 24 hour Holter ECG monitoring.

      The correlation between symptoms and heart rate variability will be then assessed.
