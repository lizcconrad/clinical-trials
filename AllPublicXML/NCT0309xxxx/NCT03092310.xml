      The purpose of this pilot study is to establish that closed-loop insulin delivery with a
      target enchanted model predictive control (eMPC)/Health Monitoring System (HMS) algorithms
      with a trust index of the predicted glucose value is safe and effective, to analyze and learn
      to improve upon the accuracy of the predicted glucose values, and to collect efficacy data to
      inform a future larger study.

      This is a feasibility study of an artificial pancreas (AP) system with our previously
      validated target eMPC and HMS algorithms, with the addition of a trust index of the predicted
      glucose value integrated into the portable Artificial Pancreas System (pAPS). The system will
      be evaluated on up to 20 subjects, with the goal of 10 subjects completing a 48-hour
      closed-loop session at one clinical site (William Sansum Diabetes Center). During the session
      subjects will bolus for all meals and snacks and perform a 45-minute walking session.

    <description>The artificial pancreas device will employ its enhanced Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm with a target glucose level of 110 mg/dL with a trust index for MPC-predicted glucose values, weighing future glucose predictions and only acting on predictions with higher weight in the trust index. The Health Monitoring System algorithm uses the same CGM data as the MPC control algorithm but utilizes a separate algorithm for trending and predictions of future glucose values. Using a redundant and independent algorithm is an important safety feature of the overall AP device.</description>
