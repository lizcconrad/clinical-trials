  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate use of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) including dose-reduction is important for
      patient's safety in T2DM patients with renal impairment (RI). However, there are insufficient
      data on dose adjustment in accordance with the prescription pattern and the risk of RI of
      OADs, in particular DPP-4 inhibitors, in clinical practice in Japan. Therefore, we will
      investigate OADs usage conditions and dose selection in T2DM patients with RI in clinical
      practice in Japan
