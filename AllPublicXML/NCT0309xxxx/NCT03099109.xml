    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as LY3321367, an
      anti-T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain domain-containing molecule-3 (TIM-3) antibody
      administered alone or in combination with LY3300054, an anti-programmed death ligand 1
      (PD-L1) antibody, in participants with advanced relapsed/refractory solid tumors.
