      Chronic intestinal inflammation produce dysplasia more frequently than the normal population.
      The therapies protect against these changes, but do not rule out dysplasia. It is not known
      the effect of different therapies protection.

      The literature data show that the inflammatory bowel diseases (rectal ulcerative colitis and
      Crohn's disease) determine an increased risk of developing dysplasia and cancer of the colon
      and rectum, for the chronic inflammation that they fee, with the differences that the two
      diseases arise. The progression from normal mucosa to dysplasia and then to cancer is more
      rapid than in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence.

      In patients with idiopathic chronic inflammatory colitis drug therapies in use reduce the
      incidence of dysplasia.

      A systematic review concluded in favor of a chemo preventive effect of mesalazine. In any
      case, it has been reported protective association between use of mesalazine and cancer
      associated with colitis (colitis Associated carcinoma CAC) with an odds ratio of 0.51 per CAC
      / dysplasia. This data, in subsequent studies, including recent ones, have remained
      controversial.

      The introduction of biological drugs in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) has changed the quality of life and also the natural history of the disease. It
      is not known what biological drugs have improved the clinical history of these diseases by
      changing the incidence of dysplasia and colorectal cancer.

      The treatment of idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), the last decade has seen
      profound changes and, now, the use of biological drugs is frequent in the moderate-severe
      forms, especially if extended. Mesalazine has in the indication of mild to moderate forms of
      therapy.
