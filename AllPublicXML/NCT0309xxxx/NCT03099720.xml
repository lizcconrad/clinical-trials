  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a hysterectomy, women tend to experience high levels of pain, and many require
      strong pain killers after the procedure. Ropivacaine is a local anaesthetic drug (injectable
      numbing medication) which works by blocking pain signals. The aim of this study is to find
      out whether injections of ropivacaine during surgery can help provide effective pain relief
      after surgery.Women aged between 45 and 70 who are having a vaginal hysterectomy can
      participate in the trial. Participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups. Those in
      the first group are given injections of ropivacaine at the site of the wound and in the
      peritoneum (space in the body that holds the organs in the abdomen) and those in the second
      group are given injections of a saline fluid in the same places that offers no pain relief
      before the end of their surgery. Participants in both groups are then regularly asked to rate
      their pain levels up to 24 hours after surgery. In addition, the pain killers they receive
      and length of hospital stay are recorded. There is a chance that the participants who receive
      the ropivacaine will benefit from lower pain levels after surgery. There are no notable risks
      of participating.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At end of the vaginal hysterectomy operation, the gynecologist will inject the uterosacral,
      cardinal ligaments, adnexal areas and the vaginal edge with 15 ml of either the ropivacaine
      solution or the placebo fluid in each side, then 20 ml will be instilled inside the
      peritoneum. Analgesia will be given on request after operation. Visual analogue score of 0 to
      100 mm will be used to assess the degree of pain, with 0 indicating no pain and 100
      indicating worst pain.
