  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic and lung neuroendocrine tumors are generally
      malignancies with a prolonged natural history. However, clinical behavior is heterogeneous
      and when tumor progression is observed, treatment options are limited. The most used therapy
      for neuroendocrine tumors management are somatostatin analogs. However, even the use in lung
      carcinoids is quite usual, no antitumoral activity has been demonstrated. Tremelimumab and
      Durvalumab combination could be more efficient drugs to improve immune system activation and
      could obtain a significantly higher clinical benefit in these patients. Tremelimumab and
      Durvalumab would be the first immune combination agents showing efficacy in neuroendocrine
      neoplasms of different origins.
