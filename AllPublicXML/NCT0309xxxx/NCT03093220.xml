  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a heterogeneous disease causing great morbidity,
      mortality and health care burden globally. Typing methods for discriminating different
      clinical conditions of the same disease are essential to a better management of CAP.
      Traditional typing systems based separately on clinical manifestations (such as PSI and
      CURB-65), pathogens(bacterial types, virulence, drug resistance, etc) or host immune state
      (immunocompetent, immunocompromised or immunodeficiency). Thus, they are barely able to
      represent the real disease status nor to precisely predict the mortality.

      As the development of multi-omic technologies, the relatedness of different phenotypes at a
      molecular level have revolutionized our ability to differentiate among patients. Our study is
      aimed at establishing a novel molecular typing method of CAP. Multi-omic (including genomics,
      transcriptomes, and metabolisms) data obtained from enrolled CAP patients and isolated
      pathogens would be integrated analyzed and interpreted. Tthe investigators believe that an
      appropriate molecular typing method would lead to revolutionary changes in current
      arrangements of CAP.
