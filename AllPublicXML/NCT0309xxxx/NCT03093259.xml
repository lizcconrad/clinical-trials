      This Phase IIa study is an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study aiming
      at evaluating the safety and the efficacy of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in
      subjects with moderate to severe Active Ulcerative Colitis who have failed or are intolerant
      to immunomodulators, Anti-TNFα, vedolizumab and/or corticosteroids followed by a one-month
      follow-up period.

      at evaluating the safety and the efficacy of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in
      subjects with moderate to severe Active Ulcerative Colitis who have failed or are intolerant
      to immunomodulators, Anti-TNFα, vedolizumab and/or corticosteroids followed by a one-month
      follow-up period.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized according to a 2/1 ratio in two different groups of
      treatment. Randomized subjects who will receive 50 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 56 days.

          -  History of toxic megacolon, abdominal abscess, symptomatic colonic stricture or stoma;
             history or is at imminent risk of colectomy;

          -  History or current evidence of colonic dysplasia or adenomatous colonic polyps.
             Subject with severe gastrointestinal complications; e.g., short bowel syndromes,
