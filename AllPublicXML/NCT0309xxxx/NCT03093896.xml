  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is also a major risk factor for development of dementia later in life.
      Findings from recent studies suggest that the there are many nutrients contained in foods
      that may be important in cognitive function in the elderly. This study evaluates long-term
      intervention with almonds and snack mix as a treatment strategy for age-related cognitive
      impairment which could possibly prevent the onset of dementia.

      The proposed study is designed as a randomized, placebo controlled trial that tests the
      effects of 6 month supplementation with 1.5 or 3 ounces of almonds or 3 ounces of shortbread
      containing coconut oil on cognitive function in older adults. Secondary outcomes include
      plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.

      The study is designed as a controlled trial that tests the effects of 6 month supplementation
      with 1.5 or 3 ounces of almonds or 3 ounces of snack mix a day on cognitive function in older
      adults. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Secondary outcomes
      include plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Participants will be
      recruited from community-dwelling men and women aged greater than of equal to 50 yr and less
      than or equal to 75 years and potential participants will be screened to meet cognitive and
      functional criteria. Participants will be pre-screened by telephone; those who appear to meet
      criteria will undergo further screening.
