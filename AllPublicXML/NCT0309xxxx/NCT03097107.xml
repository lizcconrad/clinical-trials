      SARO.15.001.04 is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel arm, 12-week study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Saroglitazar
      Magnesium 1, 2 and 4 mg in patients with fasting triglyceride ≥500 mg/dL and ≤1500 mg/dL.

      A total 124 subjects will be enrolled in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 to receive either Saroglitazar
      Magnesium 1 mg, Saroglitazar Magnesium 2 mg, Saroglitazar Magnesium 4 mg, or placebo.
