      Objective: To analyze the effect of cold water immersion (CWI) on the recovery of clinical,
      biochemical, functional and neuromuscular markers of muscle damage in 10 km street runners.

      Materials and Methods: This is a randomized, blinded trial in which 30 subjects, 10 km street
      runners, were randomly divided into three groups: control (gC), immersion (gI) and CWI
      (gCWI). The runners will be evaluated for clinical (subjective perception of exertion),
      biochemical (serum CK), functional (unipodal triple hop distance and shuttle test time) and
      neuromuscular variables by means of isokinetic variables (peak torque, total work and fatigue
      index). Volunteers will perform pre-assessment, immediately post-race and post-intervention,
      and 24-hour post-intervention. The data will be expressed by mean and standard deviation,
      analyzed in the statistical package SPSS 20.0. A significance level of 5% and a 95%
      confidence interval will be considered for all measures.
