      Objective: Identify modifiable factors that may affect asthma control and the use of
      emergency room to define customized interventions for the management of asthma prior to
      emergency room.

      Emergency department attendance is always a sign of poor balance or control of asthma. In
      spite of a decrease in the number of deaths that has been halved in 20 years and
      hospitalization due to asthmatic disease, the use of emergency center for this disease has
      not decreased. We now know that the passage through emergencies and hospitalization for
      aggravation of asthma is in itself a factor of mortality. Acting on the determinants of poor
      balance or control of asthma is essential to further reduce the mortality and morbidity of
      asthma.

      There is two parts in this study:

      Part 1 - Qualitative study by individual interviews until data saturation (although about ten
      patients should be enough to capture the concepts of interest) on the factors that induce an
      imbalance of asthma (based on the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) report whose criteria
      are validated).

      An interview guide will be written to systematically address all aspects related to asthma
      control.

      In agreement with the patient the interview will be recorded, and the verbatim will be
      transcribed and coded using a software (Nvivo version 10).

      Preparation of a questionnaire

      A questionnaire will be developed from:

        -  analysis of patient verbatim

        -  other data: GINA criteria, psychological criteria (psychological distress is assessed by
           the 12-item general health questionnaire (GHQ-12) which is valid psychometric tools in
           French) and social criteria.

      Part 2-Observational cohort qualitative study. The questionnaire thus prepared will be placed
      in the patient file upon admission. As soon as possible it will be filled by the patient
      after improvement of his condition and collected by the doctor or nurse who took care of the
      patient.

      To obtain sufficient power to demonstrate significant associations, and assuming that 15
      variables are taken into account in a multivariate model and based on the recommendations of
      10 subjects per variable, 150 patients are required.
