  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemic
      events in subjects who use insulin pens to treat their Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).
      Hypoglycemia is the number one fear of many individuals and families with someone who has
      type 1 diabetes, and this fear often prevents optimal glycemic control. It is expected that
      this protocol will yield increased knowledge about using a decision support system to help
      control the glucose level.

      This study is a 12-week parallel group multi-center randomized trial designed to compare
      CGM+DSS with CGM alone. The DSS to be implemented contains a &quot;smart&quot; bolus advisor that
      adjusts the size of correction insulin boluses based on short term blood glucose predictions.
      It is able to complete this function by evaluating CGM values, insulin usage and carbohydrate
      intake record. It also contains an exercise advisor, a bedtime advisor, hypoglycemia risk and
      long-term tracker of HbA1c.

      inControl-Advice, a smart-phone based medical software platform, is designed to provide
      advice to users. It receives data from an insulin pen and then adjustments the insulin
      delivery every 5 minutes. The system provides a series of real-time alerts and on-demand
      advice, for both dosing of insulin and ingestion of carbohydrates, based on data collected
      from T1DM patients (i.e. carbohydrate consumption, insulin injected, CGM) and inConrol Cloud
      analytics.
