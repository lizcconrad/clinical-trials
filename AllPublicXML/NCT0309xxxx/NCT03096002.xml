  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address whether inactive individuals with prediabetes who
      take part in the Small Steps for Big Changes program, which is a 3-week supervised exercise
      and lifestyle change program with brief counseling, will be more adherent to regular exercise
      one year after program completion compared to before they took part in the program.

      The study is a one-group repeated measures design and the primary outcome is exercise
      adherence at 12 months post the 3-week supervised exercise program. There is no randomization
      of individuals to conditions. Exercise adherence will be measured using self-report physical
      activity (using the Godin leisure time exercise questionnaire) and a subsample will also wear
      tri-axial accelerometers to measure total time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical
      activity assessed over 7 days. Secondary outcomes include physical fitness, haemoglobin A1C,
      quality of life, self-regulatory efficacy, anthropometrics, diet and exercise-related
      cognitive errors.

      The 3-week lifestyle program includes six sessions with a lifestyle coach and exercise
      sessions performed at home. These sessions will focus on regular healthy lifestyle that
      includes walking (or exercise of any kind) at least three times per week and will highlight
      simple dietary strategies that are linked to reduced risk of T2D. The 3-week supervised
      exercise program includes brief exercise counseling sessions that teach participants
      self-regulatory skills to promote independence and long-term adherence to exercise and a
      healthy diet. At the conclusion of the three-week program, participants will be asked to
      continue exercising a minimum of three times per week for twelve months on their own.

    <description>The 3-week lifestyle change program will introduce participants to a regular healthy lifestyle including exercise and dietary changes for reducing sugar intake, reducing refined/processed carbohydrate intake, increasing vegetable consumption. The 3-week program will include six supervised exercise sessions and three exercise sessions performed independently (e.g., at home or outside of the lab). The supervised session will include brief behavioral counseling sessions that teach participants self-regulatory skills to promote independence and long-term adherence to exercising and dietary changes.</description>
