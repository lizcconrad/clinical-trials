    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened at Intermountain Medical Center and at Intermountain affiliated
      anticoagulation clinics in the Salt Lake City region. Patients with atrial fibrillation that
      undergo a standard of care, clinically approved, left atrial appendage closure will be
      considered for study. All patients will be followed for 24 months, and will be assessed at
      the 3-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months post-left atrial appendage closure as well as other visits
      deemed necessary for clinical care. All subjects will undergo protocol-specified laboratory
      tests and will complete 6 standard, validated questionnaires at each follow-up visit, except
      at the 3-month visit when only one questionnaire will be administered.
