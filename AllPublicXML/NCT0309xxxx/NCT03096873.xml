    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to observe therapeutic effects of combined resistance and
      aerobic exercise training (CRAE) on hyperinsulemia in obese adolescent girls. Forty obese
      adolescent girls (14Â±1 years) participated in this study. The participants were randomly
      separated into two groups; no-exercise group (n=20) and exercise group (n=20). The exercise
      group performed 12 weeks of CRAE.

    <intervention_name>Combined Exercise Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The combined exercise training were consisted with 5 minutes of warm-up, 20 minutes of resistant band exercises (Upper: seated rows, biceps curl, shoulder flexion, elbow flexion, pushup; Lower: hip flexion, hip extension, calf raise, leg press, squat), 30 minutes of treadmill walking, and 5 minutes of cool-down. Intensity of the training was gradually increased from 40-50% heart rate reserve in 1-4 weeks to 60-70% HRR in 9-12 weeks.</description>
