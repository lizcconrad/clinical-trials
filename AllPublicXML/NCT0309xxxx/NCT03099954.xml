      Measure pulse wave velocity stability in relation to time of day, day of the week, physical
      activity, sleep quality, stress levels and blood pressure.

      The study population will be an estimated 300 healthy adult subjects from the United States.
      This population will be approximately 150 men and 150 women. In order to obtain a relatively
      diverse age range of users (with varying levels of arterial stiffness), we hope to enroll
      participants across three age ranges entered in the Withings application by the user: 18-40
      years, 41-60 years, and &gt; 60 years. These spots will be filled by those that satisfy the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria on a first come, first served basis.
