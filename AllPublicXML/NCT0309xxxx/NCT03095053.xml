      Introduction Embryo aneuploidy is likely the leading cause of implantation failure in IVF
      cycles. Since the inception of IVF, non-invasive morphology based scoring has mostly been
      used in the selection of embryos for transfer, resulting in relative low embryo implantation
      rates. Our understanding of the optimal conditions required for in vitro embryo culture in
      IVF has advanced significantly over the past two decades. The implementation of improved in
      vitro embryo culture technologies (i.e., culture media and incubators) has resulted in an
      increase in the number of good quality embryos and consequently in the number of blastocysts
      developing. While blastocyst transfers have seemingly improved the reproductive outcomes of
      IVF, the use of improved preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) technologies have revealed
      embryo implantation still to be sub-optimal. The main objective of this randomized controlled
      trial will be to investigate the superiority of comprehensive chromosome screening (CCS)
      euploid blastocyst transfer compared to morphology scored blastocyst transfer, in FET.

      Methods This trial will be performed as a single-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) in
      a segmented-IVF program, with intracyoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), blastocyst freeze-all
      and artificial frozen embryo transfer (art-FET). Normo-ovulatory infertile patients, with
      maternal age ≤35 years and at least two blastocysts with a morphology grade of 2BB
      cryopresreved, will be randomized by computer generated randomized allocation to one CCS or
      the morphology group. All transfers will be single embryo tranfers (SET) in art-FET, with
      only the first transfers following the ICSI blastocysts freeze-all included.

      Consent and Ethics Akdeniz University Medical Faculty Clinical Research Ethics Committee has
      approved the trial (reference number: 2015/399), with anonymized results to be released in
      ClinicalTrials.gov. All patients will provide informed consent, which included an agreement
      for the use of anonymised data for research.

      Introduction Embryo aneuploidy is likely the leading cause of implantation failure in IVF
      cycles. Since the inception of IVF, non-invasive morphology based scoring has mostly been
      used in the selection of embryos for transfer, resulting in relative low embryo implantation
      rates. Embryo morphology assessment methods have significant limitations (i.e., the
      assessments are subjective and the method uses fixed time-point assessments to define dynamic
      embryo development) and shortcomings (i.e., exposes embryos to sub-optimal conditions during
      assessment). Notwithstanding the limitations and shortcomings of this method its use
      world-wide has continued, because it is a relatively simple and non-invasive method and its
      scores have been shown to be positively correlated to embryo euploidy, ongoing pregnancy, and
      live birth (Van Royen et al., 1999, Ahlstrom et al., 2011, Forman et al., 2013, Capalbo et
      al., 2014, Oron et al., 2014, Rhenman et al., 2015).

      However multiple gestations still represents one of the most significant complications in
      IVF, which are mainly the result of multiple-embryo embryo transfers, with multiple-embryo
      transfers used to overcome the relatively low embryo implantation rates in IVF. Our
      understanding of the optimal conditions required for in vitro embryo culture in IVF has
      advanced significantly in the past two decades. The implementation of improved in vitro
      embryo culture technologies (i.e., culture media and incubators) has resulted in an increase
      in the number of good quality embryos and consequently in the number of blastocysts
      developing. While blastocyst transfers have seemingly improved the reproductive outcomes in
      IVF, the increased use of single embryo transfer (SET) and the use of improved
      preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) technologies have revealed embryo implantation still
      to be sub-optimal (Schoolcraft et al., 2013). New CCS platforms were a major breakthrough in
      PGS, allowing 24-chromosome screening to be performed with high accuracy from single cells
      (Harper and Harton, 2010). Along with the evidence that morphology scores were only
      moderately associated with euploidy and that the transfer of CCS euploid embryos resulted in
      higher implantation rates (Dahdouh et al., 2015), the continued use of morphology based
      scoring methods has increasingly being challenged.

      In addition to all the other advances in IVF, significant improvements have also been made in
      cryopreservation technologies. These improvements have resulted in significant improvements
      in frozen-thawed embryo survival (i.e. minimizing of risks), post-thaw developmental
      competence (Cobo et al., 2012; Balaban et al., 2008), and in the reproductive outcomes of FET
      (Evans et al., 2014; Ozgur et al., 2015). The benefits of FET include; the transfer of
      embryos to a more physiologic endometrium (i.e., early luteal phase), the capability to time
      transfers more accurately, and patient specific endometrial preparations can be used (Casper
      and Yanushpolsky, 2016, Franasiak et al., 2016; Groenewoud et al., 2013, Yarali et al.,
      2016).

      More RCT are required to confirm whether CCS in selecting blastocysts for transfer was truly
      superior over the conventional morphology based selection of blastocysts, in terms of
      reproductive outcomes. The present study will test the superiority of CCS selection by
      comparing FET reproductive outcomes of blastocyst freeze-all cycles; to avoid the
      complications associated with controlled ovarian stimulations (COS) when using fresh ET.

      Objectives The main objective of this RCT will be to investigate the superiority of the
      reproductive outcomes of CCS euploid blastocyst FET compared to morphology scored blastocyst
      FET. The choice to transfer all blastocyts in FET will eliminate any confounding related to
      endometrial development, while a freeze-all strategy ensures the comparison of primary
      blastocysts. The ultimate aim of this study is to investigate which one of the two blastocyst
      selection methods is most efficient in terms of ongoing pregnancy rates. Ongoing pregnancy
      rate will be defined as an intrauterine pregnancy with a fetal-heart beat on ultrasound at
      5-8 gestational weeks that continues passed 14 weeks.

      Secondary objectives The secondary objectives of measurement of the RCT will be to
      investigate whether the early pregnancy loss is also superior for CCS euploid blastocysts
      compared to for morphology scored blastocysts.
