      The purpose of the phase 1, GTO-003 clinical study is to determine the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of a new drug called GC4711 when given as an oral
      tablet. This study will compare capsules containing a liquid suspension of GC4711 when given
      orally to a similar drug called GC4419 which will be given as an intravenous infusion. This
      study will also assess the effect of food on GC4711.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GTO-003 is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose
      study conducted in Australia to compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of orally
      administered GC4711 with Intravenously administered GC4419, with an assessment of food
      effects. The study will be conducted in healthy adult volunteers, in two parts. In Part 1, a
      standard, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study will be performed. In Part 2, the
      conduct of which will be contingent on results of Part 1, a food effect cohort will be
      studied to investigate the effect of food on absorption.

      Consenting subjects will undergo screening procedures within 28 days of the start of dosing.
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) (parent drug and major metabolites) will be assessed in plasma and
      urine from all subjects.

      Part 1: GC4711 or matching placebo will be administered once by mouth for a single dose at
      escalating doses starting with one capsule (82 mg) and escalating to 5 capsules (410 mg). The
      oral GC4711 drug product will be enteric-coated size 0 Capsugel Vcap Plus hard gel capsule
      containing GC4711 in a liquid formulation.

      It is anticipated that at least 5 dose cohorts will be tested and depending on safety and PK
      outcome, additional serial cohorts may be added. Subjects in all cohorts will receive a
      single dose of oral GC4711 or placebo 48 hours after a single dose of IV GC4419 administered
      over 60 minutes. For all cohorts, 8 subjects per cohort will be enrolled, randomized 6:2 to
      active GC4711 or matched placebo. All cohorts will include a sentinel cohort consisting of
      two subjects, one randomized to oral GC4711 and one to matching placebo who will be observed
      for 24 hours with safety data reviewed by the treating investigator before dosing of 6
      additional subjects in the full cohort (5 active: 1 placebo).

      After each cohort, safety and PK data will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and the
      internal Galera study team before proceeding to the next cohort. Depending on the
      inter-subject variability in oral bioavailability, additional subjects may be added to one or
      more dosing cohorts or additional cohorts may be added.

      Subjects will also undergo electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring at selected PK time points, to
      include the estimated Tmax, (anticipated to be 2-4 hours after a dose of GC4711), to assess
      the relationship between drug exposure to GC4419/GC4711 and effects on the QT interval.

      Part 2: After completion of the single-ascending dose portion of the study, a separate cohort
      of subjects will receive a single dose of GC4711 (at a dose no higher than previously found
      to have an acceptable safety profile), under fasted or fed conditions, followed, after a
      7-day washout period, of a second single dose of oral GC4711, at the same dose as before,
      under the opposite condition (fed or fasting). In the food effect cohort, subjects will be
      randomly assigned 1:1 to the fed-fasted sequence (i.e., either fed-first or fasted-first).
      For the fed condition, subjects will receive a standard meal. There will be no placebo dosing
      or IV GC4419 dosing in the food effect cohort.

      Approximately 58 health adult volunteers will be enrolled into this study: 40 in Part 1 and
      18 in Part 2. For each cohort, the study will consist of a Screening period, a Baseline visit
      and an Active Phase. The duration for an individual subject will depend on their assignment
      to study part.
