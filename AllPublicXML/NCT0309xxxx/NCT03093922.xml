      The purpose of this study is to compare any good and bad effects the study drug atezolizumab
      has on the cancer when combined with the standard chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and
      cisplatin (or GC) in two different dosing schedules: chemotherapy (GC) before atezolizumab
      vs. GC after atezolizumab.
