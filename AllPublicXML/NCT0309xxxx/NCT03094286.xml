    <textblock>
      The proposal is a phase II clinical study designed to assess the feasibility of durvalumab
      (MEDI4736) in HIV-1-infected individuals with solid tumors. Additionally, to obtain data that
      lets understand the possible benefit of this treatment in cancer patients and HIV infection,
      exploring if activity of durvalumab (MEDI4736) could be higher in cancer that has been
      produced at least in part due to the chronic immunosupression. Simultaneously, it will allow
      us to investigate the effect of disrupting this immunoregulatory pathway might have in
      reversing cancer pathways and HIV-specific T-cell function during persistent chronic HIV
      infection in humans.

      PD-1/ PD-L1 coinhibitory pathway plays a significant role in the regulation of the immune
      response in both chronic infectious diseases and cancer.

      Preclinical and animal data support the safety and promising activity of anti-PD-1 antibody
      in HIV-1 infection.

      Demonstrated anticancer activity and safety profile of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in cancer
      clinical trials.

      Unlikely drug interactions of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and antiretroviral treatments.

      The proposal is a phase II clinical study designed to assess the feasibility of durvalumab
      (MEDI4736) in HIV-1-infected individuals with solid tumors. Additionally, to obtain data that
      lets understand the possible benefit of this treatment in cancer patients and HIV infection,
      exploring if activity of durvalumab (MEDI4736) could be higher in cancer that has been
      produced at least in part due to the chronic immunosupression. Simultaneously, it will allow
      us to investigate the effect of disrupting this immunoregulatory pathway might have in
      reversing cancer pathways and HIV-specific T-cell function during persistent chronic HIV
      infection in humans.

      In this regard, our hypothesis is:

      HIV patients with cancer have a similar outcome in terms of tolerability when treated with
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy at the recommended dose than non HIV infected patients.
