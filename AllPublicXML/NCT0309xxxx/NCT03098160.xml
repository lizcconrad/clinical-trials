      An immunotherapy study combining ipilimumab and evofosfamide for the treatment of patients
      with confirmed metastatic or locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer,
      melanoma or human papillomavirus (HPV) negative squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck that
      have failed to respond to standard therapy, progressed despite standard therapy, for which
      standard therapy does not offer the potential for increased survival.

    <textblock>
      Tumor hypoxia can lead to poor effector T cell penetration and immunosuppressive signaling
      via myeloid-derived suppressor, myofibroblast and regulatory T cells. Disruption of these
      hypoxic regions within the tumor microenvironment by the hypoxia-directed cytotoxic agent
      evofosfamide may enhance the ability of the CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab to reject
      otherwise resistant solid tumors. Additionally, induction of immunogenic cell death of tumor
      cells by evofosfamide may enhance dendritic cell presentation of tumor antigens to
      lymphocytes in draining lymph nodes, leading to clonal expansion of tumor-specific T cells,
      especially in combination with ipilimumab.

             the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll at the discretion of the
             principle investigator. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease.

          6. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs: e.g. a condition associated with frequent diarrhea or chronic
             skin conditions, recent surgery or colonic biopsy from which the patient has not
             recovered, or partial endocrine organ deficiencies.

          7. Receiving QT-prolonging drugs with a risk of causing torsades de pointes (See Appendix

             infarction within 6 months, unstable symptomatic ischemic heart disease, active
             uncontrolled infection requiring systemic therapy, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         12. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             of day 1 of therapy.

             documented Child's class B and C cirrhosis, active pancreatitis or uncontrolled
             medical disease which in the opinion of the investigator could compromise assessment
             of efficacy.

         14. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive unless on highly active
             antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and/or known Hepatitis B or C on treatment. Drug

             hormonal therapy, except in the case of prostate cancer patients who are being treated
             anti-androgen or bone targeting therapies.

         20. Female patients who have been on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal
