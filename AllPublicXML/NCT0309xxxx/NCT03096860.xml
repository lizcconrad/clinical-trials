  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to investigate in a prospective randomized cross-over
      trial, the impact of alcohol versus a placebo drink on smoking behavior and topography
      (duration and frequency of puffing), abuse liability, and toxicity. It is hypothesized that
      drinking alcohol before smoking will be associated with longer puffs and shorter duration
      between puffs and greater abuse liability and toxicity.
