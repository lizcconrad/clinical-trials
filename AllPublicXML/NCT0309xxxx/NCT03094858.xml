  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants (N = 300) will be randomly assigned to: 1) an equipment-only comparison group
      that receives a smartphone and an activity monitor wristband but does not receive smartphone
      intervention prompts, or 2) the intervention group who will receive an activity monitor
      wristband that works in conjunction with a smartphone to reduce sedentary time via smartphone
      prompts during prolonged sedentary bouts. All participants will be provided with a Fitbit®
      wristband activity monitor and an Android smartphone on the same day of the week (i.e.,
      Mondays). Participants will complete a 1-week baseline accelerometer and EMA period prior to
      the start of the intervention. Participants will be followed for 26 weeks after the
      intervention begins with follow-up visits at 6, 13, and 26 weeks. The primary outcome will be
      accelerometer-measured time spent in sedentary activity. Sedentary breaks, total active time,
      and time spent in light, moderate, and vigorous activity will be additionally evaluated as
      outcomes. Contextual variables and potential treatment mechanisms will be assessed via
      traditional questionnaire measurement and daily random EMAs at baseline and all follow-up
      visits. Brief smartphone-based daily diary assessments will be completed daily for the
      duration of the study.
