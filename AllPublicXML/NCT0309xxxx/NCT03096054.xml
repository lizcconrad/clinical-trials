  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is looking at a drug called LY3143921 hydrate (a Cdc7 inhibitor) in adult
      patients with advanced solid tumours. The main aims are to find out the maximum dose of
      LY3143921 hydrate that can be given safely to patients, more about the potential side effects
      and how they can be treated

    <textblock>
      This clinical study is looking at a drug called LY3143921 hydrate (a Cdc7 inhibitor). Cdc7
      helps our cells replicate correctly. In normal cells, Cdc7 is usually found at a low level,
      but can reach higher levels in cancer cells. This is often the case in certain types of solid
      tumour cancers, which we will focus on in this study. It is thought that giving LY3143921
      hydrate will block the function of Cdc7 and will affect cancer cells by stopping their
      replication and causing them to die. LY3143921 hydrate looks promising in laboratory studies
      and studies in animals.

      This clinical study has two parts:

      Part 1 - a 'dose escalation' phase where groups of patients will receive increasing doses of
      LY3143921 hydrate to find a safe dose and a dose that best targets the cancer cells.

      Part 2 - an 'expansion' phase where a larger group of patients will receive the highest dose
      of LY3143921 hydrate considered to be safe from Part 1, to find out more about how the drug
      is working.

             NCI-CTCAE v4.02) with the exception of alopecia or certain Grade 2 toxicities, which
             in the opinion of the investigator and Sponsor should not exclude the patient - these
             should be discussed on a case by case basis.

             hormonal contraception and condom, have a intra-uterine device and condom, diaphragm
             with spermicidal gel and condom) for four weeks before entering the trial, during the
             trial and for six months afterwards are considered eligible.

          7. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception
             (e.g. condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.

          8. Patients must have recovered from effects or major surgery, no major surgery within 4
             weeks prior to the patient receiving Cycle 1 Day 7 (for dose escalation) or C1 Day1
             (for dose expansion). If minor surgery has been performed within 2 weeks of the start
             of trial treatment then the sponsor and CI should be notified of the nature of this
             and agree to patient inclusion.

          9. Co-existing active infection or serious concurrent medical condition.

         10. Known to be serologically positive for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (mandatory testing not required).

         12. Significant cardiovascular disease as defined by:

               1. History of congestive heart failure requiring therapy

               2. History of unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction up to 6 months prior
                  to trial entry

               3. Presence of severe valvular heart disease

               4. Presence of a ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment

         13. Concurrent hypotension defined as baseline supine blood pressure systolic &lt;90 mmHg.

         14. Past history of corneal ulceration, dry eye syndrome, glaucoma. Contact lenses should
             also be avoided during participation in the trial.

         15. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.

         16. Participation in any other clinical study within the 4 weeks previous to start of
             trial treatment.
