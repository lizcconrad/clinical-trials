  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive and functional impairment are debilitating problems for survivors of major surgery.
      Efforts to modify medical treatments to prevent such impairment are ongoing and may yet yield
      significant benefits. An area in need of study is whether building patients' cognitive and
      physical reserve through a prescribed program of cognitive and physical exercise before the
      physiological insult (a prehabilitation effort) can improve long-term outcomes.
      Prehabilitation efforts before surgery thus far have focused on preemptive physical therapy
      to improve post-surgical functional outcomes. No work, however, has been done to attenuate
      the cognitive decline commonly seen after surgical illness by exercising the brain before the
      surgical insult. Cognitive prehabilitation is a novel therapeutic approach that applies
      well-understood techniques derived from brain plasticity research. Our approach is bolstered
      by data that demonstrate that cognitive training programs are effective and have a very high
      likelihood of fostering improvement in patient outcomes across a range of populations. It is
      not yet known if these programs can improve cognitive reserve, allowing patients' minds to
      better manage the acute stress of surgery and hospitalization. The primary aim of this pilot
      study is to evaluate the feasibility of cognitive and physical prehabilitation training in
      adult patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery who are at risk for postoperative
      cognitive and functional decline. The secondary aim is to study the effects of cognitive and
      physical prehabilitation training on cognitive abilities, functional status, and quality of
      life after surgery.
