  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Docetaxel (a type of chemotherapy)

        -  Apalutamide (the study medication, also known as ARN-509)

        -  Prednisone (a corticosteroid given to prevent reactions to docetaxel).

        -  Leuprolide acetate (also known as Lupron, a GnRH agonist or similar drug which is
           standard of care, causes chemical castration which greatly lowers the level of
           testosterone in the body)

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      Apalutamide is considered an investigational product, which is believed to reduce the growth
      of prostate cancer cells. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      apalutamide as a treatment for any disease, but it is being studied in prostate cancer.
      Docetaxel is an approved therapy for this type of cancer. The FDA has not approved the
      combination of the two drugs in any use.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the combination of two drugs,
      docetaxel with apalutamide. The investigators will keep track of participants'
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), scans, and overall health to determine how well this drug
      combination works at treating this type of cancer.

          -  Presence of untreated brain metastasis

          -  Seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (including but not limited
             to prior stroke, transient ischemic attack within 1 year prior to randomization, brain
             arteriovenous malformation; or intracranial masses such as schwannomas and meningiomas
             that are causing edema or mass effect). Loss of consciousness within 12 months may be
             permitted upon discussion with study PI.

          -  Medications known to lower the seizure threshold must be discontinued or substituted
             at least 4 weeks prior to study entry.

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension

               -  Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption

               -  Active infection (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or viral hepatitis) or
                  other medical condition that would make prednisone/prednisolone (corticosteroid)
                  use contraindicated

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, severe or unstable

             York Heart Association Grade II or greater), arterial or venous thromboembolic events
             (e.g., pulmonary embolism), or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias,
             significant vascular disease (e.g. aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection), or symptomatic
             peripheral vascular disease within 6 months prior to randomization.

             composition to apalutamide or docetaxel

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.
