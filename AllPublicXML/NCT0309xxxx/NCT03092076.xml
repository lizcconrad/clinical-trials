    <textblock>
      This study is a open and single center clinical trial in healthy Chinese.The objective of the
      study is to clarify the pharmacokinetics characteristics and antiplatelet effects of
      ticagrelor in Chinese and to investigate the impact of genotype.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-does, nonrandomized study of ticagrelor in healthy volunteers
      carried out at a single center. Written informed consent will be obtained from all volunteers
      before initiation of the study. The study is approved by the Research Ethic Committee of
      Guangdong General Hospital. Fifty-one healthy Chinese will be recruited.

      Venous blood will be collected at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48h after taking
      180mg ticagrelor orally. Urine collection intervals are at predose and 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to
      6, 6 to 9, 9 to 12, 12 to 16 and 16 to 24h after dosing. The concentration of ticagrelor and
      its metabolites will be analyzed using a separately validated liquid chromatography technique
      with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS).

      Besides，the basic principle of population pharmacodynamics(PPD) is applied to evaluate
      antiplatelet effects. Adenosine diphosphate(ADP)-stimulated platelet aggregation will be
      assessed at baseline, and 0.5h/1h, 2h, 4h/8h/24h, 48h/3d/5d and 7d after dosing.

      The effects of genetic variants on antiplatelet and pharmacokinetic response to ticagrelor
      are investigated through a genome-wide association study (GWAS).

    <measure>Genome-wide genotyping in 51 healthy Chinese</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A total of 900,015 SNPs in a GWAS scan were genotyped with the Illumina HumanOmniZhongHua-8 BeadChip according to the protocol from Illumina. Prior to association analysis, a systematic quality control (QC) procedure was applied to the raw genotyping data to filter unqualified SNPs and samples. The effects of genetic variants on antiplatelet and pharmacokinetic response to ticagrelor are investigated through a genome-wide association study（GWAS）in 51 healthy Chinese .</description>

    <measure>ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For platelet function tests, ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation was measured in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulated whole blood samples (2 x 2 mL) within 2 h of sampling using a Chrono-log Platelet Aggregation Systems. The platelet aggregation (PA) postdose till recovery to baseline was measured by light transmission method using ADP (20 μmol/L final concentration), and expressed as percentages. Since a sparse sampling design for platelet function testing was used, the missing platelet aggregation data during the recovery of platelet function were imputed using Bayesian simulation method. The time recovering 50% of maximum drug effect (RT50) were estimated individually, which were used to represent the antiplatelet effect.</description>

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A LC-MS/MS assay was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of ticagrelor, its metabolites, and internal standard (ferulic acid) in human plasma. Plasma samples were extracted with ethyl acetate. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of ticagrelor and M8 were estimated for each subject, using the non-compartmental analysis function in Phoenix WinNonlin software, version 6.3.</description>

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A LC-MS/MS assay was developed and validated for simultaneous determination of ticagrelor, its metabolites, and internal standard (gliclazide) in human urine. Urine samples were precipitated with 50% methanol/acetonitrile. Accumulated amount of ticagrelor and its metabolites in urine over 24 h was calculated. The relative accumulated amount was the product of the relative index and the urine volume (Compound/IS x Vurine).</description>
