      This is a phase 1/2 clinical trial of the oral XPO1 inhibitor selinexor (KPT-330) in
      combination with docetaxel for previously treated, advanced KRAS mutant non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). It is a single-arm, non-blinded study, which will compare safety and outcomes
      with historical controls (docetaxel monotherapy). The multi-center study will be conducted
      within the Academic Thoracic Oncology Medical Investigator Consortium (ATOMIC).

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase 1/2 single-arm, non-blinded, multi-institutional study. Selinexor will be administered once weekly starting one week before chemotherapy initiation (to permit pharmacodynamic assessment of selinexor alone and in combination with chemotherapy), in combination with docetaxel. Docetaxel will be given once every 3 weeks. Treatment will be administered in 21-day cycles. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed based on the first cycle (7-day lead-in plus 21-day cycle = 28 days) toxicity using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] version 4.03. A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation paradigm will be used.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible to enroll in
             this study:

               1. Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional
                  guidelines. The patient must provide informed consent prior to the first
                  screening procedure.

               2. Age ≥ 18 years

               3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

               4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (stage 4, according to the
                  American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] version 7.0 Staging manual) NSCLC

               5. Molecular identification of a KRAS mutation (codons 12, 13, or 61)

               6. Tissue available for analysis at time of enrollment for biomarker analysis (may
                  be obtained via biopsy prior to initiation of treatment, or submission of
                  available archival tissue): 10-15 slides, or 5 slides with 3 sections per slide

               7. At least one and up to two previous lines of systemic cytotoxic therapy for
                  advanced NSCLC, of which one must have been a platinum-based doublet therapy. Up
                  to four total previous lines of systemic therapy (including immunotherapy and
                  molecularly targeted therapy)

               8. Radiographic or clinical disease recurrence or progression during or after the
                  last line of systemic therapy

               9. Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1500 cells/μL;
                  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL; platelets ≥ 100,000/μL. Use of PRBC transfusion to achieve
                  Hgb ≥9.0 mg/dL is allowed.

              10. Adequate renal function (calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min using the
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation)

              11. Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN], alanine
                  aminotransferase [ALT] ≤ 2 × ULN and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤ 2 × ULN).
                  ALT and/or AST may be ≤ 5 × ULN if due to liver metastases. If ALT or AST is &gt; 2
                  and ≤ 5 × ULN in patients with liver metastases, alkaline phosphatase must be ≤
                  2.5 × ULN (unless elevated alkaline phosphatase clearly due to skeletal—rather
                  than hepatic—process; eg, normal GGT, presence of multiple bone metastases,
                  absence of bulky and/or central liver metastases). Patients with Gilbert's
                  syndrome are allowed if total bilirubin ≤ 2 × ULN and direct bilirubin is ≤ ULN.

                  activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 × ULN if patient is not on
                  anticoagulant therapy (a therapeutic PT and/or INR and aPTT is acceptable if the
                  patient is on anticoagulants)

              13. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of
                  contraception (including 1 highly effective and 1 effective method of
                  contraception) and have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening. Male
                  patients must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active
                  with a female of childbearing potential. For both male and female patients,
                  effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for 3
                  months following the last dose of study treatment. Female patients of
                  child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
                  and agree to use 2 reliable methods of contraception throughout the study and for
                  3 months after their last dose of medication. Female patients are considered NOT
                  of childbearing potential if they have a history of surgical sterility (including
                  hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, but not tubal ligation alone) or
                  evidence of post-menopausal status defined as any of the following:

                    -  Natural menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago and confirmed by FSH blood
                       level

                    -  Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt;1 year ago

                    -  Chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago. Male patients
                       and their partners must use 2 reliable methods of contraception, at least
                       one of them a barrier method (if sexually active with a female of
                       child-bearing potential).

              14. Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1

              15. Previously treated (surgery and/or radiation therapy) or untreated brain
                  metastases are eligible, provided that patients are asymptomatic and not
                  requiring escalating doses of corticosteroids

              16. Previous treatment-associated clinically significant toxicities resolved to CTCAE
                  grade ≤1 (except alopecia) or to their baseline

              17. At least 3 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, since receiving systemic
                  anticancer therapy, including investigational agents, prior to starting study
