  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The newly developed linked color imaging (LCI) system (FUJIFILM Co.) creates clear and bright
      endoscopic images by using short-wavelength narrow-band laser light combined with white laser
      light on the basis of BLI technology. This system can obtain bright endoscopic images even at
      a distant view because LCI has more intense white light than the short-wavelength narrow-band
      laser light. Short-wavelength narrow-band laser light enhances the vessels on the mucosal
      surface and the patterns of the mucosa. Therefore, LCI may facilitate the detection of
      gastric mucosal lesions. Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical utility of LCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LCI enhances differences in hue, in the red region of the spectrum, through digital
      processing. This makes red areas appear redder and white areas appear whiter. Thus, it is
      easier to recognize a slight difference in color of the mucosa. Based on previous experience,
      a new LCI based endoscopic diagnosis criteria called CMV (color- microstructure-vessel)
      criteria has been proposed, which could be used for judging the gastric mucosal lesions. LCI
      has the advantage of detecting color changes of the mucosa, and this could provide very
      valuable and useful evidence for making endoscopic diagnosis. In this study, a blinded random
      controlled clinical trial is designed to further validate the diagnostic value of LCI based
      CMV criteria for gastric diseases.
