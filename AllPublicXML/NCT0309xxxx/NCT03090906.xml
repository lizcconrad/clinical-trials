  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare clinical and histologically the soft tissue changes in
      terms of volume gain and stability around dental implants in cases where a subepithelial
      connective tissue graft from the palate or from the tuberosity is used randomly

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding the importance of the soft tissue around implants have lead clinicians to
      develop surgical approaches to augment it. The majority of them, are described as bilaminar
      techniques obtaining a subephitelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) from the palate (P).
      However, recent studies have demonstrated that tuberosity (T) tissue is a very dense and
      coarse tissue that seems to contain more collagen and less fat and glandular tissue than that
      from the P, and therefore may have better tissue qualities for soft tissue augmentation, but
      there is limited scientific evidence comparing these areas.

      The main goal of this study is to compare the soft tissue volume gain and stability around
      implants in cases where a SCTG of the same dimensions from the P or T is used randomly. To
      calculate volume changes and stability an intraoral optical scan is used and
      three-dimensional images superimposed.

      The secondary goal is to compare histologically both tissues and changes in clinical
      parameters. Histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry evaluating levels of Type I-III
      collagen, long lysyl hydroxylase, matrix metalloproteinase 1-2, and monoclonal antibody
      against cytokeratin 4-10-13 is performed.

    <description>Recipient site: Intrasulcular incision at the buccal side of the implant extending in one adjacent tooth for each side and a partial-thickness mucosal ﬂap raised. The connective tissue was secured with suture. Allocation to either treatment was performed according to a randomization table.
Donor site A double-bladed scalpel handle 1,5mm was used in both areas to obtain the same thickness.
Palate (CG) The double incision was made approximately 2 to 3 mm apical to the gingival margins of premolars. The donor tissue was removed and cross-mattress sutures were used to approximate the wound on the palate.
In both groups the epithelial collar removed. Graft required dimensions for both groups:10mm height, 12mm length and 1,5mm thick.</description>

Tuberosity (TG) The double incision was made from the distal of the terminal tooth. A second incision was made perpendicular to the linear incision at a distal point, which joined the two linear incisions. The graft was removed and a crossed horizontal suspension suture was used.
Epithelial collar removed. Graft required dimensions for both groups:10mm height, 12mm length and 1,5mm thick.</description>
