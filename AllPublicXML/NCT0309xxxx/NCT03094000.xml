  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bulimia Nervosa (BN), Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are Binge
      Eating Disorders (BE-Dis) in which binge eating episodes are a main symptom. Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the leading evidence-based treatment for patients suffering from
      these disorders. CBT-E is an &quot;enhanced&quot; trans-diagnostic version of the treatment which
      appears to be more effective in a variety of Eating Disorders (EDs). The main goals of this
      treatment are reducing dietary restrictions and EDs symptoms as well as food intake
      regulation. Self-monitoring (SM) is an important and central tool in this type of treatment
      considered crucial for its success. Therefore, during treatment, patients are required to
      monitor their eating, the circumstances, and their thoughts and feelings proximate to the
      time of eating. Nevertheless, despite the importance of this tool, research has shown that
      there are many difficulties challenging the clients' adherence to SM, which might reduce this
      treatment's effectiveness and outcome. Additionally, in recent years there has been
      cumulative data supporting the use of mindfulness in the treatment of EDs. Mindfulness, as a
      western psychological approach, is defined as the &quot;unique non-judgmental focus of one's
      attention at the present moment&quot;. Although SM requires the ability to observe, describe and
      identify occurrences, no studies have yet examined the direct effect of mindfulness skills on
      SM adherence, and therefore the improvement of treatment outcomes.

      The main objective of the present study is to examine the effect of a mindfulness based
      intervention on SM adherence during a CBT intervention for BE-Dis, and on the treatment
      outcomes as seen in the ED psychopathology and compliance to the nutritional instructions and
      food intake composition. Other aims include examining the differences between the
      experimental group and the control group, regarding their level of mindfulness and SM
      adherence. In addition, mediating and moderating processes between mindfulness and SM
      adherence will be examined.

    <description>Treatment outcomes regarding the compliance to the nutritional instructions, will be examined by analyzing the participants' self monitoring reports.
This analysis will be conducted by comparing the actual number of meals a day and the composition of food consumed (and reported) to dietary recommendations for the treatment of binge eating disorders (Fairburn &amp; Wilson, 1993).
Nutritional composition analysis of food consumed will be conducted by using the &quot;Tzameret&quot; software (of the Israeli Ministry of Health).
This procedure will be conducted before (week 1), during (week 10) and at the end of the CBT program (week 19).</description>

The number of days documented in the self monitoring form
The degree of detail type and quantity of food reported (The percentage of total reports)
The extent (frequency) of real-time monitoring (real-time monitoring will be examined by comparing the time gaps between the reported time of eating, and the actual electronic timestamp (The percentage of total reports)

The experimental group will receive in addition to CBT-E a mindfulness based intervention comprising of 4 weekly group sessions (1.5 hours each) during the month prior to the CBT-E program. The mindfulness skills intervention will also be practiced throughout the CBT-E program at the beginning of every group session and independently as homework. Mindfulness intervention includes &quot;formal&quot; mindfulness practice (brief mindfulness meditation - 10 minutes each) and &quot;informal&quot; mindfulness practice (Other &quot;non meditation exercises&quot;, also known as &quot;mindfulness in everyday life&quot;- eg &quot;STOP&quot;).</description>
