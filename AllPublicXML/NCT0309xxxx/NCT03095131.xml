      Question: Is 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) the most accurate and convenient diagnostic
      method for atrial fibrillation (AF)? Findings: The Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor can
      be used at home, and is capable of determining the occurrence of AF. Three measurement
      methods were used in this study. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the methods
      used are between 90% and 100%, and the Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor can be
      effectively applied to AF detection.

      Meaning: The Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor can be used at home and can replace the
      need for an in-office ECG, thereby accomplishing meaningful telecare.

      Importance: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. The most common
      diagnostic method, 12-lead ECG, can record episodes of arrhythmia from which the type and
      severity can be determined. The Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor (P2, OSTAR Meditech
      Corp.) is used to measure cardiovascular pressure change, with fast Fourier transform (FFT)
      analysis, to obtain the heart rate frequency variability and accurate blood pressure data.

      Objective: To compare the diagnostic efficacy of the Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor
      with a 12-lead ECG in patients with AF. Three measurement methods were used in this study:
      blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP) which is calculated from individual blood
      pressure as constant pressure, and a constant pressure 60 mmHg, in order to analyze the heart
      index and compare it with simultaneous 12-lead ECG.

      Design: The physician used a 12-lead ECG and the Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor
      simultaneously. The Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor used an FFT analysis for the
      diagnosis of AF; the findings were compared with the readings from the 12-lead ECG.

      Setting: This unblinded clinical trial was conducted at the Emergency Room of Taipei Medical
      University Hospital.

      Participants: Twenty-nine subjects with AF and 33 without AF, aged 25 to 97 years (mean: 63.5
      years), were included.

      Intervention(s) for clinical trials Subjects who had been exposed to high frequency surgical
      equipment during testing, those with cardiac pacemakers or implantable defibrillators, and
      pregnant women were excluded.

    <description>In the emergency room, when medical staff found patients with AF, they informed the research physicians to study the case. The Heart Spectrum Blood Pressure Monitor was compared with 12-lead ECG (ELI 250) after written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The results were interpreted by the emergency physician. Finally, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were analyzed to evaluate the clinical efficacy.</description>
