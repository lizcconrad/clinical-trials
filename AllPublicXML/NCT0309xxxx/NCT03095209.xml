  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on this observation study must have planned treatment regimen with concurrent CRT
      followed by planned surgery, which is considered as standard of care for their disease. The
      total radiation dose will be 50.4 Gy in daily fraction of 1.8 Gy for esophageal cancer and 60
      Gy in daily fraction of 2 Gy for non-small cell lung cancer. The concurrent chemo regimen
      will carboplatin-paclitaxel managed by the treating medical oncologist. Patients are planned
      to receive surgery at approximately 6 to 9 weeks (maximum 12 weeks post-CRT) after finishing
      CRT with surgical aspects determined by the treating surgical oncologist.

      Patients on this observation study will donate their blood samples within 4 weeks before
      initiating CRT, within 1 week before completing CRT, 1 month after CRT, and 1 month after
      surgery (or 3 months after CRT if surgery is not done for any reason). They are also
      requested to fill out questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-30, EORTC QLQ-OES18, and Pain Scale as
      attached) prior to CRT, weekly during CRT, 1 month after CRT, 1 month after surgery (or 3
      months after CRT if surgery is not done for any reason), and 6 months after CRT. Any patients
      with incomplete treatment will have samples collected up to the point where they discontinue.
      The specimen collection, handling and processing will be done by Protocol Support Lab (PSL)
      at Fox Chase Cancer Center under the directions of the Director, R. Katherine Alpaugh, PhD,
      following the procedures outlined in PSL lab manual. The patients in this observation study
      will be asked to donate a tissue specimen after the definitive surgery for investigation.

        Patients who are eligible for the phase I trial (RT-101) but decline to enroll should be
        offered to participate in this parallel observation study. Patients with the following
        disease will be included in this observation study:

        ≥T2, or N+, and M0

        Patients on this observation study must have planned treatment regimen with concurrent CRT
        followed by planned surgery, which is considered as standard of care for their disease.
