      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

        -  bicalutamide - 150mg po daily D1 - D28 (Cycle = 28 days)

        -  ribociclib po daily D1 - D21 of 28 day cycle

      PHASE I SAFETY RUN-IN COHORT:

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bicalutamide in combination with ribociclib will be
      determined using a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design. The first cohort of 3 subjects will receive
      ribociclib 400mg po daily D1 - D21 of a 28 day cycle (Dose Level 1). If no DLTs are
      experienced then the next cohort of 3 subjects will receive ribociclib 400mg po daily D1 -
      D28 of a 28 day cycle (Dose Level 2). If no DLTs are experienced then the next cohort of 3
      subjects will receive ribociclib 600mg po daily D1 - D21 of a 28 day cycle (Dose Level 3). If
      no DLTs are experienced on Dose Level 3, then 3 additional subjects should be treated at this
      level before declaring MTD.

      DLTs will be assessed within the first cycle (28 days).

      PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

        -  co-therapy bicalutamide 150mg po daily D1 - D28

        -  ribociclib po at the RP2D as determined in the Phase I Safety Run-In Cohort

      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1 within 28 days prior
      to registration

      Life expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks as determined by the treating physician.

      Hematological:

        -  White blood cell (WBC) ≥4 × 10^9/L

        -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥1.5 × 10^9/L

        -  Hemoglobin (Hb) ≥9 g/dL

        -  Platelets (Plt) ≥100 × 10^9/L

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 ml/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤upper limit of normal (ULN)*

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 × ULN or ≤5 × ULN if liver mets.

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 × ULN or ≤5 × ULN if liver mets. * For subjects with
           Gilbert's syndrome, this will apply to direct bilirubin only.
