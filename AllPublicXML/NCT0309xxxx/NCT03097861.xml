    <measure>Equivalence analysis of observed spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) count at Week 1 for lubiprostone sprinkle vs. lubiprostone capsule</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary efficacy variable of observed Week 1 SBM count, the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the treatment ratio between the sprinkle and capsule formulations will be calculated, and the equivalence of the two medications can be claimed if the equivalence limits are within the interval of [0.8, 1.25]. Subjects with any daily missing observed SBM count during the treatment week will have their daily value(s) imputed by carrying over the previous non-missing post-baseline SBM observed count.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Superiority Analysis of Observed SBM Count at Week 1 for Lubiprostone Sprinkle and Lubiprostone Capsule vs. Matching Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The observed SBM count will be summarized by treatment group. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) for the observed SBM count with baseline SBM count as a covariate, and the van Elteren test stratified by baseline SBM frequency rate (&lt; 1.5 or ≥ 1.5) and pooled sites will be performed for comparisons between the lubiprostone sprinkle vs. the placebo group and between the lubiprostone capsule vs. the placebo group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in observed SBM count at Week 1</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in observed SBM count will be summarized by treatment group. The 90% CI of the treatment ratio between the sprinkle and capsule formulations will be calculated. ANCOVA for the change from baseline in observed SBM count and the van Elteren test stratified by baseline SBM frequency rate (&lt; 1.5 or ≥ 1.5) and pooled sites will be performed for comparisons between the lubiprostone sprinkle vs. the placebo group and between the lubiprostone capsule vs. the placebo group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall and mean change from baseline in stool consistency associated with SBMs at Week 1</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The overall mean score, as well as change from baseline, for the 7-day treatment will be calculated for each subject. The mean score will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each treatment group. The 90% CI of the treatment ratio between the sprinkle and capsule formulations will be calculated. ANCOVA and the van Elteren test will be performed to detect differences from baseline between the sprinkle and capsule formulations of lubiprostone and the matching placebo group.</description>

    <measure>Overall and mean change from baseline in straining associated with SBMs at Week 1</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The overall mean score, as well as change from baseline, for the 7-day treatment will be calculated for each subject. The mean score will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each treatment group. The 90% CI of the treatment ratio between the sprinkle and capsule formulations will be calculated. ANCOVA and the van Elteren test will be performed to detect differences from baseline between the sprinkle and capsule formulations of lubiprostone and the matching placebo group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SBM frequency rate at Week 1</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>SBM frequency rate at week 1 will be summarized by treatment group. The 90% CI of the treatment ratio between the sprinkle and capsule formulations will be calculated. ANCOVA, using Week 1 SBM frequency rate as the dependent variable, will be used to compare treatment groups with baseline SBM frequency rate as a covariate. The van Elteren test stratified baseline SBM frequency rate (&lt; 1.5 or ≥ 1.5) and pooled sites will be performed to detect differences from baseline for lubiprostone sprinkle and lubiprostone capsule vs. matching placebo. In order to adjust for early withdrawals or missing days, subjects with less than 7 days of treatment will have the Week 1 SBM frequency rates adjusted as: 7 × Number of SBMs / (Number of days treated). If the number of observed days is less than 4 days, the data will be considered insufficient, and the rate will be missing for that subject. No imputation will be performed for missing data.</description>
