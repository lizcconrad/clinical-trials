  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects that the study drugs (metformin and OPC)
      have on AGE levels in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGEs are a type of metabolite, or substance, found in the food. The AGE content in food is
      determined by the types of food you eat and also how you prepare your food. The researchers
      helping conduct this study have found a potential link between AGE levels and cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to see if certain drugs (metformin and OPC) have an effect on the
      AGE levels in your blood and to see if those AGE levels have an effect on your cancer.
