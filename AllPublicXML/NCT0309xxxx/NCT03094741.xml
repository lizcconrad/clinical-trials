  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a
      Mobile Digital Solution in monitoring and collecting symptom burden data. The proposed study
      is meant to be the preparatory work for an intervention study to test the effect of Mobile
      Digital Solutions on improving patient outcomes by prompting early interventions for symptom
      relief and support of patient and family caregiver quality of life (QOL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demographic information and patient-reported symptoms will be collected from study
      participants through a mobile health application called CancerLife that they can download
      (FREE) from their mobile device app store (Android or iOS). Participants will be asked to
      broadcast their emotional and physical status through a list of symptom list within the app
      as well as how that symptom is impacting their quality of life and activities of daily
      living. This data will be collected inside the application and display in easy to understand
      pie charts. Participants will also have the option to broadcast their entry to their social
      network.

      Since the objective of the current feasibility study is to evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a Mobile Digital Solution in monitoring and collecting symptom burden and
      QOL data, the investigators will include a standard validated instrument (FACT-G: Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General) as part of this study. Participants will be asked to
      complete the FACT-G after initial registration and weekly for up to 4 weeks. Participants
      will receive electronic mail messages with a link to CancerLife weekly as a reminder to
      access the website.

    <description>CancerLife is a mobile digital solution that allows patients to broadcast their health status inside a private invitation only group, text, email or publicly in Facebook or Instagram. By doing, so the patient collects his/her own patient-reported outcomes data and then share this data with their doctor or care team.</description>
