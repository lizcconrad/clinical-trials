      This is an open label randomized, controlled, parallel intervention study. Group 1 will
      receive usual care for insulin degludec titration using the STEP WISE degludec titration
      algorithm Group 2 will receive Glooko mobile insulin dosing system, using the STEP WISE
      degludec titration algorithm.An estimated n= 240 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be
      enrolled in order to obtain approximately 200 evaluable subjects who will complete the 16
      week study.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled two-group parallel design intervention trial. The
      primary endpoint, change from baseline to week 16 in HbA1c is planned to be tested for
      superiority of the Glooko Mobile Insulin Dosing System versus standard of care for insulin
      degludec titration - both with treatment of Tresiba® U-200 FlexTouch®. An estimated n= 240
      subjects with type 2 diabetes will be enrolled in order to obtain approximately 200 evaluable
      subjects who will complete the 16 week study. The subjects, will be already on long-acting
      insulin or insulin naïve subjects and will be started on long-acting insulin degludec
      (Tresiba® U-200 FlexTouch®). The subjects will be randomized into one of the two groups:
      Group 1 will receive standard of care using the STEP WISE degludec titration algorithm for
      long acting insulin titration. Group 2 will receive standard of care along with treatment
      facilitated by Glooko mobile insulin dosing system, using the STEP WISE degludec titration
      algorithm. Major study assessment will be conducted at Baseline (Screening &amp; Visit 1), at a
      second Visit (Visit 2) after 12 weeks or 3 months and, after 16 weeks or 4 months, a final
      set of labs, meter download, and subject surveys will be administered (Exit Labs and Meter
      Download), in addition, any interactions and subsequent care plan changes completed by the
      HCP during Unscheduled HCP Interactions will be documented. Baseline, Visit 2 and the final
      screen/Exit Labs visit will include: blood draw, body weight, and questionnaires.

    <description>Glooko mobile insulin dosing system(MIDS), using the STEP WISE degludec titration algorithm.
The eligible subjects will be started on insulin degludec (Tresiba® U-200 FlexTouch®). Subjects will use MIDS for insulin degludec titration management. The clinician will configure MIDS Prescription Instruction Form(PIF) using pre-configured Novo Nordisk, Tresiba Protocol Dosing Treatment Plan which is based on the Novo Tresiba degludec Stepwise Program. The Clinician can alter this as appropriate based on medical judgment. Subjects will be started on MIDS and trained on use of Glooko MIDS mobile app. Subjects will get dose adjustment check up on the app and also alert to contact physician if subject experiences hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.</description>
