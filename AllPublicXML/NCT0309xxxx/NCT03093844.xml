  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent
      System to promote engraftment of haploidentical CD34+ selected cells combined with single
      unit umbilical cord blood transplant for treatment of high-risk hematologic disorders.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical protocol, the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System will be used for processing
      hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis (HPC, Apheresis) from an allogeneic,
      HLA-haploidentical, related donor to obtain a CD34+ cell-enriched population for
      hematopoietic reconstitution. The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G-CSF and undergo
      one apheresis to collect CD34+ stem cells. The products will be cryopreserved until the time
      of transplantation. Recipients with hematologic disorders who require transplant will receive
      a standard conditioning regimen and will receive an allograft on day 0 containing donor CD34+
      cells that have been positively selected and T-cell depleted following G-CSF mobilization
      combined with a single UCB unit.

    <description>The haploidentical donor will be mobilized by G-CSF and undergo one apheresis to collect CD34+ selected stem cell product after Miltenyi CliniMACS® CD34+ selection. The products will be cryopreserved until the time of transplantation.
Recipients will receive a standard conditioning regimen. After the conditioning regimen, the subjects will receive an allograft on day 0 containing donor CD34+ cells that have been positively selected and T-cell depleted following G-CSF mobilization combined with a single UCB unit. UCB unit will not be manipulated, and will be prepared and infused separately following standard of care procedure.</description>
