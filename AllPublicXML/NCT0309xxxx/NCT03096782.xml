  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical cord blood is a source of blood-forming cells that can be used for a transplant.
      The cord blood cells being transplanted in this study will be from a donor. Before the cord
      blood is given to you, researchers will grow the cord blood cells in a laboratory.

      Expanding cord blood means to change the blood in the laboratory. To expand the cord blood,
      researchers will grow the blood cells on a special layer of cells called mesenchymal
      precursor cells (MPCs) collected from the bone marrow of healthy volunteers and grown in a
      laboratory. This is designed to increase the number of expanded cells that can be collected.
      A type of sugar will also be added to the cell membrane of blood cells in the laboratory,
      which may help your blood counts to recover faster.

      As part of standard care, patients normally receive 2 units of non-expanded cord blood.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving 1 unit of expanded cord blood
      with added sugar and 1 unit of non-expanded cord blood (no added sugar) to a patient with
      leukemia or lymphoma can help the transplant to &quot;take&quot; faster. The safety of this combination
      will also be studied. Chemotherapy and/or 1 dose of radiation therapy will also be given
      before the transplant.

      This is an investigational study. Expanded cord blood cells with MPCs and adding sugar are
      not FDA-approved processes. Both processes are currently being used for research purposes
      only. Fludarabine, busulfan, clofarabine, melphalan, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus,
      and rituximab are FDA approved and commercially available to be given to patients with
      leukemia or lymphoma having a cord blood transplant. Total body irradiation is delivered
      using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The study doctor can explain how the
      study treatments are designed to work.

      Up to 25 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Central Venous Catheter Placement:

      Participant will first have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed. A CVC is a sterile
      flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while participant is under local
      anesthesia. Participant's doctor will explain this procedure to participant in more detail,
      and participant will be required to sign a separate consent form for it.

      The chemotherapy, some of the other drugs, the cord blood transplant, and fluids will be
      given by vein through participant's CVC. Blood samples will also be drawn through
      participant's CVC. The CVC will remain in participant's body for about 2-5 months.

      Study Plans:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, a back-up source of cord blood will be
      chosen for participant. This blood will be reserved through the National Marrow Donor Program
      and placed on hold in case it is needed quickly for an emergency. The blood will be placed on
      hold until the study doctor decides that the transplant has been successful. Once the back-up
      cord blood is collected, participant will be admitted to the hospital to follow participant's
      assigned schedule for the study treatment.

      Participant's doctor will choose one of the following 3 study plans based on the disease,
      participant's age, and participant's medical history.

      Plan 1: Fludarabine/Clofarabine/Busulfan/Rituximab/Total Body Irradiation:

      If participant is between 12 and 55 years of age and can receive high-dose chemotherapy, or
      if participant is between 55 and 65 years old and participant's doctor agrees, participant
      will receive fludarabine, clofarabine, busulfan, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), total body
      irradiation, and possibly rituximab.

      Please note Day 0 is the day of the cord blood transplant, so the negative day numbers are
      used to label the treatment days before the transplant.

      Participant will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein over about 60 minutes as an
      outpatient. If the test dose cannot be given as an outpatient, participant will be admitted
      to the hospital on Day -11 (11 days before participant's transplant) to receive fluids by
      vein and will receive the busulfan test dose on Day -10. This low-level &quot;test&quot; dose of
      busulfan is to check how the level of busulfan in participant's blood changes over time. This
      information will be used to decide the next dose needed to reach the target blood level that
      matches participant's body size.

      About 11 samples of blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing of busulfan. PK
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. These blood
      samples will be drawn at various timepoints starting before the busulfan infusion and
      continuing over about the next 11 hours. The blood samples will be repeated again with the
      first day of high-dose busulfan treatment. Each sample will be about 1 teaspoon of blood. A
      temporary heparin lock will be placed in participant's vein to lower the number of needle
      sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for
      technical or scheduling reasons, participant will receive the standard fixed dose of
      busulfan.

      If participant receives the test dose as an outpatient, participant will be admitted to the
      hospital on Day -10 and will receive fluids by vein. If participant's doctor thinks it is
      appropriate for the disease, participant will receive rituximab by vein over about 4-6 hours
      on Day -10.

      If participant receives the test dose as an inpatient, participant will be admitted to the
      hospital on Day -11 and will receive fluids by vein. If appropriate for the disease,
      participant will receive rituximab by vein over about 4-6 hours on Day -11.

      Participant will receive ATG by vein over about 4 hours on Days -9 and -8. ATG is designed to
      weaken participant's immune system in order to lower the risk that participant's body will
      reject the transplant.

      On Days -7 through -4, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over about 1 hour,
      clofarabine by vein over about 1 hour, and busulfan by vein over about 3 hours.

      On Day -3, participant will receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation.

      Participant will rest (not receive chemotherapy drugs) on Days -2 and -1.

      On Day 0, participant will receive participant's cord blood transplant through the CVC.

      Plan 2: Fludarabine/Melphalan:

      If participant's doctor chooses fludarabine and melphalan, participant will have the
      following schedule:

      On Day -9, participant will be admitted to the hospital and will receive fluids by vein.

      On Days -8 and -7, participant will receive ATG by vein over about 4 hours.

      On Day -6, participant will not receive any drugs.

      On Days -5, -4, and -3, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over about 30 minutes.

      On Day -2, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over about 30 minutes and melphalan
      by vein over about 30 minutes.

      On Day -1, participant will not receive any drugs.

      On Day 0, participant will receive participant's cord blood transplant through the CVC.

      Plan 3: Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide/Total Body Irradiation:

      If participant's doctor chooses fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and total body irradiation,
      participant will have the following schedule:

      On Day -9, participant will be admitted to the hospital and will receive fluids by vein.

      On Days -8 and -7, participant will receive ATG by vein over about 4 hours.

      On Day -6, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over about 30 minutes and
      cyclophosphamide by vein over about 1 hour. Participant will also receive mesna by vein over
      30 minutes each time, before and after the cyclophosphamide dose. Mesna is given to lower the
      risk of side effects to the bladder caused by cyclophosphamide.

      On Days -5, -4, and -3, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over about 30 minutes.

      On Day -2, participant will not receive any drugs.

      On Day -1, participant will receive a single treatment of low-dose total body irradiation.

      On Day 0, participant will receive participant's cord blood transplant through the CVC.

      Supportive Drugs:

      Starting on Day -3, participant will receive MMF as a tablet by mouth 2 times a day. If
      participant is not able to take the tablet by mouth, participant will receive MMF by vein
      over 2 hours 2 times a day. If participant does not have graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at
      Day 100 after participant's cord blood transplant, the dose of MMF will be gradually lowered.
      GVHD is when transplanted donor tissue attacks the tissues of the recipient's body. If
      participant has GVHD, MMF may be stopped 7 days after the GVHD is controlled.

      Starting on Day -2, participant will receive tacrolimus by vein as a continuous (nonstop)
      infusion until participant is able to take it by mouth. Participant will then take tacrolimus
      by mouth 2 times a day for about 6 months. After that, participant's tacrolimus dose may be
      gradually lowered if participant does not have GVHD. Participant's doctor will discuss this
      with participant.

      Starting on Day 0, participant will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) through a needle under the
      skin 1 time a day every day until participant's white blood count begins to recover. Nurses
      will teach participant and a caregiver how to perform the injections on participant's own.
      Filgrastim is designed to help cells in the bone marrow to divide, which helps raise white
      blood cell counts more quickly, lowers fever, and decreases the risk of infection.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will be on study for up to 1 year. Participant will be taken off study early if
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if the cord blood is infected and
      cannot be transplanted, if participant is unable to follow study directions, or if
      participant's doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest.

      Participation on the study will be over after the last study visit.

      Study Visits:

      At about 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will be checked for possible reactions to the transplant and study drugs,
           including GVHD.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for infection, and
           for genetic tests to learn if the donor's cells have &quot;taken&quot;. Urine will be collected
           for routine tests. The routine blood tests and urine collection for routine tests will
           be repeated as often as the doctor thinks is needed.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow aspiration to
           check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspirate, an area of the hip
           or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow is withdrawn
           through a large needle.

      Participant will need to stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks. After participant leaves the
      hospital, participant will continue as an outpatient in the hospital area, which means
      participant will have to stay close enough to be able to come back for any visits for about
      100 days after the transplant.

             transplant), or those with active disease.

          8. The first 6 patients must be &gt;/= 18 and &lt;/= 65 years old. The subsequent patients may
             include pediatric patients &gt;/= 12 and &lt;/= 65 years old. Eligibility for pediatric
             patients will be determined in conjunction with an MDACC pediatrician.

          9. Performance score of at least 80% by Karnofsky or PS &lt; 3 (ECOG) (age &gt;/= 12 years), or
             Lansky Play-Performance Scale of at least 60% or greater (age &lt; 12 years).

          5. Patients with uncontrolled serious medical condition such as persistent septicemia
             despite adequate antibiotic therapy, decompensated congestive heart failure despite
             cardiac medications or pulmonary insufficiency requiring intubation (excluding primary
             disease for which CB transplantation is proposed), or psychiatric condition that would
             limit informed consent.

          6. Positive beta HCG in female of child-bearing potential defined as not post-menopausal
