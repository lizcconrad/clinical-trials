  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of cryoablation therapy for the treatment
      of mild to moderate obesity and test the safety (good and bad effects) of this procedure. The
      vagus nerve transmits hunger signals from the stomach to the brain, and in response transmits
      stomach expansion signals from the brain to the stomach. Investigators believe that by
      interrupting this communication, participants could experience less hunger and in turn lose
      weight.

      The purpose of this single arm study is to assess the efficacy of cryoablation therapy for
      the treatment of mild to moderate obesity and test the safety (good and bad effects) of this
      procedure. The vagus nerve transmits hunger signals from the stomach to the brain, and in
      response transmits stomach expansion signals from the brain to the stomach.Investigators
      believe that by interrupting this communication, participants could experience less hunger
      and in turn lose weight.

      The rationale for using cryoablation to treat obesity is based on this investigator's
      experience safely targeting peripheral nerves via CT guidance and treated with thermal
      ablation in daily clinical practice. the primary objective of this research is to evaluate
      the feasibility and safety (over time) of percutaneous image guided cryoablation of the
      posterior vagus nerve in obese patients. The secondary objective consist of temporal
      evaluation of weight loss and appetite before and after the procedure. This will be analyzed
      through documentation of weight, and through the implementation of validated outcome
      instruments.

    <intervention_name>Cryoablation</intervention_name>
    <description>A computed tomography (CT) scan will be completed to map out where to insert the cryoablation needle. Numbing medicine will be used to numb the skin and deeper tissues before inserting the needle.
The cryoablation needle will be inserted and directed toward the target area of the vagal nerve. A CT scan will be done during the procedure to help guide the needle which will be held in position by the study doctor(s) once it reaches the target area. With the needle in place, the study doctor(s) will freeze the zone over 3 minutes, a 2 minutes thaw will follow, then 2 more cycles of 3 minutes freeze and 2 minute thaw will complete the procedure. This portion of the procedure can last from 25 to 35 minutes. Once the targeted area has been properly treated, the cryoablation needle will be withdrawn.</description>
