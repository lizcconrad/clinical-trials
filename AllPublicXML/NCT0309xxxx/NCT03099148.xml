    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  If there are any differences in the amount of LY3337641 in the blood/body when it is
           taken in different formulations. A total of 3 different formulations of LY3337641 are
           being tested.

        -  How a high-fat meal affects the amount of LY3337641 in the blood/body.

        -  How safe and well tolerated LY3337641 is.

      The study has four periods. Individuals will participate in all four periods. Each period
      will include 4 overnight stays (5 days) in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU).

      This study is expected to last up to 8 weeks. This includes the initial screening period, the
      study or dosing period, and the follow up period.
