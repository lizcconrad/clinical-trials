        Inclusion Criteria:

        For all subjects:

          -  The informed consent must be signed before any study specific tests or procedures are
             done

          -  White/Caucasian men and women aged between 18 to 79 years (inclusive )

          -  Body mass index (BMI): 18 to 34 kg/m2 (both inclusive)

          -  Ability to understand and follow study-related instructions

          -  Women and men of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception when
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed
             consent form and three months after administration of study drug. Subjects must agree
             to use two non-hormonal methods for contraception simultaneously (e.g. condom or
             diaphragm, plus spermicide) throughout the study when sexually active.

        This is not required if safe contraception is achieved by a permanent method, such as
        hysterectomy, bilateral fallopian tube ligation or vasectomy.

        For subjects with hepatic impairment:

          -  Subjects with documented liver cirrhosis confirmed by histopathology, laparoscopy,
             fibroscan, or ultrasound

          -  Subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B)

          -  Subjects with stable liver disease, i.e. same Child-Pugh class in the last 2 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any relevant disease within 4 weeks prior to study drug administration requiring
             medical treatment

          -  Known severe allergies, non-allergic drug reactions, or multiple drug allergies

          -  Use containing sex hormones within 4 weeks to six months before first study drug
             administration

          -  Use of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors or inducers

          -  Use of drugs which may affect absorption

          -  Major change of medication &lt;2 weeks prior study drug administration

          -  Deviations from normal range in physical examination, gynecological examination,
             clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis considered to be relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Any criteria which, in the opinion of the investigator, make study participation
             unadvisable for scientific, compliance, safety, or medical reasons
