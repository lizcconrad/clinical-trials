  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of chest infections (pneumonia and
      bronchiolitis) in young children, and is a major cause of admission to hospital and childhood
      death worldwide. One possible way to protect the mother and young infant from RSV infection
      is a vaccine given to women during pregnancy (maternal vaccination), which would pass
      protection to their unborn child. This may help to prevent RSV in the child's first few
      months of life when they are most vulnerable to infection. With RSV vaccine candidates in the
      pipeline, this study aims to pre-emptively gauge the knowledge of RSV and potential
      acceptability of such vaccines amongst pregnant women and healthcare staff working in
      midwifery and obstetrics, as well as their attitudes (facilitators and barriers) to being
      involved in hypothetical future research trials.

      The investigators propose to undertake a questionnaire-based study of randomly selected
      pregnant women and healthcare staff (over 16 years of age) at four English teaching
      hospitals. Pregnant women attending for ward reviews or antenatal clinics will approached and
      asked to complete an anonymous paper questionnaire lasting around 10 minutes. Healthcare
      staff will be approached in person, or via email, and asked to complete a slightly different
      questionnaire lasting around 5-10 minutes. No follow up will take place. Using statistical
      software, the investigators hope to identify factors that might affect patients'
      understanding of RSV and attitudes to being involved in hypothetical future trials and
      receiving the RSV vaccination

      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a very common virus that causes infection of the airways
      and lungs. It is the leading cause of chest infections (pneumonia and bronchiolitis) in young
      children, and is a major cause of admission to hospital and childhood death worldwide. Lots
      of research trials are being done into ways of preventing and treating RSV, however there is
      still no RSV vaccine approved for routine use. One possible way to protect the mother and
      young infant from RSV infection is a vaccine given to women during pregnancy, which would
      pass protection to their unborn child. This may help to prevent RSV in the child's first few
      months of life when they are most vulnerable to infection. There are two vaccines that are
      currently being tested in pregnant women around the world, including the UK.

      With RSV vaccine candidates in the pipeline, this study aims to pre-emptively gauge the
      knowledge of RSV and potential acceptability of such vaccines amongst pregnant women and
      healthcare staff working in midwifery and obstetrics, as well as their attitudes
      (facilitators and barriers) to being involved in hypothetical future research trials.

      The investigators propose to undertake a questionnaire-based study of randomly selected
      pregnant women and healthcare staff (over 16 years of age) at four English teaching
      hospitals. Pregnant women attending for ward reviews or antenatal clinics will approached and
      asked to complete an anonymous paper questionnaire lasting around 10 minutes. Healthcare
      staff will be approached in person, or via email, and asked to complete a slightly different
      questionnaire lasting around 5-10 minutes. No follow up will take place. The investigators
      then, using statistical software, hope to identify factors that might affect their
      understanding of RSV and attitudes to being involved in hypothetical future trials and
      receiving the RSV vaccination
