  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, randomized control trial with a pretest-posttest control and
      interventional groups design. Both the assessor and participants are blinded to all
      assessments and evaluations. All patients with subacute stroke undergo in-patient or
      out-patient rehabilitation are screened initially by a series of screening test. Suitable
      patients are assigned randomly to 3 groups respectively. Group 1 is the combined transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) and neurofeedback group. Group 2 is the neurofeedback
      group. Group 3 is the control group with sham neurofeedback training.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment sessions for all three groups are conducted by the investigators who has training
      in neurofeedback and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCs). Each participant
      performed 10 training sessions on different days. Sessions were conducted 3-5 times a week
      The tDCS + neurofeedback group will carry out 30 minutes tDCS and 30 minutes neurofeedback
      training.

      The real neurofeedback group will carry out 30 minutes neurofeedback training. The sham
      neurofeedback group will conduct the 30 minutes sham neurofeedback training.
