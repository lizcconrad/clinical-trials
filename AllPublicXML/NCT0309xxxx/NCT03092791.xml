  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to select the optimal antigen content of the three Sabin
      poliovirus strains (types 1, 2, and 3) entering the composition of the stand-alone trivalent
      Sabin-based inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (sIPV) to take forward into advanced stage
      studies. The selection will be carried out comparing the three sIPV study arms based on the
      safety and tolerability profile after each dose of primary immunization and the immune
      response to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 for both Sabin and Salk strains, after the final
      dose of a three dose primary immunization series (Day 85).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called sIPV. sIPV is used to prevent poliomyelitis.
      This study will look at the safety, tolerability of sIPV in healthy adults, toddlers and
      infants as well as immunogenicity in toddlers and infants. .

      The study will enroll approximately 340 participants including 40 adults, 60 toddlers and 240
      infants. Adult participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment
      groups—which will remain undisclosed to study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  sIPV High Dose

        -  Placebo (saline control - 0.9% sodium chloride)

      Toddler participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups:

        -  sIPV High Dose

        -  Reference IPV

      Infant participants will be randomly assigned to one of following treatment groups:

        -  sIPV Low Dose

        -  sIPV Medium Dose

        -  sIPV High Dose

        -  Reference IPV Adults and toddlers will receive intramuscular injection on Day 1. Infants
           will receive intramuscular injection on Days 1, 29, 57 and 365.

      This is a single center trial. The overall time to participate in this study for adult is 8
      days, for toddlers is 183 days and infants is 547 days.
