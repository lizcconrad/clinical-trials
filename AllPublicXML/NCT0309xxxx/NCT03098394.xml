  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of utilizing a rapid turnaround CT/NG
      test on treatment of female patients in the emergency department or urgent care setting with
      possible STIs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All females ages 18-55 presenting to the UMMC Emergency Department or Urgent Care whose
      provider suspects sexually transmitted infection will be offered study enrollment and be
      randomly assigned to either the control or the experimental group. Both groups will have a
      urinalysis, a pregnancy test, a pelvic exam, and an endocervical sample collected, but the
      experimental group's urine will be used to run the rapid turnaround test (RTAT) instead of
      the standard PCR. Data will be collected regarding provider decision making, length of stay
      in the emergency department, patient satisfaction, clinician satisfaction, further healthcare
      sought by patient, and cost surrounding each treatment.

    <description>Patients randomized to this arm will be tested for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) with both the rapid nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) as well as the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The results from the rapid turnaround test will guide providers on treatment decisions for a possible STI. The results from the PCR test will be used to verify the results of the rapid turnaround test.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients randomized to this arm will be tested for a sexually transmitted infection (STI) using the conventional PCR test. The results from the PCR test normally take approximately 48-72 hours and these patients will likely receive treatment based on the decision of the clinical provider. The results from the PCR test will be used to verify the decision of the clinical provider to treat or withhold treatment for a possible STI.</description>
