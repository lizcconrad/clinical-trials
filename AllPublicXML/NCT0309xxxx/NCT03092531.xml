  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial is to test the efficacy of a stepped-care &quot;adaptive&quot;
      Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) adherence intervention (&quot;Positive STEPS&quot;) for HIV infected
      adolescents and young adults, ages 16 to 24. Stepped care is a healthcare delivery model in
      which the least resource intensive part of an intervention is delivered first, and only those
      who do not improve then receive the high intensity, more resource intensive part of an
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infected adolescents and young adults will be recruited from Providence, Rhode Island and
      Chicago, Illinois. Participants will be equally randomized to:

        1. &quot;Positive STEPS&quot; - a stepped care, adherence intervention with integrated technology
           (2-way daily text messaging aimed at improving ART adherence). If text messaging is not
           sufficient to overcome the barriers to ART adherence;these individuals will then also
           receive the more intensive component based on general principles of cognitive-behavioral
           therapy.

        2. Standard of Care comparison group including a brief adherence educational session. This
           will consist of a review of medications and recommended dosing (i.e., to understand
           regimen), adherence expectations, toxicity expectations and medication
           misperceptions.The participant will then view a 20-minute animated tutorial which
           explains the importance of adherence to antiretroviral medication effectiveness.

    <ipd_description>Present at least annually on data collected after the second year when sufficient baseline data is collected. Randomized controlled efficacy trial, we anticipate that most of the papers and data-based projects and presentations will happen in year 5, once baseline data and follow-up assessments have occurred. Sharing findings will involve several papers, including a baseline paper, intervention-specific paper, primary paper describing the study outcomes, secondary outcomes papers and potentially a book that describes the intervention, submitting to lead workshops on the intervention approach at relevant national and international meetings and conferences. Raw data for additional analysis will be available by contacting the Principal Investigators.</ipd_description>
