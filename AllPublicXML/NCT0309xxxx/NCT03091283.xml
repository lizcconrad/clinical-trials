      Nurse anaesthetist student is a registered nurse who spends 1- year training in anaesthesia,
      has to work laboriously to cope with all assigned activities day and night. Time management,
      therefore, becomes a practical tool for nurse student to reach her goal. However, many
      factors act as barriers to nurse students' attaining and maintaining a high grade point
      average (GPA). Investigators would like to determine the effect of skills in time management
      on GPA amongst faculty nursing students.

      Skills in time management are crucial for academic success. It can be defined as clusters of
      behavioural set that are essentials in the organisation of learning load. These are comprised
      of activities such as planning, prioritising, preparation, and following schedules.
      Consequently, it yields an impact on students' achievement.

      Nurse anaesthetist student is a registered nurse who spends 1- year training in anaesthesia.
      She has to work laboriously to cope with all assigned activities day and night. Time
      management, therefore, becomes a practical tool for nurse student to reach her goal. It has
      many good aspects; namely, problem analysis, target determination, planning, implementation,
      evaluation and revision for improvement .

      However, many factors act as barriers to nurse students' attaining and maintaining a high
      grade point average (GPA) at their training. Faculty members target all these issues in
      developing strategies to improve students' academic performance and learning achievement. As
      a result, time management would be a solution to solve these problems.

      Investigators would like to determine the effect of skills in time management on GPA amongst
      faculty nursing students. The research questions are as follows:

        1. What is the nurse student's competency on Time management?

        2. What is the relationship between GPA and Time management skills among faculty nursing
           students?
