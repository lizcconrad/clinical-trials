    <textblock>
      Risk-patients for diabetes or patients that are diagnosed with this condition but who are not
      treated with insulin are randomized two times, according to diet and according to the type of
      support:

      Randomization with regard to carbohydrate restriction (25-30 E% or &lt; 10E%). Randomization
      with regard to type of psychological support. Either according to Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy or to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy. Both kinds of psychological support
      is given as group therapy.

      Two-hundred patients are recruited and each patient is followed for two years.

      The organizers will recruit 200 patients in the study &quot;To lower glucose levels and reduce
      weight by exclusion of carbohydrates and inclusion of psychological behavioral support&quot;
      (LOWinCHIP) at the primary care health center &quot;Cithyhälsan Centrum&quot; in Norrköping. Each
      patient will be followed for 2 years. Patients are eligible if they have are above 18 years
      of age and have a BMI above 28 kg/m2 and also belong to one or more of the following groups:
      1) type 2 diabetes that is not treated with insulin. 2) Patients that have had gestational
      diabetes or who have 3) first grade relative with type 2 diabetes. Finally 4) pre-diabetic
      individuals with impaired fasting glucose (6.1-6.9 mmol) or impaired glucose tolerance
      (capillary plasma glucose 8.9-12-1 after glucose challenge) are also potential participants.
      Patients must not have insulin therapy or severe kidney failure (GFR&lt; 30). They can also not
      have severe physical restrictions for activity and they must not have difficulties with
      understanding written Swedish texts.

      The participants are randomized two times (two by two factorial):

      Randomization with regard to carbohydrate restriction (25-30 E% or &lt; 10E%). Randomization
      with regard to type of psychological support. Either according to Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy (ACT) or to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy. Each group will have three
      group sessions with approximately 8 participants followed by a telephone call by the
      therapist. Each session will be held by the psychologists that are part of the Cityhälsan
      Centrum staff.

      The study has &gt; 95% power to demonstrate 5% HbA1c (mmol/mol) difference between groups with a
      drop out of 25%.
