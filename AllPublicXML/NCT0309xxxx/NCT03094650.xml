  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims at investigating (i) the feasibility in chronic stroke of using a
      dedicated virtual reality (VR) based system that embeds real-time 3D motion capture and
      embodied visual feedback to deliver functional exercises designed for training of impaired
      upper limb motor skills, (ii) whether chronic stroke survivors improve in functional outcomes
      in the upper limb when exposed to intensive VR-based therapy, and (iii) safety and tolerance
      to such a technology. The investigators hypothesize that intensive VR-based rehabilitation
      may lead to high rehabilitation doses and functional improvement in chronic stroke.
