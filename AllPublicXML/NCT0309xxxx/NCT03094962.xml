  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is the second joint in the finger from the finger
      tip. The outcome following replacement surgery of this joint is considered unsatisfactory. In
      order to improve these outcomes, it would be helpful to understand the geometry of the joint,
      how it moves and the forces that are involved. This can be achieved using computer models
      that model the bones and the soft tissues - musculoskeletal models. In order to make these
      models as representative as possible, they should be generated using anatomical data.

      Data will initially be extracted from patients' existing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      computed tomography (CT) scans. This will enable the computer model to begin being
      constructed. In parallel to the model initialisation, anatomical and motion data of the PIP
      joint of healthy volunteers will be collected. The necessary data will be collected using CT
      and MRI scans, as well as optical motion tracking methods. These data will then be used to
      populate the musculoskeletal model.

      Once the model is constructed, it will be used to simulate the motion of the joint and look
      at the effect of a simulated PIP joint replacement. This information should then provide
      insight as to how PIP joint replacements might be improved in future.

          -  Over 18 years old and able to provide informed consent

          -  No known problems relating to the PIP joint

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers involved in other studies concerned with the function and anatomy of the
             PIP joint which would have adverse effects on this study and/or the study in which

          -  Those undergoing treatment related to the PIP joint

          -  No metallic object should be present in the scanner and therefore those with any
