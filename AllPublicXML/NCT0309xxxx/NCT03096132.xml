  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate whether a less intensive intervention, Guided
      Self-Help Family Based Treatment (gshFBT), is non-inferior to the more intensive Family Based
      Treatment (FBT) for childhood obesity on child weight loss over 18-months. Cost-effectiveness
      of both treatments will also be compared.

      The primary aim of this project is to determine whether gshFBT is non-inferior to FBT for
      childhood obesity on child weight loss. Four assessments will be conducted; baseline (month
      0), month 6 (post-treatment), and at month 12 and month 18. Assessments will include the
      following for child and parent: anthropometry, physical activity, nutrition, and
      cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated from a societal perspective and a
      third party payor perspective. This program of research has the potential to advance the
      standard of practice for children who are overweight or obese by providing a less intensive
      but more cost-effective intervention.
