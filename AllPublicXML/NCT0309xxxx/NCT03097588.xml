    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride work in
      preventing chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer undergoing the
      BEAM conditioning regimen before stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy, such as carmustine,
      cytarabine, etoposide, and melphalan (BEAM), makes people feel sick to their stomach and
      causes vomiting. Netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride may reduce the nausea and vomiting
      caused by the BEAM treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride (NEPA) to prevent
      nausea and vomiting both during and after a highly emetogenic (BEAM) conditioning regimen for
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To differentiate response to NEPA over different phases of chemotherapy-induced nausea.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 60 minutes before standard of care BEAM treatment, patients receive netupitant and
      palonosetron hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1, 3, and 6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days.
