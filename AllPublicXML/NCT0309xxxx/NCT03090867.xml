  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICUs have always perceived by the public has a very technical unit with a restricted and/or
      forbidden access. Physical alteration of the patient, seeing the patient sedated, the large
      numbers of devices, the alarms and an uncertain prognosis. All this factors can be perceived
      by people close to the patient as a source of stress. In the literature, numerous studies
      have shown that families develop anxiety and depression symptoms while their loved one is
      hospitalized in the ICU. French intensive care societies thought of ways to prevent or
      diminish these symptoms. The 6th consensus conference on &quot; Live better in the ICU &quot;
      recommends: effective and adapted information, large visiting hours to reach an unrestricted
      access and family participation in care.

      The unit has taken this path to improve patient and family centered care by: creating a
      welcome leaflet, a room dedicated to meetings with families and an ICU open 24/7bto families,
      with the possibility for children to visit their parents. Hence, spontaneously, relatives
      have expressed the wish to participate to certain care and when participating, expressed
      their satisfaction. This observation and testimonies from family members and patients led us
      to think about the impact of participation of care. Two major French studies have shown
      contradictory outcomes: 16% of families would have been willing to participate in the first
      study against 97% in the second one. These studies were survey done after the ICU discharge.

      No study today has assessed the actual impact of family participation in care. The aim of
      this clinical trial is to diminish anxiety and depression symptoms. By participating in care,
      relatives can develop or strengthen a relationship of trust with caregivers. It could
      contribute also to a better understanding of the plan of care and an easier context to
      announce negative outcomes.

      Randomisation visit - D1:

      After checking the eligibilities criteria, a member of the staff will explain to the patient
      and his relative or surrogate the purpose and the planning of the study. The inform consent
      will be signed by the physician of the study. Two informs consents will be signed : one by
      the patient and the other one by the relative or surrogate. The randomisation will be done
      after collecting these consents.

      After the draw, the subjects will be randomized either in the control group &quot;Conventional
      support&quot; or the experimental group &quot;Intervention&quot;.

      Questionnaires to be completed by the :

        -  relatives or surrogates: Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD scale),
           Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI20), Zarit Burden Interview (ZARIT sale) , Beck
           Depression Inventory (Beck), State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and &quot;preliminary&quot;

        -  patient if possible: HAD scale

      Admission + 10 days visit:

      Questionnaires to be completed by the relatives or surrogates: HAD scale, MIF20, ZARIT, Beck,
      STAI and &quot;discharge&quot;

      ICU discharge visit :

      Questionnaires to be completed by the :

        -  relatives or surrogates: HAD scale, MIF20, ZARIT, Beck, STAI and &quot;discharge&quot;

        -  patient if possible: HAD scale

      Medical staff:

      In order to evaluate the feeling of the ICU staff, a satisfaction questionnaire will be
      propose at the beginning and at the end of the study.
