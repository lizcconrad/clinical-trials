      Participants will enroll in a 14-week study (2 weeks of baseline, 8 weeks of treatment, and 4
      weeks of follow-up) investigating the impact that Alkontrol-herbal (Isoflavone; Kudzu) has on
      alcohol intake in a population seeking treatment for an alcohol use disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 15 years, the Behavioral Psychopharmacology Research Lab at McLean Hospital has
      extensively studied kudzu extract and demonstrated its safety and efficacy in healthy control
      subjects as well as in heavy binge drinkers. The relative success of our recent outpatient
      trial of kudzu extract demonstrated a modest decrease in drinking, reduction in the number of
      heavy drinking days, and significant increase in the number of days abstinent. This suggests
      that Alkontrol-herbal, kudzu extract, may be a useful adjunct in treating alcohol use
      disorders.

      Participants will enroll in a 14-week study (2 weeks of baseline, 8 weeks of treatment, and 4
      weeks of follow-up) investigating the impact that Alkontrol-herbal has on alcohol intake in a
      population (age 21-60 years) seeking treatment for an alcohol use disorder. Participants will
      take 500 mg of a crude kudzu extract (NPI-031, Alkontrol-herbal; Natural Pharmacia
      International, Burlington, MA) t.i.d.; matched sugar beet placebo capsules will serve as
      placebo. Subjects will come to the lab three times a week to provide urine samples that can
      be tested for medication compliance through a biochemical marker, acetazolamide, included in
      the medication capsules. Participants will record their alcohol intake through daily diaries
      and a wrist actigraphy device, which will also monitor their sleep/wake activity.
