      The aim of this study was to determine if Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch
      (BPD-DS) with a longer strict alimentary limb at the expense of a shorter biliopancreatic
      limb will offer significant weight lost, but with lesser gastrointestinal complaints, protein
      deficiency, vitamin and trace element deficit compared to standard BPD-DS.

      This two-group, randomized, single-blind pilot study is conducted in a university-affiliated
      tertiary care center. The study protocol was approved by our ethic committee. Enrollment and
      randomization of the patients occurred between May 20163 and June 2015. Patients are
      undergoing follow-up evaluation. Patients were initially referred to our center for a
      bariatric surgery evaluation. Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older and met the
      criteria for a laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion. Patients were excluded if they had a
      BMI ≥ 50 mg/m², a pacemaker, cirrhosis or if they were planing pregnancy in the next 2 years.
      Each patient was required to provide written informed consent. Patients were randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo a standard biliopancreatic diversion (control group) or a
      modified biliopancreatic diversion with a longer strict alimentary limb (study group). A
      sealed envelope with the assignation was given to the surgeon in the operation room just
      before the procedure. Patients are followed every 6 months after surgery, up to 24-months for
      clinical evaluation, resolution of comorbidities, evaluation of side-effects, quality of
      life, bioimpedance testing and bloodwork.
