  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide use of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), which is mechanical device to
      improve hemodynamic function, has improved the outcomes of severe heart failure (HF) patients
      leading to the continued annual increase in the number of LVAD implantations. However LVAD
      support still results in major complications such as renal failure or gastrointestinal
      bleeding. The investigators hypothesize that such major complications may be due to
      endothelial dysfunction induced by the lack of pulsatility, which may be improved by an
      innovative designer natriuretic peptide, CD-NP. They have demonstrated its favorable actions
      in animal models as well as humans, and tested its safety in LVAD patients. They hypothesize
      that CD-NP will have renal and endothelial protective actions through its receptor GC-A and
      GC-B. Thus, the investigators will test their hypothesis with a highly translational approach
      to examine CD-NP's role in endothelial and renal protection.

      The aim is to determine safety and tolerability together with cGMP activating, neurohumoral
      modulating and renovascular protective properties of chronic subcutaneous delivery of CD-NP
      compared to placebo in stable LVAD patients for 3 days.

      Stable patients with LVAD implantation (3 months s/p implantation) will undergo 3-day testing
      in the Mayo Clinic's Clinical Research and Trials Unit. They will undergo daily subcutaneous
      injection of CD-NP, or placebo, for 3 days with hemodynamic monitoring, ECHO, endothelial
      function assessment, and renal blood flow monitoring. Blood and urine samples will also be
      collected and assayed.
