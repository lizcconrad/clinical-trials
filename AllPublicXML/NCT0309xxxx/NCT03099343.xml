  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will determine the effectiveness of a mobile application location-based
      tailored notification message system in helping hypertensive patients reduce dietary sodium
      intake and feel more confident in following a low sodium diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with high blood pressure often get advice to lower their salt or sodium intake. High
      dietary sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, stroke, heart failure and kidney
      disease. U.S. federal guidelines advocate daily sodium intake of less than 2,300 milligrams
      (mg). The estimated average sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 mg per day. In recent years,
      consumption of processed and restaurant foods has substantially increased. More than 75% of
      sodium in the average U.S. diet now comes from these sources.

      The mobile application will deliver tailored messages based on the user's location and
      previously identified high-sodium food items that they commonly consume.

      This 8-week research study at Visit 1 or baseline will consent and randomize 50 eligible
      adults with high blood pressure to use the mobile application daily or to follow their usual
      eating pattern with no access to the application.

      All participants will be asked to complete four surveys at baseline and Week 8: Block Food
      Frequency Questionnaire, Block Sodium Screener, Self-care Confidence in following a Low
      Sodium Diet and the Automated Self-administered 24-Hour Dietary Recall survey. All
      participants will be asked to provide a baseline and end of study 24-hour urine collection,
      regularly provide home blood pressure measurements and urine dipstick tests every two weeks.

    <description>Change from baseline in Self-care Confidence in Following a Low-sodium Diet Scale (SCFLDS) at week 8. It assesses the participants' confidence in the ability to select and prepare low-sodium foods. The self-reported tool consists of 7 items with 4 response options per item. The score range is 1-4 (1=Not confident, 2=Somewhat confident, 3=Very confident, 4=Extremely confident) then added for each question. Possible scores range from 7 to 28 and the higher the score indicates greater confidence.</description>
