  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II clinical trial studies how well photodynamic therapy with HPPH works
      compared to standard of care surgery in treating patients with oral cavity cancer.
      Photodynamic therapy can destroy or control disease by using a combination of drug, such as
      HPPH, and light and may be as effective as surgery in treating patients with oral cavity
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the non-inferiority of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to standard of care surgery by
      comparing the rate of tumor response after PDT to those observed after surgery, at 24 months
      post treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine quality of life (QoL) at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post PDT or surgery.

      II. To assess the toxicity using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 4.0).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immune markers (T cells). II. To investigate the correlation of the diffuse reflectance
      optical spectroscopy with tumor response to PDT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care surgery on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive HPPH intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 0 and undergo PDT on day
      1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months in year 1 and
      every 3-6 months in year 2.

Formal statistical examination of longitudinal patterns will be done through the use of a mixed model.
