      Depression is one of the major causes of disability for the elderly which accounts for 1.6%
      of total disability. There are three representative approaches to depression treatment
      including medication, psychological intervention and lifestyle modification. While medication
      and psychological intervention are first line treatments for depression, lifestyle
      modification offers a potentially safe and low-cost option which is suitable for especially
      elderly populations in the community.

      Lifestyle modification for management of depression involves the application of
      environmental, behavioral, and psychological concepts to increase physical and mental
      wellness. This may involve modification of several domain related depression including diet,
      physical activity, relaxation &amp; recreation and avoidance of smoking and alcohol. Especially,
      scheduling for meaningful activities which encourage community engagement and strengthen
      social relationship is beneficial psychosocial technique to improve depression.

      However, lifestyle modification in geriatric patients should be considered in the context of
      easy applicability and effectiveness for the elderly in the community. Motivational issues,
      time and resources restrictions, and priority issue may have an impact on older adult's
      ability to implement lifestyle changes in the community. First it is necessary to consider
      readiness to habitual behavior change regarding lifestyle modification4. Second, continuous
      and active engagement is increased in its development and planning of intervention. Third,
      interventions should be individually tailored and offer incentives to improve lack of
      motivation, which was frequently presented in older patients with depression.

      Previously, the investigators have proposed a therapeutic model to change a lifestyle in the
      elderly for reducing cognitive dysfunction which was developed taking cognizance of the above
      factors. Based on the previous model, the investigators developed a community-implantable
      multi-domain lifestyle modification with contingency management for depression in older
      adults. The main objective of the present study was to conduct randomized controlled study to
      test the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of this intervention compared to usual
      care management in the community.

    <description>Based on SIGN guidelines for non-pharmaceutical management of depression, the investigators developed 4 area of lifestyle modification with contingency management including physical activity, healthy diet, social activity and emotional regulation. To maintain the motivation of participants, the investigators applied prize-based contingency management for each lifestyle modification goal. The investigators provided once a week of telephone-check and once a month of visit-check during the follow-up period for 12 weeks.</description>
