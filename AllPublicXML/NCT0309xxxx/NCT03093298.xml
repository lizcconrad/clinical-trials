    <textblock>
      Examination of the molecular phenotype and composition of endocrine cells in the
      gastrointestinal tract correlated to analyses of blood for hormones/analytes before and after
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in morbidly obese individuals both with and without type 2
      diabetes

      Enteroscopy was conducted during sedation with Propofol®. The pre-surgical sampling included
      biopsies retrieved from the stomach and at the expected site of anastomosis. During RYGB
      surgery, a ~1 cm gut tissue sample was removed at the site of anastomosis. The post-surgical
      enteroscopy ~3 months after RYGB surgery included biopsies taken from the gastric pouch, the
      alimentary limb, the biliopancreatic limb and common channel. One sample from each location
      was immersion-fixated in formalin for subsequent histological analyses and one sample was
      placed in a tube with RNA-preserving media for mRNA expression analysis. Remaining samples
      were snap-frozen and stored at -80°C until further processing.

      Enteroendocrine cells were identified and isolated from biopsies obtained at several sites in
      the small intestine by using immunohistochemistry and laser capture technology. Isolated
      individual enteroendocrine cells were extensively characterised by next generation sequencing
      (Illumina NGS).

      The participants also went through four mixed meal tests with blood sampling performed:
      before an 8 % diet-induced weight loss was initiated and one week before/one week after/3
      months after RYGB surgery. Blood was sampled at several specific time points.

      The plasma, serum and urine collected from study participants before and after RYGB surgery
      will be analysed for biomarkers/analytes and correlated with clinical data (weight, BMI,
      waist/hip ratio, blood pressure) and molecular phenotype found in gut samples.

      To study changes in gut bacteria (microbiota) composition stool samples were collected during
      the study and will be analysed for microbiota composition by means of bacterial DNA
      sequencing.

             and/or SGLT2 inhibitors.

          -  Co-morbidities that, in the discretion of the investigators, exclude study
             participation such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) stage III,
