        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects (young and elderly):

          1. A signed and dated informed consent form before any study-specific screening procedure
             is performed.

          2. Healthy as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history, physical
             examination, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and digital 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG).

          3. Non-smoker or smoker of &lt;10 cigarettes per day as determined by history. Must be able
             to abstain from smoking during the inpatient stay.

             Young subjects only:

          4. Males aged between 18 and 45 years, inclusive.

             Elderly subjects only:

          5. Males older than 65 years, inclusive. Specific inclusion criteria procedure:
             genotyping Since acetylation is an important BIA 5-453 metabolic pathway, NAT1 and
             NAT2 genotyping was required for inclusion for distinguishing between poor and faster
             acetylators (both could however be enrolled in the study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All subjects (young and elderly):

        General

          1. Subjects who had participated in a clinical trial with an investigational drug within
             the 90 days prior to screening.

          2. Subjects who were likely to be noncompliant with the protocol, or who were felt to be
             unsuitable by the Investigator for any other reason.

          3. Positive serologic findings for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies,
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.

          4. Positive findings of urine drug screen (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
             cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, opiates, MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine;
             ecstasy]).

             Medical History

          5. Any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory (e.g. childhood asthma),
             gastrointestinal, endocrine (e.g. diabetes), immunological, dermatological,
             haematological, neurological, or psychiatric disease and history thereof.

          6. Acute disease state (e.g., nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhoea) within 7 days before
             study Day 1.

          7. Subjects proned to orthostatic hypotension: there was a measurement of supine blood
             pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) after the subjects had been resting for at least 10
             minutes, followed by standing BP and HR after 2 minutes of standing: orthostatic
             hypotension as defined by as a difference between supine systolic BP (SBP) and
             standing SBP ≥20 mmHg or a difference between supine diastolic BP (DBP) and standing
             DBP ≥10 mmHg.

          8. History of drug abuse within 1 year before study day 1.

          9. History of alcoholism within 1 year before day 1. Consumption of more than 50 g of
             ethanol per day (12.5 cL glass of 10° [10%] wine = 12 g; 4 cL of aperitif, 42° [42%]
             whiskey = 17 g; 25 cL glass of 3° [3%] beer = 7.5 g; 25 cL glass of 6° [6%] beer = 15
             g.

         10. History of any clinically important drug allergy.

         11. Had previously received BIA 5-453. Prohibited treatments and dietary restrictions

         12. Consumption of any caffeine-containing products (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate, or
             soda) in excess of 6 cups per day (or equivalent), of grapefruit,
             grapefruit-containing products, or alcoholic beverages within 24 hours before study
             day 1.

         13. Use of any over-the-counter drugs including herbal supplements (except for the
             occasional use of acetaminophen [paracetamol], aspirin and vitamins ≤100% recommended
             daily allowance) within 7 days before BIA 5-453 administration.

         14. Donation of blood (i.e. 450 mL) within 60 days before study day 1.

             Young subjects only:

             General

         15. An automatic QTc interval reading ≥450 ms at the screening assessment. Prohibited
             treatments and dietary restrictions

         16. Prohibited Treatments: use of any investigational drug within 90 days (young and
             elderly subjects) or prescription drug within 30 days before BIA 5-453 administration.

             Elderly subjects only:

             General

         17. An automatic QTc interval reading ≥470 ms at the screening assessment.
