    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the feasibility of a staff-lead workout program, 3-Step Workout for Life,
      in a local senior living community. Eligible participants will complete assessments before
      and after the workout program.

      The 3-Step Workout for Life program is designed to help older adults improve muscle strength
      and apply the improved muscle strength to perform activities of daily living. The 10-week
      workout consists of single-joint resistance exercise, multiple-joint resistance exercise, and
      activities of daily living exercise. Participants will exercise in small groups in a
      community room as well as one-on-one with the fitness staff in their home. The community
      fitness staff will learn the 3-Step Workout for Life program from the University partner and
      deliver the program.

    <description>Participants will exercise at the moderate intensity three times a week for 10 weeks. The total of 30 workout sessions will consist of 18 sessions of group single-joint resistance exercise, 6 sessions of one-on-one multiple-joint resistance exercise, and 6 sessions of one-on-one activities of daily living exercise. During the resistance exercise sessions, participants will use resistance tubing to strengthen major muscle groups of the upper extremity and lower extremity. During the activities of daily living exercise, participants will practice daily tasks around the home. The community fitness staff will modify the task demand to increase the physical challenge of the task to each participant, for example, increasing travel distance.</description>
