  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Calcipotriene cream. This is a
      synthetic vitamin D3 derivative for topical use. It is used to treat grade 1-3 acute skin
      graft versus host disease (GVHD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.
      Calcipotriene will be used as the exclusive topical therapy in addition to standard of care
      GVHD treatment prescribed for the study subject by the primary physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute skin GVHD affects about one third of pediatric and adult transplant recipients. Chronic
      GVHD (cGVHD) affects 40-60% of adult patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT. It is a
      major cause of non-relapse mortality and morbidity. Systemic prednisone is the first-line
      treatment for cGVHD; however, about one-half of all patients do not respond to this initial
      therapy, and there is no standard second-line therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy used for
      treatment of GVHD brings significant risk of infection, poorly affecting clinical outcomes.

      Vitamin D affects immunoregulation, fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis and
      endothelial cell function, and the investigators hypothesize that topical vitamin D
      application will have a positive effect on acute and chronic skin GVHD. The investigators
      hypothesize that topical vitamin D cream may restore normal cell function and decrease the
      use of steroid creams in acute GVHD of the skin.
