  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label observational clinical study to compare the efficacy of EMLA cream (lidocaine
      2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% in a ratio of 1:1 by weight) in comparison to the established local
      anesthesia (LA) protocol of lidocaine subcutaneous injection, in providing adequate
      peri-operative local anesthesia during transradial coronary angiography
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 800 consecutive patients, who are referred for elective coronary angiography to
      1st Cardiology Department cathlab, with the suspicion of coronary artery disease (CAD) will
      be enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria are acute coronary syndrome, previous
      ipsilateral transradial approach, Raynaud's syndrome, abnormal renal function with or without
      need for hemodialysis, known history of sensitivity to local anesthetics, non-palpable radial
      pulse, abnormal Barbeau's test and patient's refusal. Baseline clinical, demographic and
      procedural data of the study population will be recorded.

      The study will not involve any intervention but it will observe patients assigned to other
      EMLA cream or lidocaine injection for local anesthesia as part of their clinical routine
      treatment during transradial catherization.

      Primary end-point: the perception of radial pain assessed during artery puncture and 30
      minutes after sheath removal. Secondary end-point: The number of puncture attempts, the total
      time required before successful sheath insertion, and the occurrence of radial artery spasm
      will be also documented in each group Participants will be observed for 4 hours post
      angiography for development of local complications or side effects.
