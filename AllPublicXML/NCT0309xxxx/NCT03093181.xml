    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the cosmetic benefit provided by twice daily application
      of a developmental moisturising cream with niacinamide for 8 weeks in healthy female
      participants with sensitive, oily, blemish-prone skin.

      This study broadly consists of two phases: screening / washout phase (5-7 day) followed by
      treatment phase (approximately of 8 weeks). Participants will be asked to return to the study
      site 1 week, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after their randomisation visit for instrumental
      measurements and clinical assessments.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Lay person assessment of the of blemishes appearance by photographic assessment at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline and week 8 photographs of all the participants will be displayed side by side on a high resolution, colour-calibrated display screen in a room with neutral wall colours and standardised lighting and all practical efforts will be made to minimize glare. The relative positioning (left and right) of the baseline and week 8 photographs will be blinded to the evaluator and randomised. A technician will use the randomisation schedule to display each pair of images to each lay evaluator. Lay evaluators will judge the magnitude of the improvement in overall appearance of blemishes using the below scale: Left= the blemishes in the image on the left are more obvious than those in the image on the right and Right= the blemishes in the image on the right are more obvious than those in the image on the left.</description>

    <time_frame>At Baseline, Week 1, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment blinded, trained and qualified evaluator will conduct instrumental measurements of skin sebum levels. Measurement of skin sebum levels will be performed by with a Sebumeter SM 815. Sebumeter measurements will be taken in triplicate at the central forehead (above the eyebrows) with the participant lying horizontally, on their back.</description>

    <time_frame>At Baseline, Week 1, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The forehead of each participant will be thoroughly cleansed by the investigator or designee using cotton pads saturated with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol and, after 5 minutes, the central area of the forehead above the eyebrows will be measured in triplicate with a Sebumeter. The same area will be measured in triplicate 90 minutes after cleansing. The sebum excretion rate will be calculated by the difference in 90 minute and 5 minute Sebumeter values.</description>
