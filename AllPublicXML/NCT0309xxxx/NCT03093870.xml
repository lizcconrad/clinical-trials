  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol for Varlitinib is developed for the treatment of Biliary Tract Cancer.
      Varlitinib (also known as ASLAN001) is a small-molecule, adenosine triphosphate competitive
      inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal
      growth factor receptor (HER)2, and HER4. Varlitinib may be beneficial to subjects with cancer
      by simultaneous inhibition of these receptors. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      safety and efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of
      Biliary Tract Cancer. Treatment groups are Varlitinib+capecitabine and Placebo + capecitabine

          3. Have evidence of multiple (≥ 2) peritoneal metastases or ascites at baseline as
             assessed by ICR (For Part 1). (Ascites which can be attributed by non-malignant causes
             is not excluded.)

          4. Have had major surgical procedures within 14 days prior to first dose of study
             medication

          5. Have a known metastatic brain lesion(s), including asymptomatic and well controlled
             lesion(s)

          6. Have malabsorption syndrome, diseases significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function, resection of the stomach or small bowel, or difficulty in swallowing and
             retaining oral medications which in the opinion of the Investigator could jeopardize
             the validity of the study results

          7. Have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes,
             hypertension, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements

          8. Have any history of other malignancy unless in remission for more than 1 year
             (non-melanoma skin carcinoma and carcinoma-in-site of uterine cervix treated with
             curative intent is not exclusionary)

          9. Are female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding

         10. Have been previously treated with varlitinib or have been previously treated with
             capecitabine as first line therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. For patients
             who have previously received capecitabine as a radiosensitizer or as part of their
             adjuvant therapy and their disease has relapsed for more than 6 months after their
             last dose of capecitabine adjuvant therapy, their capecitabine therapy will not be
             considered as a line of systemic chemotherapy for metastatic/advanced disease, and
             thus they can participate in the study

         11. Have received any investigational drug (or have used an investigational device) within
