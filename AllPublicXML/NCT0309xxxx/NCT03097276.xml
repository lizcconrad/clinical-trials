  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic fistula is the most feared complication after surgical resection of colorectal
      cancer (CCR). It occurs in 6 to 15% of patients. Beyond the risk of death in the immediate
      postoperative period, the pain that it induces, the resources required for its management,
      the need for stomata with a negative impact on patients' quality of life and the prolongation
      of hospitalization, it also has a now-recognized adverse effect on long-term survival.

      The early detection of this complication may limit its impact. C-reactive protein (CRP) has
      proved to be an early, reliable marker of the onset of infectious complications of colorectal
      surgery.

      However, the diagnostic procedure to implement in these patients is not at all codified,
      since this population concerned by systematic CRP assay in the postoperative period is very
      recent.

      The procedures to implement in these patients so that they can obtain the maximal benefit of
      an early diagnosis have not yet been established. An algorithm for the proactive clinical
      management must be drawn up to be able to confirm or rule out the presence of a fistula as
      soon as a high level of CRP is detected, and to propose a quick treatment to ensure that
      patients benefit from this early diagnosis.

          -  patients aged 18 and older,

          -  with a CRP level &gt; 125 mg/L at D4 following colon and/or rectal resection with

             surgical treatment for peritoneal carcinomatosis

          -  patients with a diagnosis of another infection that could explain the high CRP level,
