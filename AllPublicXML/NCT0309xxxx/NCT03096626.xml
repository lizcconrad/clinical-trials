      The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), second version, was used to quantify the levels of
      depression. Mean age, duration of HD, hemoglobin levels, serum ferritin levels, serum iron
      levels, TSAT, TIBC, serum albumin levels, CRP and energy consumption (kcal/week) were
      included in the model as multivariate variables. Backward stepwise logistic regression (ROC)
      analysis was performed.
