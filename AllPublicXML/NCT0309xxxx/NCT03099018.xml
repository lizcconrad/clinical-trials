  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in children represents a frequent diagnostic
      challenge in pediatric emergency departments, since isolated signs and clinical prediction
      rules are insufficient to accurately discriminate between GAS and non GAS infections. Rapid
      antigen detection tests (RADTs) therefore remain essential, simple and rapid tools, allowing
      for rapid GAS identification and prompt antibiotic prescription. However, their sensitivity
      is not optimal. The aim of the present study is to test the accuracy of a new fluorescent
      immunoassay (Sofia Strep A FIA) using the optical technology for GAS detection in children
      3-15 years old with pharyngitis, compared to a standard RADT, using throat culture as the
      gold standard (or PCR for discrepant results, i.e. negative culture with any positive RADT).
