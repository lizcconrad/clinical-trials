      The purpose of the study is to testify whether ocular electroacupuncture or ocular
      acupuncture is effective for abducens nerve palsy (ANP), through treating ANP patient for 6
      weeks, using self-invented acupoints according to anatomy of extraocular muscles innervated
      by abducens nerve, and using sham acupuncture as controlled group, and try to provide
      clinical evidence for promoting these new techniques.

    <description>During intervention period, patients will continue to keep medications for primary condition. Patient's skin located in the extraocular muscles projection area is routinely disinfected. A diameter of 0.20 mm and length of 25 mm needle is inserted slowly. Piercing depth is about 20mm. The electropuncture apparatus is used, each group of electrodes are distinguished with different colors of wires to generate current stimulations of current 1.0~1.5 milliampere (mA), voltage 9 volt(V), frequency 1.5 hertz (Hz), and duration of 40 minutes.</description>
