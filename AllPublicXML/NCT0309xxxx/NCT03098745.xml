  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-dispensing fitting study is to evaluate the short term lens fit, vision
      performance of three monthly replacement sphere lenses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 40-subject, double masked, randomized, bilateral, non-dispensing fitting trial
      comparing hydrogel and silicone hydrogel lens materials. It is anticipated that this study
      will involve 2 visits for each lens pair, as follows: Visits: V1 (lens dispensing), V2 (1
      hour post lens settling). Each subject will be randomized to wear each pair bilaterally in a
      series of three short fitting comparisons.
