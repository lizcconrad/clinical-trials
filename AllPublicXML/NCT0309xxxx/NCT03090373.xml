  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded rct to evaluate the effect of the UroShield SAW transducer on
      preventing bacterial colonization in longterm indwelling catheters. The duration of the trial
      is 30 days. The investigator will be quantifying the number of bacterial colonies in the
      urinary catheter and in the bladder in both the treatment and control group.

    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded Randomized controoled trial of 30 days duration. The trial device is
      the Uroshield, SAW device which is an externally applied device attached to the external
      portion of the urinary catheter.

      Subjects will be randomized to a control group and the treatment group. The control group
      will receive standard of care for the care of indwelling urinary catheters, while being
      attached to a sham UroShield device. The treatment group will receive the same standard of
      care treatment but will be attached to an active UroShield SAW device.

      At baseline and again at 30 days, both the catheter and retained urine from the bladder will
      be evaluated for the number of live colonies. These numbers will be evaluated to see if there
      is a difference between the active and sham devices.

Standard of care for the upkeep and cleanliness of the catheter will be adhered to.
At both the baseline and at the conclusion of 30 days, the distal end of the catheter will be collected as well as a sample of retained urine from the bladder and these samples will be evaluated for bacterial colonization.</description>
