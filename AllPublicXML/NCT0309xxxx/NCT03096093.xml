  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates four different doses of ACIT-1 for safety and for the ability to raise
      effective anti-cancer immune responses in patients with pancreatic and other late stage
      cancers. Approximately half of the patients will have pancreatic cancer and the other half
      will have other late stage cancers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immune system has an important role in helping prevent cancer by destroying early cancer
      cells. When cancer does develop antigen-specific immune (T) cells are still present in the
      blood but are either not responding or are not effective. Vaccines stimulate these T cells to
      respond and kill cancer cells.

      ACIT-1 is designed to stimulate tumour antigen-specific T cells to respond and kill cancer
      cells.

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential and male patients whose partner is of child
             bearing potential must be willing to ensure that they or their partner use effective

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent use of immunosuppressive drugs, in particular systemic steroid therapy,
             above a threshold of 10mg per day prednisolone equivalent

          -  Evidence of active infection e.g. Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV or syphilis

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or biological therapy within 28 days of treatment with the
             exception of gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer patients

             treatment

          -  Other vaccination within previous 4 weeks

          -  Antibody treatment within previous 3 months

          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participant at risk because of participation in the study, or may

             study.
