    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to evaluate whether standard administration of Dexamethasone at the time
      of general anesthesia induction at the time of minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy (MISC) would
      result in improved quality of recovery (QoR).

    <textblock>
      There has been a public outcry regarding the continuing rise of health care expenditures. In
      1997, the estimated costs of surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) were $ 100.1 million. It
      is important to identify interventions that would improve the QoR in this patient population
      and to speed-up postoperative recovery. As most of these surgeries are performed in an
      outpatient manner as a 23 hour observation, improved recovery may also speed discharge and
      free-up valuable hospital resources.

      Patients will receive either Dexamethasone or placebo ( normal saline) at the time of
      induction of general anesthesia. QoR questionnaires, Pain scale and postoperative nausea and
      vomiting scale (PONV).

    <description>Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid that has been widely used for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. The mechanism of action is not completely understood. It has been proposed that a single dose may hinder the production and release of anti-inflammatory mediators. Dexamethasone also has a central antiemetic effect by inhibition of prostaglandin and/or release of endogenous opioids. A recent metanalysis concluded that Dexamethasone administration at induction is safe.
We will be using a 8mg dose of Dexamethasone, that is equivalent to 2ml of injectable drug.</description>
