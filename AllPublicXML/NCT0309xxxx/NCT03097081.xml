      Rationale: There is no evidence in the current literature regarding the additional value of
      an orthosis after surgically treated thoracolumbar spine fractures.

      Objective: To assess whether an orthosis provides additional pain relief compared to no
      orthosis after posteriorly fixated thoracolumbar spine fractures. Primary outcome is
      difference in pain at six weeks post-operatively. Secondary objectives are pain at other
      moments, pain medication used, pain related disability, quality of life, long-term kyphosis,
      possible complications, hospital stay, return to work and subjective feeling on benefit or
      disadvantage from the orthosis.

      Study design: Randomized controlled intervention study, non-inferiority trial.

      Study population: Dutch speaking patients presented at the VU university medical centre, 18 -
      65 years old with a traumatic thoracolumbar spine fracture from Th7 - L4 surgically treated
      by posterior fixation.

      Intervention: One group receives standard care and wears an orthosis after surgery for 12
      weeks, to use when in vertical position. The intervention group does not wear an orthosis
      after surgery.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main study outcome is the difference in pain noted on the
      NRS-score at six weeks, ≥ 2 (SD 2,5) change corresponds with a clinically significant change
      in pain score.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The current guideline for postoperative care regarding dorsal stabilization of
      spine fractures recommends the use of a post-operative orthosis. While patients generally
      receive an orthosis for 12 weeks, individual surgeon's believes sometimes gives reason to
      deviate from this guideline. This is founded by literature that increasingly questions the
      use of orthoses in the conservative treatment of spine fractures. With the fracture
      operatively stabilized, the orthosis mainly provides support of gesture and thereby
      potentially results in pain relief and confidence for patients. On the other hand some
      patients have a hard time weaning from the orthosis or report discomfort due to the device
      and prefer not to use it. With subjects being randomized between the use of an orthosis or no
      orthosis there is no additional risk. This is in part because it is hypothesized that there
      is no difference in postoperative pain and there might be a lower risk of complications
      related to the orthosis.
