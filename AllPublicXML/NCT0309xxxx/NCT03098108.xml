  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct this study to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effect of salvage
      concurrent chemo-proton therapy (CCPT) with or without surgical resection in previously
      irradiated recurrent rectal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The obtaining of local control in previously irradiated recurrent rectal cancer is crucial
      for survival prolongation as well as quality of life of patients. But, it is not easy to get
      with surgery and/or conventional radiotherapy (RT) because of the limitation of RT dose.
      Proton therapy has unique advantage showing superior dose distribution focusing tumor
      escaping surrounding normal tissues using &quot;Bragg-peak&quot;.
