    <textblock>
      A phase I open-label exploratory study in healthy male volunteers using
      positionemissiontomography (PET). The study will test the hypothesis that Tiotropium and
      AZD2115 binds to the mAchRs in a saturable manner and aims to examine the relationship
      between receptor occupancy and drug exposure.

             (defined as barrier methods in conjunction with spermicides) for the duration of the
             study (from the first dose) and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug to
             prevent pregnancy in a partner

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50.0 kg
             and no more than 100.0 kg, inclusive

          -  Able and willing to participate in all scheduled evaluations and abide by all study
             restrictions

          -  Ability to inhale from the study drug training devices at visit 1

          -  Subjects who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 3
             months following their last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the study results or the subject's ability to participate in the
             study.

          -  Any clinical significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks
             of the first administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP)

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, haematology, or
             urinalysis results, as judged by the investigator.

             or class as AZD2115.

          -  Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medication, during the 4 weeks (or longer
