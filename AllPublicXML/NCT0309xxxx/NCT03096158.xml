  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to coronary artery disease (CAD) is
      one of the main surgical procedures performed in the area of cardiology. Individuals
      undergoing CABG present sarcopenia, decreased muscle strength of the lower limbs, decreased
      respiratory muscle strength and dyspnea due to immobility in the bed and the inherent
      conditions of the disease itself. Cardiorespiratory rehabilitation techniques are rarely used
      with measurement in hospitals and can greatly favor an early and effective reestablishment to
      this population in several parameters. Objective: To evaluate the effect of functional
      electrical stimulation (FES), ventilatory muscle training (TREMVEN), early aerobic training
      (AERO) and isometric handgrip training (ISO) on the functional capacity, endothelial function
      and cardiac parameters of individuals undergoing CABG. Methods: In a randomized clinical
      trial, volunteers will be allocated into four groups: EEF, TREMVEN, AERO or ISO in the
      preoperative period of CABG. After 48 hours (postoperative midway) of the surgery, the
      protocol will begin until after hospital discharge. The endpoints evaluated will be:
      functional capacity, respiratory muscle strength, systolic and diastolic function, arterial
      endothelial function, inflammatory profile and plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF). Scientific contributions: Phase 1 cardiorespiratory rehabilitation with
      alternative interventions may provide an increase in functional capacity, strengthening of
      respiratory muscles, improvement in cardiac and endothelial functions, as well as increased
      systemic VEGF levels (myocardial revascularization) and improvement of the inflammatory
      profile, effectively forwarding the individuals to the rehabilitation phase 2.

    <measure>Cardiac Function - Echocardiography</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post (7 days) coronary artery bypass surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A high resolution ultrasound device equipped with a 2-5 megahertz (MHz) transducer will be used to obtain two-dimensional echocardiographic parameters: left ventricular end-diastolic volume, left ventricular end-systolic volume, left ventricular ejection fraction (cardiac function). The images will be stored on the hard disk of the echocardiographic device and analyzed offline in specific software of the equipment itself.</description>

    <measure>Endothelial Function- Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post (7 days) coronary artery bypass surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To examine brachial artery FMD, the arm will be extended and positioned at an angle of ~80° from the torso. A rapid inflation and deflation pneumatic cuff will be positioned on the forearm to provide an ischemia. A 10-MHz multi-frequency linear array probes, attached to a high resolution ultrasound machine, will be then used to image the brachial artery in the distal 1⁄3rd of the upper arm. Following baseline assessments, the forearm cuff will be inflated ( &gt; 200 mmHg) for 5 minutes. Diameter and flow recordings resumed 30s prior to cuff deflation and continued for 3 minutes.</description>
