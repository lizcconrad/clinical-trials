      Airway pressure-time (P-t) curve and stress index (SI) assessment have been proposed to guide
      the mechanical ventilation settings and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stress index (SI), which has been proposed to guide the mechanical ventilation settings
      and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. It reflects the change of respiratory compliance
      during inspiration. Value of SI equals to 1 that indicates a constant compliance, whereas
      values lower and higher than 1 indicate increase and decrease of compliance over inspiratory
      time, suggesting tidal recruitment and tidal hyperinflation, respectively. Based on the
      different values of SI showing different shapes, SI of straight curve equals to 1, SI of
      concave curve lower than 1 and convex curve higher than 1, the investigators speculated that
      the SI value could be reliably and accurately estimated by visual inspection of the P-t
      curve.
