      Purpose of the trial: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intervention with SMS
      messages delivered by mobiles phones to improve adherence to cardiovascular medications in
      patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

      Trial design: Two-parallel arm, single-blind, individually randomized controlled trial.

      Primary endpoint: Differences in changes (baseline minus 12 months) of: Low density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), Systolic Blood pressure and Heart Rate.

      Secondary endpoints: Differences in the changes (baseline minus 12-months) of: (i) adherence
      to cardiovascular medications used in secondary prevention measured by MARS-5 questionnaire;
      and (ii) Urinary levels of 11 dh-TxB2, Rates of composite end-point of cardiovascular death
      and hospitalization due to cardiovascular disease up to 12 months, Rates of composite of
      non-cardiovascular death or hospitalizations due to non-cardiovascular disease up to 12
      months and Adverse events: traffic accidents and injuries while reading SMS related to the
      trial.

      Duration of follow-up: 12 months

      Trial treatment:

      Intervention: The active treatment will consist of SMS that are aimed to modified behavioral
      factors associated with poor adherence to cardiovascular medications used in secondary
      prevention. The SMS will be delivered daily during the first month, increasing one day of
      interval for each week during the second month, and weekly thereafter until end of month
      12th. In addition, they will receive SMS thanking for their participation in the trial,
      reminders of trial appointment and informing if they have changed contact details. The
      frequency of this SMS will be monthly.

      Control: participants will only receive the SMS thanking for their participation in the
      trial, reminders of trial appointment and informing if they have changed contact details. The
      frequency of this SMS will be monthly.

      Expected sample size, enrollment and expected number of centers:

      Sample size = 1600 Recruitment start date: March , 2017 Recruitment end date: September, 2017
      Follow-up end date: March, 2018 Number of centers: 1

      Statistical considerations:

        -  Intention to treat analysis

        -  The trial has &gt;90% power (2 sided alpha= 0.05) to detect a reduction in LDL-C as low as
           5.1 mg/dl, under the assumption that SMS will increase adherence to statins by 7%.

        -  The primary outcomes will be analyzed using ANCOVA.

    <masking_description>TX2THeart-Colombia is a single-blind trial. The laboratory personnel in charge of measurement LDL-C and 11 dhTxB2 levels will not have access to treatment allocation and they will only have access to internal numerical ID variable. The laboratory results will be conducted once trial follow-up is completed, and results will be sent directly to the database manager, who will link the results to the existing database. The staff in charge of measurement blood-pressure and heart rate will not have access to information on treatment allocation. Measurement of blood pressure and heart rate will be the first activity to be conducted with participants in visits 1 and 3 to minimize any potential subconscious bias introduced as a consequence of patients inadvertently revealing to trial staff the treatment allocation. The only person who will have access to the information of the participants is the engineer in charge of the management of Dimagi-Commcare Plataform.</masking_description>
