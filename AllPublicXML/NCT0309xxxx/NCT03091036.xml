      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of proactive and integrated healthcare
      program for chronic complex patients (CCP). This program are based in coordination the

      Quasi-experimental study with single-arm (pre-post study design without control group). The
      investigators checking pre and post intervention the effectiveness of a healthcare program
      for CCP. The interventions consist:

        1. - Help the nurse in the hospital to carry out the care plans and the continuity care
           report.

           reference hospital.

        5. - Make proactive calls to the CCP and/or their caregiver after discharge

        6. - Plan the hospital discharge 48 hours in advance, so that the family and the patient
           can be organized.

      The investigator analysed if with this program, the CCP reducing hospital readmission and
      reducing the Hospital expenditure.
