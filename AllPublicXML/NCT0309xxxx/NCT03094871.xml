  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comorbid depression and multiple medical conditions in older adults are a serious public
      health problem. As an important facilitator of health-related activities, families are
      already involved in various aspects of self-management of chronic disease in older adults.
      Despite the benefits they provide, informal caregiving activities currently are organized
      outside the medical system, which potentially creates redundant or misaligned efforts.The
      purpose of the mentored research is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the
      FACE-PC, a theory-driven, multi- component, technology-assisted interdisciplinary team-based
      care model that systematically involves family in chronic disease management. It aims to
      optimize the patient and family's collective ability to self-manage chronic disease.

    <description>FACE-PC comprises 3 weekly and 2 bi-weekly sessions (total 5 sessions), delivered by a bachelors' prepared nurse care manager (CM) over 8 weeks. Over the five sessions, the nurse care manager will (1) review the patient medical history and set health goals for depression and chronic condition with the dyad, (2) review all medication, the level of adherence, challenges and facilitating factors of adherence, (3) deliver brief behavioral activation therapy.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive a typical primary care enhanced with reporting of their depression status and their goal for medical condition to their PCP for 8 weeks. Upon enrolment, a research nurse will review the patient medical history and identify goals for depression and a chronic condition with the dyad.</description>
