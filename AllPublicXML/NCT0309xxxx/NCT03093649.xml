    <textblock>
      Although patient-reported adverse events have been promoted as an essential element in
      clinical trials and daily managements, their efficacy remained unknown. The purpose of this
      trial was to determine the effect of the patient-reported adverse events during the treatment
      on the improvements on quality of life.
