      The investigators will test whether an intervention called ischemic conditioning can improve
      paretic leg motor function in chronic stroke subjects.

      This study will study ischemic conditioning (IC) as an intervention to improve motor function
      post-stroke. IC is a well studied, well tolerated intervention which has been shown to
      improve regional blood flow, motor neuron excitability and muscle function in multiple
      patient groups and in young, healthy subjects. Because IC targets three physiological systems
      which are all affected by stroke, the investigators hypothesize that repeated bouts of IC
      will result in improved motor function of the paretic leg.

    <description>The investigators will perform ischemic conditioning on the paretic leg by inflating a blood pressure cuff to 225 mmHg to occlude blood flow to the leg for 5 minutes. This will be repeated for 5 cycles, with 5 minutes of rest between each cycle. The intervention will be performed for a maximum of 12 times within a 4 week period.</description>

    <description>The investigators will perform sham ischemic conditioning on the paretic leg by inflating a blood pressure cuff to only 25 mmHg on the leg for 5 minutes. This will be repeated for 5 cycles, with 5 minutes of rest between each cycle. The intervention will be performed for a maximum of 12 times within a 4 week period.</description>
