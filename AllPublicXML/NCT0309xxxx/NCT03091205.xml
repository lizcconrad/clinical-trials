  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It's hypothesized that a mean and range distance from the cavo-atrial junction to the area
      where there is complete loss of conductive tissue can be measured to better inform surgeons
      performing the Cox-Maze procedure. A patient scheduled for any cardiac surgery where
      visualization and mapping of cavo-atrial junction is possible could be entered into the study
      if they meet the inclusion/exclusion requirements.
