  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors
      with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMD). Patients may have received any number of prior
      therapies for their respective solid tumors, but must not have received prior anti-PD-1
      therapy and developed progressive disease. Approximately 18 subjects in this study will
      receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses.
      In patients who derive clinical benefit from therapy, pembrolizumab may be continued until
      documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that
      prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the
      subject, subject withdrawal of consent, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure
      requirements, or for administrative reasons.

          1. Willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.

          2. 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy.

          4. Cytologically confirmed LMD or radiologically detectable LMD defined as either/or:

             A measurable lesion on contrast-enhanced MRI of either the Brain or Total Spine
             greater than 3mm that has not been radiated within the last 3 months prior to
             commencement of study therapy.

             Positive CSF cytology

          5. Patients may be newly diagnosed or have received any number of lines of prior anti
             cancer therapy. However, patients are required to have received available therapies
             for their primary disease, as deemed appropriate by the treating investigator.

          6. Non escalating steroid requirement at the time of consent and study drug initiation
             for the treatment of CNS symptoms.

          7. Local radiation therapy (RT) is allowed as needed to manage symptoms appropriately, as
             long as there remains a measurable lesion in the CNS.

          8. Whole brain RT may be used, without a pre-defined washout period, prior to
             commencement of study therapy if the lesion that has been radiated is not the sole
             measurable lesion, or the patient is eligible based on positive CSF cytology.

          9. Patients may continue therapy with a targeted agent if CNS disease developed while
             receiving the agent, and for defined regimens that have been deemed safe when combined
             with anti PD 1 therapy.

         10. Be willing to provide tissue from an archival tissue specimen in selected patients,
             where available.

         11. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

         12. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 3, all screening labs should
             be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.

             Table 3.

         13. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         14. Female subjects of childbearing potential (Section 4.8.2) must be willing to use an
             adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 4.8.2 Contraception, for the
             course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.

             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
             contraception for the subject.

         15. Male subjects of childbearing potential (Section 4.8.2) must agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception as outlined in Section 4.8.2 Contraception, starting with the
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception
        for the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks or 5 half lives of the first dose of treatment, whichever is
             shorter.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          3. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          4. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy other than pre specified
             allowed agents detailed in section 4.2.6, or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or

             qualify for the study.

             Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.
