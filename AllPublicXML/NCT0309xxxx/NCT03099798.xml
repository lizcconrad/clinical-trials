      OBJECTIVE:

      To determine the quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcome after conservative therapy,
      embolization (proximal versus distal) or surgery in patients with traumatic splenic injury.
      Secondary aims: (I) to examine therapy-related complications, (II) to establish the necessity
      of additional therapies, (III) the assessment of splenic function related to splenic
      morphology (MR imaging) after embolization and (IV) to find the prognostic factors for
      failure of non-operative management (NOM) in patients with splenic injuries. Finally, with
      the acquired data from this study a patient-oriented protocol will be provided for the
      management of traumatic splenic injury.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      The investigators expect that NOM is superior to surgery with regard to QOL, clinical outcome
      and splenic function. Embolization will need more additional therapies. Splenic morphology is
      related to splenic immune function. Expected prognostic factors are age above 40, ISS &gt;25 and
      a splenic injury grade of 3 or higher.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      A combination of a retrospective and a prospective multicentre cohort study. This protocol
      involves the prospective part of the study.

      STUDY POPULATION/DATASET:

      Patients who enter the participating hospitals between March 2017 and July 2018 with splenic
      injury will be asked to participate. The follow-up period will be one year with regard to
      QOL, clinical symptoms and imaging.

      INTERVENTION:

      All patients will complete a number of questionnaires at different time points. The patients
      who were treated with splenic artery embolization (SAE) will undergo an MRI one month and one
      year after treatment.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Primary outcome is QOL. Secondary outcomes are clinical symptoms and imaging.

      SAMPLE SIZE:

      Approximately 100 patients will be included per year during the inclusion phase.

      DATA ANALYSIS:

      With regard to the prospective data linear modelling will be performed.

      COLLABORATION/CONNECTION:

      Tilburg University, Erasmus medical center Rotterdam, Maasstad hospital Rotterdam, Albert
      Schweitzer hospital Dordrecht, Amphia hospital Breda.

      TIME SCHEDULE:

      Year 1: literature search and conducting the retrospective study and analyses. Years 1-3:
      inclusion prospective study and follow-up of patients. Year 4: finishing follow-up data
      collection and analysing.

        All patients with splenic injury after blunt abdominal trauma confirmed by ultrasound
        (US/FAST) and/or computed tomography (CT) at the primary trauma screening at the 5 selected
        hospitals between March 2017 and July 2018 will be asked to participate in this study as
        soon as they can talk and are lucid. Patients receive a verbal and written explanation
        about the study. The time for consideration is one week. When a patient is willing to
        participate he/she will be asked to sign a consent form. When patients agree to
        participate, they are included for follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Splenic injury after blunt abdominal trauma (confirmed by FAST and/or CT)

          -  The patient underwent NOM/SAE/splenectomy for the management of traumatic splenic
             injury

          -  The treatment took place in the period from March 2017 to July 2018 at one of the five
             selected hospitals

          -  18 years or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language

          -  Patients who died during or after treatment are (of course) excluded for
             questionnaires and MRI, not for clinical outcomes

        Exclusion for MRI only:

        - Patients treated with SAE: patients who do not want to or are not able to undergo an MRI
        abdomen (for example pregnant women or other contraindications for MRI). Patients excluded
        for MRI still need to fill out the questionnaires. Also, their clinical outcomes will be
        processed in the database.
