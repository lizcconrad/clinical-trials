  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with pancreatic
      cancer. Patients with BRPC have tumors in close contact with the vasculature but not to the
      extent that resection is prohibited. Nonetheless, retrospective studies have shown that
      immediate resection in these patients is associated with an increased risk of positive
      margins, and a margin positive resection does not improve survival over that of patients with
      unresectable disease. Moreover, even in those patients where a successful resection is
      achieved, there is a high rate of early metastatic progression suggesting that
      micrometastatic disease is often present at diagnosis. Therefore neoadjuvant therapy is
      likely to improve outcomes in patients with BRPC to increase the likelihood of achieving a
      margin negative resection, provide early control of occult micrometastatic disease, and
      select those patients without systemic progression who would benefit from surgical resection.

      Given the superior outcomes with FOLFIRINOX and the potential for improved local response
      with SBRT, the investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of pre-operative modified
      FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
      The investigators hypothesize that pre-operative modified FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT will
      improve the rate of R0 resections compared to historical controls treated with standard
      gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and fractionated radiation prior to surgery.
