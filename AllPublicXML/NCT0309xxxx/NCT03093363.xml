  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of a pharmacist's intervention on asthma control has now been well demonstrated,
      but its effect on inflammatory markers of FENO (Fractional exhaled nitric oxide) in asthmatic
      patients has been little studied in the literature. The aim of this study is to investigate
      the impact of a pharmacist's intervention on FENO in patients seen in clinical practice by a
      pneumologist in a secondary university center.
