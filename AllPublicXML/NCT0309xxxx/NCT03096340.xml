  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IT141 is a novel nanoparticle formulation of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, and
      is intended to deliver more drug to the tumor with reduced toxicity on normal tissues. The
      study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IT-141, and to investigate
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and possible pharmacodynamics (PD) relationships. Patients
      will also be monitored for any response to therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be 18 years of age or older.

             contraceptive requirements of the protocol.

          -  Must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed, incurable malignancy, for which
             further standard treatment is not currently available.

          -  Must have measurable or evaluable disease during the dose escalation phase (measurable
             disease is preferred for the expanded cohort after MTD is reached).

          -  Must have an anticipated survival of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Must be fully informed regarding their illness and the investigational nature of the
             study protocol, and must sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed
             Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Must be ambulatory, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
             score of 0 or 1.

          -  Must have adequate organ function, as defined by the following:

          -  Hematologic: ANC 1.5 x 109/L, Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dL and platelet count 100 x 109/L (platelet
             count &gt; 75 x 109/L if documented evidence of bone marrow involvement).

          -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin 1.5 x ULN; transaminases ≤ 2.5 x ULN (may be up to 5 x ULN if
             clearly due to liver metastases); prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin
             time (PTT) &lt; 2 x (ULN).

          -  Renal: Serum creatinine 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance 60 mL/min.

          -  Must be on stable doses of any drugs affecting hepatic drug metabolism or renal drug
             excretion (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, barbiturates,
             diphenylhydantoin, narcotic analgesics, probenecid). Such drugs should not be
             initiated less than 30 days prior to Baseline/C1D1 or at any time during study
             participation. Whenever possible, narcotic analgesic doses should be stable within 30
             days prior to study entry and during the first cycle of therapy.

          -  Must be recovered from any reversible side effects of prior therapy (e.g. no major

             therapy to hematopoietic sites within 4 weeks of Baseline/C1D1, and no nitrosoureas or

             condition that presents undue risk from the IP or procedures.

          -  Primary brain tumors or known brain metastasis unless clinically stable and on stable
             or reducing doses of steroids.

          -  Frequent vomiting.

             site of bone pain will be allowed.

          -  Current (within 1 week of Screening) or regular use of any medication (including
             over-the-counter (OTC), herbal or homeopathic preparations) that could improve or
             worsen the cancer being studied, or could affect the action or disposition of IT-141,
             or its clinical or laboratory assessment; e.g. Coumadin therapy, due to high

             or as part of a multivitamin regimen, are excluded from this study, whether prescribed
             or self-medicated.

          -  Concomitant use of a UGT1A1 inhibitor, such as idinavir, atazanavir and sorafenib,
             throughout the study period.

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to IT-141 or any of the stated
             ingredients.

          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year.

          -  History of use of another IP within the last 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, including females with a positive
             pregnancy test at screening.

          -  Previous enrollment in this study, followed by withdrawal for any reason.

          -  Known HIV-positive subjects on combination anti-retroviral therapy due to the
             potential for PK interactions with the study agent.

          -  Evidence of ischemia or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, or any
             significant abnormality on ECG.

          -  A QTc interval outside of normal. (Normal: &lt; 450 msec for males and &lt; 460 msec for
             females)
