  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolomics consists in the study of metabolites in body fluids or tissues. It investigates
      the consequences of the activity of genes and proteins. One of its advantages is that it is
      able to do a simultaneous measurement of metabolic changes in living organisms as a response
      to a disturbance (disease, diet, environment, others) and because a metabolic profile is
      summative of all the biochemical processes occurring in the body at a given time, it makes no
      presumption about the relative importance of these processes. Ultimately it is a fingerprint
      of the organism's health status, at a given time.

      Metabolomic analysis of serum, plasma and urine has revealed panels of metabolites that
      distinguish patients with cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, Parkinson disease,
      Alzheimer's disease and diabetes from control patients. Regarding ocular diseases only few
      studies have been published, related to diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, age-related
      macular degeneration, uveitis and glaucoma.

      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world, according to the World
      Health Organization, and there are still no biomarkers that can provide an early diagnosis.
      Nowadays, glaucoma classification relies substantially in the measurement of intraocular
      pressure (IOP), which can be rather artificial and also unreliable since IOP values can
      fluctuate during the day. Moreover, patients with normal IOP values can also develop
      glaucomatous neuropathy (normal-tension glaucoma, NTG) and progress even when IOP is
      decreased. Several studies have shown that NTG patients suffer from a systemic vascular
      dysregulation, with higher rates of systemic hypotension, Raynaud phenomenon and migraine.
      Hence, other mechanisms than an increased IOP are of importance in the development and
      progression of glaucoma.

      Only one metabolome-wide study has been made in glaucoma (Burgess, I.; 2015). In a sample of
      72 american patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the authors found significant
      differences in comparison to controls.

      The hypothesis for this study is that glaucoma patients will differ from controls, and POAG
      patients will differ from NTG patients. The investigators will look into metabolomics as a
      way to create a method to diagnose and stratify patients, as an add-on or alternative to the
      currently available diagnostic tools like IOP, functional and structural measurement.

      This is a cross sectional study built to compare samples from glaucoma patients undergoing
      surgery (open-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma, age and gender matched) with age
      and gender-matched controls (healthy patients undergoing cataract surgery). For this the
      investigators will collect plasma, urine and aqueous humor to be analyzed through mass
      spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Patients have a night fasting
      period prior to sample collection, and a lifestyle and food frequency questionnaire is filled
      to control for nutritional influence on metabolites. Diabetic patients are excluded, since it
      would confound our analysis.

    <description>Success is defined as an IOP between 6 and 18 mmHg with a reduction of 30% from baseline, and was sub-categorized as complete success if accomplished without glaucoma medication, qualified success with glaucoma medication, and total success as a combination of both complete and qualified. Eyes needing further glaucoma surgery, IOP ≤5 or &gt; 18 mmHg on two consecutive visits, or loss of light perception due to glaucoma were considered as failures. Needling of encysted blebs is not considered a failure.</description>
