  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this trial is to
      assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of NNC9204-1706 administered
      subcutaneously in male subjects being overweight or with obesity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects aged 18-55 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed
             consent

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 34.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive) at screening.
             Overweight should be due to excess of adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any disorder which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety,
             evaluation of results, or compliance with the protocol

          -  Subjects, aged at least 40 years, with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic
             cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (as described in the American College of Cardiology and
             the American Heart Association Prevention Guideline) risk equal to or above 5%

          -  Male subjects who are not sexually abstinent or surgically sterilised (vasectomy) and
             are sexually active with female partner(s) and who are not using a highly effective
             method of contraception (such as condom with spermicide) combined with a highly
             effective method of contraception for their non-pregnant female partner(s) (Pearl
             Index below 1%, such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intrauterine
             devices, diaphragm or cervical cap+spermicide), and/or intend to donate sperm in the
             period from screening until 3 months following administration of the investigational
             medical product
