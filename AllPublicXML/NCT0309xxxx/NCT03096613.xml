  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on accumulating evidence showing that hypothyroid status is associated with poor
      prognosis among heart failure (HF) patients, the study is designed to evaluate whether
      replacement treatment with levothyroxine could have beneficial effects on patients with HF
      and subclinical hypothyroidism. The study is a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial
      to assess the efficacy and safety of levothyroxine replacement on evidence-based HF standard
      therapy in stable chronic heart failure patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.

      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether the 24-week L-T4 replacement
      therapy, as an adjunct to standard treatment, would improve exercise capability in chronic
      systolic heart failure patients with subclinical hypothyroidism compared to the standard
      treatment.
