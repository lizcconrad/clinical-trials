  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is caused by blockages in the leg arteries. PAD limits
      patients' walking ability and quality of life. For patients with PAD, home exercise programs
      can improve walking ability and quality of life. In many patient populations, walking more
      than 5,000 steps a day is associated with better health. Currently, the benefit of walking
      more than 5,000 steps a day in patients with PAD has not been well studied.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare two different home exercise programs in
      patients with PAD: walking at least 5,000 steps a day with the help of fitness monitors vs.
      walking 45 consecutive minutes for 3 to 5 days a week (a common exercise prescription for
      PAD). This study has the potential to demonstrate that, with the help of fitness monitors,
      walking at least 5,000 steps a day can improve walking ability and quality of life for
      patients with PAD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity,
      following coronary artery disease and stroke. Symptoms of PAD include claudication, decreased
      exercise capacity, progressive functional impairment, and decreased quality of life.
      Structured exercise therapy is a cornerstone of treating symptomatic PAD. Guidelines
      recommend a symptom-based exercise program that uses claudication to moderate walking
      sessions.

      Home exercise programs have demonstrated efficacy in improving walking ability and quality of
      life for symptomatic PAD patients. In the general population and patients with certain
      chronic diseases, walking more than 5,000 steps a day has been associated with better health.
      The efficacy of walking more than 5,000 steps a day has not been well studied in symptomatic
      PAD patients.

      The EASY FIT Trial is a single-center prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the
      effectiveness of a daily step-based exercise program (walking at least 5,000 steps a day) vs.
      a guideline-recommended symptom-based exercise program (walking 45 consecutive minutes for 3
      to 5 days a week), on improving walking ability and quality of life in patients with
      symptomatic PAD. The study will enroll and randomize 40 patients with symptomatic PAD (20 to
      each exercise program).The results of this study have the potential to create an effective,
      safe, feasible, and sustainable exercise program that can help PAD patients have greater
      walking ability and better quality of life.

    <description>At baseline, both groups will be instructed to wear their fitness monitors for 7 consecutive days. After 3 months of the exercise program, both groups will be instructed to wear their fitness monitors for 7 consecutive days. During each 7-day period, all patients will be instructed to walk continuously for at least one extended period of time on a daily basis. Given that this is a pilot study, the duration and frequency of these extended periods of time will be at the patients' discretion. The change in the mean daily walking distance at 3 months will be the primary outcome.</description>

    <description>At baseline, both groups will be asked to complete the Peripheral Artery Questionnaire (PAQ), which is a quality-of-life survey with a summary score ranging from 0 to 100 (with 100 indicating the highest quality of life). After 3 months of the exercise program, both groups will be asked to complete the PAQ again. The change in the summary score at 3 months will the secondary outcome.</description>

    <description>At baseline, both groups will be asked to complete the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire (VascuQol), which is a quality-of-life survey with a summary score ranging from 25 to 175 (with 175 indicating the highest quality of life). After 3 months of the exercise program, both groups will be asked to complete the VascuQol survey again. The change in the summary score at 3 months will the secondary outcome.</description>
