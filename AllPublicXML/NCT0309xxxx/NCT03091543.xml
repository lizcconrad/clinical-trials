  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of four single oral doses of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and
      200 mg) on levodopa pharmacokinetics when administered in combination with a single-dose of
      controlled release levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg and to assess the tolerability and safety
      of four single oral doses of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) when administered in
      combination with a single-dose of controlled release levodopa/benserazide 100/25 mg.

    <textblock>
      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study with five
      single-dose treatment periods, with a washout period between doses of 5 days or more. In each
      of the five consecutive treatment periods, eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH in the
      day prior to receiving the study medication. On the morning of the dosing day, subjects
      received BIA 6-512/Placebo concomitantly with Madopar® HBS 125 in fasting conditions (at
      least 8 hours) and remained in the UFH until at least 24 h post-dose; then, they were
      discharged and returned for the next period or the follow-up visit. Blood samples for the
      assay of plasma BIA 6-512, levodopa and 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) were taken at the following
      times: pre-dose, ¼, ½, 1, 1½, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-dose.
