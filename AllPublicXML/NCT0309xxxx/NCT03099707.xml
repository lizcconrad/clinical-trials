  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Treatment Ambassador
      program - a peer-supported intervention targeting individuals living with HIV who have not
      started on treatment within at least 3 months of testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global HIV treatment initiatives have focused on increasing access to antiretroviral therapy
      (ART), with the goal of creating an &quot;AIDS-free generation.&quot; There is growing evidence,
      however, that treatment availability alone is insufficient to stop the spread of the disease.
      Countries where HIV is hyperendemic, such as South Africa, will not achieve population-level
      reductions in HIV until incident infections have been dramatically reduced over a lifetime,
      and people living with HIV (PLWH) no longer wait to start treatment until they have symptoms
      of advanced AIDS. As South Africa expands ART eligibility to all people living with HIV, it
      remains unclear if promoting earlier ART initiation will lead to widespread uptake. These
      operational realities raise two fundamental questions: how will we close the gap from the 3.4
      million PLWH currently on ART to treating the over seven million people who need care; and
      what does this portend for the future of Treatment as Prevention in South Africa? The
      investigators' prior research suggests that optimizing ART initiation for PLWH in South
      Africa will require an intervention to reduce individual barriers to starting ART, promote
      social support, and enhance linkages to the healthcare system. In the proposed study, the
      investigators will build upon our prior research to pilot test a socio-behavioral
      multi-component peer intervention, to ensure that South Africans living with HIV initiate and
      sustain treatment. Investigators will test this intervention through a pilot
      randomized-controlled trial. This multi-component intervention is designed to address
      barriers to ART initiation identified in prior qualitative research, framed through the
      Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI). TTI focuses upon three &quot;streams of influence&quot; that impact
      health behavior at the individual-, social-, and structural-levels. The intervention will be
      delivered by &quot;Treatment Ambassadors,&quot; who are PLWH who will function in multiple capacities,
      and have received intensive training in motivational interviewing (MI), peer-support, and
      peer navigation. They will then provide the intervention in eight sessions over 8-14 weeks.
      The intervention will be individually tailored to address the three streams of influence on
      patient decision-making as follows: MI will address individual perceived risk and ambivalence
      in decision-making; peer-support will target interpersonal social factors; and patient
      navigation will promote ART initiation and counter structural barriers.

      Investigators will enroll 90 participants (45 in each arm) with the goal of assessing
      feasibility and acceptability. Investigators enrolled 86 participants in total. The 90
      participant mark was not met due to time constraints and our eligibility requirements. In
      addition, preliminary efficacy will be assessed through the following measures:

      Primary Outcome Measure: Timely ART initiation (initiation within 3 months of enrollment)
      (assessed through the National Health Laboratory Service, pharmacy records, and medical chart
      abstraction).

      Secondary Outcomes Measures: 1) HIV-1 RNA Suppression within the first 6 months of study
      enrollment (assessed through the National Health Laboratory Service).

      2) Behavioral Factors associated with failure to initiate ART in a timely manner.

    <description>Treatment Initiation will be measured at 3 months through clinic records, pharmacy data, and the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), a national database in South Africa. Primary data analysis will be an intent-to-treat analysis, which includes all randomized participants. Of note, every attempt will be made to continue assessing participants even if they drop out of treatment. In addition, investigators will replicate all analyses with the completers only. The hypothesis that the intervention will yield higher rates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation by the completion of the intervention will be tested using Fisher's exact test; the treatment effect estimate will be summarized in terms of a relative risk and 95% confidence interval. Any baseline demographic or clinical variables identified as necessary covariates in preliminary analyses will be included in a logistic regression analysis that examines the main effect of treatment condition on the rates of ART initiation.</description>

For participants randomized to the intervention arm, they will immediately meet with a Treatment Ambassador to begin the 8 session intervention, which has components of motivational interviewing, peer-support, and peer navigation.

    <description>This multi-component intervention, titled the &quot;Treatment Ambassador Program,&quot; will target people living with HIV who have not initiated ART within 3 months of testing positive. Our intervention will last for 8 sessions over 8-14 weeks, and will aim to address the three steams of influences on decision-making through a system of patient navigation and support with an assigned partner living with HIV who is trained in motivational interviewing. It will be aimed at addressing barriers to ART initiation identified through our prior qualitative research, as framed through the Theory of Triadic Influence, by addressing the three streams of influences on decision-making through a system of patient navigation and support.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults living with HIV who are 18 years and older, who have not initiated ART within 3
             months of learning their status

          2. ART naïve,

          3. Live within 60 km the testing center (due to prohibitive costs of following
             participants to remote locations);

          4. English or Xhosa speaking; and

          5. Eligible for treatment under current South Africa guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to provide informed consent (e.g., due to intoxication or mental incapacity,

          2. Persons less than 18 years of age,

          3. Women who report current pregnancy at the time of consent. We are choosing to not
             include pregnant women in this study, because the study's recruitment site refers
             pregnant clients to more specialized care facilities that may better suit their needs.
