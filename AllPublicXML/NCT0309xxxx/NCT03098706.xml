  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, only one third of patients registered on the waiting list receive a kidney
      transplant. Numerous paths are being explored with the aim of reversing this shortage. The
      first is to increase the number of organs by developing harvesting from donors in a state of
      brain-death (BD) termed &quot;expanded criteria donors&quot; or from patients deceased from circulatory
      arrest.

      Another fundamental factor is to insure the success of the transplant by limiting the
      dysfunction of donor kidneys, marked by a delayed graft function (DFG).

      The development of techniques to insure correct perfusion of harvested organs, and the
      optimization of reanimation and intensive care of brain-dead donors constitute important
      factors in DGF reduction.

      Therapeutic Hypothermia could to be an attractive care strategy for BD patients.
