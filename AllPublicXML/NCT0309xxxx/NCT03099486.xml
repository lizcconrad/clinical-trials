        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. mCRC with prior progression on standard multi-agent combination chemotherapy and
             regorafenib as a standard approved monotherapy. Progression on prior regorafenib is
             required for inclusion in this clinical study. Prior regimens may include FOLFOX -/+
             bevacizumab, FOLFIRI -/+ bevacizumab or -/+ cetuximab (if KRAS wild-type) or
             panitumumab (if KRAS wilt-type). Other prior regimens may include 5-FU or capecitabine
             -/+ bevacizumab, irinotecan -/+ cetuximab or panitumumab, FOLFIRI -/+ ziv-aflibercept

          2. Patients treated with oxaliplatin in an adjuvant setting should have progressed during
             or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant therapy. Patients who progress more than
             6 months after completion of oxaliplatin containing adjuvant treatment must be
             retreated. Patients who have withdrawn from standard treatment due to unacceptable

             molecular weight heparin Subjects who are prophylactically treated with an agent such
             as warfarin or heparin require close monitoring (day5 of cycle 1 and day 1 of each
             cycle) of their INR/PTT. If either of these values are above the therapeutic range,
