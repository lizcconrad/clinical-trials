  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cannabis administration is reported to alleviate HIV neuropathic pain (HIV-NP), but
      there is limited knowledge about the effects of cannabis constituents (delta-9
      tetrahydrocannabinol/THC and cannabidiol/CBD), the consequences of long-term cannabis use,
      and the impact of cannabis on endocannabinoid (EC) function in people living with HIV- NP.
      Our objective is to address these three fundamental gaps in our knowledge by: 1) examining
      the acute effects of various CBD/THC products on HIV-NP, 2) utilizing a mHealth text
      messaging protocol, Individual Monitoring of Pain and Cannabis Taken (IMPACT) to monitor
      daily real-world cannabis use and changes in pain; and 3) studying the relationship between
      cannabinoids, EC biomarkers, and chronic neuropathic pain

    <textblock>
      Our objective is to assess 120 community-dwelling people living with HIV who have neuropathic
      pain and are currently using cannabis. These participants will be enrolled in a study that
      consists of two phases:

      Phase 1) This will involve a cross over study involving three different doses of vaporized
      cannabis that contain THC and varying concentrations of CBD:

        -  Low CBD session: 8 puffs of 1.6% THC + 0.09 CBD

        -  Medium CBD sessions: 4 puffs of 1.6% THC + 0.09 CBD plus 4 puffs of 1.73% THC + 5.4% CBD

        -  High CBD sessions: 8 puffs of 1.73% THC + 5.4% CBD

      This phase will examine the acute effects of cannabis on pain intensity, blood
      endocannabinoid levels, and the relationship of pain with heart rate variability (HRV).

      Phase 2) This phase will involve the association between dispensary-obtained cannabis and
      changes in pain reported via IMPACT, a mHealth text messaging program that will serve as a
      useful tool to monitor the relationship between pain and cannabis use. Text messaging is an
      effective method to modify health behaviors, monitor substance use, and track pain. Our group
      has recently demonstrated the feasibility of using short message service (SMS) texting to
      promote anti-retroviral therapy adherence and monitor daily methamphetamine (METH) use in
      persons living with HIV neuropathy with bipolar disorder or METH dependence.
