  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this phase III study is to establish the efficacy and safety of P-3058
      (terbinafine 10% nail solution) topically administered once weekly in patients with
      onychomycosis in comparison to the Vehicle in a double-blind fashion. The overall treatment
      period will be of 48 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a screening phase, a treatment phase of 48 weeks and a 12-week
      follow-up. Patients affected by mild to-moderate distal lateral subungual onychomycosis
      (DLSO) on a target great toenail will be included in the study. Clinical as well as mycology
      assessments will be performed throughout the whole study. Safety will be monitored by
      recording any adverse event and evaluating local tolerability.
