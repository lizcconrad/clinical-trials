  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, cross‐over study 20 subjects who are undergoing testosterone (T) therapy
      for the treatment of T deficiency will receive both subcutaneous testosterone therapy and
      intramuscular testosterone therapy. One group will receive a SQ injection followed by an IM
      injection and one group will receive an IM injection followed by a SQ injection. The primary
      objective of this study is to measure testosterone concentration in men after these two
      treatment routes and determine if there are any significant differences due to modes of
      administration. Endpoints will include total serum testosterone and calculated free
      testosterone. A questionnaire will also be administered to assess overall patient experience
      with each route of administration.
