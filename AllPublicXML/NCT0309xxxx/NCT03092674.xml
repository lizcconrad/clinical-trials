  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well azacitidine with or without nivolumab or
      midostaurin, or decitabine and cytarabine alone work in treating older patients with newly
      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, decitabine, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with
      the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Midostaurin may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine with or
      without nivolumab or midostaurin, or decitabine and cytarabine alone may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To select, based on overall survival, any or all of the &quot;Novel Therapeutic&quot; regimens for
      further testing against azacitidine in patients age 60 and older with newly diagnosed acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome with excessive blasts-2 (MDS-EB-2). (Phase
      II) II. To compare overall survival of the &quot;Novel Therapeutic&quot; regimens selected in the phase
      II portion of the trial to azacitidine in these patient populations. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of the regimens in these patient
      populations.

      II. To estimate response rates, event-free survival, and relapse-free survival for these
      regimens in these patient populations.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate associations between cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities (including
      FLT3) and outcomes for each of the regimens in these patient populations.

      II. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) daily on days
      1-7 or days 1-5 and 8-9. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive azacitidine as in Arm A and nivolumab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1
      and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive azacitidine as in Arm A and midostaurin orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      on days 8-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive decitabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5 and cytarabine IV
      continuously on days 6-11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients deemed stable at the discretion of the treating physician receive
      decitabine as in Induction. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 2 years.

             patients; collection of pretreatment specimens must be completed within 42 days prior
             to randomization (registration Step 2); reports of the results must be submitted

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: FLT3 results will be used for stratification
             purposes at the time of randomization; E-mail notification that FLT3 specimens have
             been processed must be received prior to randomization (registration Step 2)

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: Prior treatment with hydroxyurea is permitted;
             prior all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for suspected APL and prior intrathecal therapy
             are permitted, but must plan to be discontinued prior to initiating protocol therapy;
             patients with signs/symptoms of hyperleukocytosis or white blood cells (WBC) &gt;=
             50,000/mcL can be treated with leukapheresis prior to randomization (registration to
             Step 2)

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: Patients may have received non-intensive therapy
             for antecedent hematologic disorders, including lenalidomide; patients may have
             received prior chemotherapy for prior cancers; these therapies must be discontinued at
             least 5 days prior to randomization (registration to Step 2)

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: Patients who are transfusion-dependent and patients
             receiving growth factor support are eligible; patients must discontinue growth factor
             support prior to initiation of protocol therapy

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: The following tests must be performed within 14
             days prior to randomization (registration to Step 2) to establish baseline values:

               -  Performance status

               -  Complete blood count (CBC)/differential/platelets

               -  Creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault)

               -  Total bilirubin

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)

               -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

               -  Albumin

               -  Glucose

               -  Fibrinogen

               -  Electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: Patients must have complete history and physical
             examination within 28 days prior to randomization (registration to Step 2); history
             must include autoimmune disease status (to determine whether patient is eligible for
             Arm B)

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: Patients must not have active infection (systemic
             bacterial, fungal, or viral infection) that is not controlled (defined as exhibiting
             ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement despite
             appropriate antibiotics or other treatment)

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: Patients must be eligible for at least one of the
             currently active investigational treatment arms (S1612B or S1612C); if the patient
             does not meet eligibility criteria for at least one active investigational arm, then
             the patient is not eligible for S1612

          -  REGISTRATION STEP 2-RANDOMIZATION: Patients must be informed of the investigational
             nature of this study and must sign and give written informed consent in accordance
             with institutional and federal guidelines

          -  ARM B (AZACITIDINE + NIVOLUMAB)

          -  Patients must not have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment
             in past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment

          -  Patients must have AST and ALT =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)

          -  Patients must have total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x IULN

          -  Patients must have baseline troponin test performed for eligibility; however, no
             associated values must be met in order for the patient to be eligible

          -  ARM C (AZACITIDINE + MIDOSTAURIN)

          -  Patients must have total bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 x IULN

          -  Patients must have creatinine clearance =&lt; 2.5 x IULN

          -  Patients must have corrected QT (QTc) interval &lt; 500/msec (by Bazett's formula) on
             baseline ECG

          -  Patients must not have any history of hypersensitivity to any drugs or metabolites of
             midostaurin

          -  All tests for establishing baseline values must be completed within 14 days prior to
             registration to Step 2 (randomization)
