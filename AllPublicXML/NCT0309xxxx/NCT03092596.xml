  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance abuse and dependence is highly prevalent among people living with HIV and
      significantly exacerbates morbidity and mortality and accelerates HIV disease progression.
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been the single most important treatment for slowing disease
      progression. ART adherence and HIV primary care are affected by a complex array of factors in
      the context of lives impacted by socioeconomic, psychological, and health challenges. Drugs
      and alcohol play a major role in non-adherence, engagement in care, and poor health outcomes
      among HIV-infected persons. While evidence is unequivocal that substance use treatment
      improves health outcomes, systems of care for the detection and treatment of substance abuse
      and dependence remain fragmented. Integrated approaches are key to the delivery of optimal
      care. Pragmatic or effectiveness trials can provide the best evidence about clinical practice
      to inform practitioners and policy makes about the most clinically and cost effective
      treatment to inform dissemination on a wider scale at the organizational and public health
      levels. The goal of this trial is to develop and test a comprehensive, integrated program to
      detect and reduce substance abuse and in turn, to improve ART adherence and HIV, substance
      use and associated health outcomes among HIV-infected patients. This trial will test the
      effectiveness of the intervention using a stepped wedge trial design to sequentially
      implement a screening tool and training of patient health navigators at HIV clinics in NYC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to develop an organizational-level intervention to enhance
      the adoption of screening for and treatment of substance use disorders among HIV-positive
      patients receiving care at the Institute for Advanced Medicine HIV primary care clinics. The
      primary research question is: What is the impact of a brief substance abuse screener and
      treatment referral process on substance use and HIV-related health outcomes among
      HIV-infected patients attending HIV care clinics?

      The study team will achieve four specific aims:

      Aim 1: Develop an intervention to integrate substance abuse treatment with HIV care in a
      consortium of HIV clinics in New York City. The principal investigator will conduct formative
      research and utilize the study team's findings about existing systems and approaches utilized
      at the Mount Sinai Health System to: 1) incorporate a brief screening tool to identify
      patients in need of further assessment or treatment for substance abuse; and 2) train patient
      health navigators (PHNs) in motivational interviewing (MI) to engage patients for substance
      abuse treatment.

      Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of the intervention using a stepped wedge trial design to
      sequentially implement a screening tool and training of PHNs at the IAM HIV clinics. The
      primary goal is to test the effectiveness of intervention components versus treatment as
      usual (TAU) in identifying HIV infected persons with a substance use disorder and in linking
      them to substance abuse treatment. Secondary goals include examining the intersection among
      problematic substance use, HIV medication adherence, and HIV-related and other comorbid
      conditions.

      Aim 3. Develop optimized technologies within the electronic health record (EHR) system used
      at the HIV clinics and integrate these with existing substance-use treatment mobile
      applications to retain patients in recovery and relapse prevention. This will specifically
      entail use of a MyChart mobile patient portal in an Office of the National Coordinator for
      Health Information Technology (ONC) certified EHRs (Epic, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona,
      WI). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and
      Clinical Health (HITECH) Act place strong emphasis on the widespread adoption and
      implementation of EHR systems.

      Aim 4: Assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing this organizational-level intervention.
      In order to enhance the likelihood of widespread implementation, the study team will conduct
      analyses to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing the intervention components versus
      TAU alone.
