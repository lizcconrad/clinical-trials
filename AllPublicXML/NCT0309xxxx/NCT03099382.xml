  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the
      esophagus that has progressed after first-line standard therapy will be randomized to receive
      either single agent SHR-1210 or the Investigator's choice of standard therapy with docetaxel
      or irinotecan. The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with SHR-1210 will prolong
      overall survival (OS) as compared to treatment with standard therapy.
