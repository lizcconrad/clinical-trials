      This is an open label, Phase 1/2 study of oral ARQ 092 administered to patients at least 2
      years of age with overgrowth diseases and/or vascular anomalies with genetic alterations of
      the PI3K/AKT pathway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase 1/2 study of ARQ 092 administered orally. The primary objective
      of this study is to assess the safety of ARQ 092 in subjects (at least 2 years of age) with
      overgrowth diseases and/or vascular anomalies with documented genetic alterations of the
      PI3K/AKT pathway.

      The first cohort will receive a dose of 15 mg/m2 of ARQ 092 administered by mouth QD in the
      morning without food (1 hour prior to or 2 hours after a meal) for 3 cycles. If no
      drug-related clinically significant toxicity is observed at 15 mg/m2, the cohort will receive
      25 mg/m2 QD for 3 more cycles. If no toxicity is observed at 25 mg/m2, and after agreement
      between the Sponsor and Investigator, the dose may be escalated to 35 mg/m2 for 3 more cycles
      (but no more than 45 mg total QD).

      For an individual subject, treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity or another
      discontinuation criterion is met. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator and in
      agreement with the Sponsor, are deriving benefit from the experimental therapy by the end of
      6 cycles (or 9 cycles for the 35 mg/m2 schedule) will be allowed to remain on therapy for the
      duration of the benefit for a maximum time of 12 months from the start of their beneficial
      dose. It is expected that most subjects will receive between 3 to 9 months of treatment.
