  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter study including breast cancer patients with chest wall disease
      that is hormone resistant (ER positive/PR positive/HER2 negative breast cancer with
      progressive disease on 2 prior lines of hormonal therapy) or triple negative (ER negative/PR
      negative/HER2 negative, TNBC). Eighty-four patients will be enrolled at Translational Breast
      Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) sites and will be randomized 2:1 to receive treatment with
      pembrolizumab and carboplatin (n=56, Arm A) or carboplatin alone (n=28, Arm B) until
      documented disease progression. Patients randomized to Arm B may cross-over following
      progression to pembrolizumab alone (Arm Bx). Patients may have received any number of prior
      lines of chemotherapy. Patients in Arm A will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV and
      carboplatin AUC 5 IV every 3 weeks for at least 6 cycles followed by maintenance
      pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks if stable or responding disease. Patients in Arm B will
      be treated with carboplatin AUC 5 IV every 3 weeks until progression, whereupon they may
      cross-over to pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks alone (Arm Bx). An interim analysis for
      futility will be performed after 18 patients are enrolled into Arm B to allow early stopping
      of that trial arm for lack of efficacy. The primary endpoint is to compare disease control
      rates at 18 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints include progression free survival,
      toxicity, and overall response rate.

      There will be a companion translational study operating concurrently with the study described
      above. In this study, biomarker research to be performed on tumor biopsies and peripheral
      blood samples will be performed to explore the immunologic and genomic mechanism of action
      underlying treatment with pembrolizumab and carboplatin versus carboplatin alone. This
      protocol includes tissue and blood correlative exploratory endpoints including changes in
      tumor PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) gene expression, tumor and peripheral blood immune
      composition and cytokine expression, plasma tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and tumor MYC
      oncogene expression using tumor biopsy and peripheral blood testing before and after
      treatment; correlations with these markers and disease control rate will be assessed.

    <description>Treatment will be continued until clear progression is documented using RECIST, or until unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Patients who are believed to have pseudoprogression based on irRECIST may continue on study therapy after consultation with the study PI. Patients on Arm A may stop carboplatin after a minimum of 6 cycles to minimize toxicity if they have stable or responding disease per physician discretion and will continue maintenance pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. If patients on Arm A discontinue carboplatin before 6 cycles due to reasons other than progressive disease, the possibility of continuing pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks should be discussed with the study PI.</description>

             (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
