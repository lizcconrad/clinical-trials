  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction reflects the pathophysiology of Diabetes Mellitus in
      this patient group favors an increase in morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular
      events, and for this reason has been one of the most studied clinical entities.

      Therefore this work aims to analyze the cardiorespiratory parameters and glycated hemoglobin
      after the commission of a rehabilitation program in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.

      The collection protocol is to check the heart rate, blood pressure, double product, Borg
      scale, variability heart rate and glycated hemoglobin of patients with type 2 diabetes This
      project this is an experimental study, the type randomized clinical trial on the hemodynamic
      response and glucose levels in patients with DM2 institutionalized in Acre Hospital
      Foundation submitted to one rehabilitation program consisting of aerobic and anaerobic
      exercises performed for 12 weeks in three weekly meetings, of 60 minutes each.

      Background: Built with evidence that makes it possible to work in cardiac rehabilitation
      programs in patients with type 2 diabetes with more security, guaranteeing them an
      improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, the hemodynamic and glycemic variables, allowing
      them a better quality of life

      Method/Design: The research instrument is applied before and after the practice of the
      proposed exercise program (consisting of aerobic and anaerobic exercises performed for 12
      weeks in three weekly meetings, of 60 minutes each). The instrument is based on the following
      collection protocol: assessment of BP, HR, Borg scale, respiratory rate (RR), oxygen
      saturation (SAT), the DP calculation and will be carried out the examination to check HbA1C
      Will be performed for 12 weeks in three weekly meetings, of 60minutes each, in total of 36
      sessions with antecipated 60 pacients splited in 2 groups &quot;Control&quot; and &quot;intervention&quot;

      Discussion: Correlate the variability of heart rate behavior and glycated hemoglobin after
      the exercise program; To demonstrate the possible association between the change of the
      cardiorespiratory parameters according to the variation of glycated hemoglobin; Demonstrate
      the possibility of association between the variation of the cardiorespiratory parameters and
      glycated hemoglobin according to sex;

    <description>With a specific heart rate monitor, Heart Rate Variability (also called RR variability) is the measure of heart rate variation between each pair of heart beats at a given time interval.
The results of the heart rate variability analysis are divided into two groups: time domain results and frequency domain results.
They are numbers related to the &quot;rhythm&quot; in which the variations occur:
VLF - Very Low Frequency: power contained in the range below 0.04Hz. LF - Low Frequency: power contained in the range of 0.04 to 0.15Hz. HF - High Frequency: power contained in the range of 0.15 to 0.4Hz. LF / HF: Ratio between LF and HF powers.</description>

    <description>The HbA1c test counts the number of red blood cells that are glycated, that is, linked to a glucose molecule.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of pulse oximetry at every intervention session</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>With the use of pulse oximetry we will observe the percentage of oxygen that the blood is carrying, compared to the maximum of its transport capacity. Ideally, more than 89% of your red cells should be carrying oxygen.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of subjective sensation of respiratory discomfort at every intervention session</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>Used on the modified borg scale cr 410 that goes with a score of 0 to 10 where the patient will identify their degree of discomfort after the protocol in which it was submitted;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of Blood Pressure at every intervention session</measure>
    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>The expression blood pressure (BP) or blood pressure refers to the pressure exerted by the blood against the wall of the arteries. Blood pressure as well as that of the whole circulatory system is usually slightly above atmospheric pressure, the pressure difference being responsible for keeping the arteries and other vessels not collapsed. In a healthy person, the amount of pressure can vary continuously, depending on the stress, the emotion or if you are doing physical activity.</description>

    <description>This will be measured in meters during a six-minute walk test in a 30-meter runner where the participant should walk as mush as he/she can in six minutes.</description>
