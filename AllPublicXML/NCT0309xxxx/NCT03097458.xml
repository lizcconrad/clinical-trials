  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A parental cancer diagnosis challenges the family's stability and the parent-child
      relationship. It may impact the children's well-being, so that about one third of them
      develop clinically relevant levels of psychological distress. Psycho-oncological family-based
      counselling programs have been shown to elevate children's and parents' well-being. However,
      there is still a dearth of familial health services in Switzerland, which has also been
      recognized by the Swiss National Cancer Program (2011-2017).

      This study aims to implement and evaluate a short-term family counselling intervention at the
      Cancer Center of the University Hospital Basel. The primary objective of the study is the
      enhancement of adjustment to the parental cancer diagnosis. The study seeks secondary to
      determine the feasibility of the short-term counselling Intervention.

      This study ist designed as a randomized controlled wait-list Intervention study, which aims
      to implement and evaluate a short-term family counselling intervention at the Cancer Center
      of the University Hospital Basel. The study will be divided into two stages: Stage 1 serves
      as the preparatory work phase, where the intervention manual will be developed as well as the
      implementation strategy into the hospital. In stage 2 the intervention will be evaluated,
      with an interim analysis to test for feasibility. The primary objective of the study is the
      enhancement of adjustment (family, parents and children) to the parental cancer diagnosis.
      The study seeks secondary to determine the feasibility of the short-term counselling
      intervention in the Swiss medical setting and to identify predictors for families with
      continuing psychosocial adjustment problems.
