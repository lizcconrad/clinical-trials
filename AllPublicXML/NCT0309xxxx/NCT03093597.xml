      The purpose of the study is to compare the changes in the appearance of dry skin after the
      use various moisturizers: white petrolatum ointment, coconut oil, jojoba oil, and almond oil
      in patients with dry skin.

      The goal of this study is to compare how the appearance of dry skin changes before and after
      the use of following moisturizers: white petrolatum, coconut oil, jojoba oil and almond oil).
      Up to 40 subjects from Banner-University Medical Center/University of Arizona dermatology
      clinics and University of California, Davis dermatology clinics (up to 20 subjects per site)
      who have dry skin will be enrolled in this study and randomized to receive the four
      moisturizers on four locations on their forearms.There will be a total of 3 study sessions:
      baseline, and approximately 1 and 2 weeks for follow up assessment. At each visit, dry skin
      severity will be evaluated by a trained observer using a validated Dry Skin Score, skin
      barrier biophysical properties (transepidermal water loss and hydration) will be measured,
      and digital photos of the test sites will be taken for image analysis.
