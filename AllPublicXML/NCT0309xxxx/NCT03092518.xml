  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Gastric cancer is a common and serious cancer. Standard treatment is chemotherapy drugs.
      Researchers want to see if a new treatment helps. It is surgical removal of the cancer and
      heated chemotherapy delivered to the abdominal cavity called HIPEC.

      Objective:

      To test if surgical removal of tumors plus heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy can improve
      survival in people with gastric cancers.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with gastric cancer who can have most tumors surgically removed

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests

        -  Scans

        -  Tissue sample from previous surgery

        -  Endoscopy with biopsy: A tube with a camera goes through the mouth and into the stomach.
           It and takes a sample of stomach tissue. Participants might may get medicine to make
           them drowsy.

        -  Laparoscopy: Small cuts are made in the abdomen. A thin tube with a light and camera is
           inserted into the abdomen. Participants sleep through the procedure.

      Participants will stay in the hospital. They will have:

        -  Surgery to remove as many tumors as possible.

        -  HIPEC for 60 minutes: Two thin tubes are put into the abdomen. Two chemotherapy drugs
           are given through one tube. They are drained out through another at a temperature a few
           degrees above normal body temperature. Another drug is given in a vein.

      Recovery for 7-21 days: Participants will have tubes in their stomach and bladder and IVs for
      a few days. They will get pain medicine, IV fluids, antibiotics, and blood transfusions as
      needed.

      Participants will have visits every few months for 3 years, then one a year. Visits include
      physical exam, blood tests, and scans. They also include dietary assessment and questions.

      Background:

        -  An estimated 24,590 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma are diagnosed annually in the U.S.

        -  The peritoneal surface is a site of metastasis found often at time of diagnosis and is a
           common (40%) site of recurrence.

        -  Laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage and cytopathologic analysis is a staging modality
           that can identify a subset of patients with microscopic peritoneal metastasis prior to
           consideration for definitive surgical therapy

        -  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been employed in advanced gastric cancers and as an
           adjuvant with an associated improvement in survival in systematic reviews

      Objectives:

      - Determine the overall survival in patients with cytology-positive gastric cancer treated
      with HIPEC and gastrectomy

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach

        -  Cytopathologic evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis

        -  Medically fit for systemic chemotherapy, HIPEC and gastrectomy

      Design:

      - Single arm, phase II study of HIPEC and gastrectomy

             to enrollment

          -  Systemic therapy should consist of at least fluoropyrimidine-based and/or platinum
             based chemotherapy

          -  Limited peritoneal involvement found at staging laparoscopy or on final pathology that
             is deemed completely resectable is permitted

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Physiologically able to undergo HIPEC and gastrectomy

          -  No history of malignancy within 2 years of enrollment except for basal cell carcinoma

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document

          -  Previous exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy with tissue biopsy or peritoneal lavage
             is permitted.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who are receiving any investigational agents

          -  Disseminated extra-peritoneal or solid organ metastases

          -  Includes carcinomatosis associated with clinically or radiographically evident ascites
             (greater than 500cc)

             --Excludes greater omentum and ovarian metastases

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because HIPEC and gastrectomy have not
             been studied in pregnant women and has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with HIPEC and gastrectomy, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients may be considered for this study only after consultation with a
             NIAID physician.
