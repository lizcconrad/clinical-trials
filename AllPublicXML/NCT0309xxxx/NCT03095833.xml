    <textblock>
      Functional Magnetic resonance study on the effect of cognitive context variables on the
      perception and valuation of food odorants and flavor. The study is composed of two
      experiments; in a first experiment we address the question of how valuation of food odors are
      modulated by 3 cognitive conditions (indulgence, healthy, and neutral). Food odors are
      delivered using a custom-made olfactometer. Here we hypothesize that cognitive regulation can
      modulate the primary sensory processing of food odors. We expect that cortical regions
      related with valuation and cognitive regulation such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
      and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex operate the modulation of primary olfactory cortex and
      amygdala. In a second experiment, we aim to reveal the brain areas involved in integrating
      food color cues with odor and taste stimuli. Here we hypothesize that color cues are capable
      of biasing flavor attributes of food (flavor intensity), and that this bias occurs at
      different cortical areas commonly associate with multisensory integration such as the
      orbitofrontal cortex, insula, amygdala and hippocampus.

    <description>Four odors are available: &quot;milk chocolate&quot;, &quot;dark chocolate&quot;, &quot;pineapple&quot; and &quot;apricot&quot;.
In addition, a neutral odor will be used &quot;clean air&quot;, a control odor transmitted during the task by the olfactometer in the same way as the other 4 odors, the only variant being that no odor will be deposited in the U-tube containing the smells. The images corresponding to the odors will be displayed after the odor has been proposed.</description>

    <description>Concerning behavioral passes, the subjects will be in front of a computer screen on which the task will be presented. For fMRI passes, the visual stimulation of the participant is done by a mirror system placed about 10 cm from the participant's eyes, allowing him to watch a translucent screen on which the visual stimuli are projected. The latter have an intensity similar to that of television images, and therefore below the maximum permitted by labor legislation. The stimuli will be projected via a video projector located at the back of the imager.</description>

    <description>The olfactory sensitivity and the olfactory identification capacities of the subjects will be evaluated using the ETOC test. Subjects will have to define his state of hunger/satiety thanks to a questionnaire of hunger. Finally, subjects should assess the hedonic nature of the odor and the edibility of the odor source. The task to be performed will be the same for the behavioral study as for the imaging study. The subject will receive instruction from the following three: &quot;indulge yourself&quot;, the subject must think of the desire to eat the food that will be presented to him in olfactory and visual form; &quot;Be natural,&quot; the subject must act as naturally as possible; Or &quot;hold back,&quot; the subject must distance themselves from their desire to eat and control themselves. In a second step, an odor will be presented for 5 seconds. This will be based on the subject's inspiration, then an image associated with the odor will be presented for two seconds.</description>

    <description>Before and after the imaging examination, a blood sample will be taken by a medical imaging manipulator affiliated with the CERMEP whose actions will be remunerated in accordance with the usual hygiene and safety rules. The samples taken will then be annotated with the subject code and kept at the CERMEP. The volume of ghrelin sampling is 5 ml (10 ml for two samples). The volume of the leptin is 5 ml (ie 10 ml for two samples).</description>

    <description>The investigators will determine how perceptual judgments are modulated by cross-modal stimuli, as well as metacognitive judgments (how individuals judge their own sensory performance). In addition, they will determine how perceptual judgments are modified in the context of group decisions and how language influences performance.</description>
