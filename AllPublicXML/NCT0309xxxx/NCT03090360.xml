  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the growth of healthy term infants fed an experimental infant formula with a
      prebiotic, a commercial control infant formula with a probiotic, but without a prebiotic and
      human breast milk
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multisite, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The purpose of the study is
      to determine if infants fed a standard infant formula with a prebiotic have a weight gain in
      line with infants fed a standard starter infant formula without a prebiotic.
