  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how Jublia affects dermatophytomas, which are difficult to treat with
      other therapeutic options.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dermatophytomas are known to be resistant to even long courses of systemic antifungals, and
      have therefore been excluded from both topical and systemic clinical trials for
      onychomycosis, including those for Efinaconazole solution. Efinaconazole (Jublia) 10%
      solution is an FDA approved topical medication indicated for treatment of DLSO, and the
      utility of this medication likely exceeds published results. Efinaconazole solution's novel
      ability to penetrate into the subungal space likely accounts for improved treatment results
      seen in DLSO treated with Jublia. We will investigate the utility of topical efinaconazole
      solution in the treatment of dermatophytomas.
