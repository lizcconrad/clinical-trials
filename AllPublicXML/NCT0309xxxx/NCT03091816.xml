    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the changes in dynamic perfusion computed tomography images
      before, during, and after stereotactic body radiation therapy in patients with stage I-II
      non-small cell lung cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body. Diagnostic imaging
      procedures, such as dynamic perfusion computed tomography, measure blood flow through tumors.
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays
      directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to
      normal tissue. Giving dynamic perfusion computed tomography images before, during, and after
      stereotactic body radiation therapy may help better understand how radiation therapy works to
      stop tumor growth in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe perfusion computed tomography (CT) parameters and their changes in non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors prior to, during, 1 month after, and 3 months after
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate tumor perfusion parameters with clinical tumor response on follow up per
      standard of care.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate changes in serum levels of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and
      circulating tumor cell (CTC) with clinical response rates and perfusion parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo dynamic perfusion computed tomography (DPCT) at baseline, during SBRT (after
      2 of 3 fractions or 3 of 5 fractions), and then at 1 and 3 months post stereotactic body
      radiation therapy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

    <description>Descriptive statistics including mean and standard deviation or median and range, will be used to summarize the distribution of perfusion parameters (blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time and permeability), as well as their changes from baseline to the time-points after SBRT. Precision of the estimated means will be provided. Line graphs will be used to display the changes in the parameters over time. If the distribution of the data permits, mixed-effect linear regression analysis will be performed to examine the patterns of the pre- vs. post-SBRT change in the endpoints.</description>
