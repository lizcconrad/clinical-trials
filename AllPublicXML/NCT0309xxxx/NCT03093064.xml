  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia affects a significant proportion of the population and current levels of
      understanding of the illness is inadequate to treat it effectively. Converging lines of
      evidence suggest that neuroinflammation occurs in schizophrenia, and specifically
      over-activity of brain-resident immune cells called microglia. It is however unclear whether
      activated microglia play a primary role in schizophrenia, or whether this is a secondary
      phenomenon of no pathophysiological significance. The investigators therefore plan to test
      the effect of a monoclonal antibody (natalizumab) on psychotic symptoms in a cohort of first
      episode psychosis patients.
