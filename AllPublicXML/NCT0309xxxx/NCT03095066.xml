  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate AVP-786 for the
      treatment of neurobehavioral disinhibition including aggression, agitation, and irritability
      in participants with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants for this study must have a diagnosis of neurobehavioral disinhibition
      including aggression, agitation, and irritability that persists after brain injury.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study, consisting of up to 12 weeks of
      treatment.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in the Composite of the Clinical Impression Severity Scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Clinician Rating Scale (NPI-C) Subscales of Aggression, Agitation, and Irritability/Lability (NPI-C-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-C can be used to rate the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms across 14 domains. The scores for each item within an individual domain/subscale range from 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating increased severity. The NPI-C-3 is comprised of the aggression, agitation, and irritability/lability subscales. The scores for the three subscales are summed to create the total NPI-C-3 composite score, which ranges from 0 to 99, with a higher score indicating increased severity.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Modified Clinical Global Impression of Change (mCGI-C) Raw Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mCGI-C will be used to assess the clinician's view of the participant's treatment response. The mCGI-C is a 7-point (1 to 7) modified version of the CGI-C scale. A higher score represents worsening of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The NPI-C is used to rate the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms across 14 domains. The scores for each item within an individual domain/subscale range from 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating increased severity.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Modified Clinical Global Impression of Severity (mCGI-S) Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mCGI-S will be used to assess the clinician's view of the participant's severity of aggression, agitation, and irritability symptoms. The mCGI-S is a 7-point (1 to 7) modified version of the CGI-S scale. In all cases, a higher score represents increased severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-S is a single-question scale that specifically assesses the severity of symptoms of neurobehavioral disinhibition, including aggression, agitation, and irritability, on a 7-point scale : 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 in Post-traumatic Headache (PTH) Assessment Questionnaire Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PTH assessment questionnaire consists of 7 questions that characterize headache frequency, severity, intensity, and the impact of headache on activities. The PTH assessment includes a visual analog scale (VAS) to rate pain from 0 to 10. A higher score on the VAS represents worse pain.</description>
