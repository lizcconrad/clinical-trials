  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The enrolled RSV-bronchiolitis patients will be randomized into two arms , the early HHHFNC
      group and the standard therapy group with rescue HHHFNC to study the efficacy of this
      treatment.

      Setting:

      The study will be conducted between June 2017 and June 2020 in the short stay unit of the
      Pediatric Emergency Center (PEC) of Hamad General Hospital, the only pediatric emergency
      facility in the State of Qatar. Infants aged ≤3 months presenting to the unit for treatment
      of viral bronchiolitis with positive RSV test will be eligible for the study.

      Procedure:

      Eligible patients will be enrolled after obtaining written consent. For patients who consent,
      plain chest radiography, and nasopharyngeal swabs will be taken for RSV detection. If the
      patient has a positive RSV rapid antigen test, patients will be randomized in one of the
      study arms. Adverse effects in each group will be carefully monitored and documented.

      Study Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized into two treatment arms

      Group 1: Early HHHFNC Group Patients in this group will be treated by using heated humidified
      high flow oxygen /air via nasal cannula; investigators will keep the patient on HHHFNC until
      he/she becomes clinically ready for discharge.

      Group 2: Standard Therapy and Rescue HHHFNC Group:

      patients in this group will be treated by usual therapy,investigators will use low flow nasal
      cannula oxygen therapy only if oxygenation needed to maintain Oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 92%
      , if the patient deteriorate and require ICU, rescue HHHFNC will be started before admission
      to the ICU.
