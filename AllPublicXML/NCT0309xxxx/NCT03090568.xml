  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the bioavailability and tolerability of BIA 5-453
      under fasted and fed conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Single-centre, two-way crossover, randomised, open-label study in 12 healthy male
      volunteers. Subjects received a single oral 200 mg dose of BIA 5-453 following a standard
      meal in one period, and following at least 10 hours of fasting in another period. Treatment
      periods were separated by a washout interval of 2 weeks or more.
