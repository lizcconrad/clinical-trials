  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to characterise the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic profile of
      Etamicastat (BIA 5-453) and its metabolites after three multiple rising dose regimens of
      Etamicastat (BIA 5-453).

    <textblock>
      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of three dosage regimens of
      Etamicastat (BIA 5-453) in 3 groups of 8 hypertensive patients.

      In each group, the study consisted of a 10-day multiple-dose period. Progression to the next
      dose level only occurred if the previous dose level was considered to be safe and well
      tolerated. An appropriate interval separated the investigation of doses to permit a timely
      review and evaluation of safety data prior to proceeding to a higher dose level.

On Day 1 and Day 10, patients remained fasted from a minimum of 8 hours before drug administration until after the collection of the 4 hour PK timepoint. Individuals were served a meal following the 4 hour timepoint and had free access to a maximum of 2.5 litres of water per day. However they were not allowed to drink 1 hour before and 1 hour after the dosing except for the 250 mL taken with the IMP at administration.
On other administrations days, patients remained fasted for a minimum of 8 hours before drug administration and the treatments were administered one hour before a standardized breakfast.
