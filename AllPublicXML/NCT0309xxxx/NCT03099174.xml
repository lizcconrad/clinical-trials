    <textblock>
      For each dose finding cohorts (A, B, C and D):

      The primary objective of each dose finding cohort is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) / recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib with
      or without hormonal therapy (letrozole, anastrozole, fulvestrant). Dose limiting toxicities
      (DLT) will be assessed during the first treatment cycle to assess the MTD/RP2D.

      In case that no MTD is reached a RP2D dose will be determined taking into account safety data
      and other available information. This will be agreed with the Steering Committee.

      For each expansion cohorts (E and F):

      The objectives of the expansion cohorts are to assess the anti-tumour activity of xentuzumab
      in combination with abemaciclib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (cohort E).

      Tentatively a cohort F may be opened to assess the anti-tumour activity of the triplet
      combination xentuzumab / abemaciclib and fulvestrant in a single-arm expansion group of
      patients with locally advanced / metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer who
      have progressed following prior aromatase inhibitor therapy and prior CDK4/6 inhibitor
      treatment. Cohort F will only be opened if indicated by emerging data from ongoing clinical
      trials.
