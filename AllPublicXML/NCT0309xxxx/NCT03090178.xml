  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease with a high impact on patient's quality of life.
      Nocturnal pruritus is one of the main symptoms affecting quality of life. Treatment efficacy
      is generally measured by healthcare professionals during consultations with both questioning
      and visual examination of the lesions. Quality of Life (QoL) can also be evaluated
      retrospectively with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scale. Collecting data
      retrospectively introduces a significant recall bias that can be addressed by collecting data
      in Real World (RW). Real World data collection is prospective and take place within the
      patient's own environment. While data collection is generally done with diaries, it has been
      demonstrated that smartphone and connected devices were able to produce more precise and
      granular data than traditional methods.

      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate a medical hypothesis using a wristband
      actigraph: patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have a poorer quality and
      quantity of sleep than healthy subject.

      Secondary objetives are to assess the interest of a smartphone application in evaluating the
      quality of life of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in regard of those of
      healthy volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients :

          -  Subjects using a smartphone running Apple operating system (iOS 7 and above) or
             Android (version 2.2 and above)

          -  Subjects agreeing to wear the actigraphy wristband at night

          -  Subjects 18 years old or older

          -  Subjects affiliated to French Health Insurance

          -  Subjects treated for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis or atopic dermatitis
             exacerbation* *The stage of the atopic dermatitis will be assessed by using the Eczema
             Area and Severity Index (EASI), Body Surface Area (BSA) and Investigator Global
             Assessment (IGA). The EASI is an investigator-assessed instrument measuring the
             severity of clinical signs in atopic dermatitis. The EASI was identified as one of the
             best-validated outcome measures for atopic dermatitis.

        A moderate to severe atopic dermatitis corresponds to:

          -  Eczema Area and Severity Index score ≥ 7.1

          -  Investigator Global Assessment ≥ 3

          -  Body Surface Area ≥ 10

        Healthy volunters :

             above)

          -  Subjects agreeing to wear the actigraphy wristband at night

          -  Subjects 18 years old or older

          -  Insomnia Severity Index (ISI);

          -  Berlin Sleep Apnea Scale;

          -  Epworth Scale

          -  Subjects treated by hypnotic drugs

          -  Pregnant woman

          -  Subjects under guardianship

        Exclusion criteria:

        If a participant is taking hypnotic treatments during his study participation, he will be
