  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new male-specific dog-allergen-component has been found (Can f 5) which indicates possible
      differences in allergic reactions to male and female dogs. This has not yet been tested in
      real life.

      The aim is to test if sensitization only to the male-dog specific allergen-component, Can f
      5, results in a positive skin prick test (SPT) to male dog extract and not female dog
      extract. In addition, the investigators want to investigate if allergic symptoms only occur
      when exposed to the male dog extract by conjunctival provocation.
