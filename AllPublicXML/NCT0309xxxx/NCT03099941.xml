      Abstract. Insufficient motor control mechanism of transversus abdominus and multifidus
      muscles is the most important cause of the chronic nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP).
      Recently, applications sre developed that generates audio and vibrant stimuli in response to
      anteroposterior and mediolateral rotations and can be adapted according to subject-specific
      movement sensitivity.

      Objective. The objective of this study was to compare effects of a biofeedback application
      that is alternative to physiotherapist feedback in core stabilization training of patients
      with chronic nonspecific low back pain.

      Design. This study was a parallel group randomized controlled trial with outcome assessment.

      Patients. The participants were 38 patients with chronic (≥12 weeks) nonspecific low back
      pain.

      Interventions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either physiotherapist feedback or
      Perfect Practice (Level Belt Pro Inc.) biofeedback. Patients in both groups received 12
      sessions, 30 minutes of three weekly graded functional core education trial.

      Measurements. Primary outcome measures were muscle strength (transversus abdominus and
      multifidus) pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale) and functional level (Revised Oswestry
      Disability Index); secondary outcomes were flexibility (modified Schober test), range of
      motion (universal goniometer), proprioception (Active Reposition Test), patient beliefs (Fear
      Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire), psychological status (Beck Depression Index), and quality
      of life(36 Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire [SF-36]).

      Limitations. Outcome measures for muscle strength did not include objective assesment.
