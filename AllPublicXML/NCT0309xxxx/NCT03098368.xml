  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the neurodegenerative disease which is caused by Lewy bodies
      deposition in central and peripheral nervous system. The mains symptoms include both motor
      and non motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, rest tremor, postural instability,
      autonomic dysfunction or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Moreover, the PD symptoms not only occur
      in the daytime, but also in the nighttime. The nighttime symptoms or nocturnal symptoms can
      make the patients disabling as well as the daytime symptoms. The bradykinesia that occurs in
      the nighttime is called nocturnal hypokinesia which also make many serious consequences such
      as bedsore, falling or aspiration or death.

      In this study, the investigators aim to study the effects of rotigotine transdermal patch
      compare to placebo on mainly the aspect of nocturnal hypokinesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recruited PD patients who had history of nocturnal hypokinesia and
      randomized by running number (blind) into 2 groups including active and placebo group.
      Baseline demographic, disease characteristics, nocturnal questionnaires and wearable
      nocturnal sensors data were collected before drug titration. In active group, participants
      received the rotigotine transdermal patch titration from 2 mg/day to maximum dosage which
      participants had no side effect or 16 mg/ day every week. In placebo group, participants
      would get the placebo patch titration as the active group. After participants got maintenance
      dosage, participants would get the physical examination, nocturnal questionnaires and
      wearable nocturnal sensors as before study.
