Relief of abdominal pain is defined as a decrease in the weekly average of abdominal pain score of at least 30% compared with baseline and relief of stool consistency is defined as a 50% or greater reduction in the number of days per week with at least one stool that has a consistency of Type 6 or 7 compared with baseline.

Abdominal Pain: Scored between 0 (no pain) and 10 (as bad as it could be)
Stool Consistency: Bristol Stool Scale (Scored 1-7)</description>
