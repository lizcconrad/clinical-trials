  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, millions of Americans are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). For more than
      half of them, ICU admission initiates a cascade of decisions about treatment and end-of-life
      care.This is particularly the case for patients with chronic critical illness, a
      life-limiting syndrome. Most (74%-82%) ICU patients who require mechanical ventilation have
      transient or persistent cognitive impairment that precludes them from making their own
      healthcare decisions. Among ICU patients, the chronically critically ill (CCI) are at highest
      risk for cognitive impairment and thus require a surrogate decision maker (SDM), usually a
      family member. SDMs for the critically ill often describe high states of psychological stress
      associated with the uncertainty of the patient's condition and their decision making role.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of two decision support interventions
      for end-of-life care delivered to SDMs of CCI patients. This will be the first study to test
      interventions tailored to the unique needs of the SDMs of CCI patients delivered using an
      interactive avatar based format.

      The investigators will conduct a three-arm unblinded clinical trial using pre- and post-tests
      to evaluate the efficacy of two electronic decision-support interventions, Interactive
      Virtual Decision Support for End-of-Life and Palliative Care (INVOLVE) and Informational
      Support (IS), compared to each other and to usual care (UC) among 270 SDMs of cognitively
      impaired CCI patients. This design will allow the investigators to prospectively compare the
      efficacy of the experiential avatar-based decision support tool (INVOLVE) with both an
      information-only condition and UC. Subjects assigned to an experimental condition (INVOLVE or
      IS) will receive two doses of the intervention, at enrollment and 1 day later. After the
      second dose, these subjects will have access to their assigned condition for subsequent
      self-administered doses, which will be electronically captured until the patient's ICU
      discharge or death. Data will be collected at (T1) baseline (Day 3 or 4 of the patient's ICU
      stay), and then on Days 1, 3, 7 and 90 post-baseline

      The investigators aim to:

        1. Identify the essential elements of the graphical user interface and educational content
           needed to revise the INVOLVE prototype for a set of common end-of-life decisions that
           occur in the ICU.

        2. Evaluate if there are differences in the decision making readiness and decision making
           quality between subjects exposed to INVOLVE, IS, or UC on Days 1, 3, and 7 days
           post-baseline while accounting for covariates (prior SDM experience, SDM knowledge of
           the patient's preferences, and SDM's religious beliefs).

        3. Determine if there are differences in the post-decision outcomes of SDMs and their CCI
           patient by study condition while accounting for covariates at 90 days post-baseline.
