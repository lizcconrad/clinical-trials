        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is ambulatory male or female

          -  Patient's body mass index score is &gt;20 and &lt;40 kg/m2 at the Screening Visit

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of
             screening and check-in and must agree to use protocol-specified contraception
             throughout the duration of the study

          -  Patient's health is stable with no clinically significant findings on physical
             examination

          -  Patient has type 2 (ie, adult onset) diabetes mellitus diagnosed by a physician or
             nurse practitioner &gt; 6 months before the Screening Visit, is on a stable glycemic
             control medication, and protocol specified HbA1c values at the Screening Visit

          -  Patient has hypertension diagnosed by a physician or nurse practitioner &gt; 6 months
             before the Screening Visit, and BP within the protocol's acceptable range

          -  Patients must be on a stable regimen for hypertension control that includes an
             angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)

          -  Other inclusion criteria per protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a clinically significant active or unstable medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would preclude trial participation

          -  Patient is on medication(s) that, when co-administered with a soluble guanylate
             cyclase (sGC) stimulator, could increase the risk of hypotension

          -  Patient has evidence of severe or active end-organ damage

          -  Patient is an active smoker or has used any nicotine-containing products (cigarettes,
             e-cigarettes, vape pens, cigars, chewing tobacco, gum, patches) during the 6 months
             before Check-in. Use of nicotine is excluded during the study until after the End of
             Trial Visit.
