      This study aims to evaluate the effect of early administration of high-dose vitamin D3 in
      reducing all-cause, all-location mortality in vitamin D deficient patients at high risk for
      ARDS. Patients will be screened for vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20 ng/mL). Only patients screened
      as vitamin D deficient will be randomized. Half of the vitamin-D deficient patients will be
      given a high-dose of vitamin D3 and the other half will be given a placebo.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the efficacy and safety of early administration of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in
      reducing mortality and morbidity for vitamin D deficient patients at high risk for ARDS and
      mortality.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      Early administration of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will improve all-cause, all-location
      mortality to day 90 in vitamin D deficient patients at high risk for ARDS and mortality.

      Patients will be recruited from the EDs, hospital wards, operating rooms, ICUs and other
      acute care areas of the PETAL Network Clinical Centers. Screening will include a test for
      Vitamin D (25OHD) levels using either the hospital's clinical laboratory or an FDA-approved
      point-of-care device (FastPack IP, Qualigen Inc). Patients screened as vitamin D deficient
      (&lt;20 ng/mL) will be randomized. Half of the randomized patients will receive an early
      administration of high-dose vitamin D3 and the other half will receive a placebo (orally or
      via naso/orogastric tube).

      Vitamin D has pleiotropic roles in regulating immune function and maintaining epithelial
      surface integrity. Strong preclinical data support the protective role of vitamin D in
      regulating pulmonary inflammation and disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane that are
      fundamental to ARDS pathogenesis.
