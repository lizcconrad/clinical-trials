      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of myomectomy for intramural myomas on the
      fertility outcomes in infertile women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All women participating in the study will be randomly allocated into two groups; myomectomy
      group and conservative management group. Women in the myomectomy group will be subjected to
      laparotomy to remove the myomas while women in the conservative management group will not be
      subjected to surgery. Women in the myomectomy group will be asked to abstain from having
      sexual intercourse (or use a barrier contraception method) for 3 months after surgery then to
      start having regular fertility-oriented intercourse after that. Women in the conservative
      management group will be asked to immediately start having regular fertility-oriented
      intercourse. Women in both groups will be monitored form the time of starting regular
      intercourse and for one year for occurrence of clinical pregnancy.
