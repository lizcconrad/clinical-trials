  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In comparison to healthy pregnant women and non-pregnant woman, this study analyses
      parameters of primary hemostasis and plasmatic coaguation in preeclamptic pregnant woman.
      Detailed analyses of the platelet function is performed using the Multiple Electrode
      Aggregometry, detailed analyses of the plasmatic coagulation syste is performed by isolated
      coaguation factor analyses and conventional coagulation analyses.
