  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant born preterm have an increased risk of adverse long-term developmental outcomes.The
      risk associated with preterm birth increase as gestational age decreases, and vulnerability
      remains in moderate and early preterm (&lt;34 weeks) and late preterm (&gt;34 weeks). There are
      many studies in the literature showed that the prevalence of developmental delay increases
      with premature birth. However, there is no study in the literature investigates effect of
      early intervention program motor performance in subgroups of preterm infants. Hence the aim
      of this study is to evaluate the differences in effects of early intervention program on
      motor development in early and moderate (&lt;34 weeks) and late preterm infants.

      Fifty-two preterm infants corrected age less than 6 months included in this study. They were
      separated by their birth weeks. Babies with gestational ages between 34-36 weeks and 6 days
      (including the given days) are categorized as late preterm, while those born before 34 weeks
      are grouped as moderate and early preterm. Each group contains 26 infants.

      First, sociodemographic information and histories of babies are obtaining. Ages and contact
      information of the parents are recording. Prenatal and natal risk factors of the mothers are
      querying. Gestational ages and height, weight, and head circumferences of babies at birth are
      recording. Number of pregnancies, live births and abortions, type of delivery, multiple
      pregnancies for mothers as well as consanguinity between parents are asking.The Alberta
      Infant Motor Scale is using to evaluate spontaneous motor movements of the baby. After the
      detailed examination, intervention program set up for infants. Both groups receive 3 months
      family based intervention program.

      After the intervention program, both groups re-examined.
