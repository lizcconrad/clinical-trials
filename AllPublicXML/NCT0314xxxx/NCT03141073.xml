    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety and population PK of HMS5552 as add on to
      Metformin in type 2 diabetic adult subjects, there will be 2 groups, in the first 24 weeks,
      one group will receive HMS5552 plus Metformin, while the other group will receive placebo
      plus Metformin; after 24 weeks, all subjects received HMS5552 plus Metformin for 28 weeks.

      This study is a phase III study in subjects with T2DM. As designed, the study will start with
      a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period based on diet and exercise interventions for
      screening eligible subjects, meanwhile, subjects are treated with Metformin (Glucophage) at
      1500mg/day as basic therapy throughout the treatment period. 3-weeks after run-in,
      eligibility is confirmed with required laboratory tests at -5±2 days prior to randomization.
      The eligible subjects are randomly assigned to HMS5552 75mg BID group or placebo BID group
      with ratio 1:1 to receive a 24-week double-blind treatment. Then all subjects receive 28-week
      open-label treatment of HMS5552 75mg BID add-on to Metformin. After 52-week treatment, all
      investigational drugs should be discontinued and followed by 1-week for safety evaluation.
      The dosage of Metformin (Glucophage) should be maintained at 1500 mg/day from run-in period
      to treatment completion.
