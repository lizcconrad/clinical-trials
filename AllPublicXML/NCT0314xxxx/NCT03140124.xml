  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have noted the benefits of exercise programs in improving both mood and
      anxiety symptoms. Additionally, single bouts of exercise have been shown to improve mood and
      anxiety. Business applications report ancillary benefits of exercise as well. For example,
      individuals spontaneously report better ability to approach stimuli and cope with emotional
      experiences if doing it while exercising.

      The current study aims to investigate exercise during a therapy session as a potential
      intervention for enhancing therapeutic learning, particularly ability to better cope with
      emotional topics and experiencing intense emotions. In this study, patient participants will
      complete a therapy session while using an exercise machine and a separate therapy session
      while using a worry stone (control). Both patient participants and therapist participants
      will make ratings of a variety of items, including ability to discuss emotional topics and
      comfort in experiencing emotions.

      Investigators hypothesize that patients will report better ability to discuss emotional
      topics and more comfort in experiencing emotions following the exercise condition as opposed
      to the worry stone condition. Investigators also hypothesize that therapist ratings will
      similarly indicate that patients were better able to discuss emotional topics and experience
      emotional content during exercise sessions.

    <description>Each participant will be provided with an ActiveLife Trainer to use during visit 2 or 3. The ActiveLife Trainer is a stationary pedaling machine that one can use while seated. It was designed to be used while working and makes very little noise. It is a safe, low-impact physical activity machine with adjustable resistance. The machine communicates via Bluetooth with the Wahoo Fitness app which records activity metrics such as distance cycled. Participants will be provided with a tablet on which the Wahoo Fitness app will track their exercise during the session. The ActiveLife Trainer has been used in numerous research studies (Carr et al., 2014; Botter et al., 2013; Burford et al., 2013; Carr et al., 2013).</description>
