  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) have become increasingly popular in esophageal cancer.
      It is generally accepted that comparing to open resections, MIE results in decreased
      postoperative pain, faster recovery times, and shorter hospital stays with comparable
      oncologic outcomes. However, MIE poses an important challenge for established thoracic
      surgeons as it is a difficult technique to become skilled at with an protracted learning
      curve. Standard laparoscopic and thoracoscopic instruments are rigid and provide a finite
      freedom of movement with a two dimensional visualization of the operating field. Such a
      difficulty is increased even more when the Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy with an intrathoracic
      anastomosis is needed.

      Robot- assisted surgical system has opened a new era of minimally invasive surgery. Robot-
      assisted surgery offers some advantages including high- definition three- dimensional
      visualization and 7 degrees of freedom with the use of its surgical wrists, motion scaling,
      and tremor filtration, allowing the surgeon to perform complex operations comfortably in the
      domain of urinary tract, hepatobiliary and gynecological surgery. Although a robot-assisted
      thoraco- laparoscopic minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) was initiated from 2003, the
      published experience with RAMIE remains small, especially for Ivor- Lewis approaches. The aim
      of this study was to investigate the short- term and long-term outcomes of RAILE to identify
      any clinical or oncologic benefits of RAILE in esophageal cancer.

      This confirmatory, nonrandomized, single-arm trial (phase II) will be conducted to evaluate
      short-and long-term outcomes of robot-assisted thoraco- laparoscopic minimally invasive
      esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Patients will registered preoperatively. The planned
      sample size was 51. Preoperative endoscopic biopsy was performed in all patients to confirm
      the histological diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Staging workup included thorough history and
      physical examination, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and integrated
      positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Patients with histologically proven
      malignancy were candidates for surgical procedures. Operability criteria were defined
      according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. All patients were within
      the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I to III. In general, neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy was offered to patients with T2-3 or N1-2 disease. The primary endpoint in
      the first stage is the short-term postoperative complications, and that in the second stage
      is overall survival; patients continue to be followed up for this endpoint.
