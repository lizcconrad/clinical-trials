      This is a five-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the acute efficacy of oral
      brexpiprazole or placebo combined with intranasal ketamine added to ongoing, stable, and
      adequate antidepressant therapy (ADT) in the treatment of adults with MDD with TRD. Adequate
      ADT is defined as a therapeutically sufficient dose for a sufficient treatment period, which
      would be expected to be effective as listed in the MGH ATRQ.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at screening.

          2. Able to read, understand, and provide written, dated informed consent prior to
             screening. Participants will be deemed likely to comply with study protocol and
             communicate with study personnel about adverse events and other clinically important
             information.

          3. Diagnosed with MDD, single or recurrent, and currently experiencing a major depressive
             episode (MDE) of at least eight weeks in duration, prior to screening, according to
             the criteria defined in the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
             Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The diagnosis of MDD will be made by a site psychiatrist and
             supported by the SCID-5. The diagnosis will be confirmed by remote, independent raters
             from the MGH CTNI (Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Trials Network and
             Institute) with a SAFER interview.

          4. Has a history of treatment resistant depression (TRD) during the current MDE, as
             assessed by the investigator and remote centralized rater using the MGH ATRQ. TRD is
             defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than 50% improvement
             of depression symptoms), as perceived by the participant, to at least 2 &quot;treatment
             courses&quot; during the current episode of a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant therapy
             (ADT) of at least 8 weeks duration (including the current ADT). The adequacy of dose
             and duration of the antidepressant therapy will be determined as per the MGH ATRQ
             criteria. The TRD status will be confirmed by remote, independent raters from the MGH
             CTNI who will administer the MGH ATRQ, via teleconference, between the screening visit
             and the baseline visit. Participants must currently be on a stable (for at least 4
             weeks) and adequate (according to the MGH ATRQ) dose of ongoing antidepressant therapy
             (any antidepressant therapy, with the exception of MAOIs), of which total duration
             must be at least 8 weeks.

          5. Meet the threshold on the total MADRS score of &gt;20 at both the screen visit and the
             baseline visit (Day -7/-28 and Day 0), and as confirmed by the remote centralized MGH
             CTNI rater between the screen visit and the baseline visit.

          6. In good general health, as ascertained by medical history, physical examination (PE)
             (including measurement of supine and standing vital signs), clinical laboratory
             evaluations, and ECG.

          7. If female, a status of non-childbearing potential or use of an acceptable form of
             birth control per the following specific criteria:

               -  Non-childbearing potential (e.g., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
                  i.e., permanently sterilized (status post hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
                  ligation), or is post-menopausal with her last menses at least one year prior to
                  screening); or

               -  Childbearing potential, and meets the following criteria:

                    -  Childbearing potential, including women using any form of hormonal birth
                       control, on hormone replacement therapy started prior to 12 months of
                       amenorrhea, using an intrauterine device (IUD), having a monogamous
                       relationship with a partner who has had a vasectomy, or is sexually
                       abstinent.

                    -  Negative urinary pregnancy test at screening, confirmed by a negative
                       urinary pregnancy test at randomization prior to receiving study treatment.

                    -  Willing and able to continuously use one of the following methods of birth
                       control during the course of the study, defined as those which result in a
                       low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and
                       correctly: implants, injectable or patch hormonal contraception, oral
                       contraceptives, IUD, double-barrier contraception, sexual abstinence. The
                       form of birth control will be documented at screening and baseline.

          8. Body mass index between 18-35 kg/m2.

          9. Concurrent psychotherapy will be allowed if the type (e.g., supportive, cognitive
             behavioral, insight-oriented, et al.) and frequency (e.g., weekly or monthly) of the
             therapy has been stable for at least three months prior to screening and if the type
             and frequency of the therapy is expected to remain stable during the course of the
             subject's participation in the study.

         10. Concurrent hypnotic therapy (e.g., with zolpidem, zaleplon, melatonin, benzodiazepines
             or trazodone) will be allowed if the therapy has been stable for at least 4 weeks
             prior to screening and if it is expected to remain stable during the course of the
             subject's participation in the study. Patients can also continue treatment with
             benzodiazepines used for anxiety if therapy has been stable for at least 4 weeks prior
             to screening and if it is expected to remain stable during the course of the subject's
             participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female of childbearing potential who is not willing to use one of the specified forms
             of birth control during the study.
