  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induces nausea and vomit for some large patients. But, some chemotherapy
      protocol has a high indices of the incidence as observed in a combination of Anthracycline
      and Cyclophosphamide (AC). To prevent this symptoms, some medication can be used as
      Ondansetron. By other hands, the traditional acupuncture on Chinese Medicine have been used a
      PC6 point to avoid nausea and vomit. More recently, a transcutaneous electric nerve
      stimulation (TENS) also has been used for this application. Our study will test the TENS
      applied on PC6 point with two different frequencies (high and low) to evaluated the nausea
      and vomit inhibition effects.

      We will enroll 84 women that being starts a chemotherapy protocol with a Anthracycline and
      Cyclophosphamide (AC) as a part of breast cancer treatment. All volunteers will be submitted
      a 30 minutes TENS prior to chemotherapy administration. Three different TENS treatment will
      be test: 1) placebo; 2) high frequency and 3) low frequency. The self-adhesive electrodes
      will be positioned in the same position for all different TENS treatment (opposite arm to the
      chemotherapy infusion). The eletctrodes will be positioned as follows: the first electrode at
      the PC6 point which is located proximal to the flexion fold of the wrist in the middle of the
      anterior face of the forearm, between the tendons of the long palmar and radial flexor
      muscles of the carpus and the second electrode at any point in the hand. After that, all
      volunteers will receipt a formulary to self-complete a nausea and vomit symptoms record
      during the next 24 hours. Number of incidence and magnitude of the symptoms will express the
      accumulated indices the occurrence and severity of the symptoms, as further describe in this
      protocol.

Patients will be included sequentially for convenience (according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria) and non-probabilistic.

    <time_frame>Cumulative index of nausea in the first 24 hours after an infusion of chemotherapy.</time_frame>
    <description>The 24-hour follow-up record of symptoms of nausea and vomiting will be performed using a form developed from the MASEM anti-emetic instrument (MAT), especially for the present study. This form includes a diary to record emetic events within 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy. Thus, we will evaluate: the cumulative index of nausea and vomiting over 24 hours after the infusion of the first cycle of high grade emetic chemotherapy.Participants will be instructed to fill out the instrument and take the questionnaire home, bringing it back to the investigators when they return to the outpatient clinic for another round of chemotherapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Intensity of the symptom of nausea within the first 24 hours after infusion of chemotherapy.</time_frame>
    <description>As for the intensity of nausea, a Visual Analog Scale will be used to help measure the intensity of each patient. The instrument will question the patient about the degree of nausea and it will provide an auto report with a note that can vary from 0 to 10, with note 0 representing absence of the symptom while note 10 represents the most intense sensation experienced by the patient . Participants will be instructed to fill out the instrument and take the questionnaire home, bringing it back to the investigators when they return to the outpatient clinic for another round of chemotherapy.</description>

    <measure>Severity of vomiting episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Severity of vomiting episodes within the first 24 hours after chemotherapy infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>The severity assessment of vomiting episodes includes a diary to record the number of episodes of vomiting, which may be small, medium or large. Thus, we will assess the severity of vomiting over 24 hours after the infusion of the first cycle of high grade emetic chemotherapy. Participants will be instructed to complete the instrument and take the questionnaire home, bringing it back to the investigators. When they return to the clinic for another round of chemotherapy.</description>

This form includes a diary to record emetic events within 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy. Thus, we will evaluate: the cumulative index of nausea and vomiting over 24 hours after the infusion of the first cycle of emetic high-grade chemotherapy, the volume of vomiting in each episode and the need for rescue antiemetics will also be recorded. Will be instructed to fill out the instrument and take the questionnaire home, bringing it back to the researchers when they return to the clinic for their second course of chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>At home and at the end of 24 hours, will be asked to fill in the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale where symptoms of pain, tiredness, drowsiness, appetite, nausea, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety and well-being will be evaluated, Based on the Brazilian Consensus on Nausea and Vomiting. It is a scale where the patient provides an auto-report with a note that can vary from 0 to 10, with note 0 representing absence of the symptom while note 10 represents the most intense sensation experienced by the patient.</description>
