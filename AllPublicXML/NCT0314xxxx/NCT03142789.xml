  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we wish to investigate the analgesic effect of the administration of 0.2%
      ropivacaine for an adductor canal block as repeated boluses (20 ml every 8 hours) through a
      new suture-method catheter or a standard perineural catheter compared with a single bolus (20
      ml), in patients following primary total knee arthroplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the clinical effects of three different administration
      forms for an ACB: repeated intermittent boluses through a Certa catheter (CC) versus repeated
      boluses through a standard catheter (through the needle) (SC) versus a single bolus (SB). Our
      dual hypothesis is that repeated boluses through a catheter (either Certa or standard
      catheter) reduces opioid consumption (primary outcome), as well as reduces pain scores,
      enhances ambulation and muscle strength compared with a single bolus, and that the Certa
      catheter is superior to a standard catheter.

Randomization will be based on a computer-generated block randomization list in a 1:1:1 ratio, block sizes of 9. A person, not otherwise involved in the study, will prepare the randomization list and keep it, locked away in a secure place. 2 sets of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque, code envelopes will be prepared by the same person.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>At the end of the study period all patients will have an US evaluation of the catheters (a sham evaluation in the SB group) by one of the unblinded investigators. 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.2% will be injected during real-time US visualization. Spread outside the canal will be noted. In case the patient has a displaced catheter repositioning will be attempted, whether repositioning is possible is noted on a separate CRF (Case Report Form). The following will be noted; is the orifice of the catheter visible (yes/no), does injection result in a spread in-side the adductor canal (yes/no), can the catheter be repositioned to obtain a spread inside the canal (yes/no).</description>
