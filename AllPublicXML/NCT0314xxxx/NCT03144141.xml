  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm delivery accounts for about 10% of deliveries in France. Prematurity is the leading
      cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in economically developed countries. Despite the
      development of therapeutics and paraclinic examinations, this rate of preterm delivery
      remains stable or even increases. The use of medically assisted procreation techniques alone
      can not explain this rate.

      The analysis of the electrical activity of the uterus (electrohysterograms) is a promising
      technique for early diagnosis of the risk of premature delivery, allowing better management
      of the patients. This study is part of a European theme to study risk factors for the
      prevention of prematurity.
