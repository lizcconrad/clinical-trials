    <textblock>
      This is a phase II Randomized comparison clinical trial of PD-1 inhabitor activated CIK armed
      with anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for advanced liver cancer. And the aim of this
      research is to study the clinical efficacy and safety of PD-1 activated CIK armed with
      anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody for liver cancer.

      Primary hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in our country,
      ranking fourth in all malignant tumors and third in mortality.Immunetherapy is considered to
      be one of the most promising means of human against cancer. This is a phase II clinical trial
      of single-center, randomized (1:1of targeted activation CIK and traditional CIK therapy
      )comparison clinical trial of PD-1 inhabitor activated CIK armed with anti-CD3-MUC1
      bispecific antibody for advanced liver cancer. The investigators plan to recruit for 30 pairs
      of (60 cases) patients with advanced liver cancer, one of the two group will receive
      treatment of activated CIK,and the other receive mixed liquor of activated CIK and
      anti-CD3-MUC1 bispecific antibody. The result of this study was statistic and analysed with
      the record of Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors(RECIST1.1) evaluation standard.
