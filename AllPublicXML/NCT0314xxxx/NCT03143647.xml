  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium has built up the reputation of a 'natural calcium antagonist'. However, the exact
      effect of magnesium on coagulation and more specifically on platelet function is still
      disputed. An important discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro studies exists. Magnesium has
      thus been reported to antagonize platelets in some studies, and to stimulate platelets in
      other studies. Current evidence seems to point in the direction of a general antagonization
      of aggregation and coagulation.

      Intravenous magnesium is often administered in pre-eclampsia as seizure prophylaxis.
      Therapeutic regimens usually consist of an intravenously administered loading dose (2-3
      grams) and a maintenance infusion, targeting a plasma level of 2-3 mmol/L. Therapeutic drug
      monitoring is needed, as magnesium toxicity is an important concern.

    <description>One heparin tube (4ml) and one hirudin tube (4ml) blood sample will be collected through standard venipuncture. After applying a tourniquet with moderate pressure around the arm of the patient's choice, skin will be disinfected over a suitable vein in the elbow or fore-arm. A hirudin and a heparin tube will be filled with venous blood through a single puncture with a 22 Ga needle (manufacturer, location). After release of the tourniquet, bleeding will be stopped by applying local pressure for 5 minutes with a sterile gauze.</description>
