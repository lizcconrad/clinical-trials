  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some wounds are very slow to heal. Keeping moisture at the right level in a wound is very
      important, so wounds are almost always kept covered while they are healing. There are many
      different dressings that can be used to cover a wound. These dressings have different
      capabilities in handling the fluid that comes out of a wound. Some dressings can only be worn
      for a few days, while others may be worn up to 7 days. Dressings with short wear times may
      require more visits to the doctor's office for changes, while dressings with a longer wear
      time may mean fewer visits to doctor's office.

      Allevyn Life Non-Bordered is a new 4 layer dressing intended to cover wounds that have
      moderate to heavy fluid secretion. Allevyn Life Non-Bordered can be left on a wound for up to
      7 days.

      This study will evaluate subject satisfaction with the dressing when used on a wound.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. The subject must provide informed consent to participate in the study; see Section
             9.1.

          2. The subject must be eighteen (18) years of age or older.

          3. The subject must be willing and able to make all required study visits.

          4. The subject must be able to follow instructions and be deemed capable of completing
             the CWIS questionnaire.

          5. The subject must present with a chronic (â‰¥ 4 weeks duration) ulcer which meets all of
             the following criteria:

               1. The ulcer is classified as either:

                    -  a pressure ulcer

                    -  a non-ischemic diabetic foot ulcer

                    -  a leg ulcer (arterial/mixed etiology leg ulcers or venous leg ulcers
                       requiring compression therapy)

               2. The ulcer is, in the opinion of the Investigator, moderate to highly exuding.

               3. The ulcer would, in the opinion of the Investigator, benefit from a protective
                  dressing.

               4. The ulcer is not infected based on clinical signs/symptoms.

          6. A subject with a DFU must have an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.7 or greater, as
             measured within 30 days of the Screening Visit.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the ALLEVYN LIFE Non-Bordered,
             comparator, ancillary products, or their components.

          2. Participation in the treatment period of another clinical trial within 30 days of
             Visit 1 or planned participation overlapping with this study.

          3. The subject's reference ulcer is being treated with a topical antimicrobial dressing.

          4. Subjects with skin features (e.g. tattoos, skin color, pre-existing scarring) which,
             in the opinion of the Investigator, could interfere with the study assessments.

          5. Subjects who have participated previously in this clinical trial.

          6. Subjects with a history of poor compliance with medical treatment.

          7. Subjects with a medical or physical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude safe subject participation in the study.
