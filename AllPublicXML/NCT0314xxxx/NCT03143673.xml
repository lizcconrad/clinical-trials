      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of the study device and study device
      performance in patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis who are considered to be high
      risk for open surgical repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single arm, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, and open trial, up to 5 years
      follow-up with the Symetis ACURATE TA™ which is an aortic bioprosthesis for minimal invasive
      implantation vie transapical access to treat patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
      where conventional aortic valve replacement (AVR) via open heart surgery is considered to be
      associated with high surgical risk for evaluating safety and performance of the implantation
      and safety at 30-D follow-up.
