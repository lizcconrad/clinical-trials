  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to describe the evolution of hypodopaminergic syndrome in
      patients with Parkinson's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients to be included have been clinically described in the early phase of their
      disease, before instauration of dopaminergic treatment, in the context of a former study
      (&quot;Non Motor Aspects in De Novo Parkinson's Disease (Honeymoon) NCT02786667&quot;) between june
      2012 and june 2016.

      3 to 5 years after this study, those patients who started dopaminergic treatment will be
      evaluated again.

      The objective of this study, which takes place 3 to 5 year after the initial evaluation, is
      to measure the evolution of apathy and other symptoms of the hypodopaminergic syndrome.

      Secondary objectives are the evolution of other parameters including pain, personality and
      behavior. All parameters measured have been determined of each patient in the Honeymoon
      study.

    <description>Evolution of hypodopaminergic symptoms in Patients with Parkinson's disease under dopaminergic treatment. Hypodopaminergic symptoms are evaluated with different scales: ECMP (behavioral evaluation in Parkinsons's disease) for depression and anxiety, STAI (State-trait-anxiety inventory, self-assessment-questionnaire for anxiety, BDI (Beck depression inventory) for depression, PFS-16 (Piper Fatigue Sale) for fatigue. Hypodopaminergia is the expressed as the sum of its symptoms.</description>
