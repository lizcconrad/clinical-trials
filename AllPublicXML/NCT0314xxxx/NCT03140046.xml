  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irregular astigmatism is one of the most serious and frequent complications of corneal
      refractive surgery and one of the worst sequelae of other forms of corneal surgery . It is
      also considered as one of common, serious complications of corneal injuries .

      Spectacle correction is usually not useful in the correction of corneal irregular
      astigmatism. Contact lenses represent a good alternative, but their adaptation and stability
      are limited by the irregular corneal surface and patient discomfort.

      In recent years, advancements in laser technology have offered better tools for dealing with
      irregular astigmatism with finding new surgical methods to improve corneal regularity for the
      correction of irregular astigmatism.

      Topography-linked excimer laser is a potentially effective technique in the treatment of
      irregular astigmatism after keratoplasty . In fact, customized ablation was shown to be an
      effective means of treatment of irregular astigmatism due to different etiologies Such as
      corneal Injuries , scar , or postoperative.

      Some of the theoretical advantages of topography-driven photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) are
      a better astigmatic correction, the possibility of correcting irregular astigmatism, and a
      smaller ablation volume compared with standard treatments, resulting in better visual
      performance.

      Aim of the work To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and predictability of topography-guided
      photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) to improve refractive status of patient with irregular
      Cornea.
