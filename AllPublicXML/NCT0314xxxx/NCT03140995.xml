  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is important for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Sleep
      requirements for adults should be on a 'sleep needs spectrum' of between 7 to 9 hours per
      day. Poor sleep is a common complaint among people with RA, which may have an effect on their
      activity levels and well-being. There is evidence that physical activity and exercise can
      improve sleep quality and disturbances in other chronic disease populations therefore,
      examining how same affects sleep in RA is important.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is an important aspect in maintaining the body's circadian rhythm. In general getting
      fewer than 5 hours sleep per day has been associated with cardiovascular problems, diabetes
      and obesity and can also be linked to depression and anxiety. Poor sleep is a common
      complaint among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with disturbed sleep and fatigue known
      to affect up to 70% in this population. Poor sleep quality may contribute to the feelings of
      pain, fatigue and poor psychological well-being which in turn may further deteriorate
      functional ability and reduced activity.

      It is known that exercise improves a person's psychological state which can also be an
      additional factor in improving or indeed disrupting quality of sleep. Exercise has been
      identified as an important part of the nonpharmacological management of poor sleep and in
      improving sleep quality however, people with RA were previously cautioned about undertaking
      exercise. Therefore, changes in sleep quality during exercise intervention should be
      evaluated so that society can understand more the potential for long-term changes in overall
      health status, in people who have RA. Indeed the intensity level of the activity in people
      with RA may be of additional importance.

    <description>The walking programme will consist of a total of 21 aerobic walking sessions, with 1 per week being supervised by a trained physiotherapist, spread over a maximum of eight weeks (2-3 times/week). During the first 4 weeks the intention is to increase frequency and the final 4 weeks the intensity, using the Borg Rate of Perceived exertion 6-20 or distance from 2km to 6km. The participants will attend the University of Limerick for a final assessment at week 9.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigating team only will have access to the patient's names and/or identifying factors for participants at the site and University of Limerick (UL) researchers will have access to the full data set from the single site. Participants will be allocated a study code. Thereafter It is anticipated that the results will be used in presentations to conferences such as European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Additionally papers will be prepared for submission to peer reviewed journals, through Arthritis Ireland and the UL Research office. Results will also be made available at aggregate level to Consultant Rheumatologists Dr. Alexander Fraser and Dr. Joe Devlin, Department of Rheumatology, University Hospitals Limerick. Results will be shared via supplementary material thereafter.</ipd_description>
