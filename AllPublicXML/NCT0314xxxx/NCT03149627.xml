  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to recruit a random and representative sample of individuals
      within several Zambian communities for markers of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and to characterize
      chronic HBV infection and indications for treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Zambian Ministry of Health (MoH) considers viral hepatitis a significant public health
      threat; however, there are limited representative data on HBV burden, risk factors, clinical
      significance, and interaction with co-infections and co-morbidities that are common in
      Zambia. In collaboration with the Central Statistical Office, MoH, and Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention, the Zambia Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment (ZAMPHIA) will be
      testing a representative sample of Zambians across all 10 provinces for HBV infection. This
      is an important first step toward understanding the burden of disease and its distribution
      across the country. The goal of this study is to generate further information for consumption
      by local and regional health policymakers. The Investigators will research the epidemiologic
      risk factors for lifetime and current HBV infection, characterize clinical features of
      chronic HIV in Zambia, and describe key virological, serological, and comorbid factors that
      are critical to developing the best policies for HBV control in Zambia.

The Investigators will categorize patients as 'unhealthy drinkers' if the AUDIT-C score is &gt;3 for men and &gt;2 for women. The Investigators will also assess hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, defined by grade 2 or grade 3 periportal liver fibrosis on abdominal ultrasound. The Investigators will use bivariable and multivariable regression to compare liver fibrosis markers by AUDIT-C score (non/moderate drinkers versus unhealthy drinkers).</description>

      Part 1: The Investigators will test for active HBV infection using a rapid point-of-care
      HBsAg test. In addition, as a service to clients who have not had an HIV test in the past
      year (as recommended by Ministry of Health), for 20% of participants (selected randomly at
      household level), the Investigators will also collect a dried blood spot using finger prick
      method to perform HBcAb test, an epidemiologic test for lifetime exposure to HBV.

      Part 2: Participants will have physical examination, a liver ultrasound, transient
      elastography (TE), and blood will be collected for HBV viral load and other markers.
