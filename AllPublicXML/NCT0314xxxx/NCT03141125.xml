      inflammation, immunological response and fibrosis: A Randomized Clinical Placebo
      ControlledTrial with a prospective cohort study on scleroderma outpatient clinic in Cipto

      Background.

      Scleroderma is a systemic autoimmune disease that can not be cured, the progression of the
      disease still difficult to prevent and lead to increased morbidity and mortality.
      Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as standard immunosuppressant drugs to
      reduce, eliminate, inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in scleroderma patient is still less
      effective.

      Objectives.

      To evaluate the effect of ethanol extract of Physalis angulate Linn to reduce skin fibrosis
      based on MRSS, ESR, BAFF, sCD40L, and P1NP in scleroderma patients with standard therapy

      Methods.

      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial on scleroderma patients with
      standard therapy, who admitted to Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital Jakarta and Hasan Sadikin
      Hospital Bandung, from January 2016 to July 2017.

      Patients must be controlled every month until three months for follow up. Subjects were
      divided into two parallel group, one of intervention group, and one of placebo group
