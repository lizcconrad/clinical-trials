  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effects of consuming either 3 eggs per day as
      compared to a daily choline supplement (choline bitartrate, 397.5 mg choline/day) on plasma
      concentrations of High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), trimethylamine N-oxide
      (TMAO), and other biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk in young, healthy individuals.
      The goal is to determine if choline given as phosphatidylcholine (eggs) will lead to a
      different TMAO response when compared to choline in free supplemental form.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological data in short term studies, suggests that egg intake does not increase risk
      for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In fact, eggs are a great source of phospholipids
      (phosphatidylcholine) where choline has many metabolic roles, specially in lipid metabolism
      and cell membrane structure. Choline is present in the diet as free choline, which is
      absorbed in the small intestines, or choline esters, which is absorbed intact primarily
      through the lymphatic system. In addition, recent evidence suggests that the choline found in
      eggs may be metabolized by intestinal microbes into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a compound
      that may increase the risk for CVD. However, it is not known to what extent egg intake may
      contribute to plasma TMAO concentrations.

      Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the impacts of daily intake of 3 eggs
      versus a choline supplement on plasma TMAO as well as other biomarkers for CVD risk, with the
      goal of determining if the same amount of choline given as phosphatidylcholine from eggs will
      increase plasma choline levels without a concomitant increase in plasma TMAO, such that CVD
      risk is not negatively impacted.

    <description>Using plasma form each participant, an automated spectrophotometer is able to analyze at once plasma lipids [total colesterol, triglycerides, HDL (mg/dL)], glucose (mg/dL), CRP (mg/dL, and liver enzymes [alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (U/L)].</description>

    <measure>Effects of Intervention on Gene Expression using RT-PCR</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>PBMC will be isolated from whole blood. RNA will be isolated from these cells, and then cDNA will be synthesized using a specific kit. Finally a RT-PCR will be used to analyze the expression of genes, such as: GAPDH, HMG-CoA reductase, LDL-r, CD36, SRA, FMO3, SRB1, PPAR-gama. All results will be presented based on house keeping gene GAPDH.</description>
