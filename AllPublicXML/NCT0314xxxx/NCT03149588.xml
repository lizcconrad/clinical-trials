  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane and propofol are the most popular drug choices for maintenance of general
      anaesthesia for caesarean section. However, effects of these two anesthetics on maternal and
      fetal outcomes after caesarean section haven't been compared directly. The aim of this study
      is to compare the effects of sevoflurane and propofol as maintenance of general anesthesia,
      and to try to determine which anesthetic is better for maternal and fetal outcomes after
      caesarean section.

    <textblock>
      General anaesthesia is mostly performed for emergency grade 1 caesarean section and due to a
      lack of time to apply a neuraxial anaesthesia technique. Rapid sequence induction using
      propofol and rocuronium should become the standard for general anaesthesia in the obstetric
      patient. Both sevoflurane and propofol are considered to be appropriate for the maintenance
      of general anaesthesia during caesarean section. However, effects of these two anesthetics on
      maternal and fetal outcomes after caesarean section haven't been compared directly in the
      past. And for most anaesthesiologists, the clinical experience with general anaesthesia for
      caesarean section is very low. This study is to compare the effects of sevoflurane and
      propofol as maintenance of general anesthesia.
