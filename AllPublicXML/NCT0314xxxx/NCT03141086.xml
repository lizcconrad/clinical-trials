  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate that LML134 can increase wakefulness
      compared to placebo in patients with shift work disorder (SWD) measured by objective and
      subjective endpoints of wakefulness, i.e. the sleep latency in the multiple sleep latency
      test (MSLT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), respectively. Safety and PK of LML134
      will also be evaluated. In addition, novel methodologies to measure wakefulness and sleep
      will also be tested and compared to gold standard methods like the MSLT and polysomnography
      (PSG). The aim of such comparisons is to evaluate the usefulness of the new technologies in
      clinical studies and provide preliminary validation data.

      This is a randomized, subject and investigator-blinded, placebo controlled, crossover,
      multi-center Proof of Concept (PoC) study with in-house simulated laboratory night shifts in
      patients with SWD. This non-confirmatory study will include two treatment arms: LML134 and
      placebo. After a screening period, the treatment phase of the study will consist of two
      overnight stays in a sleep lab in each of two treatment periods, with a minimum one week
      wash-out in between.

          -  Male and female subjects18 to 65 years of age included.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of SWD according to ICSD-3 criteria at Screening.

          -  Subjects who are at least moderately ill with respect to sleepiness on work nights,
             including commute to and from work, as assessed by the Clinical Global
             Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S, score ≥4) at Screening.

          -  Subjects must work 5 or more night shifts per month, and 2 or more shifts must occur
             on consecutive nights, with 6 or more hours worked between 10 pm and 8 am, as
             confirmed by subject at Screening.

          -  Subjects must have mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on nighttime MSLT at Screening.

          -  Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg at Screening to participate in the study, and must
             have a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 - 35 kg/m2. BMI = Body weight (kg)
             / [Height (m)]2

        Exclusion Criteria:

             (not more than 10 cigarettes per day) who are not willing to, or in their own or the
             investigators opinion are not able to refrain from tobacco/nicotine use for at least
             12 hours without nicotine craving or other withdrawal symptoms

          -  Subjects for whom it is not safe to discontinue or who are unwilling to discontinue
             use of modafinil, hypnotics, and antihistamines for the periods specified in the

          -  Heavy caffeine consumers, i.e. subjects who consume greater than 850 mg of caffeine
             per day (approximate equivalent of three tall cups of Starbucks coffee) in coffee,
             tea, or other caffeine-containing drinks.

          -  Subjects who have high risk of obstructive sleep apnea, indicated by score of 5 or
             more on the STOP-BANG questionnaire.

          -  Presence of any sleep disorder other than SWD, as confirmed by PSG at screening.
