    <textblock>
      Study to accumulate post-market clinical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of the
      Sophono Alpha 2 and Alpha 2 MPO systems in subjects diagnosed with conductive hearing loss,
      single-sided deafness and mixed hearing loss who currently have or have had the Sophono
      implant.

    <description>The Sophono Bone Conduction Hearing Systems are a family of sound processors and accessories that operate on the principle of BC of sound vibrations. The Sophono Bone Conduction Hearing Systems transmits audio vibrations through the skin into the bone where sound is sensed by the inner ear/cochlea.
The Sophono Sound Processor is magnetically attracted to the Magnetic Implant and Magnetic Spacer. The Magnetic Implant, which is secured to the skull bone, affixes the Magnetic Spacer to the head transcutaneously through magnetic attraction forces, and the Sound Processor is magnetically affixed to the Magnetic Spacer. Vibration from the Sound Processor is transduced through the Magnetic Spacer to the Magnetic Implant and through the bone to the inner ear.</description>

        The subject population for this study includes male and female patients 5 years of age and
        older who have received the Sophono implant. Subjects will be recruited from Investigators
        who have implanted Sophono systems or from other non-investigator physician referrals.
        Subjects are expected to represent a population diagnosed with conductive hearing loss
        (CHL), single-sided deafness (SSD), and mixed hearing loss (HL).
