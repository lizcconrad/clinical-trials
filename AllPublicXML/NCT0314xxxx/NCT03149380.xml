    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of an online educational course on Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      prevention, treatment and caregiving.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Universe (www.AlzU.org) was created for family members of people with AD, people
      with mild cognitive impairment due to AD and mild AD, as well as AD caregivers and healthcare
      providers. The website provides three evidence-based courses with interactive lessons and
      activities that have been shown to increase knowledge about AD, willingness to participate in
      an AD prevention clinical trial, and intent to make specific lifestyle changes in effort to
      reduce AD risk. AlzU.org also includes online cognitive assessment measures that are
      accessible via web and mobile app.
