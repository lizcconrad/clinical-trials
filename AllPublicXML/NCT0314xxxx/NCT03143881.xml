  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of a new education-based intervention on outcomes in un- and
      under-insured Heart Failure (HF) patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) for
      care. Intervention patients will receive personalized education regarding their condition,
      pre- and post-testing of their HF knowledge base, and ED standard of care during the
      enrollment (index) visit. Patients will then be contacted via telephone 30 days post-index
      visit for re-testing and reinforcement of previously learned material. Patients in the
      control group will receive ED standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, 12.8% of adults ages 19-64 in the United States lacked any form of health insurance.
      An even greater number fell under the umbrella of under-insured. Studies indicate that the
      un- and under-insured receive less preventive care, are diagnosed at more advanced disease
      stages, and have higher mortality rates than their insured counterparts, due to the lack of
      accessible primary care services. These issues are most readily evident in patients with
      chronic conditions. When a preventable, chronic condition worsens, these patients have no
      choice but to visit the ED to address their most immediate health concerns, leaving the
      underlying chronic problem untreated. HF is a particularly burdensome chronic problem for
      patients of all socioeconomic statuses and one of the leading causes of ED and hospital
      readmissions.

      Numerous educational efforts have been tested in an attempt to reduce HF readmissions but
      have met with mixed results. Consequently, HF patients are generally seen as refractory to
      educational and management strategies. The investigators propose here a new, targeted
      educational intervention designed to improve patient outcomes and readmission rates in un-
      and underinsured HF patients.
