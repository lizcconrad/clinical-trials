    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)- Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8-9 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported changes in the levels of pain as measured by the PROMIS Pain Interference Scale. PROMIS-PI scores provided substantial information across levels of pain. The scale for adults in the general population is available in both a 41 item long-form computer adaptive version and a 4 item short form which will be used in this study. Each item is based on experiences in the last seven days before administering the questionnaire. It uses a 5-point rating scale (1-&quot;not at all&quot; to 5-&quot;very much&quot;), with higher scores indicating more pain interference.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS-Sleep Disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24-26 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-Sleep Disturbance (PROMIS-SD) is used to asses self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth and restoration associated with sleep. The full PROMIS- SD includes 27 with each item is based on a 7-day recall period and assessed on a 5 level Likert-type scale. The 8 item short form will be used in this study, in which responses are scored 1 to 5 for each item. A higher score on 5 of the 8 items reflects a worse outcome, whereas a higher score on 3 items reflects an improved outcome; therefore, the directionality of the 8 item scores are first synchronized prior to calculation of the total raw score. To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question. For example, for the adult 8-item form, the lowest possible raw score is 8; the highest possible raw score is 40. PROMIS scores are presented as T-scores. Higher T-scores represent more of the concept being measured (sleep disturbance).</description>

    <measure>Perinatal Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Questionnaire - Modified (PPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12-14 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The Perinatal Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Questionnaire (PPQ) is a 14-item measure assessing post-traumatic symptoms related to the childbirth experience, including intrusiveness or re-experiencing, avoidance behaviors and hyperarousal or numbing of responsiveness. The PPQ also contains one item pertaining to feelings of guilt. Response options were modiﬁed from the original dichotomous scale to a ﬁve-level likert scale (scored 0 to 4). Mothers were instructed to provide responses that reﬂected their experience during the targeted time frame (4 to18 months postpartum). The total possible score on the modiﬁed PPQ ranged from 0 to 56. A score of 19 or higher on the PPQ indicates clinically significant distress that merits referral of the mother to a mental health care professional.</description>

    <measure>Neonatal Breastfeeding Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5-9 days postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The questions used to assess breastfeeding behavior immediately post-delivery are adapted from Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II). The Neonatal Questionnaire was sent to the mother when her infant is approximately 3 weeks old. This questionnaire examined factors that commonly occur near the time of the birth and that affect infant feeding choices. This study will use 3 of their face valid questions to assess if the new mother has tried to breastfeed, if so, how long it took for her milk to produce, and if she is still breastfeeding.</description>
