    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that propofol, when used in general anesthesia (GA) influence patient's
      stress status and consequently affect stress response parameters. Hence, the objective of the
      presented research is to assess whether the propofol has anti-stress effect or not in
      patients undergoing surgeries that require GA and classified as The American Society of
      Anesthesiologists physical status 1 (ASA PS1)

      -  Forty patients will be divided into two groups of patients (n=20 each), where in the
           first group anesthesia induction will be with propofol as a single agent, while patients
           in the second group will be anesthetized by propofol/fentanyl and the depth of
           anesthesia will be determined by BIS score and will be kept at 40-60.

        -  In both groups, blood will be withdrawn to assess the possible effect of these
           medications on stress by measuring the following parameters:

      I- Hemodynamic indicators II- Catecholamines . III- Fasting blood glucose IV- Insulin level
      V- Cortisol VI- Vasopressin

      VII- Cytokines:
