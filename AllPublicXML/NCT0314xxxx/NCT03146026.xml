  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of 12 weeks of combined exercise training
      (CET) on arterial stiffness, endothelial function, inflammatory markers, insulin resistance,
      and body composition in obese adolescent girls. Thirty obese adolescent girls participated in
      this study. The girls were randomly divided into CET group (n=15) and control group (n=15).
      The CET group performed concurrent resistance training followed by aerobic training at 40-70%
      of the heart rate reserves (HRR) 3 days/week for 12 weeks. Plasma nitric oxide, endothelin-1,
      C-reactive protein, arterial stiffness, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
      (HOMA-IR), glucose, insulin, and the adiponectin/leptin ratio were measured before and after
      the 12-weeks study.

    <description>The CET program was performed for 60 minutes with 5 minutes of warm-up and cool-down per day, 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Combined exercise consisted of 20 minutes of various resistant band exercises (Upper body: seated rows, biceps curl, shoulder flexion, elbow flexion, chest press; Lower body: hip flexion, hip extension, calf raise, leg press, squat) and 30 minutes of treadmill walking. The warm-up and cool down consisted of static stretching. Intensity of exercise was gradually increased from 40-50% heart rate reserve (HRR) in weeks 1-4, and to 60-70% HRR in weeks 9-12. Each training session was fully supervised by the researchers. Every subject wore a heart rate monitor during the whole training session so as to maintain the correct training intensity.</description>
