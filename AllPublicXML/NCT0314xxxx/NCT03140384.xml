  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, drug-induced abortion is allowed up to 9SA, after which the surgical route is
      preferred. Mifepristone 600mg is used 36-48 hours before the introduction of Misoprostol.
      This is recommended orally at a dose of 400 μg. There are currently several studies on the
      subject, including a meta-analysis of the 2011 Cochrane Database, but doses, routes of
      administration and gestational age differ in all studies. Currently, HAS recommends the
      vaginal route at the dose of 800μg for stopped pregnancies. It is therefore necessary to
      compare the different routes of administration of Misoprostol at the same dose to allow to
      change our French recommendations on the medicinal abortion and perhaps also to recommend the
      vaginal route in this indication.
