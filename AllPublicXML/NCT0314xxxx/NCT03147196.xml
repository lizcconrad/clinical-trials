    <textblock>
      This phase II pilot trial studies how well bicalutamide and raloxifene hydrochloride work in
      treating patients with prostate cancer undergoing surgery. Antihormone therapy, such as
      bicalutamide and raloxifene hydrochloride, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the
      body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect and interrogate samples in patients with prostate cancer that were diagnosed
      with prostate cancer and are planned for radical prostatectomy at Mayo Clinic Arizona.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event profile and tolerance of therapy for 60 days of treatment
      prior to surgery.

      II. To assess change in stage and/or grade of cancer and prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      response to neoadjuvant treatment in patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate specific pathways and changes when comparing biopsy specimens to
      prostatectomy.

      II. To describe the quality of life of patients receiving hormonal therapy prior to radical
      prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive low dose raloxifene hydrochloride orally (PO) daily on days 1-30.
      Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive low dose bicalutamide PO daily on days 1-30. Treatment repeats every
      30 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive low dose raloxifene hydrochloride PO daily and low dose bicalutamide
      PO on days 1-30. Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients receive high dose raloxifene hydrochloride PO daily and high dose
      bicalutamide PO on days 1-30. Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <description>Proportion of patients who complete 60 days of treatment will be calculated as the number of who completed 60 days of treatment divided by the total number of evaluable patients. A confidence interval for this rate will be calculated based on properties of the binomial distribution. The proportion of patients who experience a particular event will be calculated as the total number who experienced the event of interest divided by the number of total evaluable patients, with appropriate confidence interval.</description>

    <measure>Change in specific pathways and biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous biomarker levels will be explored in a graphical manner including mean plots and plots of change and percent change from baseline and other summary measures. Any potential relationships between the baseline level or change in the level of each biomarker and clinical outcome will be further analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests or logistic regression methods, as appropriate. Association between a dichotomized biomarker and overall response will be assessed using a chi-squared test.</description>
