  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections are among the most prevalent microbial diseases and their financial
      burden on society is substantial. The use of bacteriophages against bacterial pathogens has
      gained over the last years a renewed interest, because of the continuing increase in
      antibiotic resistance worldwide. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy
      of intravesical bacteriophage treatment to normalize urine culture compared to intravesical
      placebo or standard antibiotic treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with urinary tract infections who are scheduled for transurethral resection
             of the prostate with urine culture (taken by mid-stream urine; or from the existing
             transurethral or suprapubic catheter) ≥104 colony forming units /mL of predefined
             uropathogens, including Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis,
             Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. and lower urinary
             tract symptoms such as urgency, frequency, dysuria, increased number of incontinence
             episodes

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fever &gt;38°C

          -  CRP &gt;100mg/L

          -  Acute prostatitis

          -  Concomitant fungal urinary tract infection

          -  Current antibiotic treatment or antibiotic treatment within the last 7 days
             (exceptions: subjects with an active catheter associated urinary tract infection who
             have received prior antibiotics may be enrolled provided a minimum of 48 hours has
             elapsed between the last dose of the prior antibiotic and the time of obtaining the
             baseline urine specimen. Subjects receiving current antibiotic prophylaxis for
             catheter associated urinary tract infection who present signs and symptoms consistent
             with an active new catheter associated infection may be enrolled provided all other
             eligibility criteria are met including obtaining a pre-treatment qualifying baseline
             urine culture)

          -  Any rapidly progressing disease or immediately life-threatening illness including but
             not limited to: acute hepatic failure, respiratory failure, and septic shock
