  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1B study of the efficacy of a topically-administered 7-amino acid peptide labeled
      with a near-infrared fluorophore Cy5 for detecting neoplastic areas of the colon is proposed.
      The study will test the efficacy of administering this agent (QRH-882260 Heptapeptide) to
      human subjects undergoing clinically-indicated colonoscopy for endoscopic resection of known
      colonic adenomas or for surveillance biopsies of known dysplasia in the setting of irritable
      bowel disease (IBD). Up to 120 evaluable subjects will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be recruited around scheduled standard of care procedures. The endoscopists
      performing the procedures are all endoscopists credentialed at the University of Michigan to
      do these procedures. Urine for dipstick pregnancy testing (if applicable) will be collected
      before the procedure, along with medical information. Vital signs are routinely monitored
      throughout the clinical procedure and are available in the electronic medical record. The
      endoscopy will proceed per the University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) standard of care.
      The endoscopist performing the clinical procedure will evaluate the potential risk (if any)
      for the subject to continue with the procedure or study. Five mL of the reconstituted
      QRH-882260 Heptapeptide (~100 Î¼M) will be sprayed onto the site of interest through a
      catheter in the endoscope. Five minutes after QRH-882260 Heptapeptide application, the
      unbound peptide will be washed off using the endogator irrigator and the residual liquid will
      be suctioned. Pictures with white-light and fluorescence will be taken with the scanning
      fiber based molecular imaging endoscopic probe inserted via the instrument channel of the
      standard endoscope before the QRH-882260 Heptapeptide application, immediately after
      application and then again after the QRH-882260 Heptapeptide will be washed off. The area of
      interest identified will be resected/biopsied per discretion of the endoscopist per clinical
      care. All specimens taken are for clinical care only (not research use) and will be sent for
      routine histology per UMHS standard of care.
