  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a major problem in the care of children in pediatric emergencies. Indeed, its relief
      rests on the oral communication of the young patient, who does not always able to it
      (difficult to verbalize, fear of the hospital, problem mental development ...). There is no
      way in which pain can be apprehended objectively, immediately and effectively. To advance our
      knowledge of this problem, several approaches have been studied as from functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), or from autonomic parameters.
      However, all these approaches have their limitations: although fMRI presents interesting
      performances, it allows only a retrospective analysis, and cannot adapt to the clinical
      context of the young patient for example. EEG-based approaches and autonomic parameters show
      interesting results but suffer from perfectible sensitivity to muscle activation for EEG
      whereas the vegetative parameters to stress. In this context, our working hypothesis
      considers that the search for markers of painful perception must be based on a
      neurophysiological approach, based on the combined analysis of the EEG and autonomic
      responses in real time. The aim of this work is to study (1) the cortical (EEG) and autonomic
      (cardiovascular, skin, pupillary) responses induced by sutures in children who can
      communicate their pain according to whether they cause pain or not.
