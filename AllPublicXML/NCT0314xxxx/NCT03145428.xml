  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of monocyte volume width distribution (MDW) is intended for use with adult
      patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), where a CBC with Differential has been
      ordered, as an aid in the early detection of patients with or developing sepsis. The study
      will establish the clinical performance of MDW for detection of sepsis in the ED.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective multi-center study to establish the clinical utility of the measurement of
      monocyte volume width distribution, a cell population parameter of the CBC-Differential, on
      the Beckman Coulter Unicel DxH analyzers. The study will validate the cut-off for the early
      detection of sepsis in an adult emergency room population where the standard of care included
      a CBC with Differential and will evaluate the diagnostic performance of the parameter.
