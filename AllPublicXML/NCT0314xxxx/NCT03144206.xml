        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females within the ages of 18-85

          2. Diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma that has been histologically confirmed by an approved
             reference pathologist

          3. Sarcoma of lower extremity location

          4. Treatment plan that includes neo-adjuvant radiation therapy followed by surgical
             resection

          5. Expected primary wound closure performed at the time at surgery

          6. Any disease stage

          7. Any tumor grade

          8. Any histologic subtype

          9. First or recurrent presentations

         10. No vascular invasion or resection/repair/reconstruction that results in decreased
             perfusion of the extremity

         11. No history of radiation therapy to the tumor and/or surgical area prior to the current
             treatment being studied

         12. Must be able to comply with follow up visits

         13. Must be able to provide own consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients under the age of 18, or over the age of 85.

          2. Treatment plan that doesn't include neo-adjuvant radiation and surgical excision

          3. Sarcoma location other than lower extremity

          4. History of radiation therapy to the tumor and/or surgical area prior to the current
             treatment being studied

          5. High dose steroid therapy (defined as &gt;5mg prednisone, or equivalent, daily)

          6. Active treatment with chemotherapy

          7. Inability of the patient to provide informed consent (i.e. dementia, cognitive
             impairment, non-English speakers)

          8. Plan for post operative radiation therapy

          9. Vascular invasion or resection/repair/reconstruction that results in decreased
             perfusion of the extremity

         10. Vascular disease resulting in clinically apparent compromise in blood flow to the
             treatment extremity (i.e. peripheral vascular disease with diminished pulses, venous
             insufficiency with clinical evidence of vascular congestion)

         11. Actively uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (documentation of history of DM with A1c&gt;8)

         12. Active deep vein thrombosis in the treatment extremity

         13. Inability to comply with follow up visits

         14. Pregnant females (women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test prior to enrollment)
