  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis is a common disease in Western countries. Traditional
      management includes inpatient administration of either oral or intravenous antibiotics with
      resumption of oral intake as symptoms improve. Recent literature has however questioned both
      inpatient and antibiotic treatment. Indeed, both inpatient and antibiotic treatment are
      associated with non-negligible risks to patients. The aim of this trial is to assess the
      feasibility of a randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether nonantibiotic
      treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe in the outpatient setting.

      treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe in the outpatient setting. It is designed
      as a pilot non-inferiority blinded randomized controlled trial. The estimated length of this
      pilot trial is 1 year. The target population is capable adults of who have a CT-diagnosed
      episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis who present to the Jewish General Hospital Emergency
      room.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome pertains to the feasibility of a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. The study group's main concern is that accrual will be impeded by the important change in clinical management that nonantibiotic treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis requires. Also, the study group is concerned that patients may be lost to follow-up. For these reasons, the primary outcome is the retention rate of patients from screening to the end of follow-up. The rate will be calculated according to (1) the proportion of participants screened but not randomized, and (2) the proportion of participants lost to follow-up.</description>

    <description>Treatment failure is defined as persistence, increase or recurrence of abdominal pain and/or fever, inflammatory bowel obstruction, need for radiological abscess drainage or immediate surgery due to complicated diverticulitis, need for hospital admission, and mortality during the first 60 days after discharge.</description>

          4. Confirmed affection of left colon, including descending and sigmoid colon

          5. Confirmed episode of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis on computed tomography (CT)
             scan defined as wall edema with or without fat stranding. Limited pericolic air with
             bubbles less than 5 mm in size, and less than 5cm from the colon wall, will be
             included as uncomplicated diverticulitis. Scan must be performed prior to enrollment
             and assessment for illegibility. The initial scan is not a study-specific procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CT scan shows complicated diverticulitis as defined by the presence of intraperitoneal
             free perforation (i.e. intraperitoneal contrast extravasation if intra-rectal contrast
             given, free air under diaphragms, disseminated intraperitoneal air), abscess,

             chronic liver disease, ongoing chemotherapy, chronic renal failure with hemodialysis,
             corticosteroid and immunosuppressive medication)

         12. Noncompliance/unreliability for return visits/lack of support system

         13. Failed outpatient treatment not previously included in study within last 30 days

         14. Cognitive, social or psychiatric impairment

         15. For patients aged 65 years or older, a Charlson Comorbidity Score ≥ 5 as calculated on
