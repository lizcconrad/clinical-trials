    <textblock>
      Many years ago, periodontal regenerative treatment has been done in Periodontics and Oral
      Medicine Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. However, there
      is still lacking of study about long-term result of periodontal regenerative treatment of
      intrabony defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beside, in the present, some materials for periodontal regenerative treatment are still
      expensive. Periodontists and patients have to plan together based on not only rationale of
      treatment but also cost and effectiveness. Thus the long-term result of treatment could be
      useful for the decision making.
