  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether
      the use of the COach2Quit application (app) reduces smoking more than brief advice for
      smoking cessation. The investigators hypothesize that real time biomarker feedback and
      messaging support from the COach2Quit app will lead to greater smoking cessation rates than
      brief anti-smoking advice alone. If effective, the COach2Quit app could be an easily
      accessible and cost-effective tool to help smokers quit. The findings from this trial could
      have implications for the delivery of future outpatient smoking cessation programs.

      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the efficacy of the novel
      COach2Quit smartphone application by determining whether the use of this app reduces smoking
      more than brief anti-smoking advice alone. This will be a two-arm individually randomized
      trial and participants who are currently smoking will be assigned 1:1 to either study arm.
      Smoking behavior will be measured through self-report at baseline, 2-week and 1-month follow
      up visits. Smoking behavior will also be verified by 2 biomarker measurements: carbon
      monoxide breath test and urine cotinine, collected at baseline, 2-week and 1-month follow-up
      visits. In addition, participants will receive weekly follow-up calls. The primary outcome
      will be smoking cessation at the 1-month follow-up visit.

This is a simple smoking cessation counseling strategy with 5 discrete components: (1) Ask about smoking at every opportunity; (2) Advise the patient to quit smoking; (3) Assess readiness to quit; (4) Assist the patient in quitting; and (5) Arrange follow-up.</description>
