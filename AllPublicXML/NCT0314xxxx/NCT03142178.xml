      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study for the use of 3VM1001
      Cream, 2g three times daily, 3g three times daily, or 3g four times daily for the treatment
      of chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee compared to the inactive vehicle
      as a placebo.

      A maximum of 120 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will self-treat for 7 (+2) days, applied
      in the morning and at bed time.

      The active pharmaceutical ingredient is copper. The proposed doses in the study are less than
      2% of the upper limit of the RDA (0.9 mg/day, upper limit 10mg/day).

      Rescue medication is acetaminophen, up to ~2g daily (Up to six Tylenol Regular Strength
