  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of a protein in the brain known as tau
      using an imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT). Tau has been shown
      to build up in the brains of patients with injury to brain cells, including Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body disease (DLB) and Frontotemporal
      degeneration (FTD).

      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of a protein in the brain known as tau
      using an imaging procedure called Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT). Tau has been shown
      to build up in the brains of patients with injury to brain cells, including Alzheimer's
      disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease and Frontotemporal degeneration. [18F]T807
      (also known as 18F-AV- 1451) is a specialized radioactive PET tracer that sticks to the tau
      protein in the brain. In this study, researchers will use [18F]T807 to form images of tau
      binding in thebrain. [18F]T807 is an investigational or experimental imaging agent that has
      not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in brain imaging. In this
      study, researchers want to find out how accurate and useful [18F]T807 is in imaging patients
      who have problems with thinking, remembering, speech, and visual activities, and may be
      diagnosed with different types of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease
      and Frontotemporal degeneration. This study will help test how imaging measures may provide
      information that could be used to determine diagnosis for patients in the future. The results
      of the PET/CT scan will be compared with other information obtained for the study, including
      brain MRI, spinal fluid and cognitive test results.

    <description>experimental PET/CT scan of the brain. In this scan, imaging is done with specialized cameras that can pick up radiation signals given off by a radioactive tracer and determine where the signals come from.
The tracer used for this study is called [18]FT807 (also known as 18F-AV-1451). [18]FT807 is a specialized radioactive PET tracer used to detect the presence of tau proteins in the brain. [18]FT807 is an experimental tracer that has been studied in patients with known or suspected Alzheimer's disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBS/CBD). In this study, patients will have one (1) [18F]T807 PET/CT scan performed at the University of Pennsylvania. The [18F]T807 PET/CT scan will require up to 3 hours of time, including preparation. The scan will take place using PET/CT scanners in the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine or the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.</description>

        Eligible subjects will have a clinical diagnosis consistent with published criteria for
        AD/MCI (i.e. amnestic AD or amnestic/non-amnestic mild-cognitive impairment, PCA), FTLD
        (i.e. bvFTD, PPA, CBD, PSP, FTD-ALS) or DLB (i.e. PD, PDD, DLB).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants has been diagnosed with one of the following neurodegenerative diseases:
             FTD, Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), CBD, PSP, Mild Cognitive Impairement (MCI),
             Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), AD, PD, PDD, DLB, FTD-ALS and is co-enrolled in one
             of the following protocols 069801, 298201, 358500, 703940, 811040, 819586, 822691 and
             822926 for these conditions.

          3. MMSE &gt; 10 at screening visit.

          4. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures. If the subject is unable to provide informed consent,
             the subject's legal representative may consent on behalf of the subject but the
             subject will be asked to confirm assent.

          5. Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and imaging
             procedures.

          6. A brain MRI is required. If a brain MRI has been performed within 6 months prior to
             enrollment in this study in protocols above and of adequate quality that scan may be

             MRI either as a part of this study

             to study visits
