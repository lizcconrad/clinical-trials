      placebo in clopidogrel and aspirin loaded patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The very early benefit of ticagrelor in STEMI is co-mediated by adenosine cardioprotection
      maintaining/ improving myocardial microcirculatory function, as well as via platelet
      inhibition or possibly other pleiotropic effects.

      Ticagrelor increases circulating adenosine by reducing cellular re-uptake. Adenosine is a
      cardioprotective agent that utilizes cellular survival kinase pathways that may have
      beneficial effects on the microcirculation and myocardium in patients presenting with STEMI.
      Adenosine is currently used as a treatment for no-reflow and improves MVO post-STEMI when
      administered during PPCI. A recent study of healthy volunteers has confirmed that
      non-invasive coronary flow is augmented by ticagrelor and that this is mediated by adenosine.
      The Investigators propose that the very early beneficial effects of Ticagrelor in ACS may be
      adenosine mediated cardioprotection, rather than only due to an antiplatelet effect. This
      important research is original and a natural progression of the ticagrelor story. It expands
      the adenosine hypothesis and mode of action of ticagrelor and addresses a novel
      cardioprotective/ microcirculatory mechanism of action.
