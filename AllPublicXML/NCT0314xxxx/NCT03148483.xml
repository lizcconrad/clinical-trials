  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of maternal and child health remains a key issue in global health. Production
      and improved accessibility of healthy and nutrient-rich milk-based products could potentially
      tackle health and nutrition inequalities in low-income countries.

      This study will assess the acceptability of a multi-component intervention, including
      provision of calcium/vitamin-D fortified milk and periodontal therapy (PT), for improving
      maternal periodontal health and metabolic and inflammatory profiles. The IMPROVE trial is a
      feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) with parallel qualitative process evaluation.
      The target population is low-income, pregnant, Brazilian women, with periodontitis, who have
      not seen a dentist in the last 6 months. A series of focus group discussions and interviews
      with the target population will be conducted to identify key barriers and enablers to
      adoption and implementation of the intervention in prenatal clinics in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil.
      Participants will be allocated to 4 groups: 1) early PT (during pregnancy) plus fortified
      milk; 2) early PT plus plain milk; 3) delayed PT (after delivery) plus fortified milk; 4)
      delayed PT plus plain milk.

      The final results will contribute to the understanding of the significance of calcium and
      vitamin D for short and long-term health and the occurrence of diseases, as well as to inform
      the current global debate on vitamin-D supplementation and fortification policy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility (acceptability of study design, recruitment strategy, random allocation and data collection procedures)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline till 6-8 weeks' postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be evaluated using mixed-methods to explore intervention delivery, participants' acceptability, challenges and issues faced during the study, and recommended changes to the study design.
Focus groups discussions will be held prior to trial recruitment to discuss issues regarding recruitment strategy, study design and data collection. In addition, group discussions will be held throughout the study (2nd and 3rd trimester) to assess potential barriers and facilitators to the intervention and data collection. At the end of each participant's involvement in the study, the participant will be asked to complete an anonymous, acceptability questionnaire to gain insights about participant's reactions to research participation and how acceptable the participant found study requirements and assessments were.</description>
