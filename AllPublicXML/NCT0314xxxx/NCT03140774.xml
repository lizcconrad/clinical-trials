    <textblock>
      The Oxford University is undertaking a follow-on study to a Phase 1 study involving the two
      viral vectored Ebola vaccines Ad26-ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the persistence of the vaccine induced immune response at 24-30 and 36-42 months
      following primary vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), is caused by the viruses belonging to the genus Ebola virus.
      The disease occurs in sporadic outbreaks in the endemic zones of Africa and results in high
      mortality. During an outbreak, human to human to transmission occurs by contact with the body
      fluids of an infected individual. In the inter-endemic period the disease is zoonotically
      sustained in the environment. Prevention or control of future endemic outbreaks in the high
      risk areas of Africa will require effective preventative strategies including immunisation.

      The Phase 1 study with the multiple heterologous prime boost regimes of the Ad26-ZEBOV and
      the MVA-BN-Filo vaccines demonstrated a substantive immunogenicity and safety of the
      vaccines. A combined immune response of humoral and cellular immunity was observed in the
      study participants. Furthermore, persistence of the immune response was evident at one year
      following the primary vaccination. It is not known whether the immune response persists
      beyond this time point. The duration of the immunological response is important as it will
      inform the clinical utility of the vaccines and whether or not additional booster dosage will
      be required and if so, at what interval.

      In this study we will invite the 56 participants from the Phase 1 study at two time points:
      24 - 30 months and 36 - 42 months after receiving the primary vaccination. Following
      consenting and enrolment into the study, the participants will undergo a blood test. We will
      assess the humoral immunity by estimating the level of binding antibody to the Ebola virus
      envelope glycoprotein. Cellular immunity will be assessed by estimating the functional CD4+
      and the CD8+ T cells secreting the pro-inflammatory cytokines. We will undertake this
      assessment by intracellular staining of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and
      using flowcytometry technique to identify the positively stained cells. A second assessment
      of the cellular immunity will be carried out by an in-house ELISpot technique subject to
      availability of additional funding.
