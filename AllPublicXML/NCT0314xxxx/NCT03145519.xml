  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the
      safety and efficacy of the OptiVein IV Catheter in the pediatric population. The study
      hypothesis is that OptiVein IV Catheter use will be superior to the control in successful
      venous access after first attempt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OptiVein IV Catheter is a sterile single use disposable intravascular cannulation device
      that is modified from CE certified Vasofix Certo Catheter from B.Braun with the additional
      features of an optical fiber and modified flashplug. The OptiVein System also includes an
      electronic unit.

      The OptiVein Catheter shares a similar intended use and the same catheter components as the
      Vasofix Certo IV Catheter. Clinical data will be obtained to demonstrate that there is no
      change to the safety and efficacy profile due to the laser component of the OptiVein IV
      Catheter.

      A prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the
      safety and efficacy of the OptiVein IV Catheter in the pediatric population. The study
      hypothesis is that OptiVein IV Catheter use will be superior to the control in successful
      venous access after first attempt.

      Patients aged newborn to twelve (12) years requiring short-term use of an IV catheter to
      withdraw blood samples or to administer fluids or medications intravenously.

      Participating sites will follow routine practice guidelines regarding the personnel
      responsible for inserting the catheters for this study, known herein as &quot;operators.&quot;
      Operators must be professionally trained in IV catheter placement; educational background and
      level of experience of operator will be documented.

      All Operators selected for participation in the study will undergo training on the protocol,
      Good Clinical Practice and the assembly and use of the OptiVein IV Catheter and Vasofix Certo
      IV catheter prior to enrolling patients into the study.

      Randomization will be in a 1:1 fashion with assignment given by the electronic data capture
      (EDC) system.
