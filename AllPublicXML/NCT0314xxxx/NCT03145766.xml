  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, observer-blind, controlled, randomized, Phase II study was designed to
      evaluate different formulations of the Purified Vero Rabies Cell vaccine VRVg.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess different formulations of the modified formulation of VRVg (VRVg 2) to
      be tested in parallel to the initial VRVg formulation (VRVg 1) and Imovax rabies. Immune
      responses will be assessed at Day 14, Day 28, Day 42, and at Month 7. Safety events will also
      be reported.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        An individual must fulfill all of the following criteria in order to be eligible for trial
        enrollment:

          1. Aged 18 to &lt;65 years on the day of inclusion

          2. Informed consent form has been signed and dated

          3. Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all trial procedures

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI): 18.5 Kg/m2 ≤ BMI ≤ 30 Kg/m2 Exclusion Criteria:

        An individual fulfilling any of the following criteria is to be excluded from trial
        enrollment:

          1. Subject is pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using an
             effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to the
             first vaccination until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination. To be considered
             of non-childbearing potential, a female must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year,
             or surgically sterile.

          2. Participation at the time of study enrollment or, planned participation during the
             present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical
             device, or medical procedure

          3. Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks (28 days) preceding the first trial vaccination
             or planned receipt of any vaccine prior to Visit 6

          4. Previous vaccination against rabies (in pre- or post-exposure regimen) with either the
             trial vaccine or another vaccine

          5. Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months

          6. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of
             immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy,
             within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy
             (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months)

          7. At high risk for rabies infection during the trial (e.g., veterinarians and staff,
             animal handlers, rabies researchers, or any others whose activities may bring them
             into frequent contact with rabies virus or animals who have the rabies virus)

          8. Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine or HRIG components, or history
             of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine
             containing any of the same substances

          9. Self-reported thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular (IM) vaccination

         10. Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion,
             contraindicating intramuscular vaccination

         11. Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,
             or hospitalized involuntarily

         12. Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction

         13. Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might
             interfere with trial conduct or completion (e.g., cardiac disorders, renal disorders,
             auto immune disorders, diabetes, psychiatric disorders or chronic infection)

         14. Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4°F [≥ 38.0°C]). A
             prospective subject should not be included in the study until the condition has
             resolved or the febrile event has subsided

         15. Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member
             (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with
