    <textblock>
      Anesthesia-induced atelectasis is a well-known entity observed in approximately 68-100% of
      pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia. The collapse of dependent lung zones starts
      with anesthesia induction but can persist for hours or even days after surgery.

      Lung collapse is a pressure-dependent phenomenon. Each acinus has a critical closing
      pressure, i.e., the minimum transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) below that the acinus begins to
      collapse. While airway pressure is homogeneously distributed within all lung units, Pleural
      pressure increases along the vertical gravitational vector because of the lung's weight. As a
      consequence, the decreased Ptp in the dependent zones promotes collapse. This means that
      patients in the supine position suffer from increasing closing pressures in the ventral to
      dorsal direction.

      Alveolar recruitment maneuvers recruit collapsed alveoli, increase gas exchange, and improve
      arterial oxygenation.

      The investigators hypothesized that in children with anesthesia-induced atelectasis, postural
      changes have recruiting effects and improve lung aeration assessed by lung ultrasound.

      Compare lung aeration between two different lung recruitment strategies (recruitment
      maneuvers in supine position and recruitment maneuvers with postural changes of lateral
      decubitus with 10 cmH2O level of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during 180 seconds;
      in pediatric patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia using ultrasound imaging
      and a four-point-aeration score to assess the lung aeration.
