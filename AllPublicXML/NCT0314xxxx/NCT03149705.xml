  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is the first cause of acquired disability of the adult, the second cause of
      dementia and the third cause of death in the industrialized countries, what constitutes à
      major public health issue. Stroke is characterized by a cerebral parenchymal lesion due to an
      ischemic mechanism (85% of the cases) or hemorrhagic mechanism (15%). For a long time, the
      only approved treatment was the intravenous thrombolysis (rt-PA). Recently, thrombectomy has
      proven its superiority in this pathology.

      Cohorts of patients with stroke are rare but can be very valuable by their clinical,
      laboratory and imaging well documented. They are the source of new hypotheses for research or
      interventions as well as the quality of care assessment tool.

      The main objective of this project is to identify new markers: biological and imaging,
      treatment response and prognosis after ischemic stroke.

      Secondary objectives of the HIBISCUS-STROKE cohort are to establish a clinical database,
      completed by biological samples and by imaging data that can be used in the following areas:

        -  Descriptive epidemiology of ischemic stroke and cerebral reperfusion,

        -  Pharmacoepidemiology and treatments observatory: safety, efficacy, indication of
           treatment in real life, costs

        -  Assessment of the long-term effect of the treatment on the occurrence of disability,
           stroke recurrence and death,

        -  Quality of life and personal, familial, professional and social consequences of stroke,

        -  Research of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers,

        -  Research projects.

      In usual care of patients admitted for ischemic STROKE at Pierre Wertheimer Hospital, blood
      samples were taken on admission in the neurovascular unit (H0), 6h, 24h and 48h after
      reperfusion , and during the 3 month clinical visit.

      For the constitution of the serum bank of Hibiscus-STROKE cohort, extra tubes are collected
      at the same time as the blood tests done routinely.

      These additional samples will be centrifuged and treated to form a collection of biological
      samples of total serum and plasma and blood stored at the Biological Resource Center of HCL
      Neurobiotec at -80 ° C (DC- 2008-72, AC-2013-1867 certified NFS96900 FR13-018140).
