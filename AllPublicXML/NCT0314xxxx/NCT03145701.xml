      The purpose of this study is to use a wire with a Doppler tip to measure blood flow in
      vessels in the brain and determine hemodynamic factors associated with treatment success or
      failure. Many neurological diseases cause abnormal blood flow in the brain in specific
      vessels. The special wire used in this study is place into brain blood vessels during
      standard of care procedure to treat such diseases, and blood flow parameters (such as
      velocity and pressure) are measured to gain better understanding of these neurological
      diseases.

    <textblock>
      Current treatments of cerebral aneurysms are imperfect, and aneurysmal hemodynamics is an
      important factor in treatment failure. The identification of hemodynamic factors that
      influence treatment success could predict outcome. Published studies show that the
      hemodynamic environment of aneurysms changes after treatment, and there is limited
      retrospective evidence that the degree of change affects treatment success. However, previous
      hemodynamic calculations did not have access to patient-specific measurements of blood flow,
      which substantially reduced their accuracy. In addition, no prospective studies of the
      predictive value of post-treatment aneurysm hemodynamics have been done.

      Methods: Prospectively test new aneurysm patients for hemodynamic predictors of treatment
      outcome based upon the hypothesis long-term aneurysm treatment outcome can be prospectively
      predicted by measuring the immediate hemodynamic effects of aneurysm treatment with novel
      patient-specific modeling techniques. Task 1: In a new cohort of patients undergoing aneurysm
      treatment, the investigators will again use Doppler guidewire measurements to create
      patient-specific hemodynamic models of treatment effects. By prospectively applying the
      knowledge of crucial hemodynamic changes the investigators will use immediate post-treatment
      hemodynamics to predict long-term treatment outcome.

    <description>The results of this prospective aim have the potential to substantially influence aneurysm management by predicting long-term outcome at the time of initial treatment. The investigators will determine how well the prospective test predicts long-term treatment success as applied at the time of treatment, using computational fluid dynamics modeling of hemodynamic factors with the incorporation of patient-specific measurements obtained by the Doppler guidewire</description>

        Patients will be eligible for this aim if they were not previously enrolled in the study,
        as this phase seeks to prospectively apply the tests generated by the previous
        retrospective cohort. Selection criteria will be similar in which a patient with an
        unruptured intracranial aneurysm ≥ 5mm in size undergoes endovascular treatment and
        subsequent angiographic follow-up.
