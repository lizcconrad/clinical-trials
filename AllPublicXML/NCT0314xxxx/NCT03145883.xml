  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will use an unmasked, parallel group, randomized design. Thirty adult
      overweight or obese subjects with mild-moderate persistent asthma will be randomly assigned
      to one of two groups: 12-weeks of home-based moderate intensity aerobic exercise versus no
      intervention. The study will include 2 clinic visits and 12 telephone calls. Exercise testing
      to assess physical fitness levels will occur during visits 1 and 2. Blood sampling for
      biomarkers, inflammatory markers, and other assessments will be done.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this pilot study is to recruit and retain obese adults with mild-moderate
      persistent asthma for a study protocol that includes exercise at a moderate intensity level
      in a home-based setting. The investigators primary hypothesis is that compared to no
      intervention, 12-weeks of moderate intensity aerobic exercise will attenuate serum levels of
      adipokines (leptin, adiponectin), and other pro-inflammatory markers. The investigators will
      also analyze the effect of the intervention on fitness levels, pulmonary function, asthma
      symptoms, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

      Given that this is a proof of concept/feasibility study, there is no primary outcome measure.
      The following measures will be assessed:

        -  Obesity related biomarkers and other markers of inflammatory responses:

        -  Asthma symptoms and asthma control measures:

        -  Lung function

        -  Fitness levels and physical activity levels:

    <description>Participants will be prescribed weekly exercise goals starting with 75 minutes a week (e.g., 15 minutes per day, 5 days a week) and progressed to 200 minutes a week (e.g., 40 minutes per day, 5 days a week) by week 12. Exercise will consist of participant preference of mobility exercises, most likely walking. Aerobic exercise, similar to a brisk walk, will be recommended as the primary mode of exercise.</description>
