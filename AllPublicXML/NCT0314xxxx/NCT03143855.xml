  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop initial human data on effects of novel
      compounds on safety (interactions with oxycodone) and efficacy (subjective response to
      oxycodone) in non-treatment seeking opioid use disorder subjects. The compound to be studied
      will be the 5-HT2CR agonist lorcaserin. There are no known or reported adverse interactions
      between lorcaserin and oxycodone or other opioids.

      Lorcaserin is a serotonin (5-HT) 2C receptor agonist (Trade Name Belviq) approved for
      treatment of obesity. The study teams's preclinical research collaborators and others have
      shown that lorcaserin and other 5-HT2CR agonists have been shown to reduce drugs of abuse
      self-administration and cue reactivity in rodents including cocaine and nicotine. Recently,
      this data has been expanded to opioids. Rats trained to self-administer oxycodone showed a
      significant reduction in self-administration and oxycodone cue induced lever presses after
      lorcaserin administration.

      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 1b/2a study. 18
      subjects are planned. The following treatment regimens will be used:

      Lorcaserin will be administered at a dose of 10mg twice daily. Placebo or Comparator -
      identical placebo capsules administered at the same time as lorcaserin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to participate in this study, subjects must:

          1. Males and females between 18 and 65 years-of-age.

          2. Understand the study procedures and provide written informed consent.

          3. Meet current DSM-5 criteria for opioid use disorder, at least moderate severity, but
             are not seeking treatment.

          4. Have at least one positive urine drug screen for opioids during screening to document
             opioid use.

          5. Have no clinically significant abnormalities in the judgment of the study physician in
             hematology and chemistry laboratory tests including liver function tests.

          6. Have no contraindications for study participation as determined by medical history and
             physical examination.

          7. Be able to demonstrate an understanding of study procedures and follow instructions
             including behavioral laboratory testing.

          8. No pregnant or nursing women will be permitted in the study, and women must either be
             unable to conceive (i.e., surgically sterilized, sterile, or postmenopausal) or be
             using a reliable form of contraception (e.g., abstinence, birth control pills,
             intrauterine device with spermicide, or condoms). Men will be advised to use condoms.
             All females must provide negative pregnancy urine tests before study entry, at each
             visit during the study, and at the end of study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             opioids, marijuana, or nicotine. Diagnosis of mild to moderate use disorder for
             alcohol will not be considered exclusionary.
