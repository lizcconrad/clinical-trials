    <textblock>
      Reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction saves viable myocardium, but paradoxically
      reestablishment of coronary artery flow also induces damage and cell death, decreasing the
      full benefit of reperfusion in terms of reduction of infarct size and preservation of
      ventricular function . Myocardial reperfusion can in itself produce more damage and cell
      death, this process defines the phenomenon of reperfusion injury, which could be prevented by
      applying additional therapies.

    <textblock>
      During myocardial ischemia, due to lack of O2, the myocyte leaves energy production from the
      aerobic metabolism of lipids and the production of energy in the form of phosphates will
      depend, in this situation, on the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. As a result they are
      consumed muscle glycogen stores that produce little ATP, and also generating acidosis. The
      cell membrane loses its ability to maintain the fluid's electrolyte balance. Cellular edema
      is generated by the entry of sodium and water, leading to cell rupture. During ischemia and
      reperfusion free radicals are produced that stimulate inflammation and consequently release
      prothrombotic and cytotoxic substances that also produce cellular damage. Due to its osmotic,
      antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory and rheological effects, dextran could be useful in this
      scenario.

      The administration of a solution in the distal bed, for the protection of the myocardium,
      before opening the epicardial artery is called by us &quot;controlled reperfusion&quot;. The
      researchers think, using a solution with venous blood, containing less O2 but retaining
      buffer properties; enriched with Dextran, which has onctic power, anti-inflammatory and
      anticoagulant properties, and molecules similar to glucose; results in a potentially useful
      solution for myocardial protection in this scenario.

      The group of investigators expect that controlled reperfusion treatment will reduce the
      incidence of ST correction and infarct size by 20-30%, improving the prognosis in terms of
      mortality and heart failure.

    <description>Patients will be treated in the occluded coronary with a solution of venous blood and Dextran, prior to the Stenting procedure.
Controlled Reperfusion PCI consists of crossing the culprit lesion with guidewire and then advancing a balloon (over the wire) to the distal segment of the culprit vessel. Proximal to the main distal branch, inflate the balloon to low atmospheres, remove the guide wire and inject the solution through the light of the balloon. Then reposition the guidewire, perform angioplasty as usual on the lesion. If there is a large residual thrombus load and at the operator's discretion, change the balloon by a manual thromboaspiration catheter and use it.
Then perform stenting of the lesion. The solution will be given with a 1 cc syringe as a slow bolus, controlling symptoms and ST segment response.
The compounds in solution are venous blood drawn from the patient after administration of heparin and mixed with dextran in a 3/1 ratio.</description>
