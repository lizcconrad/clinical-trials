  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the combination of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib in
      subjects with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic renal cell carcinoma that has
      progressed after treatment with at least one prior VEGF-targeted therapy, or for whom
      VEGF-targeted therapy has proven to be intolerable, or is considered inappropriate.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the efficacy based on objective response rate [ORR = complete response (CR)
           + partial response (PR)] of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib when administered in
           combination in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To characterize dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and
           recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination.

        -  To assess other measures of anti-tumor activity of the combination of pembrolizumab and
           cabozantinib in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma that
           has progressed after treatment with at least one prior VEGF-targeted therapy, or for
           whom VEGF-targeted therapy has proven to be intolerable, or is considered inappropriate.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response is defined as a complete or partial response, as determined by investigator assessment using RECIST and irRC. Subjects with missing or no response assessments will be classified as non-responders.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Cycle 2 of Phase 1 (21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as the highest dose level with no more than 1 DLT reported in 6 DLT-evaluable subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recommended Phase 2 Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of cabozantinib will be selected based on the clinical data and will not exceed the MTD. If &lt; 2/6 subjects experience a DLT at 60 mg daily during dose escalation, then 60 mg daily will be considered the RP2D. If ≥ 2/6 subjects experience DLTs at 60 mg daily, and ≤ 1/6 subjects experience a DLT at 40 mg daily, then 40 mg daily will be considered the RP2D. The dose of pembrolizumab will be constant at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from study treatment initiation (Cycle 1, Day 1) to the first occurrence of documented disease progression or death from any cause during the study, whichever occurs first. For subjects who do not have documented progressive disease or death during the study, PFS will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment.</description>
