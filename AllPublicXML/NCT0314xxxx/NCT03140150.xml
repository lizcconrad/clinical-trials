      Follow-up strategy for patients implanted with a pacemaker.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to verify that a follow-up strategy for patients implanted with a mono- or
      double-chamber pacemaker, stimuli-dependent or not, for 2 years, by means of data
      transmissions of the devices by Carelink Express during the usual consultations with the
      treating cardiologist significantly reduces the number of unnecessary consultations in the
      implant centers (without any change in treatment or pacemaker programming) compared to the
      usual follow-up mode recommended for this type of device.

    <description>A more in-depth study will be conducted through questionnaires and individual interviews, developed by sociologists, on representative samples of the two arms of the study (based on age, gender and type of domicile - Individual or collective housing - representative of the populations implanted in 2016) followed at a distance in terms of acceptability, impact on everyday life and the doctor-patient relationship. A survey will also be conducted with attending cardiologists to assess their acceptability of this type of follow-up.</description>

    <description>The main analysis will be a comparative cost study based on the following assumption: the direct costs of patient support are different from the direct costs of care for patients undergoing conventional monitoring, in particular in terms of the number Follow-up consultations and transport (COMPAS study: Mabo, 2011).
The complementary study will be a cost-utility analysis based on a utility measure obtained by the EQ-5D questionnaire.</description>
