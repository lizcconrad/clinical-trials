  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To this date no clinical evaluation reports of the dynamics in the National Early Warning
      Score (NEWS) for those patients who suffer an in-hospital cardiac arrest, IHCA, exists. This
      process needs to be investigated in order to optimize the future care of these patients.

      Research Questions H1: Patients that suffer an IHCA has had higher NEWS in the preceding 24
      hours from the event compared to those who did not suffer an IHCA.

      H2: There is a parameter in the NEWS that could predict IHCA better than the others in the
      preceding 24 hours.

      Power:

      A sample size of 300 patients in the control group and 150 patients in the group that
      suffered from an IHCA would generate a power estimate of 80 percent if the difference in the
      median is one point on the NEWS with a standard deviate of three points.

      Analysis of the Research Data:

      Categorical and nonparametric data will be presented in median (25-75 percentiles).

      Hypothesis testing will be performed where the documented NEWS will be divided into different
      timespans. Each timespan during the 24 hours will not be treated as repeated measures and
      will be executed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. This test is chosen because the data is
      assumed to be non-parametric and the patients will be divided into two groups, one control
      group and one with the patients that suffered an IHCA. Another hypothesis testing will be
      performed where each documented NEWS on the same patient will be treated as repeated
      measures. Depending on the level of missing data and unequivalent time points between
      subjects, which could cause a biased result, the rANOVA or a generalized mixed models
      approach will be used. For the prediction of IHCA by using a specific parameter in the NEWS,
      a logistic regression analysis will be applied. All the documented NEWS will be divided into
      different time spans. Each time span will be considered as independent measures and entered
      separately into the regression analysis. This is motivated by the fact that each and every
      one of the documented NEWS was conducted in the preceding 24 hours of the IHCA. The variable
      mortality yes/no will be set as the dichotomous independent variable in the regression
      analysis. In order to select the parameters in the NEWS that is to be included in the
      regression analysis a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U-test) including all the parameters
      in the NEWS will be executed. The level of significance for this test will be set to p=0.2 2.
      Collinearity within the NEWS parameters that is to be included in the regression analysis
      will be tested. The level of collinearity that is accepted will be &lt;+0,6 and &gt;-0,6. A
      binomial logistic regression analysis will be executed with the selected parameters in the
      NEWS The outcome of the regression analysis will be presented as odds ratio (OR).

    <time_frame>24 hours preceding an in-hospital cardiac arrest</time_frame>
    <description>All documented National Early Warning Scores (NEWS) on eligible patients admitted to a hospital ward will be collected. The NEWS will be divided into different timespans in the 24 hours preceding the in-hospital cardiac arrest. A control group of patients will also have their NEWS collected. The NEWS of the control group and the cases will then be entered into the hypothesis testing. The aim is to find some dynamics in the NEWS that separates the patients that suffers an in-hospital cardiac arrest from those who do not in the 24 hours preceding the event.</description>
