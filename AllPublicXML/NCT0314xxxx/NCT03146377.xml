    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single centre, single-arm phase II study which aims to assess the
      efficacy and tolerability of triplet combination of capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan
      (Xeloxiri regimen) in treating patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.
      Clinical data from patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer will be collected and analyzed
      in this study. The patients' data will be collected and maintained in the Division of medical
      oncology of the Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital.
