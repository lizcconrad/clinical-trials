  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One treatment session is given with the psychological treatment method Lifespan Integration
      (LI). The main outcome is change on Impact of Event Scale (IES) before and after the
      treatment. The change is analyzed and compared with the change on Impact of Event Scale (IES)
      among the people on the waiting list arm. Self-rating questionnaires are being used 5+/-3
      days before treatment, 20 +/-3 days after treatment, and 6 months +/- 6 weeks after the first
      measurement.
