      Background: Infection of cardiac implantable electronic device including wound and pouch
      infection, bacteraemia and endocarditis is a common complication of device insertion. The
      role of antibiotic prophylaxis in prevention of this complication is well established. Most
      centres in Israel currently prescribe antibiotics about 5 days following the procedure as
      well, though clear clinical evidence warranting this practise is lacking. Unnecessary
      antibiotic treatment can lead to adverse events including allergy, undesirable effects of the
      antibiotics, establishment of resistance to antibiotics among bacteria and further infections
      with resistant strains.

      Objective: The investigators hope to either establish evidence warranting use of
      post-procedural antibiotic treatment or refuting it.

      Methods: The investigators intend to recruit about 400 patients a year into both trial group
      and control group. The trial group will be treated with post-procedural antibiotics during 5
      days, while the control group will receive no post-procedural antibiotics. The endpoints of
      the study will include infections related to the implantable device and proposed adverse
      effects of the antibiotics. The t-test will be performed in order to evaluate whether benefit
      exists concerning one of the groups.

    <textblock>
      The infection of cardiac implantable electronic device site (including both pocket infection
      and deeper infections) is a common complication of electronic device insertion. Its incidence
      is estimated in different series as 0.2-0.7 per 100 device-years. The risk factors that raise
      the incidence of this complication are in the first place lack of or inappropriate antibiotic
      prophylaxis and repeated or recurrent manipulations with the device. Several comorbidities
      such as diabetes, renal insufficiency, heart failure, malignancy, anticoagulation treatment,
      and, non-surprisingly glucocorticoid treatment are the remaining risk factors for the
      infection. It is worth mentioning that over half of all cases of infection occur during the
      first year past implantation.

      About 75% of all device infections are caused by staphylococci (both S. aureus and coagulase
      negative staphylococci). The other causative organisms are streptococci, Corynebacterium
      species, Propionibacterium, gram-negative bacilli and fungi. Main source of infection appears
      to be pocket contamination by skin flora. In one study the swab specimens obtained from
      device pockets during the procedure rendered positive culture for coagulase-negative
      staphylococci in up to one half of the specimens even despite observant aseptic technique and
      appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis.Thus, the contamination leading to infection of the
      implantation site can occur during the procedure. Other possible paths for infection include
      erosion of the device or its leads through the skin and seeding of the device and its leads
      by systemic bacteremia. The treatment of this complication usually requires explantation of
      the infected device, intravenous antibiotic treatment and then implantation of a new device
      through the non-infected route.

      The principal approach to prevent device infection remain aseptic technique during the
      procedure and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. Different clinical trials showed that
      pre-treatment of elective patients before the device implantation with anti-staphylococcal
      penicillins or with first generation cephalosporins results in decrease in rate of infection
      with odds ratio about 0.2-0.25.Therefore, current recommendation is to pre-treat patients
      before implantation of the device with 2-3 gram cefazolin or 1.5 gram cefuroxime, or 15 mg/kg
      vancomycin or clindamycin 900 mg IV within 4 hours before the procedure. Currently there is
      no evidence regarding adjuvant antibiotic treatment after the implantation. In the face of
      lack of evidence, several medical centres in Israel either non-uniformly administer different
      antibiotic regimens following the implantation or refrain from routinely prescribing any
      antibiotics to the patients following the implantation.

      Objective:

      The investigators suppose that non-necessary antibiotic treatment entails several adverse
      outcomes including direct adverse effects of the antibiotics (e.g. allergy, gastrointestinal
      effects, QT-prolongation), and induction of resistance to antibiotics among the patient's
      microflora entailing further infections with resistant bacteria (e.g. urinary tract
      infections, diarrhea). Therefore, an evidence either warranting use of antibiotics following
      the implantation of implantable electronic device or refuting it should be established.

      Medications:

        1. cefalexin 500 mg qid,

        2. roxithromycin 150 mg bid Both medications are authorized in Israel for a variety of
           infections or infection prevention including prevention of implantable cardiac
           electronic device infection. Both medications are routinely prescribed in medical
           centres in Israel following implantation of cardiac electronic devices.

    <intervention_model_description>We propose to organize a randomized open-label study in which patients undergoing de novo implantation or replacement of cardiac implantable devices (single-chamber, dual-chamber and biventricular pacemakers and defibrillators) will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Patients in one group will be discharged home with recommendations to take antibiotic treatment for 5 days following the procedure (cefalexin 500 mg qid, or in the presence of beta-lactam sensitivity roxythromycin 150 mg bid) while in the other group no recommendations regarding antibiotic treatment will be given. Both groups will receive antibiotic prophylaxis before the procedure according to the current recommendations. In both groups, the aseptic technique during the procedure will be observed, and proper hygienic measures past the implantation will be taken.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The random assignment will be performed by a researcher from the cardiologic team performing the implantation by means of choosing one of two closed envelopes. The treatment will not be placebo-controlled, and therefore the neither the patients nor the attending physicians will not be blinded to the final results of the assignment.</masking_description>
