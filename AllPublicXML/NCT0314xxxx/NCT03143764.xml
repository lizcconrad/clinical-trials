  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to examine cycling time and distance when inactive subjects were provided
      with electrically assisted bicycles, and secondly, to examine changes in cardiorespiratory
      fitness.

  <detailed_description>

      Method: Inactive employees in a selection of public and private corporations in three
      Norwegian cities were invited to participate. Inclusion criteria were: a desire to cycle to
      work, residence more than 3km from the workplace, and not physically active according to
      guidelines. There were 25 participants in the study and we provided them all with
      electrically assisted bicycles fitted with GPS bike computers to record usage. The
      participants were followed for three to eight months, 226 days on average. Measures of
      maximal oxygen uptake were performed before and after the intervention. Demographic
      characteristics and prior transportation habits were reported in a questionnaire at baseline.
