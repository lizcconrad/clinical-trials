  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Urban Institute—a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization—is partnering with Rubicon
      Programs to conduct a rigorous evaluation of its Fathers Advancing Communities Together
      (FACT) program. FACT is a multi-faceted program designed to deliver responsible parenting,
      healthy relationships, and economic stability services on a voluntary basis to low-income
      fathers in Contra Costa County, California. Urban's evaluation comprised of three key
      components:

      The implementation evaluation will describe FACT program activities and services, including
      communication and coordination across partners, service delivery mechanisms, and whether and
      how participants and their families received comprehensive services. Urban will identify a
      logic model for the program and assess the barriers to and facilitators of program
      performance. The implementation evaluation will draw from interviews with program staff,
      partners, and stakeholders, as well as field observations, program and administrative data,
      and focus groups with FACT participants and their families.

      The outcome evaluation will build on the implementation evaluation to determine whether
      specific program components, their frequency, and their duration, are related to outcomes.
      Urban will conduct surveys of program participants at the time of their enrollment into the
      program and one year following their enrollment to explore how participants' self-reported
      attitudes on various domains are associated with economic self-sufficiency and family
      functioning. Urban will also use program and administrative data collected by Rubicon and its
      partners, specifically Rubicon's case management database, to assess participant outcomes.

      The impact evaluation will assess to what extent participation in the FACT program is
      associated with improved outcomes as compared to similarly situated individuals who did not
      participate in the program. Urban will work with Rubicon's partners to identify individuals
      living in Contra Costa County who were eligible to participate in the program but, for
      whatever reason, did not do so. Once a comparison group of fathers has been established,
      Urban will use individual-level outcome data to determine whether the FACT program has an
      impact on economic self-sufficiency and family functioning.

    <description>This outcome will capture how, due to FACT programming, participants' changes in attitudes and perceptions of their parenting, relationships, and economic stability were associated with changes in program-specific behaviors/outcomes, and the extent to which program components (e.g., classes and workshops) were associated with changes in fathers' attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors as measured by a participant survey. This outcome will draw on data collected from participant surveys, program data in Rubicon's Salesforce/ECM database, and administrative data from Rubicon's partners providing services to FACT participants. All of the above data points will be combined and linked, to the extent possible, to analyze individual-level data to assess participants' changes in their attitudes and perceptions of self-sufficiency, relationships, and parenting.</description>

        The study population will include all FACT participants enrolled from July 2016 through
        September 2019. The participant survey will be administered to a sub-sample of
        approximately 200-250 FACT participants enrolled from March 2017 to March 2019. The
        sub-sample for the impact evaluation will be FACT participants with an active child support
        case.
