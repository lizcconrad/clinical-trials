      The aim of present study was to study the osteopathic manipulative effects on pain relief and
      quality of life improvement on hospitalized oncology geriatric patients. A non-randomized
      comparison trial was performed in Unit of Oncology Rehabilitation, Palazzolo Institute, Don
      Carlo Gnocchi Foundation ONLUS, Milan, Italy, from September 2015 to March 2016. 23 older
      oncology patients were unrolled and allocated in two experimental groups: study group (OMT
      group, N=12) underwent to osteopathic manipulative treatment associated to physiotherapy and
      control group (PT group, N = 11) underwent only physiotherapy. At enrollment (T0), 23
      recruited oncology patients completed the socio-demographic forms and were evaluated, from
      external examiner, pain intensity and quality of life. All patients were revaluated at the
      end of treatment (T4) for quality of life and every week (T1, T2, T3 and T4) for pain
      intensity. Standard level of significance was p&lt;0.05.
