  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive cancer. Over the past 40 years there has not been much
      progress made in reducing deaths from this cancer. Recently, new models of pancreatic cancers
      have been generated from mouse and human tissues. These models have used larger pieces of
      tissues taken from surgical removal of pancreatic cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether these new pancreatic cancer models can be
      generated from the small biopsies we take to make the diagnosis of the pancreatic mass.

      The Endoscopic Ultrasound guided pancreatic biopsy tissue collected for only research
      purposes will be used to generate organoids in a in-vivo and in-vitro setting.

      The development of these methods may help scientists identify new treatments for pancreatic
      cancer and to potentially develop more personalized approaches to treating pancreatic cancer.
