  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-center, open-label, fixed-sequence, 2-period crossover study in
      healthy adults to evaluate the effect of oral rifabutin (RBT) 300 milligram (mg) on the
      pharmacokinetics of oral cabotegravir (CAB) 30 milligram ( mg). This study will evaluate the
      drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential between CAB and RBT to inform dosing strategies for
      tuberculosis in subjects receiving CAB for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment or
      prevention. In Treatment Period 1 (Treatment A) participants will receive CAB 30 mg once
      daily for 14 days, followed by Treatment Period 2 (Treatment B) where participants will
      receive RBT 300 mg once daily with CAB 30 mg once daily for 14 days. The total study duration
      will be approximately for 10 weeks. Approximately 15 healthy subjects will be enrolled to
      ensure that 12 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments.
