  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Egypt, the evidence for quality processes has not been established yet in the current
      training programs for surgery residents. There are no published articles discussing career
      satisfaction among surgical residents. Therefore, we are going to conduct a self-designed
      survey in Egyptian university hospitals to measure residents' satisfaction and display views
      about their undergraduate surgical education, surgical education during internship year,
      post-graduate training program, and extracurricular activity during medical school.
