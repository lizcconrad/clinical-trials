    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of Kangaroo Mother Care
      (KMC) as continuously as possible together with the use of a plastic bag in combination with
      routine World Health Organization (WHO) thermoregulation care reduces the incidence of
      moderate (32-36° C) or severe (&lt;32.0° C) hypothermia in preterm infants ≥ 32 to 36 6/7 weeks
      of gestational age (GA) when compared to KMC as continuously as possible together with
      routine WHO thermoregulation care.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of Kangaroo Mother Care
      (KMC) as continuously as possible together with the use of a plastic bag in combination with
      routine World Health Organization (WHO) thermoregulation care (warm delivery rooms, immediate
      drying after birth, early and exclusive breastfeeding, postponement of bathing and weighing,
      and appropriate bundling) reduces the incidence of moderate hypothermia (32-36° C) or severe
      (&lt;32.0° C) in preterm infants ≥ 32 to 36 6/7 weeks of gestational age (GA) when compared to
      KMC as continuously as possible together with routine WHO thermoregulation care, as
      practiced.

      The investigators are proposing two trials, one protocol for infants 32-36 6/7 weeks (this
      one) and one for infants who are ≥37 weeks gestational age. This preterm infant trial will
      address the effectiveness of KMC in combination with plastic bags in decreasing hypothermia
      in preterm infants. The proposed trial will determine whether KMC with plastic bags prevents
      hypothermia in neonates born in a healthcare setting with limited resources where a high risk
      for hypothermia has been reported. Any intervention that decreases morbidity during the
      neonatal period has the potential to impact health beyond the neonatal period,and one that is
      highly cost-effective and easy to use is more likely to be implemented in the developing
      world.
