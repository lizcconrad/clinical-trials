  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the affect of ground based microgravity on co-cultured
      vascular cell types. Our goal is to better understand the cross-talk between vascular cell
      types grown under conditions such as microgravity as is seen in space. In this pilot study,
      the investigator proposes to assess changes in cell phenotype and function in microgravity as
      compared to normal gravity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study builds upon previously reported space flight data in GenLab, as well as our own
      published data whereby the investigator evaluate the effect of microgravity on the
      differentiation and functional potential of circulating stem cells. The goal of this work is
      to leverage the powerful genetic analyses done in the SPHINX study and look at the
      consequences these changes have on cell-cell communications essential for vascular
      homeostasis, for a possible correlation to cardiovascular deconditioning. The application of
      this work is targeted at possible &quot;cell based&quot; countermeasures to address the negative
      effects of microgravity on the vasculature.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differentiation (Colony Forming) Kinetics of normal vs microgravity cultured stem cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 weeks of collecting cells</time_frame>
    <description>The study team are interesting in the effect of co-cultured Endothelial cells on the kinetics of stem cell colony formation (i.e. differentiation). As compared to normal gravity samples, the colonies that form while in co-culture with ECs will be counted and monitored. This gives a measure of the differentiation potential of these cells.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gene and Protein expression of normal vs microgravity cultured stem cells</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 2 years from the start of the study</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will use rtPCR to probe the stem cells for the up regulation of Endothelial cell (EC) specific genes and down regulation of stem cell genes. EC specific genes include vascular endothelial cadherin (CD144), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), and von Willebrand factor (vWF). Stem cell markers include CD34. The study team will use GAPDH as a control.</description>
