    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, randomized, open-label, cross-over study with three single-dose
      treatments to compare the bioavailability of an oral tablet relative to an oral capsule of
      GLPG1690 after single dose intake in healthy male subjects and to evaluate the effect of food
      on the bioavailability of the oral tablet.
