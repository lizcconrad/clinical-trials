  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effectiveness of strategies for engaging parents into parenting
      programs. Engagement strategies included a booklet showing testimonial quotes and photos from
      prior participants, a recommendation to attend for the child's teacher, and a motivational
      call from the parenting program provider. It was hypothesized that the combination of
      engagement strategies would increase attendance at a parenting intervention compared to
      receiving only a promotional brochure and research interview.

    <description>This was a manualized, 20-minute call from the Triple P Positive Parenting Program provider to a parent in which the provider elicited the parent's child-focused goals and showed how the parent's goals could be addressed by Triple P. The provider also helped the parent problem solve barriers to attendance and develop an action plan to handle common barriers (e.g., scheduling conflicts) as well as set session reminders.</description>
