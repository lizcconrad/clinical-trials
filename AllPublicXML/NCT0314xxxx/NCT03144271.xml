      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of ascending single s.c. doses of NNC 0113-0217 in healthy male subjects, aiming
      at establishing the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.
             (Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during
             normal management of the subject)

          -  Subject is male

          -  Age 18-65 years, both included

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) below 35.0 kg/m^2 (Body weight between 50 kg -150 kg, both
             inclusive)

          -  Good general health based on medical history, physical examination including ECG
             (Electrocardiogram) and laboratory analysis, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation, defined as randomised, in any other clinical trial involving
             this or other investigational products within the last 3 months before dosing

          -  Patients with MI (Myocardia-Infarction) during the last 12 month

             thiazide diuretics, thyroid hormones, and/or lipid lowering medication who are not on
             a stable dose for more than 6 weeks prior to start of the study

          -  Use of weight lowering medications (orlistat, sibutramine, rimonabant, phentermine)

          -  Clinically significant GI (Gastro-Intestinal) disease including inflammatory bowel
             disease, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, dyspepsia, apparent diabetic gastro

             hormonal IUDs (intrauterine devices), or refrain from sexual intercourse during the
             study and until 1 month after completion of the trial. This is to prevent the
             possibility of a pregnancy from spermatocytes that can potentially be damaged by study
             medication

          -  Current treatment with drugs known to interfere with glucose metabolism such as
             systemic corticosteroids, non-selective beta-blockers, and MAO (Mono-Amino-Oxidase)

             aminotransferase), alkaline phosphatase above three times the upper reference limit
             (one retest within one week is permitted, the last result being conclusive)

          -  Clinical significant abnormal laboratory test results during the screening as judged
             by the Investigator

          -  Impaired renal function, defined as s-creatinine above or equal to 135 μmol/L
