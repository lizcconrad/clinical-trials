  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparison of the results of levator resection operation with the use of fixed sutures
      technique in which the levator muscle is approached through skin incision and the muscle
      shortened and sutured directly to the tarsus then the skin crease reformed with interrupted
      sutures which pick up the underlying levator muscle versus the results with the use of
      adjustable sutures in which the suture passes through the levator muscle into the tarsal
      plate and out through the skin edge .the skin crease is formed separately so that adjusting
      the suture doesn't open the wound, the suture can be adjusted according to the result up to 4
      days post operative.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Cases of blepharoptosis admitted at Assiut University Hospital.

          -  Cases that are fit for surgery.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Cases not fit for surgery.

          -  Cases of pseudoptosis may result from many conditions that simulate an asymmetry of
             the upper eyelid level. Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, enophthalmos, or exophthalmos can
             accentuate a minimal blepharoptosis or produce the appearance of blepharoptosis on the
             contralateral normal side,

          -  Cases with diseases, such as myasthenia gravis; negativity for Bell palsy symptoms;
             and Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome.
