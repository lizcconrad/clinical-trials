      This study evaluates the clinical efficacy and study the therapeutic mechanism of a kind of
      traditional Chinese medicine colonic dialysis on Chronic kidney disease (CKD) 5 without blood
      dialysis therapy in adults. Half of participants will receive conventional integrated therapy
      on chronic renal failure (CRF), while the other half will receive integrated therapy on CRF
      and traditional Chinese medicine colonic dialysis.

      Patients who would hospitalized in Nephrology of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional
      Chinese Medicine have chance to participate this study. All participates will be divided into
      two groups depending on their individual treatment interests and the baseline information
      will be balanced.

      Integrated Therapy is routine symptomatic and supportive treatment for CRF,including reducing
      blood pressure and urine protein, improving anemia，regulating calcium and phosphorus
      metabolism and so on.The colon lotion used in colonic dialysis is a kind of hospital
      preparation. It consists of Rhubarb, Concha ostreae and some other traditional Chinese
      medicine.The whole treatment lasts about 10 days,as long as a regular drill-and-fill
      procedure. Before and after the treatment, related body dimensions will be tested.
