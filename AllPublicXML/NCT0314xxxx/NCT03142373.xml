  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance (SC) reflect autonomic activity
      and the balance of autonomic nervous system (ANS) which regulates involuntary physiological
      functions. The modulation of ANS tonic activity is a target of osteopathic manipulative
      treatment (OMT). The main aim of the present study was to verify whether CV4 and RR
      osteopathic techniques influence ANS activity, as measured by HRV and SC.

      Trial design. A randomized-controlled clinical trial was performed from June 2010 to January
      2011.

      Methods. 32 healthy adults (33.9±14 years, and 72% female) were selected. At enrollment, all
      subjects were randomized in three groups: CV4 group (CV4 technique), Rib Raising group (RR
      technique), and Placebo group (PL technique). Each subject of each group underwent respective
      technique only once. HRV and SC was continuously recorded during the session respectively
      with heart rate monitor Polar S810i and with Onda Scanner Domiana (OSD-Microsale model). All
      data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software and the significance level was
      considered at p≤0.05.
