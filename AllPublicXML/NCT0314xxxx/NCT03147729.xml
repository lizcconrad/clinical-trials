  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal incontinence (AI) is used to englobe the involuntary loss of both fecal material and
      gases, which can help to improve quality of life. Based on these experiences objectives were
      drawn: to evaluate the effectiveness of radiofrequency and it's influence on quality of life
      of patients with anal incontinence, to correlate the anal incontinence severity and to
      evaluate a sexual function and to verify an influence with radiofrequency treatment. It is a
      blind randomized clinical trial. For the collection of data it was used a fecal quality of
      life questionnaire (FIQL). The questionnaire assess the severity of Anal Incontinence (FISI),
      the degree of patient's satisfaction using a five-point scale (Likert) and a visual analogue
      EVA scale). It was divided in two groups, in one group it was used radiofrequency and pelvic
      exercises and in the other turned off radiofrequency (heated glycerin) and pelvic exercises.
      It was accomplished in eight sections. As a result, it is expected the efficiency of the
      treatment of radiofrequency in the quality of life, in sexual function and in it's severity.

    <measure>The effectiveness of radiofrequency in anal incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>8 radiofrequency sessions will be performed, with a 7 day interval between them. The session will be 20 minutes.Participants will be followed up for a minimum of 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The radiofrequency application protocol will be used in the form of a capacitive electric transfer, bipolar configuration, with the Tonderm brand, Spectra G2 model, which has two electrodes: one active, in the anal region, with liquid glycerin and another, dispersive, coupled to the patient's hip. The temperature will be measured through a digital thermometer with infra-red until it reaches 41°C and will be maintained for 2 minutes. It will use Consent form, questionnaire of socio-demographic data and basic anamnesis. Then Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life, Fecal Incontinence Severity Index and Female Sexual Function Index. After, a perineal physical evaluation will be performed by an experienced Physical Therapist. The professional will perform a perineal muscle strength test, reflex and sensitivity test. For the sensitivity evaluation will be used a digital osiometer. The patients will be divided into two groups.</description>
