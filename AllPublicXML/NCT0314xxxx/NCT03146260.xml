  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Azoospermia is complete absence of sperm in the ejaculate. It accounts for 10-15% of male
      infertility cases. It is classified as obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). NOA
      constitutes 60% of all cases of azoospermia. Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) for
      intracytoplas¬mic sperm injection (ICSI) was first introduced for treatment of obstructive
      azoospermia in 1993. Soon afterwards testicular sperm were retrieved successfully and used in
      ICSI in cases of NOA. In the NOA cases, TESE combined with ICSI has been proven to be an
      acceptable line of treatment. Microdissection TESE may have some theoretical benefits over
      conventional TESE, but uncertainty exists about its superiority. During a conventional TESE
      procedure, the testis is exposed through a small incision and one or multiple biopsies are
      taken blindly. Micro TESE was first introduced in 1999. In this technique, the tunica
      albuginea is widely opened and examination of the testicular tissue is carried out at 20-25×
      magnification under an operating microscope allowing visualization of whitish, larger and
      more opaque tubuli. The concept of this technique is that these tubuli are more likely to
      contain active spermatogenesis. also no secure clinical predictors of (SR) are demonstrated
      for both procedures.The recovery of spermatozoa is successful in only 50% of cases and
      therefore the ability to predict those patients with a high probability of achieving a
      successful sperm retrieval would be of great value in counselling the patient and his partner
      . There is no single clinical finding or investigation that can accurately predict the
      outcome of TESE.An unsuccessful sperm recovery has important emotional and financial
      implications so objective counselling based on predictive factors may offer realistic
      expectations for both the couple and physician.

    <description>Conventional testicular sperm extraction (TESE) will be done under anesthesia through small vertical incision in the median raphe, skin, dartos and tunica vaginalis is opened to expose tunica albuginea. The tunica albuginea is incised for about 4mm at the upper pole near the head of epididymis.</description>

    <description>Microdissection testicular sperm extraction (TESE)will be carried under anesthesia micro TESE will be through a transverse incision of the testis covering three-quarters of its circumference, according to a line preserving as much as possible the predominantly transversal sub albugineal vessels. The testis will be opened like a book by gently separating the lobular tissue of both sides. Then, the tissue will be examined under the microscope at ×10-24 magnification to search for areas with dilated whitish tubules, from which numerous microretrievals will be performed.</description>
