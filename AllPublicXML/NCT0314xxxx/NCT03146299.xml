  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of total laparoscopic hysterectomy in 1989, laparoscopic gynecologic
      surgery has undergone many advances. TLH or LAVH has the advantages of faster recovery, fewer
      complications and shorter hospitalization compared to total abdominal hysterectomy.

      However, the hysterectomy for giant uterus has the difficulty of delivering the uterus out of
      the body. According to the results of TLH, LAVH and abdominal hysterectomy, TLH and LAVH show
      the postoperative complications were less frequent (3) and the postoperative recovery (4) and
      return to daily life were faster than total abdominal hysterectomy (3) even if it took longer
      operation time.

      Therefore, laparoscopic hysterectomy has many advantages over abdominal hysterectomy and
      indications are increasing. However, there has not yet been a direct comparison between TLH
      and VALH for large uterine surgery. In this study, we compared the results including the
      complications, hospitalization period and so on., in undergoing operation and post-operation
      between TLH and LAVH for the removal of giant uterus, which is predicted to be over 500 g.
