      The pectoralis block, including pecs I and II block, is a novel technique first described in
      2011 as an alternative to paravertebral blockade for analgesia following breast surgery. The
      research goal is to determine the efficacy of the pectoralis block compared to placebo in
      improving quality of recovery following mastectomy.

      The pectoralis block, including pecs I and II block, is a novel technique first described in
      2011 as an alternative to paravertebral blockade for analgesia following breast surgery. The
      concept involves injecting local anesthetic near the coracoid process in the fascial planes
      between both the pectoralis major and minor muscles (pecs I), and the fascial plane between
      the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles (pecs II). This is a prospective,
      double-blinded, randomized controlled trial in subjects undergoing mastectomy under general
      anesthesia. The research goal is to determine the efficacy of the pectoralis block compared
      to placebo in improving quality of recovery following mastectomy.
