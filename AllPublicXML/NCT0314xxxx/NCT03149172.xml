    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to conduct a interventional prospective clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of three different xenografts for ridge preservation by comparing the
      quality of newly formed bone using histomorphometric and micro CT analysis.The three
      xenograft materials under investigation are Bio-Oss® (bovine derived xenograft), Equimatrix®
      (equine derived xenograft), and Endobon® (bovine derived xenograft). There are no prospective
      studies comparing the effectiveness of these three materials, Bio-Oss®, Endobon® and
      Equimatrix®, when placed in extraction sockets.

      Participants will be recruited from patients in the TUSDM clinics that require extraction of
      single rooted non-molar tooth and are treatment planned to receive dental implants in the
      future. Participants will be randomized to receive one of the three xenograft materials after
      tooth extraction. The percentage of newly formed bone and bone density will be compared
      between the three materials 4-6 months after ridge preservation.

      This is a pilot prospective clinical trial in which histological and micro CT analysis will
      be utilized to compare between Endobon®, Equimatrix®, and Bio-Oss®.

      Primary aim: Compare the percentage of newly formed bone between Equimatrix®, Bio-Oss® and
      Endobon®.

      The investigators hypothesize that the mean percentage of newly formed bone from Equimatrix®
      will be higher than Bio-Oss® and/or Endobon®.

      Secondary aim: Compare the bone density between Equimatrix®, Bio-Oss® and Endobon®.

      The investigators hypothesize that the bone density from Equimatrix® will be higher than
      Bio-Oss® and/or Endobon®.
