      This study is designed to see whether Apatinib is effective in treating patients with
      advanced refractory biliary tract cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancers (BTC) includes cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). The
      systematic treatment based on gemcitabine plus cisplatin is recommended as the current
      standard chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic BTC. There is no standard recommendation
      for second line therapy.

      Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      2(VEGFR-2).

      This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with
      advanced refractory BTC who had received first-line chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must have histologically or cytologically documented carcinoma primary to the intra-
             or extra-hepatic biliary system or gall bladder with clinical and/or radiologic
             evidence of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.

          2. Patients with ampullary carcinoma are not eligible.

          3. Must have failed or are intolerant to one line of systemic treatment but no more than
             2 prior lines of systemic chemotherapy for advanced BTC. Patients who received
             adjuvant chemotherapy and had evidence of disease recurrence within 6 months of
             completion of the adjuvant treatment are also eligible. If the patient received
             adjuvant treatment and had disease recurrence after 6 months, patients will only be
             eligible after failing or having intolerance to one line of systemic chemotherapy used
             to treat the disease recurrence.

          4. Age between 18 and 75 years old

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Assessment of 0 or 1.
