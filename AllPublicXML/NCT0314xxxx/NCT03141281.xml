  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the effect of broad and directed (narrow) technology-based training on
      basic perceptual and cognitive abilities in older adults and on the performance of simulated
      tasks of daily living including driving and fraud avoidance.

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will be randomly assigned to four training conditions: broad training using
      either 1) Posit Science's web-based &quot;BrainHQ&quot; or 2) the video game Rise of Nations, or to
      directed training for 3) Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) training on both
      driving, American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)'s web-based older driver training
      program, and training for fraud avoidance, a web-based tutorial on finance and fraud, or 4)
      to an active control condition of puzzle solving. Training will take approximately 15-20 hr
      for each treatment condition. Before training begins, participants will take baseline ability
      tests of perception, attention, memory, and cognition, activities of daily living, as well as
      a driving simulator test for hazard perception, and a financial fraud recognition test. They
      will be tested again on these measures following training completion, and at a one-year
      follow-up from training completion.
