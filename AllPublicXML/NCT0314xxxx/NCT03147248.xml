      This is a Phase I/III Study to Evaluate Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Safety between CT-P13
      SC and CT-P13 IV in Patients with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis.

    <textblock>
      A new subcutaneous infliximab formulation is being developed by Celltrion, Inc. as an
      alternative to the intravenous regimen where subcutaneous infliximab injection typically
      takes less than 2 minutes. The availability of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab would
      increase the treatment options available to patients, particularly those wishing to
      self-administer their therapy. This Phase I/III Study randomized, open-label, multicenter,
      parallel-group study is designed to Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Safety between
      Subcutaneous CT-P13 and Intravenous CT-P13 in Patients with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis.
