  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several factors initiating cytokine storm and systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome (SIRS) during cardiac transplantation. This may lead to serious perioperative
      complications: respiratory insufficiency, circulatory collapse, acute renal and liver
      failure, multi-organ dysfunction etc.

      On the other hand the high level of cytokines may play an important role in the development
      of graft rejection which is still a relevant problem in this patient group.

      There are some new data showing that the use of extracorporeal cytokine adsorber during long
      cardiopulmonary bypass time (&gt;120min) may be beneficial to prevent SIRS with decreasing the
      level of cytokines in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. However there is lack of
      data and studies regarding the effect of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption during cardiac
      transplantation.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of extracorporeal cytokine adsorber built
      in the cardiopulmonary bypass circle during heart transplantation. The hypothesis is that
      removing cytokines during transplantation in this patient group prevents the development of
      extreme systemic inflammatory response syndrome, early rejection and decreases the incidence
      of severe perioperative complications.

      Patients undergoing cardiac transplantation will be enrolled in the study after giving a
      written, signed informed consent.

      The participants will be randomized into two groups:

        -  intervention group (30 patients): a cytokine adsorber (CytoSorb®) will be installed into
           the cardiopulmonary bypass circle during the operation

        -  control group (30 patients): no cytokine adsorber will be used during cardiopulmonary
           bypass

      The investigators will collect demographic, clinical and laboratory data about patients
      before, during and after the operation.

      The incidence of early cellular or humoral rejection, length of ventilation, ICU and hospital
      stay, the use of vasopressors and inotropes in the perioperative period and incidence of
      perioperative complications and survival will be documented.

      The level of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alfa) and complements
      before, during and after the use of cardiopulmonary bypass will be determined if the
      investigators find relevant difference between the two groups in clinical variables.
