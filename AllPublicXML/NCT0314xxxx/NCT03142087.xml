    <textblock>
      30 patients with brain tumor will be included in the study between the ages of 6 and 18 who
      have undergone surgery. Patients included in the study will be randomly assigned to two
      groups. The study group will be included in the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus Balance Game exercise
      program under the supervision of a physiotherapist for 2 days per week for 8 weeks. The
      control group will be taken to the conventional exercise program under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist for 2 days a week, 1 hour a day. The assessments will be made before the
      exercise program begins and at the end of the 8th week. Patients' physical measurements were
      assessed by anthropometric evaluations, muscle strength measurement, pain Visual Analogue
      Scale, walking Observational Walking Analysis, Balanced Pediatric Functional Range Test,
      Timed Up and Go (TUG) and one foot standing test and Nintendo Wii Fit Plus Balance
      Assessment, Functional capacity 2 min. With Walking Test, fatigue with PedsQL
      Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, daily life activities will be evaluated with WeeFIM.

      In our pediatric rehabilitation policlinic we have seen that these children has problems in
      balance and coordination from cause muscle weakness and cerebral-sensory-proprioceptive
      problems. We have evaluated with all parameters belong the physiotherapy and rehabilitation
      measurements and then planning this study with study protocol.
