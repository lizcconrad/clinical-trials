  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open label study on the use of Ibrutinib on the inhibition of food-induced
      anaphylaxis in adults with food allergy. Ibrutinib (brand name Imbruvica) is currently FDA
      approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
      and Waldenstrom's macroglobulineia (WM). We propose to administer this approved drug to
      adults with food allergy to inhibit food allergy responses.

  <detailed_description>

      This is open-label study designed to determine the fewest doses and shortest length of time,
      from two days to up to 7 days, needed for ibrutinib to fully inhibit tests for food allergy,
      and to determine the length of persistence of efficacy after the drug is stopped.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of food allergy to peanut (or tree nut).

          -  Male or female age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Positive skin prick testing and basophil activation test to the trigger food, either
             peanut or tree nut.

          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL

          -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL

          -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl

          -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SPGT) within normal institutional limits

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits

          -  Women of child bearing potential must agree to two forms of highly effective
             contraception (hormonal, device, or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following
             completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform the Principal Investigator and her
             treating physician immediately.

          -  A female of child bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Ability to clearly understand and speak English at an 8th grade reading level. For
             safety reasons, subjects must speak English due to the anticipated need for clear and
             timely communication with investigators and the study team in emergency situations,
             since the investigators and study team are English speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have been on immunomodulatory therapies or oral corticosteroids within 1
             month prior to study participation will be excluded, and those taking antihistamines
             must stop these drugs for one week prior to enrollment and must refrain from taking
             antihistamines during the duration of the study so as not to interfere with SPT
             responses.

          -  Subjects with symptoms not consistent with type 1 food reactions (atopic dermatitis,
             eosinophilic esophagitis and any other non-IgE-mediated food sensitivities) will be
             excluded.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ibrutinib.

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, beta-blocker use or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.

          -  Subjects on anticoagulants, anti-platelet therapy, or any other predisposition towards
             bleeding.
