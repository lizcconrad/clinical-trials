  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common post-operative deficiencies or complications of bariatric surgery is
      protein malnutrition. It may lead to many predicaments such as malnutrition, vitamin, micro-
      and macronutrient deficiencies that can lead to deleterious consequences. A protein-rich diet
      make a person feel satiety and thereby the consumption will be low in overall energy intake.
      The objectives of our study are. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of protein
      supplementation on changes in health parameters such as fat mass, muscle mass, weigh change,
      protein (total and albumin), Vit B12, Zinc and Magnesium, in Qatari patients post bariatric
      surgery. Our participants are Qatari aged 18-45 years males and females recruited from the
      bariatric surgery centers of 2 major HMC hospitals (HGH hospital) and will be randomized to
      receive either the protein supplement (treatment group) or a dietary advice (control group).
      All participants will be equally followed and monitored for 3 months and data on the above
      parameters will be collected, together with other population characteristics, at Baseline, 1
      month and 3 month. Data will then be analyzed using the most up-to-date SPSS statistical
      package to assess the effect of protein supplementation on the parameters of interest.
      Statistical measures will be carefully chosen to properly assess the difference in the
      treatment (protein supplementation) effect compared with the control (Dietary advice).
      Investigators hypothesize that Patients receiving protein supplement (intervention group)
      Compared with patient not on protein supplement (placebo group) will maintain weight loss and
      other essential health parameters.

    <masking_description>Investigators and researchers in this study will be blinded to the intervention, i.e. they will not be aware of who is on protein supplement and who is on placebo. Patients will also be blinded to the intervention, i.e. they will not know whether they are taking protein or zero protein supplement. For the blinding there will be a dietician who will assign the treatment and the control to patients as per the above randomization results. This dietician will also be responsible for filling the intervention &amp; control ready-to-feed shakes into identical bottles labeled either A or B, the dietician will not have any other responsibility such as data entry or follow up of participants as this will be done by the PI and research team, he will only be responsible for the blinding process.</masking_description>
