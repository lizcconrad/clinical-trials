    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the phenomenon of cardiovascular system response
      to maternal hyperoxygenation in the fetus with congenital heart disease(CHD), which can
      provide further insight into fetal adaptations to CHD and improve our understanding of the
      pathophysiology of these conditions.Cases are gravidas with fetal congenital heart disease
      diagnosed by echocardiography various gestational weeks.The baseline fetal echocardiography
      parameters has obtained from these gravidas.Then the participants received 10-15 minutes
      hyperoxygenation, and the accordingly fetal echocardiography parameters were obtained.The
      objective of the study includes:(1)To investigate the response of the MCA PI to maternal
      hyperoxygenation in various forms of CHD. Middle cerebral artery(MCA) pulsatility index (PI)
      at MH will be compared to baseline at various gestational ages in a variety of types of
      CHD;(2)To investigate the response of the umbilical artery (UA) PI to maternal
      hyperoxygenation in various forms of CHD. UA PI at MH will be compared to baseline at various
      gestational ages in a variety of CHD; (3)To study the response of myocardial diastolic
      function to MH in various forms of CHD. Diastolic inflow patterns across the tricuspid and
      mitral valves will be measured and ductus venosus flow pattern will be evaluated at MH and
      compared to baseline at various gestational ages in a variety of CHD;(4)To investigate for
      any changes in cardiac output and the ratio of flow between the right and left ventricles in
      response to MH in various forms of CHD;(5)To investigate for changes in flow pattern at the
      aortic isthmus in those with suspicion or clear evidence of coarctation of the aorta.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All singleton fetuses with CHD at all gestational ages are eligible for enrollment in
             the study. Patients will be recruited to enroll in the study as they present for
             clinical care at Fetal Echocardiography clinic. MH assessments will all be performed
             only at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital. Baseline room air data for CHD may be collected
             from other referring centers within the Anzhen network.

          -  Non-sinus rhythm, presence of arrhythmia; Fetal hydrops; Severe brain anomaly (which
             may influence MCA flow); Evidence for significant ventricular dysfunction; Evidence
             for constriction of the ductus arteriosus
