  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease in the world.
      It is currently unclear why fat starts to accumulate in the liver, although both the amount
      and type of food consumed have been implicated. The majority of studies that have
      investigated the effects of dietary fat or sugar on liver fat have fed volunteers excess
      calories, which are known to increase liver fat. The effect of specific dietary components,
      when consumed as part of a diet not containing excess calories, on liver fat accumulation
      remains unclear.

    <textblock>
      This research aims to investigate the role excessive consumption of specific macronutrients
      may play in the development of NAFLD. This will be achieved by subjecting participants to two
      specific dietary interventions (high-fat, low-carbohydrate and low-fat, high-carbohydrate) in
      a randomized, crossover research design. Liver fat content, and whole-body and hepatic
      fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism will be assessed before and after the specific
      dietary interventions.

    <description>Dietary intervention: Participants will consume a diet that is rich in saturated fat (20% total energy) and low in free sugars for 4 weeks. This diet will include commonly eaten foods such as butter, cheese, and fatty meat products. Total fat intake in this intervention will be 40-45% total energy.</description>

    <description>Dietary intervention: Participants will consume a diet that is low in saturated fat (~5% total energy) and rich in free sugars (20% total energy).The diet will include commonly eaten food and drink such as sugar sweetened beverages, confectionery (e.g. fruit gums) and table sugar.</description>
