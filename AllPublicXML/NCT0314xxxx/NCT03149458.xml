  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of hemiparetic patients have balance disorders, which impact independence in
      daily living activities and walking. Conventional techniques used in rehabilitation improve
      balance but have shown no effects on dynamic balance required during walking. Recently dance
      is proposed to improve dynamic balance in older people and people with Parkinson's disease.
      Although many studies showed that dance is an effective activity to improve balance in these
      people, it has never been assessed in hemiparetic patients (except a case report). The aim of
      this study is to show that a dance program improves the balance of hemiparetic patients,
      compared to a control group. This randomized controlled study aims to include 40 hemiparetic
      patients who will perform a dance program (experimental group) or a upper-limb rehabilitation
      program (control group) for 8 one-hour sessions.

      Randomized controlled study aims to include 40 hemiparetic patients who will perform a dance
      program (experimental group) or a upper-limb rehabilitation program (control group) for 8
      one-hour sessions. These activities are carried out in the form of a workshop and are already
      proposed in common practice in the service. They are carried out by the physiotherapists of
      the service. Patients are assigned in one of two study groups. It is specified that they will
      be able to carry out the program of the opposing group at the end of the study in order to
      limit the &quot;disappointment&quot; effect. The evaluations will be carried out at 4 and 8 weeks and
      will mainly rely on data of balance, function, quality of life and satisfaction
