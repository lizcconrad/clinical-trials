  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-blind, randomised, single centre, 2-way crossover pilot study to investigate the
      effectiveness of LAMELLEYE for the treatment of dry eye symptoms in patients with primary
      Sjögren's Syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 2-way crossover design comprising 2 treatments: the CE-marked LAMELLEYE dry
      eye drops, and a CE-marked comparator product. All Participants will be allocated to a
      treatment group in a random order.

      The study design allows observations to be made between the treatments at both an intra- and
      inter-patient level regarding relationships between the patient's disease specific quality of
      life, symptoms and adverse events, and satisfaction with treatments.
