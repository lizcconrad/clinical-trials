  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational trial designed to assess prospectively the adherence rate to AIs
      among women with invasive breast cancer (stages I-III) currently receiving AI adjuvant
      therapy after standard local and systemic therapy. We will study adherence by administrating
      the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS - 8).

      -  Women with breast cancer seen at the Texas Tech Physicians Breast Care Center will be
           recruited during their routine follow-up visit with their medical oncologist.

        -  Post - menopausal women with histologically confirmed hormonal positive (ER and/or PR)
           invasive breast cancer stages I - III with no evidence of metastatic disease (M0).

        -  Patients must be on one of AI (steroidal or non-steroidal).

        -  Patient must have completed local treatment (surgery /radiation) and recovered from all
           side effects of chemotherapy and surgery.

        -  Patient must be able to complete a demographic and the MMAS - 8 questionnaires in
