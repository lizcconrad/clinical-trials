  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective multi-centric Belgian observational trial will involve all patients who
      have initiated adalimumab for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis prior to September 1st
      2015 in a Belgian centre maintaining a prospective log of patients using biological therapy.

      Only patients fulfilling all Belgian reimbursement criteria for adalimumab will be included,
      namely having failed mesalamine and steroids or thiopurine analogues for at least 3 months,
      or being intolerant to this therapy, and showing a total Mayo score of at least 6 with an
      endoscopic sub-score of at least 2.

      Both short-term and long-term outcome of adalimumab therapy will be evaluated, focusing on
      the need and successfulness of adalimumab dose-escalation from 40mg every other week to 40mg
      every week, and dose de-escalation back to 40mg every other week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis after
      failure of aminosalicylates plus corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators.1-4 In the
      registration studies for adalimumab in ulcerative colitis prior anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) treatment was restricted; in ULTRA 1, prior anti-TNF treatment was an exclusion
      criterion,5 while in ULTRA 2, 40% of patients had been exposed to infliximab prior to start
      of adalimumab, but primary non-responders to infliximab were excluded.6 Open label real life
      studies have shown good responses to adalimumab in UC. However typically, these cohorts were
      small and most patients were anti-TNF naïve. One Italian open label study on 88 patients
      reported clinical remission rates of 28% and 43% at week 12 and year 1, respectively.7 No
      significant differences were observed between infliximab naïve and infliximab exposed UC
      patients. In a Belgian open label study of 73 patients previously failing infliximab, overall
      clinical response at week 12 and 52 were 75% and 52%, respectively.8 Adalimumab was continued
      without need for dose escalation throughout year 1 in 16 patients, 22 needed dose escalation
      and 35 discontinued treatment within 1 year. Prior response to infliximab and early serum
      concentrations correlated with response.

      While data are available in Crohn's disease,9 real life data on adalimumab dose escalation
      and dose de-escalation are limited in ulcerative colitis. Similarly, factors associated with
      need and success of dose escalation and dose de-escalation later on are almost absent.

Success of dose-escalation is defined based on a positive physician global assessment and absence of blood on two consecutive visits at least 3 months apart from each other. Of note: patients requiring a second intervention later on (addition of any type of steroids, addition of any immunomodulatory drug or optimization to off-label adalimumab 80 mg every week) will be regarded as failure (treatment optimization based on trough level monitoring or biomarkers alone will not be included)</description>
