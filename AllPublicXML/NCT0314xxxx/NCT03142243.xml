  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humans generally develop a preferred upper and lower extremity. Due to repetitive uneven
      loading, this gradually results in morphological adaptations to the dominant side of the
      body. The corresponding morphological asymmetry can be further accentuated by (intensively)
      practicing a unilateral sport such as tennis, which is very popular. Yet, research on this
      particular topic is scarce, especially in (elite) female players. Furthermore, existing
      studies only examine the degree of morphological asymmetry of the upper extremity. Therefore,
      the aim of this study is to explore the morphological differences between the dominant and
      the non-dominant extremity/side on a whole body level (trunk, upper and lower extremity) in
      elite female tennis players.

    <description>Side-to-side difference (i.e. dominant versus non-dominant upper and lower extremity) will be calculated and expressed as a percentage (extremity symmetry index (%)) for the outcome measures described above (i.e. fat mass, muscle mass, bone mass, bone mineral content and bone mineral density).
Extremity symmetry index = (measure dominant extremity or side / measure non-dominant extremity of side - 1) x 100</description>
