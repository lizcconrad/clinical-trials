  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of micropulse (MP)
      macular laser in combination with intravitreal aflibercept for the treatment of
      centre-involved diabetic macular edema.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema (DME) is one of the major causes of visual decline among diabetic
      patients. Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study has established focal/grid macular
      laser as the standard of treatment for clinically significant macular edema. More recently,
      intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents, either as monotherapy or in combination with
      focal/grid laser, have proven to be superior for the treatment of DME compared to laser
      alone.

      Micropulse (MP) macular laser involves applying the laser in a fraction of the time within
      very small pockets of energy. Unline traditional focal/grid macular laser, the micropulse
      method of delivery does not leave any visible burns on the retina.

      A recent release by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network has shown that
      deferring focal/grid laser and treating diabetic macular edema with only anti-VEGF may lead
      to better visual outcomes. Since MP laser does not have the undesired side effect of leaving
      laser scars on the macula, the study is to show that prompt MP laser in addition to anti-vegf
      injections may lead to better visual outcomes and/or decreased treatment burden without the
      undesired side effect of macular scarring.
