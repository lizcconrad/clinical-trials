  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare the immunogenicity, safety, and viral shedding of a
      new A/H1N1 strain that will be incorporated into the FluMist quadrivalent formulation for the
      2017-2018 influenza season with the previous A/H1N1 strain that was included in the vaccine
      in the 2015-2016 influenza season.

    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, multi-center study will enroll approximately 200 children 24
      to &lt; 48 months of age. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive two doses of
      either FluMist quadrivalent 2017-2018, FluMist quadrivalent 2015-2016 formulation, or FluMist
      trivalent 2015-2016 formulation.

      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to randomization. Randomization will be
      stratified according to whether the subject ever received prior influenza vaccination.
      Approximately 50% of the subjects will not have been previously vaccinated. All subjects will
      receive two doses of investigational product on Study Days 1 and 28, and followed for a
      28-day follow-up period after each dose. Blood and nasal samples will be collected and safety
      evaluations perfomed.

      The duration of subject participation is approximately 2 to 3 months. The study will be
      conducted during the influenza &quot;off-season&quot; in the US. After completion of the study all
      subjects will be offered and strongly encouraged to receive an inactivated influenza vaccine
      approved for use in the US for the 2017-2018 influenza season.
