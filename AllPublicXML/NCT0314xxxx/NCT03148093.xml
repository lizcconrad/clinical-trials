  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CHOICE Registry will describe real-world treatment patterns and physician and patient
      (and caregiver)-reported outcomes associated with patients who have progressed beyond 2nd
      line metastatic colorectal cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, non-interventional, observational, approach will be employed. All patient
      follow-up visits and other interactions will be established by the physician investigator:
      the CHOICE Registry will not impose a fixed schedule of follow-up visits. Data will be
      obtained in conjunction with actual follow-up visits to support treatment and various
      assessments of disease progression, patient quality of life and caregiver burden, and
      resource utilization. Patients will be followed for minimum of 15 months. All prescribed and
      administered medications, treatment adjustments and duration will be documented by the
      physician investigator treating the patient as per standard of care. The CHOICE Registry will
      not impose any change to the treatment regimen prescribed by physicians participating in the
      Registry. Adult males and females with metastatic colorectal cancer (having received first
      and second line treatment, and upon initiation of third line or later treatment) will be
      eligible to participate. Approximately 1000 patients will be enrolled by approximately 30 to
      40 physician investigators representing both community and academic medical centers in the
      United States. Descriptive statistics will be employed to address the key research objectives
      of the CHOICE Registry, such as a description of patients receiving various second (and/or
      subsequent) lines of treatment in the management of metastatic colorectal cancer in real
      world clinical settings, and the associated clinical, economic, and humanistic
      (patient-reported) outcomes.
