  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of trapeziometacarpal injections
      using palpation alone. The importance of this study is one of education, cost containment,
      and decreased risk to the patient. If it can be shown that the accuracy of trapeziometacarpal
      injections using palpation alone is similar to the reported accuracy of ultrasound and
      fluoroscopy, then these guided techniques may not be needed.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of trapeziometacarpal injections
      using palpation alone. If it can be shown that the accuracy of trapeziometacarpal injections
      using palpation alone is similar to the reported accuracy of ultrasound and fluoroscopy, then
      fluoroscopy and ultrasound guided techniques may not be needed. Due to the expenses
      associated with medications and testing, it is important to not accrue unnecessary costs if
      there is no perceived benefit. The investigators plan to enroll 50 patients presenting with
      trapeziometacarpal joint arthritis who agree to participate. These participants will undergo
      an injection technique consisting of palpating the base of the thumb and placing the needle
      into the trapeziometacarpal joint without the guidance of ultrasound or fluoroscopy. Contrast
      dye will be included in the standard injection of lidocaine and corticosteroid. After
      injection, the participant will have 2 fluoroscopy views of the thumb. The images will not be
      evaluated for injection accuracy prior to the patient leaving the clinic, so as to not
      introduce any bias by the treating physician. These images will be blindly reviewed by three
      investigators at a later date, and determined by consensus if there is contrast material in
      the joint. The accuracy rate can then be compared to data regarding accuracy of fluoroscopic
      and ultrasound guided injections of the trapeziometacarpal joint. If there is a similar
      accuracy rate between modalities, it can be concluded that ultrasound may not be worth the
      added cost to the patient and fluoroscopy may not be worth the added cost or radiation to the
      participant. Additionally, participants will be contacted at 6 weeks post injection to
      evaluate post-injection arthritis symptoms.
