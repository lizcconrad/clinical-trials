  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify and describe the presence of itch active molecules in psoriasis
      and response to treatment with apremilast. This data will be complemented by
      immunohistochemical data determining nerve ending density and neuropeptide concentrations
      before and during treatment and correlated with patient reported outcome. It is important to
      underscore that itch may interfere with various aspects of patient functioning, emotions and
      social status and should therefore be adequately addressed while treating patients with
      psoriasis
