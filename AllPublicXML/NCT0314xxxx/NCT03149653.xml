  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of ClinOleic or Lipoplus or
      SMOFlipid lipid emulsions. After 6 weeks of each lipid emulsion, Omegaven (fish oil) was
      added for a further 4 weeks. The safety and tolerance was evaluated after each lipid emulsion
      cycle by biochemistry, hematology and coagulation variables, vital signs and adverse events.
      We also analysed fatty acid profiles in plasma or erythrocyte phospholipids, antioxidant
      enzyme activities, lipid peroxidation products, plasma lipids and pro-inflammatory cytokine
      production after in vitro stimulation of whole blood by lipopolysacharide in HPN patients.
      The non-interventional group of healthy controls was included for comparison.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous lipid emulsions (LEs) are an indispensable part of home parenteral nutrition
      (HPN). All commercially obtainable LEs are applicable for HPN in providing a source of energy
      and essential fatty acids. The originally used soyabean oil-based LE (Intralipid) have been
      suspected of being associated with a higher risk of pro-inflammatory lipid-mediator
      production due to their high content of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The more modern
      mixes of soyabean oil, and/or olive oil, and/or fish oil LEs with beneficial responses
      compared with Intralipid are available. Given that there are no clear clinical
      recommendations for LE application in HPN, we performed this cross-over design, phase 4 study
      comparing ClinOleic, Lipoplus or SMOFlipid in chronic intestinal failure patients with
      additional escalation of fish oil using Omegaven.
