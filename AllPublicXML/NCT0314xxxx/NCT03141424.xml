    <textblock>
      Background: Asthma is a common chronic condition characterized by respiratory symptoms and
      hyperresponsive airways. According to treatment guidelines, patients with persistent asthma
      require daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). However, certain subgroups of
      asthma patients such as non-eosinophilic asthma patients do not respond well to the ICS
      treatment. In the present study, asthma patients treated with ICS and exhibiting low levels
      of eosinophilic biomarkers such as S-periostin, FeNO and blood eosinophils, are randomized
      1:1 to either 1) tapering of ICS or 2) usual care. Thus, the aim of the present study is to
      investigate whether patients with non-eosinophilic asthma can sustain their level of disease
      control during ICS tapering.

      Design: This is a randomized, controlled, one-center, non-inferiority study of ICS tapering
      in patients with non-eosinophilic asthma.

      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: 1) Objectively secured asthma diagnosis, 2) Age 18-65
      years, 3) ICS treatment equivalent to Budesonide 800 microgr daily or more with at least 80%
      adherence, 4) Serum-periostin &lt; 50 ng/ml, 5) FeNO&lt;20 ppb at all prior visits, 6)
      Blood-eosinophils&lt;0.15 at screening, 7) no allergic asthma history, 8) never daily smoker, 9)
      no other respiratory diasease, 10) no daily treatment with immunosuppressives, 11) no
      pregnancy, and 12) no history of drug or alcohol abuse.

      Endpoints: Primary: Change in Control Questionnaire (ACQ) from baseline to post-tapered ICS
      and time from baseline to drop-out. Secondary: Change in FeNO, change in Serum-Periostin,
      change in FEV1, change in blood-eosinophils.

      Methods: Relevant patients will be recruited from Respiratory Outpatient Wards. In total, 110
      patients will be required. Visits will be performed at screening, at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16,
      26, 52. In the active arm, ICS dosage will be reduced to 50% at week 0 and removed at week 8.
      All visits include ACQ, FeNO, spirometry, blood eosinophils. S-periostin will be measured at
      screening and at week 8 and 16.
