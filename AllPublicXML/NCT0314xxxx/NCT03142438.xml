      This investigation is a prospective, non randomized, non blinded study. This investigation is
      designed to evaluate the performance, comfort and ease of use with the F&amp;P trial full face
      and nasal mask amongst Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients. Up to 70 OSA patients will be
      recruited from the North Texas Lung and Sleep Clinic (NTLSC) database

      Visit 1 will involve the participants being fitted with the F&amp;P trial full face or nasal mask
      for use in-home.

      The participant will then come in to return the mask (Visit Two) and have a final interview,
      this ensures the maximum time participants will be exposed to the trial mask in home will be
      14 ± 4 days from visit one.

      The mask will be returned to the Institution at the conclusion of the trial and the
      participant will return to their previous mask. The Institution will recruit all patients
      within three weeks of the beginning of the study.
