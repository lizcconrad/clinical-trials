  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and the recommended phase two dose (RPTD), and to assess the safety, preliminary
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-176 for participants with advanced solid
      tumors likely to express Prolactin Receptor (PRLR). The study will consist of 2 cohorts: Dose
      Escalation and Expanded Recommended Phase 2 Dose.
