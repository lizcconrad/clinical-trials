    <textblock>
      Anti-Cytokine Therapy for Hemodialysis InflammatION (ACTION) is a phase II multi-center study
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, for
      patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ACTION Trial will enroll 80 participants being treated with maintenance hemodialysis for
      end-stage renal disease. Participants will be randomized to receive Anakinra, 100 mg
      administered intravenously 3 times per week at the end of the hemodialysis session, or
      matched placebo. The duration of study drug administration is 24 weeks. There will be an
      additional 24 weeks of follow-up after study drug administration has been completed.

    <description>Anakinra (Kineret®) is a therapeutic agent that blocks the effects of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta by competitively binding to the interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI). Anakinra is a recombinant, non-glycosylated form of the naturally occurring human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra).
Anakinra will be supplied in pre-filled syringes as a sterile, clear, colorless-to-white, preservative free solution. Each syringe will contain 100 mg in 0.67 ml solution (pH 6.5) containing disodium EDTA (0.12 mg), sodium chloride (5.48 mg), sodium citrate (1.29 mg), and polysorbate 80 (0.70 mg) in Water for Injection, USP.</description>

    <description>Anakinra (Kineret®) is a therapeutic agent that blocks the effects of IL-1α and IL-1β by competitively binding to the interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI). It is a recombinant, non-glycosylated form of the naturally occurring human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) but differs from human IL-1Ra in that it has the addition of a single methionine residue at the amino terminus. It is supplied commercially in single use 1 ml prefilled glass syringes as a sterile, clear, colorless-to-white, preservative free solution. Each syringe contains: 0.67 ml (100 mg) of anakinra in a solution (pH 6.5) containing sodium citrate (1.29 mg), sodium chloride (5.48 mg), disodium EDTA (0.12 mg) and polysorbate 80 (0.70 mg) in Water for Injection, USP.</description>
