  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although taste influences food choices and favours diseases like obesity, there is no
      consensus about the existence of correlations between bitterness and anthropometric
      variables. Also, an electronic-based method for data collection could provide a more
      appropriate way for the evaluation of taste perception and save time.

      The objective is to search for correlations between bitterness and anthropometric variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study evaluating correlations between the bitterness rates given on a
      generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale, anthropometrics and other variables. Bitterness
      perceptions at the tip of the tongue (TOTp) and at the whole mouth (WMp) were recorded using
      a locally developed novel cloud-based software (Cloud-gLMS). The ANCOVA test was adjusted
      using TOTp and WMp as dependent variables and age, height, weight, BMI, gender, waist
      circumference, alcohol intake, comorbidities, and use of medications as independent
      variables.
