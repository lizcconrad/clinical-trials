  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction appears to contribute to slow weaning from
      mechanical ventilation. Several trials of inspiratory muscle training to facilitate weaning
      in intensive care have been performed, with inconsistent results, utilizing different methods
      of IMT in different populations.

      To perform the best IMT program, we need to know the physio-pathology of the diaphragm in
      difficult to wean patients.

      This study proposes to discriminate the two main characteristics of the inspiratory muscles:
      strength and endurance.

      By analyzing the evolution of strength and endurance during all the weaning period, we want
      to know which characteristic has the more deficiency to adapt in a second time an effective
      program of IMT.

      The main objective of this study is to determinate which characteristic of inspiratory
      muscles between strength and endurance has more deficiency in difficult to wean patients. In
      a second time, the results of this study will help to choose the best IMT program to assess
      his impact on the weaning time.

      We are going to conduct an interventional trial because of Peak Pressure measure, which is
      not measure in care practice. Following 18h of invasive mechanical ventilation in a
      controlled mode, the failure of the first single breathe trial of 2 hours and the presence of
      sevrability criterias defined by the European consensus conference in 2007, 80 participants
      will be included in the medical intensive care unit of Bordeaux's hospital. We'll perform
      measurements of the Maximal Inspiratory Pressure and Peak Pressure from the inclusion to the
      extubation.
