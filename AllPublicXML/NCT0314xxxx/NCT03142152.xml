    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial is to assess
      the safety and efficacy of the CARILLON Mitral Contour System in treating subjects with
      functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) associated with heart failure, compared to a randomized
      Control group which is medically managed according to heart failure guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 400 subjects will be randomized at up to 50 investigational sites in the United
      States, Canada, Europe and Australia. Subjects will be randomized into one of two study
      groups using a 2:1 (Intervention : Control) ratio.

      Study subjects who are eligible for this clinical study will undergo a transthoracic
      echocardiographic examination prior to randomization to evaluate the inclusion criteria
      associated with the severity of mitral regurgitation. A coronary angiogram will also be
      performed to evaluate the coronary artery anatomy as a final eligibility (screening)
      assessment. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized into one of two
      study groups (Intervention or Control).

      Study subjects will undergo a venogram to assess the suitability of the coronary sinus/great
      cardiac vein (CS/GCV) for placement of the CARILLON implant. If the subject meets the
      anatomic requirements for device placement, the subject will be randomized.

      Subjects randomized to the Intervention group will undergo the CARILLON implant procedure.
      With the distal aspect of the device anchored, incremental tension will be applied to plicate
      the peri-annular tissue. A transesophageal or transthoracic echocardiogram will be obtained
      before, during and after device placement to quantitate the degree of functional mitral
      regurgitation and to evaluate left ventricular function. After the proximal anchor of the
      implant is locked in place, safety and efficacy will be reconfirmed prior to releasing the
      CARILLON implant from the delivery system.

      Subjects randomized to the Control group will experience an index procedure similar to the
      Intervention group (without device placement) to ensure that they will not be able to deduce
      the group assignment based on the type of intervention or time associated with the procedure.

      After the study subjects are discharged, the subjects' primary care specialists
      (cardiologist/heart failure physician) and clinical investigation site staff will coordinate
      follow-up evaluations. Subjects will be evaluated at one (1), six (6), twelve (12), eighteen
      (18) and twenty-four (24) months post-implant, to assess long-term safety, and functional and
      clinical status.

      After the 24-month evaluation, Control subjects and Intervention subjects who did not get a
      CARILLON implant (e.g., due to venous dissection or other procedural complication -
      &quot;Non-Implanted&quot;), may be unblinded and offered the option of receiving the CARILLON device as
      part of a Cross-Over Registry, at the discretion of the study physician and patient.

      All implanted Intervention subjects and those Control and Non-Implanted subjects who do not
      Cross-Over will be followed with an abbreviated annual contact for an additional three (3)
      years for a total of five (5) years.
