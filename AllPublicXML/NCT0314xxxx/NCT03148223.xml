  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if auriculotherapy is effective in the treatment of
      dysmenorrhoea. This intervention consists of fixation of yellow mustard seeds at specific
      points of the auricular pavilion (or area), with opaque tape. Half of the participants will
      have specific ear pinch points stimulated by mustard seeds fixed with opaque plaster, while
      the other half will have only the adhesive plasters fixed, without the seeds for stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhoea is responsible for the most part of dissatisfactions in the female
      class, in the face of discomforts which are caused monthly. For this, the income index of
      this woman in the work environment tends to reduce, thus harming the development of every
      sector to which she responds. The expected effects, after the intervention, will be positive,
      favoring a considerable improvement of the symptoms reported by the women. We chose
      auriculotherapy because it is a non-medicated, noninvasive intervention that is inexpensive.

    <masking_description>Participants will not be informed which group they belong to, intervention or control. Who will apply the treatment will not be blind, since during the treatment it will know if the points to be stimulated must contain seeds of mustard or just plaster, but will not have previous knowledge of the members of the groups. The evaluator, who is responsible for applying the pre- and post-treatment evaluation instruments, will be blind and not aware of the research intervention. The data analyst will also be early for the intervention group.</masking_description>
