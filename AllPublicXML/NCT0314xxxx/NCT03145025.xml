    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm, observational evaluation of the
      corneal ECD change from baseline for subjects having the Retisert FA drug delivery system
      (0.59 mg) surgically implanted in the ocular vitreous chamber of at least 1 previously
      unimplanted eye for at least 1 year.

        Subjects having the Retisert FA drug delivery system (0.59 mg) surgically implanted in the
        ocular vitreous chamber of at least 1 previously unimplanted eye for at least 1 year

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are scheduled for surgical placement of a Retisert fluocinolone acetonide (FA)
             intravitreal implant in a previously unimplanted eye.

          2. Are able and willing to comply with all treatment and follow up/study procedures.

          3. Able and willing to provide informed consent or, for subjects 12-18 years of age, have
             the ability to understand and provide assent (when applicable) and whose
             parent/legally authorized representative has the ability to understand and provide
             written informed consent on the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed
             consent form (ICF) and provide authorization as appropriate for local privacy
             regulations.

          4. For female subjects:

        Note: Should a subject conceive during the study, the pregnancy should be reported as soon
        as possible to the study Medical Monitor and Promedica International within 24 hours. The
        pregnancy will be followed up to term. The subject will continue in the studyregardless if
        pregnancy is reported on an AE/SAE form. If an Investigator becomes aware of a post study
        pregnancy 30 days after the study exit visit while Fluocinolone Acetonide Implant remains
        in the subject's study eye, then it should be reported as a post-marketing report

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has previously, concurrently or anticipated enrollment in Bausch &amp; Lomb study 440,
             titled, &quot;An Observational Bilateral Evaluation of Corneal Endothelial Cell Density in
             Subjects Who Have Had a Fluocinolone Acetonide Implant for at Least One Year.&quot;

          2. Has severe/serious ocular pathology or medical condition that could result in the
             subject's inability to complete the study, based on the judgment of the Investigator.

          3. Has participated in an ophthalmic drug or device research study within 30 days prior
             to Screening (Visit 1, Day -30 to -1) in this study

          4. Is monocular (unable to detect hand motion at 6 feet in 1 eye).

          5. Has a known corneal dystrophy or corneal transplant.

          6. Has a history of ocular surgery in the eye scheduled for implant surgery, including
             laser procedures, within the 30 days prior to Screening (Visit 1, Day -30 to -1).

          7. Had any type of intraocular drug delivery implant (eg, Retisert, Ozurdex
             [dexamethasone intravitreal implant]) in the study eye.
