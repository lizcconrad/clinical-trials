  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) describes a group of disorders in which partial or complete
      cessation of breathing occurs many times throughout the night, resulting in daytime
      sleepiness or fatigue that interferes with a person's ability to function and reduces quality
      of life. Transplantation has become an important treatment modality for end-stage organ
      failure. Transplant recipients are now living longer and, hence, develop chronic adverse
      medical conditions. Furthermore, transplantation is associated with weight gain. Despite the
      high prevalence of poor sleep and cardiovascular conditions among transplant patients, SDB is
      not well studied in these patients.

      The primary research objective is to evaluate the prevalence, incidence and type (central or
      obstructive) of SDB in patients after lung transplantation.

      Secondary research objectives are the evaluation of correlations between severity of SDB and
      clinical findings (weight, medical therapy, heart function, lung function, renal function,
      graft failure, â€¦). Furthermore, the investigators will evaluate the relationship between SDB
      and cardiovascular morbidity.
