  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this retrospective study was to compare immediate postoperative pain scores and
      the need for rescue analgesia in children who underwent pulpotomies and general restorative
      treatment and those who underwent general restorative treatment only, all under general
      anaesthesia.

    <textblock>
      Ninety patients aged between 3 and 7 years who underwent full mouth dental rehabilitation
      under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study and reviewed. The experimental group
      included patients who were treated with at least one pulpotomy, and the control group was
      treated with dental fillings only. The Wong-Baker FACES scale was used to evaluate
      self-reported pain and the need for rescue analgesia. The data were analysed using the
      Kruskal-Wallis test, two sample t- tests, chi-square tests and Pearson's correlation
      analysis.

          -  Patients with at least 1 pulpotomy were included in the experimental group (n=45), and
             patients treated with dental fillings only were included in the control group (n=45);
             a total of 90 patients were eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with special needs and those with any systematic problem (cardiac disease,
