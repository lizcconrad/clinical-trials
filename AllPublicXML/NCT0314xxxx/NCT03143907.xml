  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has suggested that mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) for psychosis may be
      effective in reducing the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., social withdrawal, lack
      of motivation) and the distress associated with psychotic symptoms (e.g., hearing voices) and
      could lead to improvements in functioning and quality of life. MBI research to date has
      primarily focused on studies of patients with chronic psychotic illness, yet relatively
      little is known about the use of MBIs for youth recovering from their first episode of
      psychosis. Results from recently published pilot studies appear promising in terms of the
      feasibility, acceptability, and potential clinical utility (e.g., improved psychological
      symptoms) of MBIs for the early psychosis population (Ashcroft et al., 2012; van der Valk et
      al., 2013; Khoury et al., 2015). The current project team has completed a pilot study at the
      Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychoses (PEPP) at London Health Sciences
      Centre (LHSC), wherein the &quot;Mindfulness Ambassador Council&quot; (MAC), a 12-week facilitated
      group intervention promoting mindfulness skills and the development of emotional and social
      competencies, was shown to be an effective, feasible, and acceptable means of treating youth
      in the early stages of psychotic illnesses. In follow up to the initial pilot study, the
      purpose of this study is to perform a multi-site Randomized Control Trial to determine the
      effectiveness of the MAC group intervention on reducing psychotic disorder symptomatology for
      transitional aged youth experiencing early psychosis. The main hypothesis, based on previous
      findings on the use of MBIs in psychotic disorders, including results from our initial pilot
      study at PEPP, is that youth with early psychosis who participate in the MAC group
      intervention will experience a reduction in their negative and positive symptoms of psychosis
      and affective symptoms compared to those receiving treatment as usual (TAU). Furthermore, we
      expect that youth experiencing early psychosis who participate in MAC will have an
      improvement in their quality of life, measures of recovery (self-esteem, perceived recovery),
      perceived coping, assertiveness, mindfulness and cognitive skills, and a reduction in
      healthcare service utilization (e.g., emergency room visits, inpatient admissions/length of
      hospitalization).

      The purpose of this multi-site RCT is to determine the effectiveness of the MAC group
      intervention on reducing psychotic disorder symptomatology (primary outcome) as well as
      promoting quality of life, critical skills for recovery and decreasing mental health service
      utilization (secondary outcomes) for transitional aged youth (16-25 years old) experiencing
      early psychosis. This study will be run across five southern Ontario Early Psychosis
      Intervention (EPI) sites with Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychoses (PEPP)
      at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) being the lead site. We aim to recruit 24
      participants from each the five EPI programs for the study (total n=120 participants).
      Participants will be randomized into Group-A (n = 12; immediate treatment intervention group)
      or Group-B (n = 12; delayed treatment intervention group). Group-A will receive the MAC
      intervention at the onset of the study, while Group-B will receive treatment as usual (TAU).
      Group-B will have the option of receiving the MAC intervention approximately 6 months after
      the onset of the study. At all times during this study, participants who are receiving the
      MAC intervention will also be able to continue receiving TAU. Both groups will be assessed
      with a battery of quantitative measures at baseline (T1), three months later (i.e.,
      immediately post-MAC intervention) (T2), and again three months post-MAC intervention (T3).
      The measures include interview assessments of psychotic disorder symptoms, and self-report
      measures of affect, self-esteem, quality of life, coping strategies, assertiveness, social
      functioning, mindfulness and cognitive skills. In addition, healthcare utilization records
      for the 6 months preceding MAC intervention onset and for the 6 month duration of the study
      (3 month MAC intervention + 3 month post-MAC intervention follow-up period) will be
      collected. Researchers conducting symptom assessment interviews and data analysis will be
      blinded to the group membership of participants. Based on the pilot study at PEPP-LHSC, and
      based on previous findings of Mindfulness Based Interventions for psychoses in the
      literature, we are expecting that participation in the MAC intervention will result in
      improvement in the following areas: quality of life, measures of recovery (self-esteem,
      perceived recovery), perceived coping, assertiveness, social functioning, mindfulness and
      cognitive skills, and a reduction in healthcare service utilization (e.g., emergency room
      visits, inpatient admissions/length of hospitalization).

    <description>MAC is a 12-week facilitated group mindfulness intervention promoting the development of social-emotional competence in youth created by Mindfulness Without Borders (MWB; www.mwb.org). A meditative practice, mindfulness focuses one's awareness on the present, acknowledging and accepting without judging one's feelings, thoughts, or bodily sensations. Each session has a unique focus (e.g., paying attention, practicing gratitude) and consists of facilitated group learning, discussion and mindfulness skills practice. Home assignments to help reinforce specific lesson are also assigned. MAC has demonstrated acceptability, feasibility, and promising beneficial effects in schools, and in the pilot study conducted at the Early Psychosis Program at London Health Sciences Centre in London, Ontario. Its youth-focus and emphasis on building social and emotional competencies through mindfulness make it a promising intervention for youth recovering from their first episode of psychosis.</description>
