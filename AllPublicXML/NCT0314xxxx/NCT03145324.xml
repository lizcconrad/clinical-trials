      To collect the immunisation history of participants enrolled in a previous vaccine study (REC
      09/H0604/107) in order to assess the influence of genetic variation on the level of immunity
      to routine immunisations.

    <textblock>
      Children aged 6 month to 13 years were enrolled in a study to compare the immunogenicity and
      safety of adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines during the 2009 pandemic influenza
      season. Nine-hundred and forty-nine children were recruited from 5 UK centres: Oxford,
      Southampton, Bristol, Exeter, and London

      In the previous study, DNA was collected when individuals provided appropriate consent, to
      explore the genetic determinants of responses to vaccination. Although, study participants
      consented for their medical records to be reviewed by members of the study team, and for
      these data as well as anonymised serum samples to be used in future research, routine
      immunisation histories were not collected before this study closed.

      In this study we wish to collect the full vaccination history of participants, as this
      information will be extremely important in interpreting results. We propose sending a letter
      to parents/guardians informing them of the study and asking whether they are willing for
      members of the study team to approach their general practitioner or the child health computer
      system in order to retrieve these records. Immunisation histories will then be included with
      other non-identifiable information needed for analysis, and samples unlinked from personal
      identifiers prior to analysis.
