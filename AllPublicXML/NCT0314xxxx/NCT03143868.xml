  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about how type of exercise influences measures of appetite
      regulation. In this study, investigators will be evaluating a resistance exercise session
      (using weight machines and free weights) and an aerobic exercise session (using a treadmill).
      Participants will also complete a sedentary control condition.

      A secondary purpose is to compare sex-based differences in appetite-indices in response to
      exercise. Therefore, the responses to aerobic and resistance exercise will also be compared
      between men and women.
