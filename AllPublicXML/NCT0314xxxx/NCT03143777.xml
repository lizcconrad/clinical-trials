    <textblock>
      This study investigates the impact of introducing an early mobilisation device called the
      Sara Combilizer on time taken to mobilise in critical care. The investigators will collect
      baseline data on time taken to mobilise for a period of 4 months, then following a training
      programme and introduction of the device for a further 4 months

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early mobility within the ICU is associated with a number of positive outcomes including
      reductions in ICU and hospital length of stay and better functional recovery. The exact
      definition of 'early' mobility is still not defined, with the actual ability to mobilize
      limited by a number of perceived factors.

      The Sara Combilizer is a combined tilt table and stretcher chair, which allows passive
      transfer of patients out of bed. It is theorized the passive and safe nature of transfer may
      facilitate earlier mobilisation of patients within critical care. This study aimed to assess
      whether the introduction of the Sara Combilizer reduced time taken to first mobilize for
      patients mechanically ventilated for at least 5 days and at risk of ICU acquired weakness.

      Patients admitted to a large UK critical care unit during the trial period and ventilated for
      ≥ 5 days were included in the study. Baseline data was collected prospectively for a period
      of 4 months. The Sara Combilizer was then introduced for a 1 month training and
      familiarization period, followed by a further 4 months prospective data collection.
