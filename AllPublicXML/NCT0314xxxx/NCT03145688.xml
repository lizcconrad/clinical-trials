    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine physical activity habit formation in parents and if
      this can increase moderate to vigorous physical activity behavior in their children over six
      months. The Primary Research Question is:

      Does the habit formation condition result in increased moderate-vigorous intensity physical
      activity of the child compared to the control (education) and education + planning conditions
      at six months? Hypothesis: Child physical activity will be higher for the habit formation
      condition in comparison to the more standard physical activity education and planning
      conditions at six months.

      Secondary Research Questions

        1. Does the habit formation condition improve child health-related quality of life, and
           health-related fitness outcomes compared to the control and planning conditions at six
           months? Hypothesis: Child health-related fitness and quality of life will be higher for
           the habit formation condition in comparison to the control and planning conditions.

        2. Can group differences among behavioural, and health-related fitness outcomes be
           explained through a mediation model? Hypothesis: The covariance of the assigned
           conditions (habit formation, planning + education, education control) on child physical
           activity will be explained by parental support habit, and through the use of consistency
           and cues regulation strategies (i.e., manipulation check). In turn, the covariance
           between support habit and health-related outcomes will be explained by physical activity
           among conditions. The habit formation condition will not affect parental support
           intentions or underlying outcome expectations (benefits of physical activity) for
           support of child physical activity because its effect on behavior is to tie initial
           intentions to behavioural action or to work independent of goals and intentions.

        3. Is there an intergenerational, seasonal, or gender difference across primary outcomes by
           assigned condition? Hypothesis: Parents in the habit formation condition will show
           higher physical activity via some activities being performed with their children in
           comparison to the other conditions. No differences in gender or season are hypothesized
           but these are exploratory research questions because there is limited research at
           present [28] to make any definitive statement.

    <description>Behavioural: Family Physical Activity Habit formation. The Habit formation intervention condition will receive the same content as the education control condition and the physical activity planning condition but with additional material on creating physical activity support habits. The material includes a brief discussion of what habits are with some very straightforward examples such as preparing for sleep routines or initiating to drive a car to work. A key component of the habit section will be based on planning for context-dependent repetition, with pointers on how to maintain repetition as habit forms.</description>
