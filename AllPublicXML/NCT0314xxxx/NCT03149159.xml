    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if continued nivolumab with the addition of ipilimumab
      plus hypo-fractionated stereotactic radiation (sTR) of a single lesions results in partial or
      complete responses in patients with metastatic ccRCC who fail initial treatment with single
      agent nivolumab.

          -  Presence of a metastatic lesion greater than 1 cm in size that is amenable to
             radiation treatment

          -  Adequate organ system function

          -  WOCBP and men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use appropriate

             metastases (exceptions outlined in the protocol).

          -  Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus,
             that require treatment with immune suppressing drugs.

        Note: Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,

        absence of an external trigger

          -  Presence of a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10
             mg daily prednisone or equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration.

        Note: Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone
        equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Unstable angina or uncontrolled congestive heart failure

          -  Uncontrolled hypercalcemia

          -  History of allergy to study drug components.

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.

          -  Anti-cancer treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, other
             immunotherapy, or investigational therapy within 14 days of registration.

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. WOCBP must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 7 days
             prior to registration.

          -  Any other medical condition for which treatment with ipilimumab or nivolumab would be
             medically contraindicated
