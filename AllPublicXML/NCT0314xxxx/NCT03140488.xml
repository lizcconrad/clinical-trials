  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is considered one of the biggest public health concern of the 21st century and
      increases the risk of many comorbid medical conditions. Obesity in pregnancy places women at
      higher risk of obstetrical complications during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum. In
      particular, obese pregnant women have more difficulty going into labor, a longer labor
      course, and even with pharmacologic treatment, have a higher chance of requiring cesarean
      delivery.

      When pregnant women need help going into labor, they commonly receive a medication called
      Pitocin on the labor and delivery floor. Pitocin is the brand name and is a synthetic analog
      to the naturally produced oxytocin, a hormone secreted by mother when they naturally go into
      labor. This medication has been used widely around the world. There is emerging evidence that
      obese women need more oxytocin to go into labor compared to their lean cohorts. There are
      many studies to support the use of different oxytocin dosages and are currently supported by
      the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Despite these evidences, a low dose
      oxytocin regimen is universally used in the United States, regardless of patient
      characteristics.

      This study is a double blinded randomized controlled trial. Both lean and obese cohorts will
      be recruited for the study. The investigators will randomly place both cohorts into the low
      or the high dose oxytocin regimen treatment group. The investigators, patients and providers
      will be blinded and will not know the specific assignments. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of high dose oxytocin in the obese cohort. The hypothesis is that obese
      patient will have shorter time to delivery with the high dose oxytocin regimen without
      incurring any additional risks or adverse outcomes.

    <masking_description>This portion of the study will be carried out by the research pharmacy. Single (low dose) and triple (high dose) concentration of oxytocin will be premixed in the intravenous fluid bag in the pharmacy. Sequence generation for randomization will be created with 1:1 ratio in both the obese and lean group by the Department of Statistics. After the sequence is generated, ths list will be given to the research pharmacy. The premixed oxytocin medication will be sequentially labelled as &quot;OPS drug, patient #1, 2, 3&quot; etc. per the allocation. Allocation concealment will also be carried out by pharmacy as these bags will completely appear identical after they are labelled numerically. Once a patient is randomized, the pharmacy will send up the appropriate concentration of oxytocin already premixed in the intravenous fluid bag, labelled as &quot;OPS drug, patient #&quot;. Lean group will be assigned at # 1-70 and obese group will be assigned at #71-140.</masking_description>
