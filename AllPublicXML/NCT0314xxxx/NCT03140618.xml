  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The care environment influences both patients' experiences of care as well as staff's
      experiences of the work environment. A radical change in physical environment is planned at a
      psychiatric ward, aiming at creating a care environment that supports patients' opportunities
      for recovery from mental ill-health and to create a better and more attractive work
      environment for the staff. The rebuilding involves a new ward layout and new innovations such
      as light installations, a comfort room and an activity room.

      The study uses a single-system design to evaluate the effects of the intervention - the
      rebuilt ward. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be used in the evaluation. Data
      will be collected using questionnaires measuring dimensions of patients' well-being and
      experiences of the care environment, staff's experiences of work-related stress and work
      environment, quality of care, a device measuring physical activity, existing clinical
      registers and data from medical files, staff' sick leave, participant observations, and
      semi-structured interviews.

      This evaluation study, to our knowledge the first of it's kind in Sweden, is expected to
      generate important knowledge of the effect of the change process that can be used at other
      psychiatric wards to design the inpatient care environment. In the long run, the study could
      lead to a better reputation of psychiatric nursing and to more attractive workplaces.
