  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the ability of OncAlert™ to screen for cancer and the
      reappearance of cancer. OncAlert™ was developed by Vigilant Biosciences, a collaborator in
      this research study. OncAlert™ is an oral rinse which is spit into a cup and sent to a
      laboratory for analysis. OncAlert™ is considered experimental by the FDA because it is not
      approved for the screening of cancer.

    <description>The agreement between CD44 ELISA and BCA test as measured using the POC test (OncAlert) and central laboratory testing at Vigilant The concordance of these two measures will be assessed using Cohen's kappa statistic for a dichotomized outcome (positive vs. negative test). A kappa of 0.6 or lower will be considered of insufficient concordance, and the minimum required level indicating adequate concordance is a kappa of 0.8
The sensitivity and specificity of the OncAlert test to detect OOPSCC in cases compared to a non cancer control population.
A specificity of 0.65 minimally acceptable for the Vigilant POC test. In order to demonstrate a clinically acceptable level of specificity, a performance goal of 0.75 is chosen</description>
