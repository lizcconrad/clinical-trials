      To evaluate and compare the effect of administration of intravenous ketorolac- midazolam or
      dexmedetomidine as adjuvants to general anesthesia on perioperative outcome during retinal
      surgery.

      regarding patient registry; G power analysis was done was done to estimate the sample size.
      Assuming alpha (type I error) = 0.05 and beta (type II error) = 0.2 (power =80%), 18 patients
      per group would be sufficient to detect a difference 20 % in hemodynamics indices among the
      groups. A drop out 10% of cases was expected therefore 20 patients were required in each
      group to detect the difference.

      - Statistical analysis: Data will be analyzed through SPSS (Statistical Package for Social
      Sciences). Program version 22. Distribution of data will be first tested by
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data is presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), median and
      range or numbers and percentages. For normally distributed data, one way ANOVA test will be
      used to compare between mean values of three groups with post hoc Bonferroni test for paired
      comparisons. Repeated measures ANOVA with post hock Bonferroni will be used for intra-groupal
      comparisons. For non-parametric data, Kruskal Wallis H test to compare between median values
      of 3 groups with Mann Whitney U test for paired comparisons. Chi Square test will be used for
      testing significance of categorical data. The P value â‰¤ 0.05 was considered as the level of
      statistical significance
