        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of leukemia or CD19 + lymphoma, with a life expectancy less than 2 years
             that meet the following conditions:- Adult acute lymphoid leukemia in second or third
             response, not candidate for transplantation due to age, associated diseases or lack of
             donor, or in relapse post allogeneic transplant.- Pediatric acute lymphoid leukemia in
             second or third response, refractory or non-transplant candidate due to donor absence,
             or in relapse post allogeneic transplant, or with minimal residual residual disease
             (0.1% or greater) after two or more lines of treatment. - Symptomatic follicular
             lymphoma, which has received at least 2 treatment regimens (one of them including
             rituximab) and a progression-free interval of less than 2 years. Patients not
             candidates for transplantation or post-transplant relapse may be included.-
             Symptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has received at least 2 treatment
             regimens (one of them including rituximab) and a progression-free survival of less
             than 2 years. Patients with a 17p deletion or TP53 mutation may be included after the
             first line of treatment. - Mantle cell lymphoma in the first relapse (or higher) when
             it is not a candidate for transplantation, or second post-transplant relapse (or
             higher). - Diffuse large cell lymphoma in first relapse (or higher) when it is not a
             candidate for transplantation, or second post-transplant relapse (or higher).

             calculated glomerular filtrate rate &lt;30 ml / min; Or bilirubin&gt; 3 times the upper
             limit of normal (unless it is due to CLL or Gilbert syndrome).

             pregnancy test in the screening phase.

          -  Women of childbearing age, including those whose last menstrual cycle was in the year
             prior to screening, who are unable or unwilling to use highly effective contraceptive

             start of the study to the completion of the study.

          -  The need to take glucocorticoids in a chronic manner at doses higher than 10 mg / day
             of prednisone (or equivalent) or other chronic immunosuppressants. Hormonal
             contraceptives, intrauterine device, intrauterine systems of hormonal release, sexual
             abstinence, vasectomy of the couple or bilateral tubal occlusion.
