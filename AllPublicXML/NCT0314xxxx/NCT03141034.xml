  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that this combination regimen of irinotecan plus ramucirumab
      administered as second line treatment will be tolerated and lead to improved outcomes similar
      to paclitaxel plus ramucirumab in patients with advanced gastric and gastro-esophageal
      junction (GEJ) cancers. This study proposes a phase II clinical trial with irinotecan plus
      ramucirumab for treatment of patients with metastatic gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma who have
      progressed after first line chemotherapy. To the knowledge of the investigators, this regimen
      has not been previously administered to this patient population, so safety and tolerability
      will be monitored and reported.

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months from completion of treatment (estimated median treatment and follow-up of 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-PFS will be measured from date of study entry to first radiographic progression or death due to any cause. Radiographic progressive disease (PD) will be defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1). For those who are alive and do not experience progression, the investigators will censor them at the time of loss to follow-up (very few) or at 12 months from the study entry, whichever comes first.</description>

    <measure>Time to progressive disease (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months from completion of treatment (estimated median treatment and follow-up of 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-TTP is defined as the time from study entry until date of radiographic PD using RECIST v1.1 criteria. For those who are alive and do not experience progression, the investigators will censor them at the time of loss to follow-up (very few) or at 12 months from the study entry, whichever comes first. For those who are dead before progression, the investigators will consider death as the competing risk. If the number of death are very small, the investigators will censor them at time of death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best overall response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of treatment (estimated to be 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>-BOR is defined as the best response across all time points from randomization until radiologically confirmed PD using RECIST, v1.1 criteria. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions. PR is defined as having a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. PD was defined as having a ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions and ≥5 mm increase above nadir. SD was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria.</description>

          -  History or evidence of known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients
             with known brain metastases must be excluded from this clinical trial because of their
             poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

             are not considered &quot;significant&quot;) during the 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  History of any arterial thromboembolic event, including but not limited to myocardial
             infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, or unstable angina
             within 6 months prior to enrollment.

             diastolic for &gt; 4 weeks) despite standard medical management.

          -  Presence of serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior
             to enrollment.

          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to first dose of protocol therapy.

          -  Minor surgery/subcutaneous venous access device placement within 7 days prior to first
             dose of protocol therapy.

          -  Receiving chronic antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and others),
             dipyridamole or clopidogrel, or similar agents. Once-daily aspirin use (maximum dose
             325 mg/day) is permitted.

          -  The patient has elective or planned major surgery to be performed during the course of
             the clinical trial.

          -  Bowel obstruction, history or presence of inflammatory enteropathy or extensive
             intestinal resection (hemicolectomy or extensive small intestine resection with
             chronic diarrhea), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or chronic diarrhea.

          -  Cirrhosis at a level of Child-Pugh B (or worse) or cirrhosis (any degree) and a
             history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites resulting from
             cirrhosis (i.e. ascites from cirrhosis requiring diuretics or paracentesis).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, metabolic disorders or other nonmalignant organ or systemic disease or
             secondary effects of cancer that induce a high medical risk and make assessment of
             survival uncertain, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with ramucirumab and irinotecan. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
