      The goal of is this study is to investigate the reliability and validity of a classification
      system for neck pain patients. In a previous study clinical experts were asked about the
      clinical criteria they considered to be determinative for 5 predefined dysfunction patterns
      in patients with neck problems: 1) articular, 2) myofascial, 3) neural, 4) central, and 5)
      sensorimotor control dysfunction pattern. This Delphi survey revealed a list of pertinent
      anamnestic and clinical criteria per dysfunction pattern.

      In the present study we will collect anamnestic and clinical data of 200 neck pain patients.
      This will be obtained by approximately 20 clinicians that fill out a standardized
      registration form at the intake of their patients with neck pain.

      The therapists and patients will receive an informed consent that clarifies the purpose of
      the study and what happens next with the collected data.

      Per patient the therapist indicates the dominant clinical pattern based on his/her
      experience. Prior to the data analysis, the researchers will be blinded to the patient
      identification data. Subsequent, the registration forms will be screened for the presence of
      clinical criteria (obtained from previous Delphi study), independent of the therapist's
      diagnosis/conclusions. A second independent researcher will gather this information, which
      will be used for statistical analysis, in order to investigate which clinical criteria can be
      considered as determinative for a particular pattern. Outcome measures for these analysis
      are:

        -  sensitivity and classification specificity

        -  (positive and negative) likelihood ratios

        -  odds ratios

        -  diagnostic accuracy
