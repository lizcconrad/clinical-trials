    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a hemodynamic and physiopathological condition that is defined
      as an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥25 mmHg when measured at rest. PH often
      progresses to heart failure and premature deaths. PH is a progressive disease that has many
      causes, which can affect people of all ages, is characterized by shortness of breath, reduced
      exercise tolerance, psychological distress and tiredness and reduced quality of life. Surveys
      of SF-36, 'Nottingham Health Profiles' and 'Minnesota Life with Heart Failure' surveys are
      routinely performed in PH clinically. However, none of the questionnaires are specific to
      pulmonary hypertension, so they are incomplete in determining the condition of the disease
      and the patients. There is no Turkish questionnaire for patients with pulmonary hypertension
      and other surveys used are inadequate in determining the condition of the patient and the
      patient since they are not specific to the disease. The aim is to provide a Turkish
      questionnaire that is specific to pulmonary hypertension in the literature.
