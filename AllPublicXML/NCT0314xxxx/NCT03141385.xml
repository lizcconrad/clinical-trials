      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that remote ischemic preconditioning
      prevents acute kidney injury and improves clinical outcomes in patients undergoing total arch
      replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a well-recognized complication after cardio-thoracic surgeries
      and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Total arch replacement is reported
      with a relatively high incidence of post-operative AKI. In addition, few effective preventive
      or therapeutic interventions for AKI have been identified. A number of studies have now
      addressed renal protection as a primary outcome following RIPC. Because the mechanism of I/R
      injury are similar to those proposed for AKI after CPB, the purpose of this study is to test
      the hypothesis that remote ischemic preconditioning prevents acute kidney injury and improves
      clinical outcomes in patients undergoing total arch replacement.
