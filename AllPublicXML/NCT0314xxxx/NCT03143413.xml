  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune connective tissue disease with undefined etiology and
      characterized by progressive fibrosis of the skin and major organs. Dry eyes and / or buccal
      syndrome is commonly reported in patients with systemic sclerosis. Goujerot-Sjogren syndrome
      is a chronic autoimmune disorder that is characterized by dryness of the eyes (xerophthalmia)
      and / or mouth (xerostomia). It may be primary or secondary to another connective tissue
      disease (such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or other). Several criteria have been validated
      to classify the SS but require a labial salivary gland biopsy, invasive act which
      complications can sometimes be reported (hematoma, lip sensory defect).

      Several scores based on the evaluation of the ultrasound homogeneity of the salivary glands
      were developed but no studies have evaluated ultrasound abnormalities of salivary glands in
      patients with systemic sclerosis.

    <textblock>
      Descriptive explorative study of three population showing sicca symptoms (Systemic sclerosis,
      Gougerot-Sjogren syndrome, Sicca-Asthenia-Polyalgia syndrome).

      Patient will be enrolled in the rheumatology department of University hospital of
      Clermont-Ferrand (France).

      Salivary glands ultrasonography will be performed on all patients enrolled by the same expert
      and blinded to the diagnosis of the patient. Echostructure of the two salivary glands will be
      graded 0 to 4 and the size calculated.
