  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to investigate the diagnostic performance of integrated
      F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and Dual Energy CT (DECT)
      imaging in determining the thoracic nodal status of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and its impact on target volume delineation for image
      guided radiation therapy (IGRT) planning.

    <description>Knowledge gained during this study may potentially allow for an improvement in PET-CT accuracy for lung tumor and thoracic adenopathy detection, and for a more accurate definition of the RT target, decreasing the radiation dose delivered to normal tissue.</description>

        The investigators plan to recruit a total of 50 individuals (male, female; age range 18-90
        years) referred to undergo a clinically indicated PET-CT examination. Patients will be
        identified from the Radiology department schedule. With the proposed 50 patient data set,
        the investigators are neither targeting nor avoiding the selective recruitment of women and
        minorities. Given the narrow inclusion criteria, the investigators plan to recruit patients
        irrespective of demographics. The patient will be approached by IRB-approved study
        personnel under the direction of one of the licensed physician investigators listed on the
        study, either prior to or on the day of the planned PET-CT examination (a single study
        visit, with the objective to perform the clinically indicated imaging), with a full
        explanation and request for consent as required by the IRB. MUSC policies regarding patient
        consent will be followed. The study design is not randomized.
