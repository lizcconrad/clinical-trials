  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1, randomized, open-label study of the prime-boost vaccine candidates
      given in the prime-boost regimen previously demonstrated to have a high level of
      immunogenicity and immune durability: Day 0 prime (PIV) and Day 180 boost (LAV), and compare
      it with a previously untested schedule: Day 0 prime (PIV) and Day 90 boost (LAV) in order to
      define the potential tradeoff between potential immunogenicity, including cell-mediated
      immunity, and a more practical dosing schedule.

      This study is a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, study with 2 treatment groups (N=40):

      Group 1 (n=20): TDENV-PIV 4 µg + Alum adjuvant (Day 0), TDENV-LAV F17 (Day 180) Group 2
      (n=20): TDENV-PIV 4 µg + Alum adjuvant (Day 0), TDENV-LAV F17 (Day 90)

      Investigational Product Dosage, Schedule, and Mode of Administration:

      TDENV-PIV Dosage: 0.5 mL of DENV serotypes 1-4 (4 µg / serotype) in alum adjuvant Mode of
      administration: intramuscular (IM) into the subject's upper arm, deltoid area of the
      subject's arm; vaccination will be given in the non-dominant arm whenever possible TDENV-LAV
      F17 Dosage: 0.5 mL of the post-transfection LAV F17 vaccine Mode of administration:
      subcutaneously into the upper-outer triceps/deltoid area of the subject's arm; vaccination
      will be given in the non-dominant arm whenever possible Schedule Varied, 2 vaccinations per
      volunteer in a heterologous prime-boost strategy. First dose on Day 0 (PIV) AND a second dose
      (LAV) on Day 180 for group 1. First dose on Day 0 (PIV) AND a second dose (LAV) on Day 90 for
      group 2.

      This study is intended to further evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of 2 tetravalent
      dengue vaccine (TDENV) candidates administered in a heterologous prime boost fashion with PIV
      followed by LAV 180 days later and to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a previously
      untested vaccination schedule consisting of PIV followed by LAV 90 days later.
