  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of heart-lung bypass on babies undergoing cardiac surgery.
      The investigators want to learn more about the inflammation that exposure to bypass creates
      in the body by studying markers of inflammation and cell injury in the bloodstream.
      Additionally, the investigators want to examine if these markers can predict which babies
      develop post-surgical complications. The hypothesis is that babies who undergo bypass will
      have higher levels of these markers than babies not exposed to bypass and that these markers
      will correlate with how the baby does clinically after surgery.

      This study will evaluate markers via blood sampling in babies with congenital heart disease
      who do not undergo cardiac surgery, those that undergo surgery without bypass, and those that
      undergo surgery with bypass. The overall goal is that this study will lead to useful
      biomarkers and lay the groundwork for future novel therapies aimed at improving outcomes for
      babies who require heart-lung bypass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a minimal risk observational study looking at markers of inflammation and cell injury
      in the bloodstream of babies with congenital heart disease, with a particular emphasis on
      whether these markers can predict low cardiac output syndrome in infants who undergo
      heart-lung bypass. Low cardiac output syndrome is a common postoperative complication marked
      by poor blood flow to the body affecting nearly 1/3 of infants post-bypass and is associated
      with significant morbidity and mortality.

      Babies not requiring surgery will serve as the control group. Infants in group 1 will have
      0.5 ml of blood drawn prior to discharge. This will be scavenged from the laboratory when
      possible. Infants in groups 2 and 3 will require serial blood draws over peri-operative time
      points each in the volume of 0.5 ml.

      Group 2:

      T0 = Before surgery (in the OR) T1 = After chest closure or end of case (in the OR) T2 = On
      admission to the pediatric intensive care unit T3 = Timed 4-6 hours after the time of
      admission T4 = Timed 12 hours (+/- 1 hour) after the time of admission T5 = Timed 24 hours
      (+/-1 hour) after the time of admission

      Group 3:

      T0 =Pre-cardiopulmonary bypass to be obtained in the operating room just prior to surgery T1
      = After going on bypass (but prior to modified ultrafiltration) T2 = After modified
      ultrafiltration T3 = On admission to the pediatric intensive care unit T4 = Timed 4-6 hours
      after the time of admission T5 = Timed 12 hours (+/- 1 hour) after the time of admission T6 =
      Timed 24 hours (+/-1 hour) after the time of admission
