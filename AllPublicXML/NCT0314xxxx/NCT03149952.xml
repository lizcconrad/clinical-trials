  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization for allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation constitutes a
      particular time in the management of patients with malignant hemopathies both for the
      patient, for his entourage or for the nursing staff. For the patient, the strict protective
      isolation set up during this period is a source of isolation in the broad sense and is
      associated with an escape from external events and society. It also constitutes a physical
      barrier (mask, charlotte, surblouse and overshoes worn by caregivers or visitors) and even
      psychological in relations with relatives. Moreover, this period is also difficult because of
      the possible complications of conditioning (mucositis, transit disorders, fever ...) and
      allograft itself (graft versus host disease, no transplant, relapse diseaseâ€¦). The patient
      may be weakened and diminished, which can give a feeling of helplessness and uselessness to
      the family. Finally, this therapy can have serious physical and psychological consequences
      for the patient and his entourage (especially in the case of family allograft) who do not
      always have the possibility to express themselves verbally. Published studies in hematology
      report depressive, anxious and post-traumatic stress disorders in patients and relatives
      during allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is therefore important to
      reduce these symptoms, particularly those related to the cut-off during hospitalization for
      allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells.

      Over the last decade or so, the logbook has been used in some resuscitation services in
      intubated patients, with the main objective of filling the &quot;memory gap&quot; mentioned by the
      intubated patients when they woke up and limiting the trauma associated with this Cut in the
      world corresponding to the sedation period. For this purpose, the use of a logbook in
      Hematology, by analogy with what is used in the resuscitation services, could be a means of
      limiting the psychological complications related to the allograft.
