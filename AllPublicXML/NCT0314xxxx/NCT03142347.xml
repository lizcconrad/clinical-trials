      Comparison effectiveness two methods revascularization of the superficial femoral artery:
      remote endarterectomy vs. remote endarterectomy supplemented DCB angioplasty in patients with
      steno-occlusive lesion of the femoro-popliteal segment of TASCII D

    <textblock>
      Given that more and more devices appear to deliver cytotoxic drugs into the depth of
      atherosclerotic plaque, it is interesting to study the effect of these drugs when applied
      directly after plaque removal.

After that, the translational and rotational motions loops under fluoroscopic guidance, continuing detachment of plaque in the antegrade direction to the distal end of plaque. Plastic of arteriotomy wounds performed patches of xenopericardium. Control patency of the arterial vessel is performed intraoperatively by X-ray angiography. When rendering residual stenosis or intimal dissection, limiting blood flow, complemented by endovascular intervention plasticity.</description>
