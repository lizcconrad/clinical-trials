  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The work hyposesis is based on the application of a chlorhexidine gel against the
      non-application on the healing abutments in patients who have received a submerged titanium
      implant to check its effect on healing and prevention of bacterial plaque accumulation during
      a period of 1 month.

    <textblock>
      Once the implants are integrated, and given the consent, the patients will be operated to
      connect the healing abutments as they come from the manufacturer (Mozo Grau, Ticare®).
      Patients will follow the study protocol in 2 arms.

      The random distribution is made prior to assignment following the internet program
      https://www.random.org

Inflammation 3 = gingiva with heavy bleeding during manipulation during unscrewing or screwing of the abutment.</description>
