  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess any differences in patient quality of life between Cryo
      Balloon ablation and Radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. The
      study will also assess any differences in the amount and duration of pain medication required
      after the ablation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are several different accepted techniques for performing ablation of atrial
      fibrillation. The two primary techniques currently in use in our center for atrial
      fibrillation are Cryo Balloon and Radiofrequency ablation.

      Based on personal observation, it is felt that patients undergoing Radiofrequency ablation
      have a higher incidence of chest discomfort and subsequently a greater requirement for pain
      medications post procedure as compared to those patients undergoing Cryo ablation.
