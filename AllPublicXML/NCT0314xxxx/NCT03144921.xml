  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EPIC II (Early-Stage Partners in Care) is a research project designed to assist people with
      early-stage memory loss and their care partners by providing early-stage related education
      and skill-training sessions designed to reduce stress, enhance well-being, manage challenges,
      and plan for the future. Researchers will gather feedback from individuals about their
      experience to continue to improve programs for early-stage memory loss.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help early-stage individuals who have early-stage memory loss
      or early stage dementia and their current or future care partners by providing education and
      skill-training programs designed to reduce stress and distress, increase well-being and
      quality of life, and plan for the future. About 160 early-stage dyads (person with
      early-stage dementia and his/her care partner) will be enrolled across Arizona and Nevada
      through Arizona State University.

      People who decide to voluntarily participate in this program, will be asked to:

        -  Meet others with memory loss and their care partners.

        -  Attend six group sessions (2 hours &amp; 30 minutes each) to learn strategies to help handle
           new situations, reduce stress, improve mood, communicate better with each other, and
           plan for the future.

        -  Participate in one 90-minute individualized session to address specific issues that may
           be unique to each dyad's situation.

        -  Participate in five 2-hour confidential interviews that involve questions about
           background, mood, and quality of life.

        -  Participate in interviews at the start, and again about 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, to help
           us to continue to improve the program.

        -  Attend several monthly booster sessions after completion of the seven EPIC sessions.

      Each person will receive up to $95 for completing all follow-up interviews, or $20- 25 for
      each interview completed. All participants are offered the EPIC sessions shortly after their
      first interview or shortly after their 3-month interview. Some participants will also attend
      an additional free education workshop within one month of the initial assessment.

    <intervention_model_description>Dyads will be randomized (assigned by chance) to one of two groups: 10 EPIC A or 2) EPIC B (Wait List Control - WLC. Randomization with stratification by language preference (English vs. Spanish) and geographic setting will occur in sets of 4 to 8 (average 6) eligible dyads.
The RCT ends at T2 with comparison of changes in outcomes between EPIC and WLC participants from Assessment 1 (baseline) to Assessment 2 (3 months post baseline). T2-T5 assessments will be used for within-group and maintenance of gains analyses from about 3 months to 12 months post baseline.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Group A will start the EPIC intervention immediately after assessment 1. The EPIC program consists of a 7-session, psychoeducational skills training intervention designed to provide education and skills on how to prepare for the future and reduce stress regarding memory changes and loss for both the person with early-stage dementia and their care partner. Following the 7 EPIC sessions, participants will attend 4 booster sessions over 5 months to reinforce the skills/lessons.</description>

    <description>Group B - the wait list comparison (WLC) group - will have a 75-minute group education session (comparator intervention) about 3 weeks after baseline assessment. The WLC session is an overview of memory loss/dementia and its related impact for EPs and CPs and an overview of aging network services in the community. They will receive a brief telephone check-in call approximately 3 weeks before the T2 assessment. The WLC group will start the complete EPIC psychoeducational skills training intervention immediately after Assessment 2. Following completion of the 7 EPIC sessions, participants will attend 4 booster sessions to reinforce the skills/lessons.</description>
