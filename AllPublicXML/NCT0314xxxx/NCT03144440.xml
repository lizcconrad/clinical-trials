      Primary objective:

      1. To estimate the effectiveness of treatment with FDC of Zepatier with or without ribavirin
      in Israeli patients with CHC and advanced fibrosis in real life setting.

      Secondary objective:

      1. To estimate the safety and tolerability of treatment with FDC of Zepatier with or without
      ribavirin in real life setting in Israeli patients with CHC and advanced disease.

      Hypotheses:

      Effectiveness and tolerability of treatment with FDC of Zepatier with or without ribavirin in
      Israeli patients with CHC and advanced fibrosis will be similar to that demonstrated in phase
      3 clinical trials.

      The following data will be collected:

      Demographics information: age, gender, race, country of birth (COB). Data on liver and
      virological characteristics: Hepatitis C virus(HCV) genotype, fibrosis stage (F0-4),
      technology of fibrosis assessment (fibroscan, fibrotest, elastography, biopsy), , cirrhosis
      (y/n), presence of portal hypertension: esophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy,
      history of decompensation, liver transplantation (y/n).

      Previous anti-viral treatment: PR- Peg-Riba (relapse, partial/null responder, unknown
      response), direct anti-viral agents (DDAs): Protease Inhibitors (PI) (Bocepravir,Telepravir,
      Simepravir), Sofosbuvir (SOF), NS5A (Ledipasvir, Daclatasvir), NS5B.

      Co-morbidities: BMI, Diabetes Mellitus, HIV-co infection, HBV-co infection, alcohol abuse,
      CKD (Chronic kidney disease)/renal failure, cardiovascular disease, inherited blood
      disorders, pre/post-transplant (liver/kidney) Concomitant medication (drug-drug
      interactions): antiacids (Proton pump inhibitors,H2-blockers), statins,beta-blockers, oral
      contraceptives, anti hypertensive, Anti retrovirals for HIV, etc.

      Base line and end-of treatment parameters: White blood cells(WBC), Hemoglobin (HB),
      Platelates (PLT), Alanine transferase (ALT), Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alpha phetoprotein
      (ALP), Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), albumin, bilirubin, Protrombin time (PT)/INR, LDL-C,
      IL28 (if available), Model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score, Child pugh (CPT)
      score/class, viral load and virological response: HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) at week 4 and 8
      (if available), and sustained virological response (SVR) 12 and SVR24.

      Data on virological breakthrough and relapse will be also collected and if possible to check
      resistance associated variants (RAVs).

      Data on treatment safety: any adverse event (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), AE which led
      to early discontinuation of treatment; decompensation event (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy,
      bleeding esophageal varices,) liver failure, liver transplantation and death.

      Primary variable The proportion of patients achieving SVR12 (HCV RNA &lt;15 IU/mL at follow-up
      week 12; 12 weeks after the last actual dose of the Zepatier).

      The Full Analysis Set will include all patients who received ≥1 dose of Zepatier.

      Secondary variables

        -  Cirrhosis/Fibrosis stage (F3, F4). Cirrhosis defined by liver biopsy (Metavir F4);
           transient elastography by Fibroscan tomography (TM) (&gt;12.5 kPa); or FibroTest® or
           FibroSure® (&gt;0.75 with APRI &gt;2).

        -  Previous HCV anti-viral treatment

        -  Co-morbidities and concomitant medication

        -  Laboratory abnormalities; baseline and end of treatment (EoT) parameters

        -  Serious and non-serious adverse events occurring at any time during the treatment
           period, and other adverse events up until 14 days after cessation of treatment, will be
           collected and analyzed.

        Data collection from electronic patients' files from the different medical centers
        participating in the study will be performed after completion of treatment and follow-up
        period of up to 24 weeks post treatment (SVR).

        Data will be collected every 4 months (3 times a year) and analyzed in one center (Carmel
        Medical Center, Haifa, Israel).

        Study interim report will be provided twice per year (middle and end of each year)
