  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In children requiring botulinum toxin injections, improving supervisory procedures of
      injection sessions to reduce pain and improve the experience of this invasive procedure is
      needed. The intervention of medical clowns seems very interesting in this goal, but its
      effectiveness has not been proven within the botulinum toxin injections. The objective of the
      study is to evaluate in terms of profit the presence or absence of clowns during a session of
      botulinum toxins by determining their impact on pain and anxiety felt among children and
      their carers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, the presence of clowns allows a major reduction of pain and anxiety in
      children and their accompanying in various medical and hospital surgical settings. A previous
      study on a population of 60 children was conducted to assess the impact of the presence of
      clowns during the production of botulinum toxin injection in children but not confirming the
      benefit of their participation in carrying this medical procedure. The results of this study
      are opposed to current scientific data. Their impact clown assessment criteria seem however
      insufficient to actually support the conclusion as to the ineffectiveness of distractibility
      clowns in this specific medical procedure iterative injection of botulinum toxin.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the pain and anxiety before and after the botulinum
      toxin injection session in children and hetero-assessment of pain and anxiety by accompanying
      depending on the presence or not of clown. The second objectives are the evaluation of the
      course of the session by the injector doctor, the accompanying of the child and to evaluated
      the effect of distraction during the toxin of the clown or the usual distraction (music,
      movie...)

    <description>Botulinum toxin injections are carried out according to the usual injection protocol.
40 children will be included into the arm toxin with clown distraction. During injections, clowns take information with the doctor before the procedure on the child's pathology, the cognitive level, the number of injections. During injections, clowns fit and distraction can change depending on the reaction of the child to their intervention.</description>
