  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence that topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and capsaicin
      are effective in osteoarthritis (OA), it is still unclear why they work for some people but
      not others. The investigators are undertaking an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis
      to identify responders according to patient characteristics, however, no studies report the
      presence of synovial hypertrophy or neuropathic-like pain. These two traits are of interest
      as they may be used to optimise the treatment effects of the two drugs which work via
      different mechanisms to reduce pain in OA. The investigators are therefore conducting this
      pilot n-of-1 trial series.

      This pilot n-of-1 trial series will investigate whether a person with OA, who has a different
      balance between inflammatory and neuropathic pain, shows a preference between these
      mechanistically different treatments. The trial will also be used to offer recommendations on
      the use of n-of-1 trial series for individualised (precision) medicine in OA.

    <description>Within each participant:
Topical NSAID (A) or capsaicin (B) are taken for a treatment period of four weeks. This is followed by another four week treatment period with the other treatment. These two treatment periods comprise one treatment cycle. The order of treatments within a treatment cycle is determined randomly (AB or BA).
This treatment cycle is repeated so that all participants undergo a maximum of three topical NSAID treatment periods and three topical capsaicin treatment periods (i.e., three treatment cycles). This is reduced to two cycles if they are found to meet the criteria for response at the interim analysis (after cycle two).</description>
