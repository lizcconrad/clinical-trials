      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied and the researchers are trying to find out more about it— for example, the side
      effects it may cause, and the activity of a drug, or combination of drugs, against a cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the activity of fulvestrant alone,
      fulvestrant and palbociclib, or fulvestrant, palbociclib, and avelumab combined, in
      participants with metastatic hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast cancer that has
      previously stopped responding to prior palbociclib and endocrine therapy.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved both palbociclib and fulvestrant
      as treatment options for this disease, however the use of palbociclib has not been studied in
      people who have previously been treated with palbociclib. The FDA has not approved avelumab
      as a treatment for any disease.

      Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks activity of
      two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the body occur), called
      Cyclin Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a pathway, or a
      sequence of steps, which is known to promote cancer cell growth. Laboratory testing has shown
      that palbociclib may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Palbociclib
      is FDA-approved as therapy for metastatic hormone receptor positive HER2 negative breast
      cancer in combination with endocrine therapy in the first line setting, and in combination
      with fulvestrant for pre-treated disease. It is not known whether cancers that have grown
      despite prior palbociclib treatment are still sensitive to palbociclib.

      Endocrine therapy prevents growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer by blocking
      stimulation of cancer cells by estrogen. During this study, the endocrine therapy will be
      fulvestrant. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic
      hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

      The immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system sends a
      type of cells called T cells throughout the body to detect and fight infections and
      diseases—including cancers. One way the immune system controls the activity of T cells is
      through the PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1) pathway. However, some cancer cells hide
      from T-cell attack by taking control of the PD-1 pathway and this stops T cells from
      attacking cancer cells.

      Avelumab is an antibody designed to block the PD-1 pathway and helps the immune system in
      detecting and fighting cancer cells. An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune
      system when it detects harmful substances. Previous studies show that the administration of
      antibodies which block the PD-1 pathway can lead to tumor destruction.

      In the laboratory, adding avelumab to fulvestrant and palbociclib appears to improve
      effectiveness. It is not known whether this is true in humans

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed hormone receptor positive (HR+) HER2
             negative metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable invasive breast cancer. ER, PR
             and HER2 measurements should be performed according to institutional guidelines, in a
             CLIA-approved setting. Cut-off values for positive/negative staining should be in
             accordance with current ASCO/CAP (American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of
             American Pathologists) guidelines.

          -  Men and pre- and postmenopausal women are eligible. Ongoing monthly GNRH agonist is
             required in pre-menopausal women or male participants for at least 4 weeks prior to
             study entry.

          -  Participants must have radiological or objective evidence of progression on an
             endocrine and CDK 4/6 inhibitor regimen in the metastatic setting, and/or
             relapse/progression during or within 12 months of completion of an endocrine and
             CDK4/6 inhibitor regimen in the adjuvant setting.

               -  Participants must have previously been exposed to CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in
                  combination with endocrine therapy. Exposure to any prior CDK4/6 inhibitor,
                  (including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib) is allowed. Patients may
                  have a line of endocrine therapy after combination endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor
                  exposure.

               -  Participants must have remained on prior endocrine and CDK4/6 therapy in the
                  metastatic setting without progression for at least 6 months prior to study
                  entry.

               -  It is not mandatory to have a CDK 4/6 inhibitor containing regimen as the most
                  recent treatment.

          -  Participants may have 0-1 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the metastatic
             setting.

          -  Prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting may include any aromatase inhibitor
             (AI) or tamoxifen, but may not include prior fulvestrant. In the metastatic setting,
             1-2 prior lines of endocrine therapy are allowed.

          -  Participants may have received radiotherapy for palliative purpose, but must not be
             experiencing &gt; grade 1 treatment related toxicities, and must have completed treatment
             &gt; 14 days prior to registration.

          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of study agents in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this
             study.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1 (see Appendix A).

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µL

               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (participants
                  with documented Gilbert's disease are allowed total bilirubin up to 1.5X ULN)

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN, or ≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with
                  documented metastatic disease to the liver.

               -  Creatinine &lt; institutional ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for
                  subjects with creatinine levels above institutional ULN.

               -  Baseline QTc &lt; 480 ms

          -  The effects of palbociclib and avelumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. If,
             for any reason, a woman should become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
             Women of childbearing age, women who are made postmenopausal through use of GNRH
             agonists, and men must agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of
             protocol treatment and for at least 60 days after the last dose of study medication if
             the risk of contraception exists.

          -  Adequate contraception is defined as one highly effective non-hormonal form of
             contraception or two effective forms of non-hormonal contraception by the participant
             and/or partner.

          -  Highly Effective Non-Hormonal Contraception

          -  Methods of birth control which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per
             year) when used consistently and correctly are considered highly-effective forms of
             contraception.

          -  The following non-hormonal methods of contraception are acceptable:

               -  True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the participant. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception].

               -  Male sterilization (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence
                  of sperm in the ejaculate). For female participants, the vasectomized male
                  partner should be the sole partner.

        OR

        -Effective Non-Hormonal Contraception

        Alternatively two of the following effective forms of contraception may be used instead:

          -  Placement of non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).
             Consideration should be given to the type of device being used, as there is higher
             failure rates quoted for certain types, e.g., steel or copper wire.

          -  Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

          -  Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

          -  The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of
             spermicide. The following should be noted:

          -  Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not highly
             effective forms of contraception. Therefore, the use of additional spermicides does
             confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.

          -  However, spermicides alone are ineffective at preventing pregnancy when the whole
             ejaculate is spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception
             and should not be used alone.

        It should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required. A double barrier
        method is acceptable, which is defined as condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or
        cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream /suppository.

          -  Premenopausal women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test. Pregnancy
             testing does not need to be pursued in female participants who are:

               -  Age &gt; 60 years; or

               -  Age &lt; 60 with intact uterus and amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months or more AND
                  estrogen (estradiol) levels within postmenopausal range; or

               -  Status-post bilateral oophorectomy, total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal
                  ligation.

          -  Participant must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had endocrine, chemotherapy, and/or biologic therapy within 14
             days prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from any prior
             treatment-related toxicities (must recover to no more than grade 1. Alopecia, sensory
             neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 toxicity not constituting a safety risk based
             on investigator's judgment are acceptable).

          -  Participants who are receiving concurrent therapy with other investigational agents.

          -  Rapidly progressive, symptomatic, visceral spread of disease placing participant at
             risk of life-threatening complications in the short term.

          -  Participants with active brain metastases. Stable treated brain metastases are allowed
             (this includes participants who have documented radiologic stability at least 4 weeks
             after radiotherapy, and do not require systemic steroids for management of symptoms
             from CNS metastatic lesions).

          -  Participants who have discontinued prior palbociclib for toxicity, or have needed more
             than one dose or schedule reduction for toxicity from prior palbociclib therapy. If a
             participant required a single dose reduction during prior palbociclib therapy and
             tolerated it well, for example prior dosing at 100 mg qd 3 weeks on 1 week off
             schedule, than that dose may be selected for this trial.

          -  History of allergic reactions to palbociclib or attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to palbociclib.

          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
             antibodies (NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≥ 3)

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A isoenzymes are ineligible. Lists including medications and
             substances known or with the potential to interact with the CYP3A isoenzymes are
             provided in Appendix B, and can also be found within Section 5.4. Because the lists of
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx;
             medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this
             information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant
             will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new
             medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.

          -  Current use of drugs listed in Appendix C that are known to prolong the QT interval
             (See Appendix C)

          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation

          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication, except for the following: a. intranasal,

             or equivalent; c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT
             scan premedication).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active
             infection requiring systemic therapy, clinically significant cardiovascular disease
             including: cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment),
             myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive
             heart failure (≥ New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious
             cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements. Ability to comply with study requirements is to be assessed by each
             investigator at the time of screening for study participation.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immuno-stimulatory
             agent. Participants with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or
             hyperthyroid diseases not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.

             disease requiring steroid or immunosuppressive therapy, pneumonitis, or pulmonary
             fibrosis.

          -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening (positive
             HBV surface antigen or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test positive)

          -  Live vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because effect of palbociclib and avelumab
             on a developing fetus is unknown. Breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to entry
             onto the study.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: ductal
             carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous
