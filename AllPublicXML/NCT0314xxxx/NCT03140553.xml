  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both TCH (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab) and EC followed by
      TH(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab) regimens as Neoadjuvant
      Treatment for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer have been recommended by NCCN guideline. It is
      unknown which regimen is better. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCH
      (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab) and EC followed by TH(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide
      followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab) regimens as Neoadjuvant Treatment in HER2-Positive
      breast cancer. The endpoint of pathologic complete response is used as a surrogate marker for
      survival. Safety and tolerability assessed by number of grade 4 toxicities and
      hospitalizations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed HER2 positive invasive breast carcinoma

          -  Clinical stage Ⅱ-ⅢB

          -  Patients must have measurable disease as defined by palpable lesion with both
             diameters ≥2cm measurable with caliper and/or a positive mammogram or ultrasound with
             at least one dimension ≥2cm. Bilateral mammogram and clip placement is required for
             study entry. Baseline measurements of the indicator lesions must be recorded on the
             Patient Registration Form. To be valid for baseline, the measurements must have been
             made within the 14 days if palpable. If not palpable, a mammogram or MRI must be done
             within 14 days. If palpable, a mammogram or MRI must be done within 2 months prior to
             study entry. If clinically indicated, xrays and scans must be done within 28 days of
             study entry.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) performance status 0 to 1 within 14 days of
             study entry

          -  Normal (greater than 50%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by
             echocardiography

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Adequate organ function within 2 weeks of study entry:

        Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500/mm3, Hgb &gt;9.0 g/dl and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 Total
        bilirubin &lt; upper limit of normal Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL or calculated cranial cruciate
        ligament (CrCL) &gt;50mL/min using the Cockcroft Gault equation serum glutamate oxaloacetate
        transaminase(SGOT)(AST) or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase(SGPT)(ALT) and Alkaline
        Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility

          -  Patients must be over 18 years old.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to the start of treatment

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study

             adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin. Patients with a history of other malignancies, who remain disease free
             for greater than five years are eligible.
