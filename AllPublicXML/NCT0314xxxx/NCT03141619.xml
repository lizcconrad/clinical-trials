  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that poor cerebral perfusion during critical
      illness is a risk factor for acute and long-term neurological dysfunction among survivors. We
      use near-infrared spectroscopy to measure brain tissue oxygenation as a non-invasive
      surrogate marker for cerebral perfusion. Acute neurological dysfunction is defined as the
      presence of delirium, which is assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care
      Unit (CAM-ICU). Chronic neurological dysfunction is defined as having quantitative
      impairments on robotic testing (KINARM robot) and traditional neuropsychological screening
      (Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status).

    <measure>Brain tissue oxygenation and delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of primary outcome: The primary hypothesis of this study is the association between BtO2 and the amount of non-comatose (i.e. RASS -4 or -5) days a patient is CAM-ICU positive (i.e. delirious). Statistical diagnostics (e.g. assessment for normality) will determine the use of parametric (Pearson) or non-parametric (Spearman's rank) correlational analysis on this data set. A correlation will be considered statistically significant if p&lt;0.05.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of secondary outcomes-physiological determinants of brain tissue oxygenation</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Simultaneous multiple linear regression analysis will be used to investigate if clinically relevant hemodynamic and physiological parameters (E.g. MAP, HR, SaO2, and pCO2) predict NIRS derived BtO2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain tissue oxygenation as an independent risk factor for delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if BtO2 is an independent predictor of delirium, logistic regression will be used to estimate the unadjusted effect of each individual predictor on delirium duration (i.e. the number of CAM-ICU positive days). The following covariates were selected a priori, as they have been associated with delirium: a history of cognitive dysfunction, a history of hypertension, a history of alcohol abuse, MAP, blood urea nitrogen, and total narcotic dose (in fentanyl equivalents).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain tissue oxygenation as an independent risk factor for long-term cognitive impairment-RBANS</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) will be administered among ICU survivors. We will use simultaneous multiple linear regression analysis to investigate if clinical variables available on admission (e.g. history of hypertension) and data collected within the first 72 hours of the patients' ICU stay (e.g. brain tissue oxygenation) can predict participant performance on the RBANS (i.e. total score and each cognitive domain) administered at 3 and 12 month after ICU discharge.</description>

    <measure>Brain tissue oxygenation as an independent risk factor for long-term cognitive impairment-KINARM</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KINARM robot will be used to assess sensorimotor and neurocognitive control of limb movements in ICU survivors. We will use simultaneous multiple linear regression analysis to investigate if clinical variables available on admission (e.g. history of hypertension) and data collected within the first 72 hours of the patients' ICU stay (e.g. brain tissue oxygenation) can predict participant performance on the KINARM (i.e. task/total score for each subtask) administered at 3 and 12 month after ICU discharge.</description>
