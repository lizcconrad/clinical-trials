  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative ileus (&quot;post-op ileus&quot;) is a condition which can occur after surgery. This
      means that the bowels stop working correctly and food and liquids will not pass through in
      the normal manner. Post-op ileus can be uncomfortable and require a longer hospital stay
      until the bowels begin to function correctly again. Currently there are no effective methods
      for preventing post-op ileus. Some studies suggest there is a benefit from drinking coffee
      following colon or gynecological cancer surgeries with very little risk. However, the effects
      of coffee following small bowel surgery have not been studied. This randomized, controlled
      trial will compare the outcomes of patients who receive coffee during their hospital stay
      after small bowel surgery to similar patients who receive warm water. About 60 patients will
      be in each group. The main outcomes are time until the nasogastric tube is removed and length
      of hospital stay.
