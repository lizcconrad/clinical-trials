  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate whether eight weekly telephone coaching sessions or
      materials on lifestyle interventions can be beneficial for overweight and obese 8-12 year
      olds.

      The proposed five-year cluster randomized controlled pediatric practice-based trial will
      compare the effectiveness of two practice-based interventions on improving diet and physical
      activity and reducing BMI among overweight and obese 8-12 year olds seen in pediatric
      practice: (1) Fitline-Coaching, consisting of a pediatric practice-based component plus
      Fitline counseling and workbook, or (2) Fitline-Workbook, consisting of the same
      practice-based component, but only the family workbook materials mailed over 8 weeks, with no
      referral to Fitline coaching. Sixteen pediatric primary care practices will be randomized to
      either the Fitline-Coaching (N=8) or the Fitline-Materials (N=8) condition. Five hundred and
      twelve parents and their children ages 8-12 with a body mass index (BMI) of &gt; 85th percentile
      (overweight or obese) will be recruited from the practices to achieve N=400 at 12 month
      follow-up.

    <description>It is hypothesized that the effect of the Fitline-Coaching on child BMI will be predicted by changes in Social Cognitive Theory constructs. Parents will complete a survey assessing: (1) anticipated benefits of the behavior change (outcome expectations) (23-item questionnaire); (2) perceived support and barriers to addressing their child's behavior changes (15-item questionnaire); (3) self efficacy in helping their child improve their diet and physical activity (12-item) questionnaire; (4) behavioral capability (12-item questionnaire); and (5) knowledge (7-item questionnaire).
Children will complete a survey assessing (1) anticipated benefits of the behavior change (outcome expectations) (23-item questionnaire); (2) perceived support and barriers (67-item questionnaire); (3) self efficacy (16-item questionnaire); (4) behavioral capability (12-item questionnaire); and (5) knowledge (7 item questionnaire).</description>
