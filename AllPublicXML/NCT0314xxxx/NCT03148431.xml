      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  The safety of the study drug and any side effects that might be associated with it.

        -  How much of the study drug gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to
           remove it in healthy participants.

      Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for 3 overnight stays.

      This study involves a single dose of LY3002815 or placebo given as an injection into the
      vein. This study will last approximately 16 weeks including screening. Additional follow-up
      may be required.

      This study is for research purposes only, and is not intended to treat any medical condition.
