  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The proportion of elderly people has dramatically increased in recent decades. Moreover,
      social and demographic trends show a global increase of elderly people at risk of loneliness
      and lack of social relationships. The objective of this study was to evaluate the process,
      the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce social isolation
      and its negative effects on health in elderly persons.

      Methods:

      This is a mixed methods multi-approach evaluation that includes: 1) A qualitative evaluation
      among coordinators and participants taking part in the intervention, through in
      depth-interviews and focus groups, respectively. The main topics covered will be positive and
      negative aspects of the intervention, suggestions for its improvement, opinions on different
      aspects of the intervention, and perceived benefits. 2) A quantitative quasi-experimental
      design, comparing a group of individuals taking part in the intervention with another group
      with similar characteristics not receiving the intervention. Data will be collected at the
      beginning and at the end of the intervention. Social support will be measured through
      questions drawn from the Medical Outcomes Study and the National Social Life, Health, and
      Aging Project questionnaires. Psychological morbidity will be measured through Goldberg's
      General Health Questionnaire, and Health-related Quality of Life will be measured through the
      EuroQoL questionnaire. Information on visits to the primary care center in the years before
      and after the intervention will be obtained from the electronic records of the primary care
      centers. 3) A cost-utility analysis, conducted from a health system (primary care)
      perspective, including direct costs of the program and the primary care health services used.
      The effects of the intervention will be measured on quality-adjusted life years.

      Discussion:

      There is an urgent need for studies assessing the effectiveness and the efficiency of
      potential interventions to reduce social isolation among elderly persons. The results of this
      study will help to fill the knowledge gap in this area and might be especially useful for the
      development of social and public health policies and programs for older people in
      disadvantaged neighborhoods in urban areas.

      Hypothesis:

      The intervention evaluated in this protocol will significantly improve social support, mental
      health, general health status and distinct dimensions of quality of life in the intervention
      group (IG) compared with the comparison group (CG). Among participants in the IG, the
      intervention will also significantly reduce the number of visits to their primary care
      centers. Furthermore, this intervention will be cost effective.

      Objectives:

      General objective To evaluate the process, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an
      intervention to reduce social isolation and its consequent negative impact on health in the
      elderly.

      Specific objectives

        1. To evaluate the implementation process of the intervention (participant profile,
           positive and negative aspects of the intervention, barriers and facilitators in its
           implementation, quality of the intervention, and satisfaction).

        2. To assess the impact of the intervention on social support, self-perceived health
           status, mental health and quality of life among participants, and visits to the primary
           care center.

        3. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      Methods:

      Study design

      This is a mixed methods multi-approach evaluation that includes:

        -  a qualitative evaluation among coordinators and participants who underwent the
           intervention through in-depth interviews and focus groups, respectively;

        -  a quantitative quasi-experimental design, comparing a group of individuals taking part
           in the intervention (IG) with another group with similar characteristics not receiving
           the intervention (CG). Data will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the
           intervention;

        -  an economic evaluation, which includes a cost-utility analysis.

    <description>The intervention &quot;School of Health for the Elderly &quot; consists of 22 weekly group sessions of 1.5 hours each. In addition to helping participants learn about different health issues, the intervention encourages interaction among participants and works on personal skills. Furthermore, most sessions are led by professionals who are experts on the topic covered and work in the neighborhood (professionals from the health services, social services, markets or neighborhood associations), making it easier to inform participants of the neighborhood's available resources. The aim of the intervention is to decrease social isolation and loneliness and, therefore, to improve mental health, self-perceived health and wellbeing</description>
