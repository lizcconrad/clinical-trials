  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrostomy tube (G-tube) complications, such as granulation tissue formation and tube
      dislodgements, are frequent causes of emergency department visits. The investigators have
      developed two G-tube dressing designs using commercially available materials and products to
      decrease the risk of G-tube related complications. The investigators aim in this study is to
      pilot two novel G-tube dressings in patients with pre-existing G-tubes to gain parental
      feedback on device designs, ease of use and G-tube stability in preparation for a final
      design and trial.

    <textblock>
      In order to address complications associated with gastrostomy buttons (G-buttons) or tubes
      (G-tubes) in children, the investigators developed two multi-component securement dressings.
      The purpose of this study is to try these dressings and obtain parental feedback.

      This will involve survey using questionnaires before and after the use of two different
      G-tube dressings. Eligible patients will be identified by a nurse practitioner or attending
      surgeon. The researcher will obtain consent from the patient or their parents/legal guardian.
      The investigators will ask a series of questions regarding their current experience dressing
      and maintaining G-tube stomas. A week supply of each new prototype dressing will be provided
      to the patient or parent. Caregivers will be educated on the use of each dressing and will be
      given a number to call should they have any questions or concerns. The dressings will be
      changed daily and as needed. Once the patient is enrolled and provided with dressings, the
      investigators will perform a follow up telephone interview at one week to evaluate their
      experience and ensure they did not experience any adverse events. Caregivers will be given a
      second questionnaire to collect feedback on the dressings after two weeks either in person or
      over the telephone. They will be asked to choose their preferred dressing, provide feedback
      on advantages and disadvantages of each type and report adverse events. For inpatients, the
      investigators will obtain opinions from parents, patients, nurses and doctors. Photographs
      will be obtained at each outpatient visit or during the inpatient period for objective
      comparison.
