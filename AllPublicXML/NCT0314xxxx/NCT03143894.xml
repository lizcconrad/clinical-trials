      This study will test the preliminary efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) to improve fatigue and cognition in women with a history of breast cancer and
      persistent fatigue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue and cognitive dysfunction are commonly reported symptoms associated with impaired
      quality of life and productivity in breast cancer survivors. Transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to improve both fatigue and cognition. Here tDCS will be
      used in a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial in women who have
      finished treatment of breast cancer and who report persistent fatigue.

      Participants will complete measures of fatigue and cognition before and after five
      consecutive days of active or sham tDCS then complete questionnaires by phone one week later.
      Participants will return about one month later for another five days of participation,
      followed by another brief study phone call the following week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women, 18 years of age or older

          -  Stage I-III breast cancer

          -  Treatment Status: At least 6 months and no more than 5 years after the conclusion of
             active breast cancer therapy, including surgery, radiation therapy and (neo)adjuvant
             chemotherapy, if administered. NOTE: Adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy and endocrine
             therapy may still be ongoing at the time of study enrollment.

          -  Fatigue: Moderate fatigue on most days within the past week (i.e., at least 4 out of
             the last 7 days), rated as â‰¥ 4 on a 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (worst fatigue) scale.

          -  Able and willing to complete study tasks as evidenced by at least the following:
             fluent English speaker; hearing and language comprehension; and, sufficient literacy
             to complete study forms and questionnaires.

          -  Patient understands the study regimen, its requirements, risks, and discomforts, and
             is able and willing to sign an informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of recurrent breast cancer at the time of enrollment.

          -  Depression or anxiety as defined either by ongoing pharmacological treatment for
             depression or anxiety or a HADS score on initial screening.

          -  Dementia as assessed by a MMSE score on initial screening.

          -  Known pregnancy or nursing.

          -  Any of the following: diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder made by a
             physician, seizure disorder, pacemaker, hearing aids, any metal implanted in the head,
             or the presence of other known current untreated causes of fatigue such as anemia or
             untreated hypothyroidism.

          -  Use of stimulant medications, sleep medications, nicotine patch, and other drugs
             thought to interfere with tDCS efficacy for seven days prior to and during study
             participation.

          -  Use of narcotic pain medication, benzodiazepines, or illicit drugs for seven days
             prior to and during study participation.

          -  Consumption of &gt;14 alcoholic drinks per week or positive screening on the CAGE.

          -  Skin conditions involving open sores on the scalp that would prevent proper
             application of the electrodes.

          -  Hairstyles that obstruct placement of the electrodes including cornrows, dreadlocks,
             braids or other hair accessories that cannot be removed.

          -  Other medical or other condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigators might
             compromise the objectives of the study.
