  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of implementing an intervention in the home
      setting that is specifically designed to coach and mentor caregivers as they assist
      individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) who have fractured a hip to
      perform everyday activities and engage in more physical activity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior research by the Baltimore Hip Studies (BHS) has shown that it is possible to improve
      function, increase physical activity, and improve behavioral symptoms among long term care
      residents with ADRD and to effectively coach and mentor caregivers through a care practice,
      Function Focused Care for the Cognitively Impaired (FFC-CI), that focuses on having
      caregivers teach, cue, model, and assist cognitively impaired individuals to perform
      functional tasks and engage in physical activity, while minimizing behavioral symptoms. This
      study will determine if a revised intervention, Function Focused Care for the Cognitively
      Impaired: Hip Care at Home (aka, Hip Care at Home), can be implemented in a home setting.

      The Hip Care at Home intervention will include an initial evaluation of the hip fracture
      participant, caregiver, and home setting by an interdisciplinary care team including a
      physical therapist (PT), occupational therapist (OT), and a coach (nurse or nurse's aide)
      trained in the function focused care (FFC) approach. The FFC coach will then work with the
      primary informal (family or friend, unpaid) caregiver to integrate the recommended
      environmental, behavioral, and physical interventions into the home setting, with weekly
      visits.

    <description>Assessment of Environment for Impact on Physical Activity is a visual checklist indicating whether the described environmental component is present or absent. This measure will be included at baseline to tailor the intervention, but will be repeated at follow-up as a potential intermediate outcome. Environment assessments will be done by the FFC coach and recommendations for change discussed with caregiver and initiated as approved. Additionally, changing the environment to optimize function and physical activity (e.g., providing access to open areas for walking, pleasant destinations, and rest areas along pathways) will also facilitate the integration of the Hip Care at Home intervention.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hip Care at Home</intervention_name>
    <description>This is a graduated, functionally-based intervention, paired with caregiver interactions for enhancing functional abilities. Caregivers are encouraged to have the hip fracture participant actively participate in their own activities of daily living and incorporate functional activities into daily routines. An intervention coach will discuss care related challenges with the caregiver to identify dependency problems, motivate the caregiver to help foster independence in the care recipient, and provide guidance in addressing behavioral symptoms associated with cognitive limitation that may occur during caregiving. The coach is guided by interventions designed by PTs, OTs, and a nurse practitioner expert in FFC. The intervention includes 1) initial assessment of participant, caregiver, and environment, 2) coaching and mentoring of caregivers regarding use of effective motivational strategies, 3) goal setting, and 4) on-going motivation and evaluation.</description>
