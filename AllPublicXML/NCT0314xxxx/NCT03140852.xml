  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to obtain data about the effectiveness, reach, adoption, and
      implementation potential of an innovative, combined urinary/bowel continence workshop through
      a randomized controlled trial in six Wisconsin communities. This three-session workshop is
      based on proven principles of behavior change addressing urinary and bowel continence
      self-management and health education and has been developed specifically for administration
      to women age 50 and older in senior centers. We hypothesize that workshop participants will
      experience improvements in urinary and bowel incontinence symptoms, will have increased
      levels of care-seeking and self-efficacy for these conditions, and will maintain the
      self-management strategies taught in the workshop 3 months following completion of the
      workshop. We further hypothesize that this workshop will reach its intended target population
      (independent senior women with incontinence) and will improve their mental health by
      destigmatizing the condition of incontinence.
