  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, randomized, open-label, cross-over study with 4 single-dose
      treatments of GLPG1972 to compare the bioavailability of the oral wet granulation (WG) tablet
      relative to an oral solution and to the oral direct compression (DC) tablet after single dose
      intake in healthy male subjects and to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of
      the WG oral tablet.
