  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients after severe acquired brain
      injury (ABI) were randomised in addition to the individual daily rehabilitation program to
      intensive Facial Oral Tract Therapy (F.O.T.T.®) (intervention group) or unspecific treatment:
      washing face, brushing teeth, without facilitating swallowing (control group).

      The duration of the intervention period was 15 working days (3 weeks). The intervention in
      both groups was twice a day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The F.O.T.T.® approach uses structured tactile input and facilitation techniques in
      meaningful everyday life context, aiming for improving function in the face and oral tract
      that is as normal as possible. The goal is maximum participation in daily life. The treatment
      encourages learning of helpful functional movements or patterns of movement for safe
      swallowing, protection of airway, oral hygiene, eating, drinking, breathing, voice and
      articulation.

    <masking_description>The patient´s primary physician in the clinic, the primary occupational therapist, physiotherapist and the nurses were kept blinded for the whole period of the intervention.
The patient´s relatives did know into what group the patient was randomized. The patient himself did not know. The occupational therapists associated to the project were not blinded.
The otolaryngologist, who scored the video recorded FEES examinations was blinded. The colleagues from Germany, who analyse data are blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>Intensive F.O.T.T.® intervention was given twice a day, approximately 20 minutes per intervention, exclusive time to position the patient. Before and after the intervention, the patient was positioned in a standardized way in side lying for 10 minutes to rest. Here, the Electromyographic Bioimpedance Measuring device (EMBI) measured the spontaneous swallowing frequency and -quality during both, the resting period and the intervention. In the intervention itself, the patient was facilitated with specific handling and interventions to swallow, according to F.O.T.T.®. The faciltation was embedded into a meaningful context for the patient, e.g. tooth brushing or eating small amounts of apple sauce, if safe.</description>

    <description>The intervention in the control group was given twice a day, approximately 20 minutes per intervention, exclusive time to position the patient. Patients in the control group were before and after the intervention, positioned in a standardized way in side lying for 10 minutes to rest. The EMBI measured the spontaneous swallowing frequency and -quality during both, the resting period and the intervention. The intervention included unspecific stimulation of the hands and the face, without therapeutic interventions directed towards facilitation of swallowing.</description>
