  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 5% of breast cancers are metastatic at diagnosis and 20-30% of localized breast cancer
      become secondarily metastatic.Thanks to recent therapeutic advances, the median survival
      ranges between 12 months in 1970 and 18 to 24 months in 2000. However, patients suffer from
      many detrimental symptoms such as fatigue, pain related to treatment and metastasis. The
      physical, biological, psychological and clinical benefits of physical activity (PA) during
      treatment in patients with localized breast cancer have been widely demonstrated. Numerous
      studies investigated the effect of PA in non-metastatic breast cancer, but to our knowledge,
      only four interventional studies worldwide focused on the implementation of PA in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer.It seems appropriate to investigate the feasibility of PA
      intervention with patients with metastatic breast cancer to see if the observed effects in
      localized breast cancer are confirmed in metastatic breast cancer population. The ABLE study
      is an interventional cohort designed to assess the feasibility of a 6-month adapted physical
      activity intervention, performed under real life conditions in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer.

    <description>The program is individualized according to age, fitness level, place of residence, access to adapted specific training group or associations, PA preferences and wishes of each participant. Patients are informed of the recommendations in terms of PA, and the target of 150min per week in order to maintain health benefits. Patients are asked to walk at least 30 minutes per day and increase their activities into daily routine. Several individual strategies are established with the patients to attain their objectives and increase their daily life PA.
Withings® PA trackers have been used to provide an incentive effect to increase PA, to measure the number of steps per day and make people think about their PA. Patients wore a Withings Go® wristband PA tracker throughout the whole study and had in real time a feedback on their number of steps per day.
A 7 mL blood sample is collected at baseline (D1) and at the end of the 6-month study (M6) for the biological study.</description>
