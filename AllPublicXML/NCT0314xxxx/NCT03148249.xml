  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is defined by the occurence of visual hallucinations (VH) in
      the absence of any mental disorder. Elderly patients with reduced visual acuity due to
      ophthalmic diseases are most affected. Conditions are often associated with the syndrome of
      age-related macular degeneration, cataract or glaucoma. Existing data on the syndrome's
      prevalence in Europe reveal diverse results. Aim of this study was to assess the prevalence
      of CBS in patients with low visual acuity and to evaluate, if an additional therapeutic
      interview with and treatment by a psychiatrist is beneficial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a visual acuity of 0.5 LogMAR or less in the better eye were screened for CBS.
      Instruments used were an interview asking for details of the hallucinations, a mental test
      and a scale concerning quality of life. Patients with CBS were randomized by minimization in
      two groups: in group 1, a patient-doctor interview by an ophthalmologist was performed and in
      group 2 an interview and if needed, a therapy by a psychiatrist. At the 3-months follow up,
      the psychological strain of patients was recorded again.
