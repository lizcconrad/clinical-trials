  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 150,000 people in the UK suffer a stroke each year and ~60% with moderate to severe
      stroke fail to recover arm or hand use. Stroke rehabilitation is increasingly home-based
      following early supported discharge (ESD) from hospital to facilitate self-management and
      avoid problems associated with prolonged hospital stays. There is strong evidence that
      intensive practice and re-education of normal movement is essential for functional motor
      recovery, hence the NHS guideline of 45 minutes therapy 5 days per week, but NHS Trusts have
      difficulty meeting this target due to cost and access to specialist therapists.

      An M-MARK Mk1 device that combines an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with an
      Mechanomyography (MMG) sensor has been designed and laboratory tested. Novel signal
      processing techniques have been demonstrated that reduce problems of vibration artifacts and
      generate information on mechanical muscle activity and movement. The aim of the overall
      M-MARK project is to develop a low-cost wearable wireless device (Mk2) that patients can use
      independently at home while practicing standardised everyday activities to regain upper limb
      function. Mk2 M-MARK has now been developed in collaboration with therapists, patients and
      their carers. The system incorporates feedback, presented on a computer/tablet, as motivating
      visualisations of movement showing them if they have moved in the correct way. A separate
      interface has been developed for therapists, which offers a simple system to diagnose
      specific movement problems to inform clinical decision-making, monitor progress and thus
      increase efficiency of therapy.

      In phase 1 of this study, user requirements were assessed to inform the development of the
      Mk2 M-MARK for clinical use. Ten patients and carers were interviewed and 20 health
      professionals took part in two focus groups, from Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust and North
      Bristol NHS Trust. The Mk2 system has now been developed, reliability demonstrated and
      iterative testing with stroke patients has ensured usability of the system.

      This phase of research will examine the clinical feasibility of using Mk2 M-MARK with stroke
      patients who are undergoing early supported discharge. All feasibility aspects of the
      wearable system will be assessed including usability and safety. Preliminary data on efficacy
      will be collected and a health economics analysis will be undertaken.

    <description>M-MARK will be used by therapists for assessment of the upper limb, and stroke participants will be asked to use M-MARK whilst performing individually tailored and prescribed exercises for a minimum of 5 days/week.
A set of tailored arm exercises using M-MARK (including targets for repetitive and functional activities) will be prescribed which the participant will be asked to practice independently at home for four weeks.
During the four weeks, the patient (with support from their carer as required) will be encouraged to don the M-Mark garment and log-on to the M-Mark computer tablet each day to carry out their programme of exercises. They will be asked to use M-Mark to repeat as many exercise sessions per day as prescribed to them by their research therapist.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years old or older.

          -  Between 1 and 20 weeks post clinical diagnosis of stroke with residual upper limb
             movement deficits.

          -  Currently undergoing upper limb rehabilitation post-stroke within early supported
             discharge.

             the Montreal cognitive assessment [9] (scores between 19-25 corresponds to mild
             cognitive impairment, and 25-30 represent normal cognition). For aphasic patients, the
             Oxford cognitive screen (OCS) will be used to determine cognitive status.
