  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT scan is a nuclear medicine test used to create pictures of the
      whole body that will show where somatostatin receptors are found, including on tumours.
      Somatostatin receptors are found on most neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), and some other types
      of tumours. Currently at the Cross Cancer Institute, most patients with suspected
      somatostatin positive tumours (e.g. NETs) have an Octreoscan™. A scientific study has shown
      that a scan with a similar product ([68]Ga-DOTATATE) is more accurate than an Octreoscan™.
      This study will look at [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE scans, a product virtually identical to
      [68]Ga-DOTATATE.

      The purpose of this study is to: 1) demonstrate the safety of [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE; and 2)
      confirm that [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE is effective at diagnosing somatostatin positive tumours.

      The proposed clinical trial will be a Phase I/II, diagnostic imaging, controlled, open label,
      single site, single dose clinical trial in a broad cross-section of patients with known or
      suspected somatostatin receptor positive tumours. All participants will be imaged with
      [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE PET/CT for uptake by somatostatin receptor positive tumours. A safety
      evaluation will be conducted on the first 10 consecutively enrolled participants (safety
      sub-group), consisting of vital signs, haematology and SMA-12 serum biochemistry profile
      (pre-injection and post-imaging), and an adverse event (AE) assessment (up to 24 hours) after
      [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE imaging. The safety evaluation for the remaining participants will consist
      of an AE assessment (up to 24 hours) after [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE imaging. The efficacy
      evaluation will include [68]Ga-HA-DOTATATE scan clinical accuracy compared to standard of
      care cross-sectional images and values published in the literature.
