    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to get insight into control of glycemic variability with Sugar
      Balance capsules which is the leaves of three herbs: ivy ground (Coccinia indica)-200mg,
      bougainvillia (Bougainvillea spectabilis)-30mg, Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus
      rosea)-20mg.

    <textblock>
      The glycemic variability would be obtained at 14 days with the usage of Flash glucose
      monitoring system manufactured by Abbott and outcomes would be compared at the end of
      ambulatory glucose profile.
