      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 2
      concentrations of A-101 compared to Vehicle for the treatment of 4 seborrheic keratosis (SK)
      Target Lesions on the trunk, extremities and face.

      The secondary objectives of this study include duration of response of A-101. During the
      study, the investigator will identify 4 eligible SK Target Lesions on each subject on the
      trunk, extremities and face. For each subject, at least 1 SK Target Lesion must be on the
      face and at least 1 Target Lesion must be on the trunk or extremities. The Target Lesions
      will be treated at a maximum of two treatment visits.

          4. Subject has 4 appropriate seborrheic keratosis Target Lesions on the trunk,
             extremities and face, with at least 1 Target Lesion on the face and at least 1 Target
             Lesion on the trunk or extremities. The 4 identified Target Lesions must meet the
             requirements as defined below:

               1. Have a clinically typical appearance

               2. Have a Physician's Lesion Assessment of ≥ 2

               5. Thickness that is ≤ 2mm

               6. Be a discreet lesion

               7. Be the only SK lesion present when centered in the area outlined by the provided
                  circular template

               8. Not be covered with hair which, the in the investigator's opinion, would

          5. Subject chemistry and complete blood count results are within normal limits. If any of
             the laboratory values are outside normal range, the treating investigator must assess
             the value/s as NOT clinically significant and document this in the patient's medical
             chart in order for the subject to be eligible for randomization.

          6. Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 14
