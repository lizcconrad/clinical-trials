  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methotrexate (MTX) co-medication can improve the therapeutic effect of biological therapies
      (e.g. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -inhibitors) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its role in
      Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) remains unclear.

      No data from Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) are available to address the questions whether
      add-on of MTX to UST monotherapy, or a withdrawal of continuous MTX therapy in patients with
      newly initiated Ustekinumab (UST) treatment or simultaneously induction of MTX with UST in
      naive active PsA-patients will influence outcome measurements.

      So, the purpose of the study is to analyse the effects of blinded MTX-co-medication on
      outcome in patients treated with UST: Non-inferiority at week 24 of UST monotherapy compared
      to add-on to MTX in patients with active PsA and at least 12 weeks of MTX treatment prior to
      screening or who are actually not treated with MTX and do not have prior inadequate response
      to MTX-treatment for PsA will be demonstrated.

      Methotrexate (MTX) co-medication can improve the therapeutic effect of biological therapies
      (e.g. TNF-inhibitors) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its role in Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)
      remains unclear. Differences in phenotypical manifestations between PsA and RA might
      influence the impact of co-medication, treatment response and treatment adherence
      differently.

      Independent from this data, the impact of use of MTX in Ustekinumab (UST) treated patients
      with active PsA remains unclear: No data from Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) are available
      to address the questions whether add-on of MTX to UST monotherapy, or the other way around, a
      withdrawal of continuous MTX therapy in patients with newly initiated UST treatment or
      simultaneously induction of MTX with UST in patients will influence outcome.

      There is some evidence that MTX may contribute to improved treatment persistence with
      anti-TNF therapy, particularly when used in combination with infliximab, but there is very
      little data to support a benefit in effectiveness in patients receiving concomitant MTX.

      Additionally, MTX may play a role in immunogenicity: In the PSUMMIT program the patients with
      concomitant MTX had lower anti-drug-antibody (ADA) rates than those on UST-monotherapy,
      although there was no effect on efficacy and safety.

      Furthermore, methotrexate treatment manifestations such as dactylitis or enthesitis seems to
      be ineffective.

      In this study, the effect of blinded MTX-co-medication on outcome in patients treated with
      UST will be analysed. Differences on efficacy, safety and treatment adherence will be
      calculated related to MTX use in four arms of the stratified, randomized placebo-controlled
      clinical trial which contains a study treatment period of 52 weeks. The primary endpoint,
      differences in DAS28 in the treatment groups, will be measured at week 24.
