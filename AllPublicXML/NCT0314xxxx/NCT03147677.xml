    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm controlled study,
      for which a total of 216 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (Stage II-IV) will be
      enrolled. The subjects will be randomized to three groups in 1:1:1 ratio. One group receive
      Alfacalcidol 0.25ug/day and Irbesartan 150mg/day for 16 consecutive weeks. The second group
      receive Alfacalcidol 0.25ug/day alone for 16 consecutive weeks. The third group receive
      Irbesartan 150mg/day alone for 16 consecutive weeks. All subjects will be followed up for 4
      weeks after medication is over. A total of 4 visits have been scheduled for this study at
      week 0, week 8, week 16, week 20.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult Chinese subjects, at age 18-65, diagnosed with Type 2 diabetic nephropathy
             (Stage II-IV) who meet the WHO diagnostic standards of diabetes in 1999. The
             international Mogensen staging standard for diabetic nephropathy is used.
             Specifically, in Stage II (normal albuminuria stage), the UAER is normal (＜20μg /min
             or＜30mg/24h). In Stage III (early diabetic nephropathy stage), the UAER is 20-200μg
             /min or 30-300 mg/24h. In Stage IV (clinical or overt diabetic nephropathy stage), the
             UAER is ＞200μg/min or urine protein quantitation is ＞500mg /24h.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Renal damage caused by other causes;

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure constantly greater than 140/ 90mmHg);

          -  Type 1 Diabetes

          -  Any acute and chronic infections;

          -  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)＞7.5%;

          -  24h urinary protein quantity＞3g, serum albumin＜25g /L and estimated glomerular
             filtration rate (eGFR)＜60 ml/min;

          -  Patients who suffered from malignant tumors or any illness that endanger life, such as
             liver, kidney, heart and lung function insufficiency over the past 5 years;

          -  People who have received the gastrointestinal operation, which may affect absorption
             of Vitamin D;

          -  People who have taken such drugs as angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium, and
             angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor that affect excretion of urine protein, and
             who have been allergic to Vitamin D;

          -  Pregnant or lactating women;

          -  Other candidates that are deemed not suitable by investigators.
