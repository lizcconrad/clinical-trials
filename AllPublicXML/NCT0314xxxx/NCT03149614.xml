  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical effects of spinal mobilization versus
      vertebral resonant oscillation (POLD) in patients with bilateral mechanical neck pain on pain
      sensitivity and neck pain intensity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical practice guidelines for manual therapy management the neck pain including the
      spine mobilization.

      The vertebral resonant oscillation using the POLD method is similar to spine mobilizations,
      but there are some differens; the oscillatory movement has a sinusoidal waveform, the
      frequency used between 1.2 and 2 Hz and the amplitude is similar to &quot;neutral zone&quot; to
      described by Panjabi 1992.

      The spinal mobilizations has a posterior-anterior vertebral movement for spinous process,
      described by Maitland 2000.
