    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is skeletally mature.

          -  The patient qualifies for primary Total Ankle Replacement (TAR) per the surgeon and
             has a diagnosis of one of the following: Primary Arthritis (e.g. Degenerative
             Disease), Secondary Arthritis (e.g. Post-Traumatic, Avascular Necrosis, if minimally
             2/3 of the talus is preserved), or Systemic Arthritis of the ankle (e.g. Rheumatoid
             Arthritis, Hemochromatosis).

          -  The patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up visits, evaluations
             and questionnaires as described in the Informed Consent.

          -  The patient reads, understands and signs the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved
             Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is Morbidly Obese (defined by Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40 or BMI of 35 - 40
             with significant medical problems caused by or made worse by their weight).

          -  The patient has one of the following conditions, which could compromise the affected
             limb: ankle arthrodesis with malleolar exeresis, severe neurological (Charcot's
             Arthropathy) or vascular disease, loss of musculature or neuromuscular compromise.

          -  The patient has an active local/systemic infection that may affect the prosthetic
             joint or has a recent history of infection.

          -  The patient has a condition that may impair proper wound healing (e.g., poor soft
             tissue envelope).

          -  The patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the follow up period.

          -  The patient has a metabolic disorder or disease that may compromise bone quality (e.g.
             arthrogryposis etc.), physiological or anatomical anomalies, and/or malignancy/local
             bone tumors.

          -  The patient has inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, severe
             neuropathy).

          -  The patient has a known sensitivity or allergic reaction to one or more of the
             implanted materials.
