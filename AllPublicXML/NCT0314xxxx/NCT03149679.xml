      Single center, open labeled, phase 2 clinical trial, where patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer are selected for treatment with dose dense Cyclophosphamide every second
      week based on TP53 mutation status; i.e. only patients with TP53 mutated tumors may be
      included in the treatment arm.

    <intervention_model_description>Single center, open labeled, phase 2 clinical trial, where patients are selected for treatment based on upfront TP53 mutation status; i.e. only patients with TP53 mutated tumors may be included in the single treatment arm. The informed consent, however needs to be signed prior to a biopsy for TP53 mutation analyses; thus, all patients are formally enrolled in the study prior to tissue collection, and the full population tested will be accounted for despite the fact that only patients with TP53 mutated tumors may enter the single treatment arm.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic colorectal cancer patients for whom conventional therapy has failed;
             defined as 2 lines of chemotherapy including oxaliplatin or irinotecan- containing
             regimens as well as an EGFR inhibitor if applicable.

          -  Tumor lesion suitable for biopsy

          -  Age &gt;18 years

          -  Clinically or radiologically measurable tumor deposits according to the RECIST
             criteria

          -  WHO performance status 0-1

          -  Radiology studies (CT thorax/abdomen/pelvis) and echo cor and ECG must be performed
             within 28 days prior to registration.

          -  Before patient registration in the trial, written informed consent must be given
             according to national and local regulations.

          -  Blood test requirements:

        Neutrophils &gt; 1.0 e9/L Platelets &gt; 75 e9/L Bilirubin &lt; 20 µmol / L. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5
        x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Co-morbidity including, but not limited to, impaired renal-, liver or bone marrow
             function, that based on the assessment of the treating physician, may preclude the use
             of cyclophosphamide at actual doses.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug, its metabolites or any excipients in the
             infusion solution.

          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition(s) potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients cannot be included.

          -  Clinical evidence of serious coagulopathy. Prior arterial/venous thrombosis or
             embolism does not exclude patients from inclusion, unless patient is considered unfit
             by study oncologist.

          -  Patient not able to give an informed consent or comply with study regulations as
             deemed by study investigator.
