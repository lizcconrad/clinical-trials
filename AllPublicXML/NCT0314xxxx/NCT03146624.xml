      OBJECTIVE to evaluate patients satisfaction of obturator with attachment versus conventional
      obturator in treatment of unilateral maxillectomy .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fourteen patients were selected according to the following criteria : patients having
      sufficient number of natural teeth(class I and \or class IV Aramany classification)not less
      than five teeth, intact soft palate , sufficient mouth opening , not exposed to radiotherapy
      or chemotherapy. Patients were divided into two equal groups, each of seven patients:
      patients of group I(Comparator) received a clasp retained obturator, while patients of group
      II(Intervention) received an attachment-retained obturator (RCT). The design of the
      definitive obturator for group I included double Aker's clasp on the first , second premolars
      and molars with alternating buccal and lingual retention, palatal plate as a major connector
      and a meshwork extension at the defect side. For group II, crown preparation of all the
      remaining abutments was done. Then, in the wax pattern, a lingual guiding plane was prepared
      and two OT Vertical attachments were attached mesial to the most anterior abutment and
      palatal to the second premolar and first molar . Construction of the splinted crowns were
      completed and the final impression was made with the splinted crowns in place to be picked up
      into the impression. After final try-in of the obturator, construction of the definitive
      obturator was completed with a hard resin hollowed obturator bulb, functional relining with
      soft silicone liner for both groups.

      Evaluation included patient satisfaction (primary outcome)where Two scales were followed in
      this study which are&quot;The Obturator Functioning Scale&quot; and &quot; The European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer Head and Neck 35&quot;
