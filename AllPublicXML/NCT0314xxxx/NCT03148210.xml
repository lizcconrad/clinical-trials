  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous population health studies suggest that up to 10% of Canadian adults have undiagnosed
      asthma or COPD- these people are currently undiagnosed and untreated, even though they may
      have significant respiratory symptoms. Our study will use targeted casefinding to find people
      with undiagnosed asthma and COPD in Canadian communities. The investigators will assess their
      symptoms and their health care use and number of sick days to determine the burden of
      undiagnosed respiratory disease in these people. The investigators will then determine
      whether early treatment of previously undiagnosed airflow obstruction will improve patients'
      health outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects at least 18 years old;

          -  Subjects who score &gt; or = to 4 points on The Asthma Screening Questionnaire or &gt; 16.5
             points on The COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire;

          -  Subjects who have given written informed consent to participate in this trial in
             accordance with local regulations;

          -  Subjects able to perform pre and post bronchodilator spirometry to measure lung

        subjects with airflow obstruction whose FEV1 improves by &gt; 12% and 200 ml after
        bronchodilator and COPD will be diagnosed in subjects who do not have a significant
        bronchodilator response and who exhibit persistent airflow obstruction post bronchodilator)
        will be asked to consent and participate in the RCT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who report a previous physician diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Subjects who report a previous physician diagnosis of COPD
