    <textblock>
      The purpose of Project 2 is to execute phase I functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      studies to assess the effects of lorcaserin on brain target engagement (measured by fMRI
      brain activation and neural connectivity) in cocaine use disorder (CocUD) subjects and/or
      opioid use disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the screening period (Study Days -3 and -2), the urine drug screen (UDS) must be
      negative for cocaine and opioids, and the self-reported last use of cocaine or opioids must
      be at least seven days prior to this result, in order to ensure that possible cocaine or
      opioid withdrawal has ended. After these criteria have been met, all subjects will receive
      placebo at 8:30 AM for one day during the Placebo Pretreatment Baseline Day (Study Day -1).
      The first fMRI session (fMRI #1) will take place at 10:00 AM on the following day (Study Day
      1). Following fMRI #1, the subjects will be randomized into two parallel groups (Group A:
      Lorcaserin; Group B: Parallel Placebo). Based on the information that a lower dose of
      lorcaserin has the potential to be clinically effective , and based on the safety and abuse
      potential data from human studies, as well as the preclinical data on interaction with
      cocaine , the study will begin with the lower dose of lorcaserin (10 mg per day). For Group A
      (lorcaserin group), the lorcaserin dose will be 10 mg orally per day for 7 days. For Group B
      (parallel placebo group), identical appearing placebo will be given orally according to the
      same schedule as lorcaserin for 7 days. After the 7 days of treatment with study medications,
      fMRI #2 will take place, then study medications will be discontinued. A follow-up visit will
      occur one week after the last dose of study medication. See Section II.b for details and
      criteria for stopping or continuing this dosage based on the results of the interim analysis,
      which will take place after 15 subjects have completed at each arm. Based on the interim
      analysis, if there is no significant effect and no trend towards significant effect (p &gt;
      0.10) for the lower dose lorcaserin in the primary regions of interest for the cue-reactivity
      fMRI task, and no significant accumulation of adverse effects, then testing will stop for the
      lower dose of lorcaserin, and testing will begin for the higher dose of lorcaserin (10 mg
      twice per day) 7 days. The higher dose of lorcaserin will be tested in a two group parallel
      arm design, initially with 15 subjects in the high dose lorcaserin arm and 15 subjects in the
      parallel placebo arm. Another interim analysis will take place after 15 subjects have
      completed at each arm in the higher dose lorcaserin study.

          3. Must be in residential or outpatient treatment for substance use disorder.

        3. Meet current DSM-5 criteria for Cocaine Use Disorder and/or Opioid Use Disorder with

        6. Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within normal limits, except
        that liver function tests must be less than twice the upper limit of normal and judged by
        the study physician to be clinically insignificant.

        7. Have a normal baseline ECG as shown by normal sinus rhythm with the exception of sinus
        arrhythmia or mild sinus bradycardia (heart rate 50 to 59 beats per minute), and with
        normal conduction (including normal QTcF), with the exception of early repolarization
        judged to be clinically insignificant by both the study physician and study cardiologist.

        8. Have no contraindications for study participation as determined by history and physical
        examination.

        9. Be able to demonstrate an understanding of study procedures and follow instructions
        including behavioral laboratory and fMRI testing.

        10. No pregnant or nursing women will be permitted in the study, and women must either be
        unable to conceive (i.e., surgically sterilized, sterile, or postmenopausal) or be using a
        reliable form of contraception (e.g., abstinence, birth control pills, intrauterine device
        with spermicide, or condoms). Men will be advised to use condoms. All females must provide
        negative pregnancy urine tests before study entry, at each visit during the study, and at
        the end of study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have concurrent DSM-5 diagnosis of any psychoactive substance use disorder other than
             cocaine, nicotine, opioid, or marijuana use disorder, or meet DSM-5 criteria for
             cocaine or opioid withdrawal

          2. Have a DSM-5 axis I psychiatric disorder other than substance use disorder, including
             but not limited to Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, ADHD, or
             Schizophrenia, or a neurological disorder requiring ongoing treatment and/or making
             study participation unsafe.

          3. Subjects with evidence or history of any clinically significant medical disorder
             including cardiovascular, endocrine, pulmonary, CNS, hepatic, or renal, except that
             controlled hypertension, controlled hypothyroidism, and cancer in remission will not
             be excluded.

          4. Subjects who have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus, since weight loss may increase
             the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with
             insulin and/or insulin secretagogues (eg, sulfonylureas), and lorcaserin has not been
             studied in combination with insulin.

          5. Subjects with an abnormal QTcF on ECG.

          6. Have a history of seizures (excluding childhood febrile seizures), or loss of
             consciousness for more than 20 minutes.

          7. Have significant current suicidal or homicidal ideation or a suicide attempt within
             the past 6 months.

             than cocaine, marijuana, alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine.

         12. Allowed concomitant medications should be maintained on a stable dose from screening
             until the end of the study. Stable regular doses of dihydropyridines, such as
             amlodipine (Norvasc), to control blood pressure are permitted. (However,
             cardiovascular drugs that are taken as prn that could affect the blood flow centrally
             are excluded).

        12. Prior to starting study medication, and prior to each MRI scanning session, have
        positive breath alcohol level, or have a positive urine drug screen for any drug of abuse
        other than marijuana.

        13. Have metal fragments or other bodily metal (e.g., pacemaker) or significant
        claustrophobia that would put the subjects at risk for MRI scanning.
