  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this clinical study is to see if a maintenance dose of GEN-003 reduces
      the number of days that subjects have a genital herpes recurrence. The second purpose of the
      study is to evaluate the safety and tolerablility of a maintenance dose of GEN-003.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of GEN-003 in
      subjects who have received previous doses of GEN-003 in the GEN-003-003 clinical trial.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 intramuscular (IM) dose (the
      maintenance dose) of GEN-003 or placebo.

      Subjects will use a daily electronic reporting tool for reporting the presence or absence of
      genital herpes lesions, and severity of genital herpes symptoms.
