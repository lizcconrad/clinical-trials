  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial hypothesis of this work is that the genesis and the evolution of the atheromatous
      plaque are partly controlled at the molecular level and in particular by the microRNAs
      through their role as regulator of the genes.

      The study of the tissue and serum profile over time of specific microRNAs involved in the
      regulation of atheromatous plaque correlated with clinical data and restenosis imaging will
      allow to define biological markers of restenosis in the patient with an arteritis of the
      lower limbs .

      This study is a pioneer in the field and it would be imprudent to conclude that a biomarker
      would be used clinically at the end of this work alone. Nevertheless this study will make a
      major advance in this topic, in vivo intervention studies with inhibition or over-expression
      of microRNA will obviously be necessary to confirm the use of these as biomarkers of
      arteritis of the lower limbs.

      Regular assay of reliable biomarkers in arterial patients will ultimately suggest early
      management to best adapt surgical and medical treatment.
