  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test a problem-solving intervention for Spanish-speaking stroke
      caregivers that will be delivered over the telephone and online via the previously developed
      and nationally available Spanish version of the RESCUE website. The investigators will adapt
      their previously pilot-tested problem-solving intervention and make it culturally-relevant
      for Hispanic caregivers. The investigators' main goal is to test the efficacy of a brief,
      telephone and online problem-solving intervention. The objectives are: 1) reduce caregiver
      burden and depression, 2) improve caregivers' problem-solving abilities, self-efficacy, and
      quality of life, 3) improve Veterans' functional abilities and determine the intervention's
      impact on Veterans' healthcare utilization, 4) determine budgetary impact, and 5) determine
      caregivers' perceptions of the intervention.

      This research study will test a problem-solving intervention for Spanish-speaking stroke
      caregivers that will be delivered over the telephone and online via the previously developed
      and nationally available Spanish version of the RESCUE website. The investigators will adapt
      their previously pilot-tested problem-solving intervention and make it culturally-relevant
      for Hispanic caregivers. The investigators' main goal is to test the efficacy of a brief,
      telephone and online problem-solving intervention. The objectives are: 1) reduce caregiver
      burden and depression, 2) improve caregivers' problem-solving abilities, self-efficacy, and
      quality of life, 3) improve Veterans' functional abilities and determine the intervention's
      impact on Veterans' healthcare utilization, 4) determine budgetary impact, and 5) determine
      caregivers' perceptions of the intervention.

      The investigators will conduct a two-arm (8-session intervention vs. standard care), ,
      randomized controlled trial to test a problem-solving intervention for Spanish-speaking
      stroke caregivers that will be delivered over the telephone and online via the previously
      developed and nationally available Spanish version of the RESCUE website. A sample of 290
      stroke caregivers will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or a standard care
      group. Eligibility criteria: caregivers of Veterans with a primary diagnosis of stroke who
      have received services from the VA CHS are eligible for participation if they meet the
      following criteria: 1) are the primary caregiver and provide the majority of care for a
      Veteran who has a diagnosis of stroke (ICD9 codes for stroke: 430-438 or ICD 10 codes 160.0
      through 169.998) within the last six months and who has at least two activity of daily living
      (ADL) deficits, 2) have Internet access and ability, (either themselves or via a relative or
      friend) 3) are reachable by cell or home phone, 4) Spanish is their preferred language, 5)
      have moderate to severe stress, and 6) self-identify as Hispanic/Puerto Rican, and 7) agree
      to random assignment to the intervention or standard care group.

      Baseline measurements will be conducted with the caregivers prior to the intervention.
      Post-test assessments will be collected at 1 and 12 weeks post-intervention. In addition, the
      investigators will obtain pre- and post-test measures of Veteran-related variables via CPRS
      electronic health records. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to assess caregivers'
      perceptions of the intervention. A general linear mixed model for repeated measures will be
      used to examine the relationship between treatment assignment and each outcome over time. The
      investigators will measure the budgetary impact of providing intervention by comparing the
      costs of the intervention group to the costs of the control group.

    <description>The intervention consists of a problem-solving intervention and information/tools on the previously developed, evidenced-based Spanish-version of the RESCUE stroke caregiver website to improve stroke caregiver outcomes. The intervention will be conducted via telephone by a trained rehabilitation counselor. The intervention consists of four components: 1. Introduction to the RESCUE website and the problem-solving method; 2. Illustrative example on how to use the problem-solving approach and the RESCUE website to address caregiving problems; 3. Individualized practice exercise to develop a personalized problem-solving plan; and 4. Summary of the problem-solving method.</description>
