  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Bronchiolitis is one of the most common and costly respiratory diseases in
      infants and young children. Despite the high prevalence and morbidity of bronchiolitis,
      therapy remains controversial. Supportive care ensuring adequate hydration and oxygenation
      remains the cornerstone of therapy for these infants.

      Over the past 2 decades, research on bronchiolitis management has explored the use of
      nebulized hypertonic saline that rehydrate the airway surface liquid and improve mucociliary
      clearance, as well as reduce airway edema.

      Aim:The aim of this study is to investigate whether the addition of frequently nebulized
      hypertonic saline to standard therapy affects the length of stay (LOS) of moderately ill
      infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.

      The investigators will conduct this prospective double blind randomized clinical trial by
      comparing between 2 groups of patients with bronchiolitis, first group will receive 3%
      hypertonic saline and second group will receive 0.9% saline.

      Data collection includes:

      Name, Age, Mode of delivery, Birth weight, Current weight, Number of sibling, Immunization
      record, Duration of breast feeding, past medical history including number of wheezy chest,
      pneumonia, Parents level of education, Presence of Asthma / Allergic rhinitis in family, Pets
      /Smoke at home)

      Using the validated Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) investigators will
      assign patients a score before and at the end of treatment.

      To prepare 3% sodium chloride, the investigators will dilute 60 ml 20% sodium chloride
      injection with 500 ml normal saline (NSS) 0.9%.

      Length of stay will be measured in both groups, to establish the efficacy of hypertonic
      saline in reducing length of stay.
