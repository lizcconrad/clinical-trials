  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplant candidates who have CMV-specific, CD8+ T-cells, are CMV-seropositive and
      carry HLA-A1 and/ or HLA- A2 alleles have a high probability to maintain this type of
      immunity during the three first months after the transplant, despite induction
      immunosuppressive therapy (thymoglobulin).

        Patients who are candidates for renal transplant and who fulfil the clinical criteria
        established by the participating institutions to receive induction immunosuppressive
        therapy. Participating institutions may include centers from the Spanish Network for
        Research in Infectious Diseases (REIPI, Transplantation Program) as well as other centers
        outside the network.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Renal transplant recipients with CMV-positive serology.

          2. Patients with pre-transplant, CMV-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity, i.e. IFNγ
             levels ≥0.2 UI/mL (QF-CMV Reactive).

          3. Adults over 18 years of age.

          4. Patients receiving induction therapy with thymoglobulin (at least a cumulative dosage
             of 1mg/kg).

          5. Patients receiving prophylaxis with valganciclovir (900 mg/day, adjusted to kidney
             function) until day 90 after transplant.

          6. Patients who signed an informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Multivisceral transplantation, including pancreas-kidney transplantation.

          2. HIV infected patients.

          3. Patients who cannot comply with the monitoring protocol.
