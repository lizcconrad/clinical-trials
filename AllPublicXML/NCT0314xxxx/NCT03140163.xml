      The ULTRACHEST study will be a prospective clinical diagnostic performance study with primary
      objective to establish device diagnostic clinical performance of Ultra Low Dose CT (ULD-CT)
      in order to prove it is more accurate in detecting pneumonia when comparing to standard
      conventional chest radiography.

      -  200 subjects

        -  Each subject will undergo CXR and ULD-CT at the same day.

        -  Subjects subdivided into 3 groups [high, moderate and low risk], based on a laboratory
           finding(CRP), symptoms and physical examination.

        -  3 different thoracic radiologist will judge the scans on existence of consolidation.
           Consolidation will be expressed as binary outcomes (Yes or No consolidation)

        -  Radiologist will be blinded for subjects demographic data.

        -  All radiologist have to score how confidence they were on the finding of
           consolidation[5point likert].

        -  The investigators will perform a McNemar's test for evaluation. A two sided p-value of
           less than 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.

        -  Inter-observer variability will be evaluated by using a Fleiss Kappa test.

    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be subdivided into 3 groups [high, moderate and low risk], based on a laboratory finding(CRP).
CRP levels lower than 20mg/L &gt; low risk
CRP levels between 20 and 100mg/l &gt; medium risk

    <measure>5 point likert scale to evaluate the &quot;level of confidence&quot; of each radiologist</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>- As described in &quot;outcome 1&quot; the radiologist judges the scans on existence of consolidation. After each judgement the radiologists has to fill in a questionaire [5 point likert scale] to score their level of confidence on the finding on whether or not they saw consolidation on the scan.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>All 3 radiologist will be asked to write down on paper if they see an additional finding on either the ULD-CT or CXR</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Three different thoracic radiologist will judge the scans and fill in a questionaire if they see any additional finding (Yes/No).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>In case the radiologist observes an additional finding, the radiologist has to fill in a questionaire on paper what kind of additional finding was seen:</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>In case they see an additional finding, they have to fill in what kind of additional finding the have seen and write it down in the questionaire.
Example:
[tumoral mass; pleural effusion; atelectasis; lymph nodules].
- Additional findings will be subdivided in: atelectasis, pleural effusion, tree in bud, lymph nodes or tumoral mass.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reporting the total number of observed additional findings for each modality [ULD-CT and CXR], based on the above mentioned questionaires</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>All additional findings will be presented in a table.
for example:
Number of subjects with additional finding of atelectasis:
ULD-CT (40 ULD-CT scans with atelectasis out of 100)
CXR (25 CXR radiographs with atelectasis out of 100)
Number of subjects with additional finding of tumoral mass:
ULD-CT (2 ULD-CT scans with tumoral mass out of 100)
CXR (1 CXR radiographs with tumoral mass out of 100)
Number of subjects with additional finding of pleural effusion:
ULD-CT (15 ULD-CT scans with pleural effusion out of 100)
CXR (33 CXR radiographs with pleural effusion out of 100)</description>
