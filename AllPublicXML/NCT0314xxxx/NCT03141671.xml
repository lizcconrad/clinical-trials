    <textblock>
      This research study is comparing two different combinations of androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT) used together with radiation as a treatment for rising PSA after radical prostatectomy
      (prostate cancer).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that an intervention is being
      studied. In this study, the investigational agents are apalutamide and abiraterone acetate.

      Currently, the best standard treatment for men with this type of prostate cancer includes
      radiation therapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT blocks the function
      of hormones including testosterone which prostate cancer uses to grow and spread. All
      participants in this study will receive the main standard form of ADT called a luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHA). Physicians often also use another drug called
      bicalutamide to help the LHRHA block hormone function. The investigators are testing whether
      using two newer anti-hormonal drugs called abiraterone acetate and apalutamide with LHRHA can
      improve cure rates compared to using bicalutamide plus LHRHA. These two drugs work together
      to suppress both testosterone and the receptor where testosterone binds thereby providing
      more potent hormone suppression.
