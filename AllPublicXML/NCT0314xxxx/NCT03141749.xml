  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in DM1 and in other inherited myopathies, which can
      lead to chronic immobilization, are unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      incidence of VTE in cohort of patients presenting with DM1 with a comparison to a group of
      other inheritable myopathies and to a community-based population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cohort of more that 2,800 adult patients admitted to our Institutions between January 2000
      and November 2014 with genetically proven myopathy will be retrospectively included.

      Any information relative to their demographic and genetic characteristics, their muscular
      functional status and the occurrence of VTE will be collected.

      Statistical analysis will be performed to estimate the incidence of venous thromboembolism in
      this population, to identify predictors of VTE, and to compare its incidence to a
      community-based population.
