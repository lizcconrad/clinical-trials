    <textblock>
      c-TRAK TN is a multi-centre phase II study, consisting of a circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA)
      screening component and a therapeutic component. c-TRAK TN aims to assess whether ctDNA
      screening can be used to detect residual disease following patients standard primary
      treatment for triple negative breast cancer, and will assess the safety and activity of the
      investigational medicinal product pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo blinded serial ctDNA screening every 3 months from the point of
      registration and completion of primary treatment for their triple negative breast cancer. If
      a ctDNA positive result occurs on or before their 12 month ctDNA screening assessment they
      will be randomised by the Institute of Cancer Research Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit
      (ICR-CTSU) in a 2:1 ratio to the pembrolizumab treatment arm or observation arm. The patient
      and their treating team will only be informed of the randomisation if they are allocated
      treatment.

      Patients without a positive ctDNA result within 12 months of starting ctDNA screening, will
      not be randomised but will continue to have blinded ctDNA screening every 3 months up to 2
      years from starting ctDNA screening.

      All patients will be followed up every 6 months until recurrence, specific withdrawal of
      consent for follow up, or until sponsor advises no further follow up is required.

For patients allocated to the observation group, the treating team and patient will not be informed that randomisation has taken place in order to remain blinded to the positive ctDNA result.

             Adjuvant chemotherapy:

             Patients must be registered within 3 months of the last cycle of adjuvant
             chemotherapy, or within 4 weeks of completing adjuvant radiotherapy, whichever occurs
             later. Patients may register during adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy and should
             be registered as early as possible.

          8. Consent to provide research blood samples.

          9. Patients with bilateral tumours can be included if both are triple negative and if two
             archival tissues samples can be provided per tumour.

         10. Patients must have had surgery achieving clear margins (as per local guidelines).
