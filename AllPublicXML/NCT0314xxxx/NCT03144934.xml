    <textblock>
      The subjects who are adequately eligible to attend this clinical trial via screening will be
      assigned to four cohorts (five if necessary) and administered a single dose of GX-I7 solution
      or placebo drug for intravaginal injection at the visit 3 (Day0) and 7 (Day28). After
      completing scheduled tests at the visit 6 (Day 14), safety-related data of each cohort will
      be evaluated by Independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). Dose escalation will proceed
      under the principal investigator, medical monitor, and the sponsor's mutual approval,
      referring to SMC's evaluation.

    <description>Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is T cell growth factor that can be used for treating lymphopenia patients. GX-I7 is a protein drug recombining human IL-7 and hybrid Fc (hyFc). HyFc made by Genexine is composed of hinge-CH2 region of Immunoglobulin D (IgD) and CH2-CH3 region of Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). The recombined region is not exposed and each region's characteristics can reduce immunogenicity and improve the efficacy of drug. Consequently, it will be able to treat the patients with lymphopenia in effective ways.</description>
