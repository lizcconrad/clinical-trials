  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multi-system granulomatous disorder that is triggered and influenced by
      gene-environment interactions. Although sarcoidosis predominantly affects the lungs in most
      cases, the clinical disease course is highly variable and any organ can be affected leading
      to end organ damage despite currently available therapeutics that unfortunately also have
      numerous and potentially devastating side effects. The environmental triggers of sarcoidosis
      are unknown but several occupational, environmental and infectious agents have been
      associated with sarcoidosis in susceptible hosts. Exposure to these triggers result in
      inflammation, characterized by activation of CD4+ T-cells, cytokine production, subsequent
      recruitment of other immune cells, and granuloma formation. Although several genetic markers
      have been associated with sarcoidosis, none fully explain individual susceptibility or
      clinical course variability, strongly implicating the environment and epigenetics. We have
      the ability to generate a map of the epigenetic histone modifications in immune cells via
      Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation coupled with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and a map
      of transcriptome profiles via RNA-seq. The availability of histone and transcriptional
      signatures defining T cell activity in sarcoidosis will help identify the specific molecular
      programs affected by disease processes and can become the basis for future discovery of novel
      biomarker diagnostics in a clinical setting.
