  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke represents one of the main causes of adult disability and will be one of the main
      contributors to the burden of disease in 2030. However, our healthcare systems do not have
      enough resources to cover the current demand let alone its future increase. There is a need
      to deploy new approaches that advance the current rehabilitation methods and enhance their
      efficiency.

      One of the latest approaches used for the rehabilitation of a wide range of deficits of the
      nervous system is based on virtual reality (VR) applications, which combine training
      scenarios with dedicated interface devices. On the other hand, recent studies have shown the
      potential of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to restore motor function in
      hemiparetic stroke patients. It must be emphasized, however, that so far little work exists
      on the quantitative assessment of the clinical impact of VR based approaches in combination
      with tDCS protocols. We hypothesize that the combination of VR-based motor rehabilitation
      protocols with concurrent anodal tDCS can boost functional recovery, and may achieve superior
      effects when compared to 3 alternative treatments: 1) VR without tDCS, 2) occupational
      therapy with tDCS, and 3) occupational therapy without tDCS.

      The findings derived from this study will contribute to establish a novel and superior
      neurorehabilitation paradigm that can accelerates the recovery of hemiparetic stroke
      patients. Besides the clinical impact, such achievement could have relevant socioeconomic
      impact.
