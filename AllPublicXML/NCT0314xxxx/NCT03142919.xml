      LPS Challenge in Individuals with Major Depressive Disorder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to understand the biological differences between two distinct
      subtypes of depression, patients with and without inflammation as defined by c-reactive
      protein (CRP). Using a double-blinded, parallel group, placebo-controlled design,
      participants will be phenotyped before and after a low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      challenge designed to perturb the immune system and trigger a transient, mild inflammatory
      response. This experimental design will allow for the delineation of the homeostatic
      mechanisms underlying sensitivity to inflammation-related depression. Low-dose LPS has been
      used by multiple groups to safely induce transient inflammatory responses in humans. The
      pilot study is expected to take approximately one year to complete.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Both healthy controls and depressed participants will be required to be in good
             general health (as evaluated during Visit 1, including EKG) and to be 18-55 years of
             age. Depressed participants will be required to have symptoms of depression (i.e. a
             PHQ-9 score ≥10) and be unmedicated for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine).
             Half the depressed participants (N=10) will be required to have a high-sensitivity
             C-Reactive Protein (CRP) score of ≥3 mg/L, and half the participants will be required
             to have a CRP score of ≤1 mg/L.
