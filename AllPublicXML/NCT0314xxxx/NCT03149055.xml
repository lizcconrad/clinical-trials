    <description>Clinical failure is measured by:
Systemic antifungal therapy for &gt; 14 consecutive days for suspected fungal infection up to week 14.
Breakthrough proven or probable fungal infection during the prophylaxis phase. The prophylaxis phase is defined as the period from the first dose of isavuconazole through 7 days after discontinuation
Toxicity leading to permanent discontinuation of prophylaxis
