  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate lung ultrasound as a method for measuring
      extravascular lung water in stabilized patients during hospitalization for ADHF. Subjects who
      have been stabilized following admission for ADHF and capable of lying supine will be
      evaluated by lung ultrasound to determine the degree of lung congestion as measured by the
      total B-line score. Since different patients may require different degrees of postural change
      and/or other maneuvers (e.g., leg elevation or exercise) to induce B-line increments, a
      tailored sequential protocol will be employed to define which maneuvers are sufficient for
      each patient.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Hospitalized for the management of acute decompensated heart failure

        Reached at least a 12-hour period after hospital admission

        Presence of peripheral edema with a score of at least 1+ (slight pitting in both ankles;
        2mm or less depression that disappears rapidly)

        Able to lie supine with no more than one pillow (approximately a 10 cm head elevation)
        without dyspnea for at least 30 minutes by patient report

        Have not received treatment with any intravenous loop diuretic within the 4 hours prior to
        initiating study assessments and with no plans for additional intravenous treatment during
        the series of lung ultrasound measurements

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Persistent uncontrolled hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mmHg)

        Significant lung disease including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (See
        concomitant medication exclusions), pulmonary fibrosis, active asthma or acute pneumonia

        Use of medications specified for the treatment of COPD including short- and long-acting
        bronchodilators (Î²-agonists and anticholinergics) and inhaled glucocorticoids as well as
        oxygen therapy

        Use of another investigational product in a clinical study within the following time period
        prior to the first administration of study medication: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the
        duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer)
