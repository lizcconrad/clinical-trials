  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the early outcomes following Reverse Shoulder
      Arthroplasty (RSA) in patients sixty years or younger for the purpose of characterizing these
      patients, evaluating their clinical outcomes and radiographic appearance.We would like to
      know how quickly they are healing and returning to their baseline activities of daily living
      and ability to work. This will help when counseling patients prior to surgery as it will give
      us a better defined and study supported understanding of the post-operative recovery timeline
      in the younger population.

      This study is looking at patients who are sixty years or younger at the time of they undergo
      a reverse total shoulder replacement. This is an important population to look at their
      functional and clinical outcomes as they are often still employed and have more physical
      demands upon their shoulder in everyday life than the older replacement population for which
      there are more outcome data available. We would like to determine how the younger population
      is healing and returning to their baseline activities of daily living and ability to work.
      This will help when counseling patients prior to surgery as it will give us a study supported
      understanding of the post-operative recovery timeline in the younger population. We will
      review x-rays to evaluate healing at two years. Functional surveys are given pre and post
      operatively (1 &amp; 2 years) and these will be reviewed as well. A physical exam is also
      performed to determine range of motion pre and post operatively (1 &amp; 2 years).
