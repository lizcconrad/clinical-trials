  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized clinical trial in which patients treated with 3X per weekly
      conventional hemodialysis will be treated to a dialysate sodium 135 mEq/L vs. 138 mEq/L and
      followed for safety and tolerability, effects on BP and volume.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized clinical trial in which hypertensive hemodialysis patients will be
      randomized to a low dialysate sodium (Na) of 135 mEq/L or a standard dialysate Na of 138
      mEq/L. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to the low arm. Dialysate Na will be lowered 1 mEq/L
      every 2 weeks, as tolerated. Tolerance will be assessed by symptoms, intradialytic
      hypotension (IDH) episodes (systolic BP &lt;90 or intervention for symptoms or BP drop during
      dialysis), achievement of dry weight. The trial will last for 6 to 12 months, for an
      individual, depending on when they entered the trial. The primary outcome is feasibility and
      safety of using the lower dialysate sodium which is assessed by symptoms during or
      immediately after dialysis, intradialytic hypotension episodes and the frequency of emergency
      room visits and hospitalizations. Several secondary outcomes will be measured including blood
      pressure prior to dialysis and at home, change in plasma Na over time, dry weight,
      post-dialysis weight, interdialytic weight change, symptoms of thirst and dry mouth,
      self-reported dialysis recovery time, relative blood volume change during a single treatment
      (via 'Critline') and, in patients without an implanted electronic device, extraceullular
      fluid volume (via bioimpedance).

    <time_frame>Baseline period through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>IDH is determined by review of blood pressures (measured every 30 minutes during dialysis), symptoms (recorded by the nurse during the dialysis treatment and reviewed at Q2 weekly face to face visits by the study team) and the need for intervention (targeted ultrafiltration goal was reduced; treatment was terminated early or saline given for intradialytic hypotension. IDH is defined by any 1 (or more of the following) 1) lowest intradialytic Systolic BP &lt;90 mm Hg or 2) intradialytic symptoms (cramps, lightheadedness, nausea +/-vomiting, diaphoresis, loss of consciousness or seizure) OR 3) intervention performed for symptoms of IDH or lowest intradialytic BP &lt;90 mm Hg.
The # IDH events (meeting 1 or more of the 3 criteria above) per 100 treatments will be compared across treatment arms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline period through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ascertained via self-report on a questionnaire that asks about the frequency of symptoms suggestive of DD occurring during or immediately after dialysis. The symptoms are: headache, nausea +/- vomiting, confusion, drowsiness, muscle twitching, blurred vision. There are 5 response options ranging from never through to very often for each question. The questionnaire is administered at baseline, at 6 weeks, and Q3 months thereafter. The change in frequency of each symptom will be compared across arms.</description>
