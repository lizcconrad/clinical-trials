    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in
      diagnosing abdominal solid organ injuries in pediatric patients. 146 subjects will be
      enrolled across approximately 8 sites in the US. All subjects will have had a Computerized
      Tomography (CT) scan as part of standard of care, confirming at least one solid organ
      abdominal injury. All subjects will have an abdominal ultrasound without contrast, followed
      by a contrast-enhanced ultrasound using the contrast agent Lumason. Ultrasound and
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound results will be compared to the CT scan results. The study
      procedures will take place within 48 hours of injury.

      This is an interventional study proposes to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) in diagnosing abdominal solid organ injuries in pediatric patients. 146
      subjects will be enrolled across approximately 8 sites in the US. All subjects will have had
      a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan as part of standard of care, confirming at least one
      solid organ abdominal injury. All subjects will have an abdominal ultrasound without
      contrast, followed by a contrast-enhanced ultrasound using the contrast agent Lumason.
      Ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound results will be compared to the CT scan results.
      The study procedures will take place within 48 hours of injury. At conclusion of enrollment
      of all subjects a centralized review of CT vs. CEUS will occur to compare to real time
      readings.
