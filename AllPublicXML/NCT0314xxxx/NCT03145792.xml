  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial examines the efficacy of two behavioral therapies. Seeking
      Safety, which addresses co-occurring problem gambling (PG) and posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD), is being compared to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for PG, which addresses only PG.
      Both models are delivered via telehealth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our key study question is whether an integrated focus on PG and PTSD (Seeking Safety; SS)
      offers a useful new option for clinical care compared to a purely problem gambling approach
      (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for PG; CBT-PG). This question—the impact of integrated versus
      non-integrated treatment for co-occurring disorders—is one of the key issues in the field
      currently and has never been studied in relation to PG and PTSD.

      Our aims are:

        1. To conduct an RCT of SS versus CBT-PG in a sample of 84 people with current PG and PTSD
           (full or subthreshold).

        2. To evaluate outcomes from baseline to end of treatment and 12 month followup on two
           primary variables (money lost gambling and number of gambling sessions) and several
           secondary variables.

      Our hypotheses are: (a) SS will do no worse than CBT-PG on the primary PG outcomes as both
      treatments are designed to address addiction; i.e., both will show improvement from baseline
      to end of treatment and maintenance of gains through the followup. (b) SS will show superior
      results on trauma symptoms as SS is designed to address those, whereas CBT-PG is not.
