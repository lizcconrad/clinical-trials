    <textblock>
      This trial will consist of two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 will enroll adult healthy
      volunteers (HV) into four treatment groups. The first group will enroll HV into a single
      ascending dose (SAD) treatment group consisting of three cohorts. The second group will
      enroll HV into a multiple ascending dose (MAD) treatment group consisting of three cohorts.
      The third group will enroll HV into a food effect (FE) treatment group consisting of one
      cohort. The fourth group will enroll HV into a drug-drug interactions (DDI) treatment group
      consisting of one cohort. Part 2 Cohorts 1 through 3 will enroll adult subjects with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) currently on stable ivacaftor/lumacaftor background therapy for a minimum of
      three months into a MAD treatment group consisting of three cohorts. Part 2 Cohort 4 will
      enroll adult subjects with CF not currently receiving or have received cystic fibrosis
      conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1. Approximately
      125 subjects will be enrolled.

      PART 1 The SAD treatment group is comprised of three cohorts where HV will be randomized to
      either PTI-801 or placebo. Following the conclusion of at least three SAD cohorts, a set of
      HV will participate in an assigned MAD treatment group. The MAD treatment group is comprised
      of three cohorts where subjects will be randomized to receive either PTI-801 or placebo once
      daily (QD) for a total of 7 days. Following the conclusion of at least three SAD cohorts, a
      set of HV will participate in a FE treatment group. The FE treatment group is comprised of
      one cohort where subjects will be randomized to receive an initial single dose of PTI-801
      either after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours (fasted group) or after an overnight fast
      of at least 10 hours followed by the consumption of a high fat high and high calorie meal
      (fed group). After a 10 day washout period, subjects will cross over to the opposite group
      and receive a second dose of PTI-801. Following the conclusion of at least two MAD cohorts, a
      set of HV will participate in a DDI treatment group. The DDI treatment group is comprised of
      one cohort where subjects will receive a 3-drug cocktail consisting of caffeine, bupropion,
      and midazolam on Day 1. On Day 4, subjects will be randomized to receive either PTI-801 or
      placebo QD for a total of 12 days. On Day 17, subjects will receive the 3-drug cocktail in
      combination with PTI-801 or placebo.

      PART 2 Part 2 is comprised of a MAD treatment group with three cohorts and a
      co-administration group with one cohort. Following conclusion of the complementary HV MAD
      cohort in Part 1, a set of adult subjects diagnosed with CF currently on stable
      ivacaftor/lumacaftor background therapy for a minimum of three months will participate in the
      Part 2 complementary CF MAD cohort. Subjects will be randomized to receive either PTI-801 or
      placebo QD for a total of 14 days. Following conclusion of CF MAD Cohort 1 in Part 2, a set
      of adult subjects diagnosed with CF not currently receiving or have received background CFTR
      modulator therapy for a minimum of 30 days prior to Day 1 will participate in the Part 2 CF
      PTI-801 and PTI-808 co-administration cohort. Subjects will be randomized to receive either
      PTI-801 co-administered with PTI-808 or placebos QD for a total of 14 days.
