  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease with a broad
      diversity of symptoms and fluctuating progression patterns. Clinical assessments are
      challenging and are continually reviewed and enhanced. Optimal multiple sclerosis care
      depends on early detection of disease progression. The Digital self-Assessment for Multiple
      sclerosis (DAM) mobile program was developed by Ad Scientiam in order to create a robust and
      clinically validated remote monitoring platform for MS patients and clinicians. The
      correlation between DAM version 0 (the first iteration of DAMS) and Multiple Sclerosis
      Functional Composite (MSFC) has been clinically evaluated in a preliminary study in 30
      subjects. DAM version 0 and MFSC global scores were correlated. However, the cognition test
      had a poor reproducibility and clinicians expressed the wish to measure a walking range
      rather than a walking speed. Even though vision is the main sense impacting all other tests,
      particularly when interacting with a mobile, visual tests are rarely performed in real life.
      A new version of DAM version 0, DAMS, was therefore developed with the addition of the Sloan
      Low Contrast Letter Acuity Test (SLCLAT), the replacement of the walking speed test with a
      walking distance test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) by a new version of
      the cognitive test which resembles the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).

      The hypothesis is that systematic and prospective multi-dimensional data collection of MS
      disabilities through the DAMS mobile application will refine the quality and accuracy of both
      clinicians and patients' knowledge of the disease progression and will ultimately improve the
      current care of patients.

      To test this assumption, the statistician will analyze:

        1. The global diagnostic performance of DAMS with (DAMS 4 tests) and without (DAMS 3 tests)
           the low contrast vision test versus standard MS scales

        2. The test-retest reliability of DAMS' scores at a 15 day interval
