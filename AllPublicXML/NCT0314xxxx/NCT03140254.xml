        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may be of either sex, at least 18 years of age and of any race.

          -  Subjects must read and sign an Informed Consent Form, Authorization to Use and
             Disclose Protected Health Information Form, and List of Restricted Products prior to
             participating in the study.

          -  Female subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test documented before treatment
             with test materials.

          -  Screening day microbial baseline meeting minimum skin flora baseline requirements on
             abdomen and groin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergies or sensitivities to sunscreens, deodorants, laundry detergents,
             fragrances, vinyl, latex (rubber), alcohols, metals, inks, or to common antibacterial
             agents found in soaps, lotions, or ointments.

          -  Exposure of test sites to strong detergents, solvents, or other irritants within the
             14-day product-restriction period or during the test period.

          -  Exposure of test sites to antimicrobial agents, medicated soaps, medicated shampoos,
             or medicated lotions, use of biocide-treated pools or hot tubs, use of tanning beds,
             or sunbathing during the 14-day product-restriction period or during the test period.

          -  Wear fabric softener-treated clothing (including bug-repellent and UV-treated
             clothing) during the 14-day product-restriction period or during the test period.

          -  Use of systemic or topical antibiotic medications, steroid medications (other than for
             hormonal contraception or post-menopausal reasons), or any other product known to
             affect the normal microbial flora of the skin during the 14-day product-restriction
             period or during the test period.

          -  A medical diagnosis of a physical condition, such as a current or recent severe
             illness, mitral valve prolapse with a heart murmur, congenital heart disease,
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C, an organ transplant, or an immunocompromised condition such
             as AIDS (or HIV positive), lupus, diabetes, Crohn's disease, asthma or medicated
             multiple sclerosis.

          -  Any tattoos, or scars within 2 inches of the test sites; skin blemishes or warts, may
             be permissible with the specific approval of the Principal Investigator or Consulting
             Physician.

          -  Dermatoses, cuts, lesions, active skin rashes, scabs, breaks in the skin or other skin
             disorders within 6 inches on or around the test sites.

          -  A currently active skin disease or inflammatory skin condition (for example, contact
             dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema) anywhere on the body that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, would compromise subject safety or study integrity.

          -  Subjects who receive an irritation score of 1 (any redness, swelling, rash, or dryness
             present at any treatment area) for any individual skin condition prior to the
             Screening Day baseline or Treatment Day baseline sample collection.

          -  Participation in another clinical study in the past 30 days or current participation
             in another clinical study.

          -  Showering, bathing, or swimming within the 72 hour period prior to sampling for
             baseline screening, the test day, or throughout the test period.

          -  Pregnancy, plans to become pregnant or impregnate a sexual partner within the pre-test
             and test periods of the study, or nursing a child. All female subjects will be
             required to complete a urine pregnancy test on the day of test material application,
             prior to treatment. Both gender of subjects must be willing to use an acceptable
             method of contraception to prevent pregnancy for at least 14 days immediately
             preceding Treatment Day and throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Any medical condition or use of any medications that, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator or Consulting Physician, would preclude participation.

          -  Unwillingness to fulfill the performance requirements of the study.
