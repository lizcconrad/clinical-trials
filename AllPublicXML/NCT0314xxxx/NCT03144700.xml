      Study Design and Methodology

        -  Study Population:Compensated Cirrhosis

        -  Study Design: An Ambi Prospective Cohort study

        -  Study Period: 2 Years

        -  Sample size: Retrospective- All patients from Jan 2010 to Mar 2017 Prospective- Assuming
           the incidence of clinical decompensation is 5%/year.With alpha of 5%, power 80% we need
           to enroll 138 cases. Further assuming 20% drop out 166 cases will be enrolled.

        -  Intervention: This is an observational study. No intervention will be given.

      Monitoring and assessment: All the routine investigation and clinical information will be
      collected at 6, 12,18 and 24 months.
