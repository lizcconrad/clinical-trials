      Each subject will participate in the trial from the time the subject signs the Informed
      Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 28 days,
      eligible subjects will receive treatment beginning on Day 1 of each 2-week dosing cycle for
      aveluumab. Treatment with aveluumab will continue until documented disease progression,
      unacceptable adverse event(s),intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of
      treatment, Investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent,
      pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, After
      the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring
      (serious adverse events and events of clinical interest will be collected for 90 days after
      the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new
      anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier). Subjects who discontinue after 24months of therapy
      for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability or who discontinue after
      attaining a CR may be eligible for up to one year of retreatment after they have experienced
      radiographic disease progression. Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease
      progression will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until disease progression,
      initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up.
      All subjects will be followed by telephone for overall survival until death, withdrawal of
      consent, or the end of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. The
             subject may also provide consent for Biomedical Research. However, the subject may
             participate in the main trial without participating in Biomedical Research.

          2. Be20 years of age on day of signing informed consent

          3. Have histologically or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of GEP-NECs including all
             gastrointestinal tracts

          4. Have metastatic disease or locally advanced, unresectable disease with feasible biopsy
             sites (baseline and follow up)

          5. Has experienced documented objective radiographic or clinical disease progression
             during or after first-line therapy containing any platinum/etoposide

          6. Have measurable disease based on mRECIST as determined by investigator. Tumor lesions
             situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has
             been demonstrated in such lesions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Has grade 1 or 2 neuroendocrine tumor in GI tracts.

          3. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          4. Has a known history of active TB

          5. Hypersensitivity to avelumab or any of its excipients.

          6. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.
