  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic agreement between, on the one hand,
      ultra-low dose CT and MRI with UTE pulse sequences, and on the other hand, standard CT scan,
      to quantify lung parenchyma patterns in thoracic sarcoidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease involving lung and mediastinum in more than 90% of cases.
      Five to 25% of thoracic sarcoidosis are complicated by a severe fibrotic lung disease.
      Computed tomography (CT) is critical for the diagnosis of thoracic sarcoidosis as well as for
      therapeutic management. Repeated CT examinations, sometimes all life long, raise the issue of
      the cumulative radiation dose and subsequent risk of cancer, thus pushing the need for
      imaging techniques using low or no radiation dose. Based upon tube voltage and current
      reduction as well as iterative recontsruction, ultra-low dose CT (ULD CT) allows to lower the
      dose up to that of a traditional chest X-ray. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using
      Ultrashort echo time (UTE) enables lung parenchyma imaging with high signal-to-noise and
      spatial resolution.
