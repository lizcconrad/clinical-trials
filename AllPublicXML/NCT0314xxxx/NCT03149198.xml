      Introduction: Physical exercises have been recommended to improve overall well-being in
      patients with fibromyalgia, with the main goal of repairing the effects of lack of physical
      conditioning, and improving symptoms especially pain and fatigue. Very well estimated and
      widely known are the studies that support the use of the pilates method as effective in
      improving the symptoms of the disease.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the soil method in improving pain in women with
      fibromyalgia in the city of Santa Cruz, RN.

      Methodology: This is a randomized controlled trial with blind evaluator, where 60 patients
      with fibromyalgia diagnosis are divided into two groups. The intervention group, perform an
      exercise program based on the pilates method in soil and another, considered control group,
      participate in a program of aerobic exercises in the pool. Both groups conduct supervised
      exercise programs 2 times a week for a period of 12 weeks. The evaluation instruments used in
      an EVA (visual pain scale); FIQ Questionnaire - Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; Functional
      ability by the &quot;Timed Up and Go&quot; test and 6-minute walk test; A quality of sleep by the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-BR) and an ESS-BR (Epworth Sleepiness Scale); Finally, a
      general quality of life for the SF-36.

      Statistical analysis: Data are analyzed by t-student, Mann-Whitney test, repeated-measures
      ANOVA and intention-to-treat analysis.
