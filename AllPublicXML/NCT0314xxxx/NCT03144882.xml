    <textblock>
      Programmed ingestion of turmeric has no adverse effects and reduces plasma level of hs-CRP,
      IL-6 and TNF-α accompanying with increases albumin levels in hemodialysis patients. Turmeric
      can be considered as an effective anti-inflammatory supplement in hemodialysis patients.

      Hemodialysis patients over 18 years were recruited after fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria.Seventy-one hemodialysis patients were randomized into two groups: the trial group
      (n =35 ) and the controls (n =36 ); a randomization numeric table was used for allocation
      sequence . Trial group received turmeric and control group received placebo for 12 weeks.
      Biochemical determinations included levels of serum albumin (Alb), potassium (K) ,blood urea
      nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), IL-6 level, TNF- α , and liver function tests and
      hs-CRP at the start and end of the study were measured.

    <description>Turmeric rhizome at first was washed and dried out in a warm and dry place for a week , then powdered rhizomes were encapsulated by Clinical Pharmacy Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, using hard gelatin capsules. Also placebo capsules were made by the same center using Sorbitol. Curcumin level of turmeric was measured by HPTLC analysis for quantification of variability in content of curcumin</description>
