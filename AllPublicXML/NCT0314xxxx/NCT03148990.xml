  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measles and rubella are highly contagious acute viral diseases. As per WHO, several evidences
      demonstrate the benefit for providing the universal access to vaccines containing measles and
      rubella antigens, mainly due to, respectively, mortality in children and malformations in
      fetuses. This is a Phase I-III, Controlled, randomized and double blind for the evaluation
      double viral vaccine anti-measles and rubella (MR), which is developed and produced at
      Instituto de Tecnologia em Imunobiologicos Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, in Brazil, for use in
      human beings. 432 eligible volunteers (11-month-old infants), will be vaccinated and
      monitored for local and systemic adverse events and titration of antibodies. The study will
      last 11 months in total.
