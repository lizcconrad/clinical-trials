      COLLECT is a monocentric, prospective, observational study, which aims to assess the
      association between changes in the intestinal microbiota and the incidence of
      gastrointestinal graft-versus-host diseases (GvHD). Patients admitted for performance of an
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or patients with a first diagnosis
      of an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will be enrolled and stool samples will be analyzed using
      next-generation sequencing. In addition to stool, blood and urine samples will be collected
      for cytokine and 3-indoxylsulfate analysis.

      Exposure to drugs will not be influenced and remains at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      Documentation of patient is performed by using the web-based survey platform
      www.ClinicalSurveys.net which was set up by researchers of the University Hospital of
      Cologne. This survey platform enables an optimal performance in epidemiological,
      observational, and interventional trials and is characterized by layered access security and
      frequent data backup. It has been used for numerous registry and cohort studies with approval
      of competent authorities and ethics boards.

      The following data items of patients with a written informed consent are prospectively
      documented into our database:

        -  Demographics

        -  Chemotherapeutic agents

        -  Other immunosuppressives

        -  Radiation treatment

        -  Antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment

        -  Bowel movement abnormalities

        -  HSCT Donor and recipient information

        -  Status of hematological disease

        -  Days with neutropenia

        -  Fever and infectious complications

      The following samples of patients with a written informed consent are prospectively
      collected, stored and analyzed:

        -  Stool samples (16S rRNA analysis)

        -  Urine (3-IS analysis)

        -  Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples (PBMCs Fluorescence-activated cell
           sorting (FACS) analysis)

        -  Citrate blood samples (cytokine analysis)
