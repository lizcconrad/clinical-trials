  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fetal heart plays a central role in the adaptive mechanisms for hypoxemia and placental
      insufficiency. Longitudinal data on the hemodynamic sequence of the natural history of fetal
      growth restriction show that the umbilical artery and middle cerebral artery are the first
      variables to become abnormal . These arterial Doppler abnormalities are followed by
      abnormalities in the right cardiac diastolic indices, followed by the right cardiac systolic
      indices, and finally by both left diastolic and systolic cardiac indices .

      Preserving the left systolic function as the last variable to become abnormal ensures an
      adequate left ventricular output , which supplies the cerebral and coronary circulations.This
      defence is contingent on the fetal cardiovascular system, which in late gestation adopts
      strategies to decrease oxygen consumption and redistribute the cardiac output away from
      peripheral vascular beds and towards essential circulations, such as those perfusing the
      brain.

      Adding cardiac Doppler may improve management of the IUGR fetus(intrauterine growth
      retardation), Doppler ultrasound is valuable in defining the degree of cardiovascular
      compromise in at-risk pregnancies. The severity of fetal blood flow redistribution shows the
      degree of fetal adaptation and provides information on how long the pregnancy can be
      continued safely.

      The aime of the study is assessment of cardiac output redistribution in fetal hypoxia by
      estimating relative right to left side cardiac output wich reflect cardiac sparing in (IUGR).
