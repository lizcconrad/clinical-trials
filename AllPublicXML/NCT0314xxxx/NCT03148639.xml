  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia is clinically challenging for both the
      patient and the therapist. For the therapist, one of the main difficulties arises from the
      impossibility of directly communicating with the entity persecuting the patient. For the
      patient, the therapeutic process is challenging because it aims at getting to better cope
      with an entity that keeps repeating stereotyped and abusive sentences without having the
      emotional strength to reply to the persecutor. To help overcome these clinical challenges,
      virtual reality enable patients to recreate the face and the voice of their persecutor.The
      hypothesis is that the engagement of patients in a dialogue with an external representation
      of their persecutor, with the support of the therapist, would help them to gain better
      control over their voices.

    <description>Patients will receive 6 sessions of avatar therapy consisting of 45 minute (1 session per week). The therapy will consist in prompting patients to enter in a dialogue with their persecutor to better regulate their emotional responses. Over the course of the therapy, the character of the avatar will progressively become under patients' control. More precisely, the avatar's speech and tone will gradually be changed by the therapist to echo patients' improved ability to regulate their emotions. That is, the avatar will progressively change from being abusive to becoming helpful and supportive. By doing so, the therapy will seek to reinforce patients' feeling of empowerment over their voices.</description>
