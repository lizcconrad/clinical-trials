  <brief_summary>

      To document levels of labor force participation, occupation, educational attainment, and
      financial toxicity following cancer treatment in YA cancer survivors aged 25-34 years.

      This observational, cross-sectional study will recruit 200 YA survivors through the Wake
      Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base
      (WF NCORP RB). Data will be collected using a web-based interface and will capture physical,
      psychosocial and cognitive late effects; work ability; work-related outcomes, including labor
      force participation, occupation, work place characteristics, and educational attainment;
      survivor characteristics; and cancer diagnosis/treatment information (from clinical records).
      We will evaluate the relationships among these measures using the theoretical framework to
      guide statistical analysis.

        YA survivors between ages 25-34 were selected because they are relatively early in their
        career trajectory and represents AYA cancer survivors. This age range allows comparison to
        national benchmarks on work-related outcomes as it matches exactly the age range examined
        in the national employment statistics. We chose 2 years post diagnosis to allow time for
        acute effects of cancer treatment to stabilize and because many survivors are likely to
        have returned to work. The 10-year post-diagnosis cap limits confounding between time since
        treatment and current age. We will accrue to 4 cells in equal numbers (N=50 for each cell)
