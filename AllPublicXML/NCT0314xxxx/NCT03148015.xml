  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is an immunohistochemical study of archived patient breast tissue, specifically
      pre-invasive lesion specimens. The purpose is the discovery of novel molecular markers of
      pre-invasive breast lesions. These novel markers, once validated in this study, can serve as
      targets for individualized prevention therapy, neoadjuvant therapy for ductal carcinoma in
      situ (DCIS), or predictors of lesion aggressiveness. We have discovered two novel classes of
      DCIS molecular pathways required for the survival of DCIS neoplastic cells that will serve as
      the basis for the candidate molecules to be evaluated in this proposed study. The first class
      of DCIS molecular markers is autophagy, a cell survival mechanism that we discovered to be
      highly augmented in the hypoxic and nutrient deprived intraductal neoplastic cells of human
      DCIS (1-4). The second class of biomarker is calcium efflux that is mediated in breast cells
      by the calcium export pump Plasma Membrane Calcium ATPase (PMCA2) (5, 6). During normal
      lactation, breast epithelium pumps large concentrations of calcium into milk. In neoplastic
      lesions, calcium is exported by PMCA2 as a cell survival mechanism, since cells under
      metabolic stress accumulate calcium to a toxic level. Calcium export in DCIS may also
      contribute to intraductal calcifications, a hallmark of high grade DCIS and the most common
      marker of DCIS on mammography (7).

      Sentara cares for hundreds of patients per year who are diagnosed with breast pre-invasive
      lesions, including atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and
      lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Sentara treats 25% of the women with breast cancer in
      Virginia. Coupled with information from the Sentara Cancer Registry, Dr. Hoefer or a research
      team member will identify eligible patients with ADH, DCIS, and/or LCIS at the time of the
      core biopsy diagnosis, surgical therapy, and/or upon lesion recurrence. After receiving
      written informed consent from the eligible patients, Sentara Pathology will retrieve the
      corresponding tissue blocks. The recut tissue sections will be processed at George Mason
      University, Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine for markers relevant to
      calcium signaling, Vitamin D response, proliferation, autophagy and inflammation. Combined
      with the translational research expertise/technology in the Center for Applied Proteomics and
      Molecular Medicine at George Mason University, Sentara's diverse patient cohort provides an
      opportunity to address the most fundamental unanswered questions surrounding the etiology,
      progression, and therapy of pre-invasive breast lesions.

      Sentara Healthcare is a progressive and integrated healthcare organization that cares for
      hundreds of patients per year who are diagnosed with breast cancer and pre-invasive lesions,
      including atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and lobular
      carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Sentara Healthcare maintains a Cancer Registry which includes
      complete clinical information and disposition information of tissue blocks collected at the
      time of the core biopsy diagnosis, the surgical therapy, and upon lesion recurrence. Combined
      with the translational research expertise/technology in the Center for Applied Proteomics and
      Molecular Medicine (CAPMM) at George Mason University (GMU), the Sentara Healthcare extensive
      patient cohort provides an opportunity to address the most fundamental unanswered questions
      surrounding over-treatment and under-treatment of pre-invasive breast lesions:

        1. Does the histopathologic/molecular character of the carcinoma in situ, the immune
           infiltrate, and/or the stroma, correlate with the type of lesion (ADH, DCIS or LCIS),
           the grade of the lesion, or the presence of later recurrence?

        2. Does the level of autophagy within the lesion duct, or the level of PMCA2, of the
           pre-invasive lesion, correlate with lesion grade, the level of apoptosis, or the
           presence of later recurrence?

        3. Does the level of Vitamin D receptor correlate with the level of PMCA2?
