      Study Design:

        -  A randomized controlled study.

        -  The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology from April
           2017 to October 2017 at ILBS, New Delhi

        -  Study group will comprise of patients critically ill cirrhotics with septic shock

      All included patients would be randomised to low target MAP group (60-65mm Hg) or high target
      group (80-85 mm of Hg). Patients older than 18 years of age will be enrolled if they have
      septic shock that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and if they required vasopressors
      (norepinephrine or epinephrine or terlipressin) at a minimum infusion rate of 0.1 μg per
      kilogram per minute. Standard criteria will be considered to define refractoriness to fluids.
      The target MAP would be maintained for a max. of 5 days or until recovery or shock and or
      AKI. In the high-target group, a reduction in vasopressor doses to maintain a mean arterial
      pressure of 65 to 70 mm Hg will be done in case of any of the prespecified serious adverse
      events that could potentially be related to an increased rate of vasopressor infusion
      occurred. These events could be: clinically relevant bleeding (i.e., transfusion requirements
      of at least 2 units of packed red cells), myocardial infarction (defined as typical
      electrocardiographic changes, with a concomitant increase in troponin, and segmental
      echocardiographic hypokinesia or akinesia, with the infarction confirmed, when possible, by
      means of coronary angiography), major ventricular arrhythmia, poorly tolerated
      supraventricular arrhythmia, mesenteric ischemia, and distal-limb ischemia.

      • Septic shock would be defined as clinical construct of sepsis with persisting hypotension
      requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP&gt;=65 mm of Hg and having a serum lactate &gt;2 mmol/L
      despite adequate volume resuscitation
