  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how well ponatinib combined with
      low-intensity chemotherapy may control Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) or BCR-ABL
      positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in patients who are at least 60 years old.

      In elderly patients with ALL, intensive chemotherapy is effective but causes a lot of side
      effects, some of which are very serious and can be life-threatening. Researchers want to
      learn if using low-intensity chemotherapy in this study can achieve the same effect as
      high-intensity chemotherapy in the long run but with fewer side effects.

      Ph+ and BCR-ABL positive are types of genetic mutations (changes).

      The safety and effectiveness of the study drug combined with low-intensity chemotherapy will
      also be studied.

      Ponatinib may cause a blood clot to form in an artery or in a vein. Depending on the location
      of the clot, this could cause a heart attack, a stroke, severe damage to other tissue, or
      death. A blood clot may occur within 2 weeks after you start taking the drug. About 41%
      (about 2 in 5) of patients taking the drug form an abnormal clot. Blood clots can occur in
      patients that do not have other known risk factors for forming clots. If you develop a blood
      clot, you will need to stop taking ponatinib. In some cases, emergency surgery could be
      needed to remove the clot and restore blood flow.

      This is an investigational study. Ponatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of Ph+ ALL for whom no other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is
      allowed. The chemotherapy used in this study is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of ALL. It is considered investigational to use ponatinib in combination with
      chemotherapy to treat PH+ or BCR-ABL positive ALL.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      During Cycle 1, you will take ponatinib by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-14. During Cycles
      2 and beyond, you will take it 1 time every day.

      During Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, you will receive hyper-CVD chemotherapy which includes:

        -  On Days 1-3, you will receive cyclophosphamide 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart)
           by vein over about 3 hours.

        -  On Days 1-3, you will receive mesna by vein non-stop to help prevent side effects. The
           mesna infusion will end about 12 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide.

        -  On Days 1 and 11, if your doctor thinks it is needed, you may receive rituximab by vein
           over 4-6 hours.

        -  On Day 1 and Day 11, you will receive vincristine by vein over 15 minutes.

        -  On Days 1-4 and 11-14, you will receive dexamethasone 1 time a day by vein over 30
           minutes or by mouth.

        -  On Day 4, you will receive G-CSF (pegfilgrastim [Neulasta] or filgrastim) as an
           injection under the skin daily until blood counts recover.

        -  On Day 2 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5, you will receive methotrexate intrathecally (as a spinal
           tap). A spinal tap is when fluid surrounding the spinal cord is removed by inserting a
           needle into the lower back. The affected area is numbed with local anesthetic during the
           procedure. It can also be used to give chemotherapy.

        -  On Day 7 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5, you will receive cytarabine intrathecally.

      During Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, you will receive the following chemotherapy:

        -  On Day 1, you will receive methotrexate by vein non-stop over 24 hours.

        -  On Days 2 and 3, you will receive cytarabine by vein 2 times each day (about 12 hours
           apart) over about 2-3 hours.

        -  On Day 4, you will receive G-CSF (pegfilgrastim [Neulasta] or filgrastim) as an
           injection under the skin every day to help your blood cell counts recover.

        -  On Days 1 and 8, if your doctor thinks it is needed, you may receive rituximab by vein
           over 4 to 6 hours.

        -  On Day 8 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, you will receive methotrexate intrathecally.

        -  On Day 5 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, you will receive cytarabine intrathecally.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed to help reduce the risk of side effects, you may
           receive leucovorin by vein or by mouth 4 times a day for up to 8 doses, beginning 12
           hours after the methotrexate dose ends.

      You may be given other drugs to help prevent side effects. The study staff will tell you
      about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.

      Maintenance Therapy:

      After Cycle 8, if the disease has not gotten worse, you will start Maintenance Therapy.
      During Maintenance Therapy, you will receive the following drugs for about 2 years:

        -  On Day 1 of every cycle, you will receive vincristine by vein 1 time over about 15
           minutes.

        -  On Days 1-5 of every cycle, you will take prednisone by mouth.

        -  You will take ponatinib by mouth 1 time every day while you are on study.

      Post-Maintenance Therapy:

      You will take ponatinib by mouth 1 time every day while you are on study.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 8 cycles of chemotherapy treatment followed by 24 months of
      chemotherapy-based maintenance treatment. You may continue to take ponatinib alone in the
      post-maintenance period for as long as your doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You
      will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after follow-up (described below).

      Study Visits:

      If it is more convenient for you, you may have the following tests/procedures performed at
      your local doctor's office or clinic. Your local doctor will tell the study doctor at MD
      Anderson the results of the testing. The study doctor and/or study staff will discuss this
      option with you.

      Within 24-48 hours after the start of Course 1, at least 1 time each week during Cycle 1,
      then every 1-3 weeks while you receive chemotherapy, then every 4-8 weeks during maintenance,
      blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-8 then every 3 months, you will have a physical exam.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, you will have a chest x-ray.

      On Days 14 and 21 of Cycle 1, then every 2-3 cycles while you receive chemotherapy, then
      every 3-6 months during maintenance, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration to
      check the status of the disease.

      One time during Cycles 2 and 6, then every 3 months, you will have an EKG.

      On Day 28 of Cycles 4 and 7, then every 3 months after that, you will have an ECHO or a MUGA
      scan.

      Every 3 months:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be draw for routine tests

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you may have an eye test.

      At 3 months and if the disease comes back:

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn to learn how you are responding to the study
           drug(s) and if you have become resistant to treatment.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy performed to check the status of
           the disease and for genetic testing.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, you may be called by a member of the study
      staff and asked how you are doing and if you have started any new medications. This call
      should last about 10 minutes.

             of clinically significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmias (such as atrial
             fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or Torsades de
             pointes) as determined by the treating physician; Prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry
             electrocardiogram (&gt; 470 msec) unless corrected after electrolyte replacement

          9. This is a continuation of Exclusion #8 above: Any history of venous thromboembolism
             including deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; Uncontrolled hypertension
             (diastolic blood pressure &gt;90mmHg; systolic &gt;140mmHg). Patients with hypertension
             should be under treatment on study entry to effect blood pressure control

         10. Patients currently taking drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing
             Torsades de Pointes (unless these can be changed to acceptable alternatives)

         11. Taking any medications or herbal supplements that are known to be strong inhibitors of
             CYP3A4 within at least 14 days before the first dose of ponatinib

         12. Treatment with any investigational antileukemic agents or chemotherapy agents in the
             last 7 days before study entry, unless full recovery from side effects has occurred or
             patient has rapidly progressive disease judged to be life-threatening by the
             investigator.

         13. Pregnant and lactating women will not be eligible; women of childbearing potential
             should have a negative pregnancy test prior to entering on the study and be willing to
             practice methods of contraception. Women do not have childbearing potential if they
             have had a hysterectomy or are postmenopausal without menses for 12 months. In
             addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner
             of childbearing potential and should practice an effective method of birth control.

         14. History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including: Diagnosed
             congenital bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease); and diagnosed acquired
             bleeding disorder within one year (e.g., acquired anti-factor VIII antibodies)

         15. Patients with documented significant pleural or pericardial effusions unless they are
             thought to be secondary to their leukemia.
