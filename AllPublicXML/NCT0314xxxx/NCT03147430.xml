      This is a non-treatment study. It will not involve the use of any investigational drug or
      device. Potential participants will be enrolled through direct contact with collaborating
      clinical sites when the patient's annual 3D mammogram report yields a BIRADS rating of 4-5.
      The clinical Investigators or a member of their staff will conduct consent discussion once a
      suspicious mammogram report is identified or if a patient is referred for imaging of a
      suspicious area in the breast. After consenting the participant will be asked to donate a
      blood sample, a saliva sample, medical records pertaining to the suspicious mammogram report
      and a medical history questionnaire. The participants will be followed after one year to
      capture progression or resolution of their suspicious mammogram report. After a biopsy
      confirms the diagnosis of cancer or benign lesion, a recut sample of the tissue may be
      requested for research.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. According to
      estimates, approximately 46,000 women in the United States, and 130,000 women in the European
      Union, die due to breast cancer yearly. Early detection is of paramount importance in
      reducing mortality from this major public health burden. Screening mammography has been shown
      to reduce breast cancer mortality by 20% to 35% in women aged 40 to 69 years. Detection of
      small volume breast cancer at early stages is associated with a 10-year disease-free survival
      rate as high as 98% in patients with pT1a,bN0M0 tumors (measuring 1 cm or less, with
      disease-free axillary lymph nodes and no distant metastasis). The assumption that early
      diagnosis will lead to improved treatment outcomes has driven the search for diagnostic
      biomarkers.

      Despite this enthusiasm, a biomarker for stage I breast cancer has been elusive. The
      predictive value of mammography declines in cohorts of patients with denser breast tissue and
      smaller lesions, and recent studies have indicated that the small amount of biomarker
      molecules emanating from a breast tumor of less than 1 cm is well below the sensitivity of
      detection for current analytical methods. In addition, biomarkers in body fluids are highly
      perishable. Biomarkers break down during collection, transport and storage due to endogenous
      degradative enzymes yielding false negatives. Thus there is a significant need for new
      technologies that will a) identify and measure low abundance biomarkers (less than 1
      nanogram/mL), and b) is low cost and can be seamlessly integrated into the clinical workflow.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary goal of this study is to a) experimentally discover putative plasma markers for
      detecting early, stage I breast cancer in the setting of a suspicious mammogram and
      distinguish those cancers from benign lesions b) verify the putative markers through
      molecular profiling; and c) validate the markers by mass spectrometry.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Determine percent accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis in the context of 3D
           mammographically (screen detected) tumors.

        2. Determine percent precision of cancer diagnosis in the context of 3D mammographically
           (screen detected) tumors.

        3. Discover additional protein markers of early stage breast cancer that distinguish these
           tumors from benign lesions identified by mammography by comparing protein markers
           between patients with invasive cancer vs. benign tumors as determined by biopsy.

        4. Additionally compare protein markers between patients with invasive cancer and
           pre-invasive neoplasms as determined by biopsy.

        5. Bank samples for future research and sequencing.

        All participants will be enrolled through direct contact with collaborating clinical sites.
        In the first phase this study will strive to enroll 150 participants who are identified as
        having a suspicious mammogram. Suspicious mammogram will be defined as being rated as
        Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) rating IV or V, undergoing image guided
        biopsy. BIRADS IV is &quot;Suspicious abnormality&quot; and V is &quot;there is a mammographic appearance
        which is highly suggestive of malignancy, action should be taken.&quot; The goal is to accrue at
        least 30 cases of invasive cancer confirmed by biopsy, and at least 90 cases of benign or
        pre-invasive lesion pathology confirmed by biopsy in this first phase study.
