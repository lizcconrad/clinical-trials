  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypnosis-based interventions are starting to be tested in order to improve emotional distress
      and fatigue of cancer patients. However, most of these studies only include breast cancer
      patients and do no measure long-term effects of such interventions.

      Our randomized controlled trial aims to propose to 116 post-treatment cancer patients (all
      tumour localisations accepted) an 8-week groupal intervention combining hypnosis and
      self-care techniques.

      Primary outcomes (emotion regulation, emotional distress, fatigue) and secondary outcomes
      (sleep difficulties, fear of recurrence, attentional bias, conjugal communication) will be
      investigated at 3 measurement times: before the intervention (T1), 3 months later (T2 - right
      after the intervention of the experimental group, and right before the intervention of the
      control group) and again 3 months later (T3 - after the intervention of the control group).
      Some questionnaires, two relaxation tasks, an attentional task, an actigraph and a smartphone
      application will be used to collect data. The indirect impact of the intervention on
      participants' partners will also be measured by questionnaires (emotional distress, conjugal
      communication).

      Data collection has started on March 2017. Our results should bring new knowledge about the
      efficacy of an hypnosis-based intervention to improve fatigue and well-being in cancer
      patients, which are often under-diagnosed and under-treated, but also about the indirect
      efficacy to improve partners' well-being. Those results might contribute to spread this kind
      of inexpensive intervention in oncology settings.
