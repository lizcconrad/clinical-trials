  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Articulating Oral Airway (AOA) is a novel oral airway which actively displaces the
      tongue, allowing for a greater cross-sectional area for mask ventilation. The investigators
      hypothesize that, in patients with predictors for difficult mask ventilation, the AOA will be
      non-inferior to the Geudel oral airway in terms of expired tidal volumes.

      Difficult mask ventilation (MV) is common in the obese population and can result in patient
      morbidity and mortality. The Articulating Oral Airway (AOA) is a novel oral airway which
      actively displaces the tongue, allowing for a greater cross-sectional area for MV. The
      investigators hypothesize that, while using the same ventilatory pressure in neuromuscularly
      blocked patients with predictors for difficult mask ventilation, MV with an AOA will not
      result in smaller expired tidal volumes than MV with a similarly sized Guedel oral airway
      (GDA). In other words, the AOA will be non-inferior to the GDA in terms of expired tidal
      volumes.

    <masking_description>Anesthesia facemasks will be opacified so that the clinical provider will be blinded to which oral airway (Geudel vs AOA) is being used and in what order. The patient will be anesthetised and thus blinded. The Investigator and Outcomes Assessor will only see video of the data on the anesthesia monitor (not the patient/device/etc) and will thus be blinded. The only individuals who will not be blinded are the Research Assistants who will not be involved in data analysis.</masking_description>
