  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, single-centre, feasibility study to assess the feasibility issues and
      collect preliminary clinical data for the design of future randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the feasibility and patient comfort of magnetic retrieval device removal of ureteral
      stent in transplant patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To curtail the pain and discomfort during cystoscopic stent removal and in order to improve
      patient's quality of life, a newly developed ureteral stent with a small magnet at its distal
      end and a customized magnetic retrieval catheter is recently used in Europe. The product is
      Black-Star® with a retrieval device by Urotech (Achenmühle, Germany). The magnetic Blackstar
      stent is a ureteral stent with a small magnet fixed with a string at the distal loop. The
      placement of stent is similar as routinely done on a guidewire, the only difference is to
      include the magnetic piece over the guidewire. To remove the stent a customized catheter with
      a magnetic Tiemann tip is used. The catheter is inserted after urethral application of a
      standard lubricant and removed with the stent after coming in contact with the stent's
      magnet.

      The stent comes in various sizes and is currently being used in Europe. The studies have
      concluded fast and easy retrieval of stent without requirement of cystoscopy and decreased
      patient discomfort.

    <time_frame>3-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be followed up 4 weeks post renal transplant surgery, until ureteral stent removal. Feasibility and comfort of stent retrieval, Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ) at 4 weeks before stent removal and 1 week post stent removal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome measure: Retrieval time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (intraoperatively)</time_frame>
    <description>Retrieval time in minutes: The time taken for ureteric stent removal (both routine and magnetic stent) will be documented and mean time taken will be calculated. This will show which technique takes less time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome measure: Infection rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Infection rates: Number of Urine culture positive with stent in situ and after removal of stent (both routine and magnetic stent). This will suggest if magnetic stent is associated with an increased incidence of urinary tract infections as compared to the routine stent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome measure: Cost effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>3-6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cost effective analysis: Units will be Canadian Dollars; we will analyze the cost of disposables, sterilization of instruments, use of cystoscopy suite and also nursing and surgeon charges. Mean cost taken for either procedure will be compared to find cost effectiveness</description>
