  <brief_summary>

      The objective of this study to evaluate potential impact of a brief, low-cost primary
      care-based intervention of parenting self-efficacy, knowledge, and behavior.

      Enriching parenting behaviors in early childhood promotes child development and offers a
      promising strategy to reduce future educational disparities. However, current interventions
      are limited by cost and have not been widely disseminated. Recognized as a target for
      research to improve early childhood development and subsequent school readiness skills among
      at-risk families, the primary care setting offers an ideal opportunity to reach the millions
      of children living in poverty. However, what remains unknown is how to more efficiently
      leverage the primary care setting to deliver a sustainable and effective preventive program
      to promote positive parenting behaviors and encourage early childhood development in
      low-income families. Therefore, the investigators designed Sit Down and Play (SDP) a brief
      parent-directed program delivered in the primary care setting. Modeled after the widely
      disseminated literacy program Reach Out and Read and grounded in social cognitive theory, SDP
      is intended to take place during each pediatric well-child visit occurring in a child's first
      two years with the goal of promoting positive parenting behaviors.
