    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, 2-cohort, open-label trial of high dose Vitamin C intravenous infusion
      in subjects with solid tumor malignancies who are eligible for resection (cohort A) or with
      KRAS or BRAF mutant metastatic cancer who have received prior systemic treatment (cohort B).

      This clinical trial is for men and women with resectable or metastatic solid tumor
      malignancies. The objective of the study is to investigate whether high dose vitamin C
      infusion leads to pathological tumor response in resectable colorectal, pancreatic, and lung
      cancer (cohort A) or objective tumor response in KRAS or BRAF mutant solid tumors (cohort B).

      Patients enrolled in cohort A will receive high dose Vitamin C infusion for 4 days per week
      for 2-4 consecutive weeks prior to surgery. Patients enrolled in cohort B will receive high
      dose Vitamin C infusion for 4 days per week up to 6 months. A tumor sample will be resected
      after completion of study drug (high dose vitamin C infusion) treatment to examine the
      effects of study drug (Cohort A only). In addition, organoids will be grown in vitro and
      continue to be treated with vitamin C added in culture medium to examine tumor response. The
      resected tumor in this study will

      Key eligibility:

        -  Men and women age 18 and older

        -  Patients with histologically proven early stage or locally advanced colorectal
           adenocarcinoma, lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, who are eligible for resection, and
           have not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy (cohort A) Patients with inoperable,
           metastatic, KRAS or BRAF mutant colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung cancer and pancreatic
           cancer, who have received at least 1 line of treatment for metastatic disease (cohort B)
