  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes, and it has been
      a leading risk factor for death globally. Despite the availability of smoking cessation
      services locally, most smokers do not use such services. Workplace is one of the most
      convenient platforms to provide smoking cessation services and over 55% of smokers are
      employed according to the local population-based survey. However, the effectiveness of a
      smoking cessation programme conducted in workplace is yet to be examined in Hong Kong, and
      the attitudes and practices of corporations in promoting smoking cessation are not clear.
      Thus, this study aims to examine the employers'/managerial staff's knowledge, attitudes and
      practices in promoting smoking cessation in workplace and evaluate the smoking behaviours of
      participants before and after attending a smoking cessation intervention.

      This study will separate into two phases. Phase I is a large scale cross-sectional survey to
      corporations in Hong Kong to examine the employers' knowledge, attitudes and practices in
      promoting smoking cessation in the workplace. Phase II is a longitudinal randomized
      controlled trial study to evaluate the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention to
      assess the subjects' smoking behaviors, knowledge on smoking and satisfaction of the smoking
      cessation services. The investigators are interested to know if the intervention package
      including health education,social media and telephone follow-up would trigger higher quit
      rate or other changes in smoking behaviors. The investigators will also monitor the smoking
      status of the subjects regularly through telephone follow-ups, understand the company's
      practices about smoke-free policy as well as evaluate the outcomes of the intervention.

      The primary outcome of the study is to measure participated smokers' self-reported 7-day
      point prevalence quit rate at 26 and 52 weeks follow-ups. The secondary outcomes include
      participated smokers' (i) self-reported reduction rate at 26 and 52 weeks follow-ups; (ii)
      self-reported quit attempt at 26 and 52 weeks follow-ups; (iii) knowledge enhancement rate
      towards smoking cessation at 26 and 52 weeks follow-ups compared with baseline; (iv) change
      in self-efficacy towards smoking cessation at 26 and 52 weeks follow-ups compared with
      baseline.

      Data of the above outcomes will be collected through telephone interviews (follow-ups) by the
      investigators. Descriptive statistics will be used to measure the (1) basic info of the
      participants, including the total number of employees and smoking employees; (2) knowledge on
      smoking of employers/managerial staff; (3) attitudes on smoking cessation of
      employers/managerial staff; (4) practices of the corporations with respect to smoking
      cessation. Logistic regression, linear regression and spearman correlation coefficient will
      be used to examine the relationships between corporates' policy in smoking cessation and the
      knowledge and attitudes of employers/ managerial staff. Chi square and t-test will also be
      used to compare the quit rates between groups and logistic regression will be used to predict
      quitting. Data will be entered and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 23.
