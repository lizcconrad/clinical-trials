  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) quantify cardiovascular anatomy and physiology using
      magnetic resonance imaging under both resting and exercise conditions in patients who have
      congenital heart disease and in age-matched normal volunteers, (2) use computer models to
      reproduce and simulate blood flow in these patients, and then (3) to combine the imaging data
      and computer models to estimate values which cannot be directly measured and to predict
      physiological changes induced by exercise and medical or surgical therapies.

      Investigators hope to gain a greater understanding of the hemodynamics of congenital heart
      disease and their associated operations as they pertain to real-life situations (i.e. upright
      and non-sedentary, rest and exercise). With this knowledge, investigators would look to
      optimize the geometry and physiology of the patients, potentially reducing several of the
      long-term complications found in congenital heart disease patients such as cardiomyopathy,
      pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias, thrombosis and heart failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients will have congenital heart disease or acquired cardiopulmonary disease.

          -  normal volunteers will be willing to undergo MRI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients unable to receive intravenous contrast material (this does not apply to
             normal volunteers)

          -  subjects with arrhythmias which will prevent MRI cardiac gating

          -  subjects with illnesses which make participation inappropriate. In addition, patients
             who would normally be excluded from an MRI study because of pacemaker implant,
             aneurysm clip, severe claustrophobia, or any other condition which, based on the
             Investigator's judgment, would preclude proximity to a strong magnetic field will be
             excluded from this study as well.

          -  NORMAL VOLUNTEERS may be excluded if they are not able to remain still during the exam
             or follow the instructions of the investigators.
