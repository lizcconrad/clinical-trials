  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an etiologic trial to test the hypothesis that predicts that Helicobacter
      pylori eradication in asymptomatic/mildly dyspeptic adults will result in an increase in body
      iron. The study will assign and aims to complete the follow-up of 240 subjects half of them
      assigned to a highly effective FDA approved 14-day course of a 3-1 capsule containing bismuth
      subcitrate, metronidazole and tetracycline plus omeprazole which is now OTC. We have tested
      the effectiveness of this therapy in the study population and it seems to yield almost 100%
      eradication on PP analysis. We need the best possible, near 100% eradication rate, which we
      have already obtained in a pilot, to make comparisons on ITT basis and safely conclude that H
      pylori leads to a deficit of body iron.

      This etiologic double-blind randomized trial in non-anemic mostly asymptomatic/mildly
      dyspeptic Hp-infected adults will assess whether Hp eradication results in improvements in
      the levels of iron stores. Iron stores will be assessed by (i) SF as primary outcome, and the
      following secondary outcomes: (ii) serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), (iii) the ratio of sTfR
      to SF or R/F, which will be used to estimate body iron, (iv) transferrin saturation (TS), (v)
      zinc protoporhyrin (ZPP) and (vi) hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and at 6 months of follow-up.
      This study is a double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) of Hp eradication allocating 400
      Hp-infected asymptomatic/mildly dyspeptic adults 18-65 years of age of El Paso, Texas, to
      receive either (i) a 14-day quadruple Hp eradication therapy described above or (ii) placebo.
      We expect that at least 240 will complete the study medications and follow-up.
