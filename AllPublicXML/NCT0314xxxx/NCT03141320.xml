      This study aims to help women have a better birth experience, by trying to understand what a
      'confident birth' means to women during pregnancy and labour. Results from a recent service
      evaluation at a local NHS Trust, exploring a new programme designed to enhance women's birth
      experience, highlighted the importance of understanding women's confidence for birth. A
      significant number of pregnant women that attended the course (19.5%) felt 'not at all
      confident' for birth. The service evaluation results also suggested that confidence for birth
      is an important influence of enhancing birth experience.

      There is some research that suggests that if women's confidence for birth can be improved,
      then she may be less fearful of birth and have experience less labour pain. However, very
      little is known about what women consider to be a 'confident birth' and who or what they feel
      influences their confidence. If maternity services are able to understand this, this could
      possibly lead to the development of tools and strategies to help women to feel more confident
      for giving birth.

      This is a qualitative study that involves two methods of data collection: interviews and
      social media. Women that are pregnant or have recently given birth will be interviewed to
      explore who or what they feel has influenced their confidence for birth. The interviews will
      last for about one and a half hours. The location for interview is flexible and women can be
      interviewed in their own home. In addition to this, approximately 500 messages posted on a
      large UK parenting website about confidence for birth will also be analysed.
