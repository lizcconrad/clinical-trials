  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When considered from a provincial perspective, quantification of surgical procedures
      undertaken by different hospitals and healthcare networks is necessary for informing resource
      allocation and modelling of healthcare services. The investigators hypothesized that i)
      non-physiologically complex surgical procedures would account for most (&gt;1/2) of pediatric
      surgical procedures performed at both pediatric specialist hospitals and the other hospitals
      performing pediatric surgery, ii) surgical discharges for non-physiologically complex
      surgical procedures would account for most (&gt;1/2) in-hospital bed nights among pediatric
      surgical admissions at both pediatric specialist hospitals and the other hospitals performing
      pediatric surgery, and iii) the relative distributions of non-physiologically complex
      surgical procedures, but not physiologically complex procedures, would be at least moderately
      similar between pediatric specialist hospitals and the other hospitals performing pediatric
      surgery. To test these 3 hypotheses, the specific objectives of this study were to estimate
      i) the proportion (primary outcome) of non-physiologically complex pediatric surgical
      procedures, and ii) the similarity and diversity (secondary outcomes) of non-physiologically
      and physiologically complex surgical procedures between the pediatric specialist hospitals
      and the other hospitals performing pediatric surgery in Ontario, Canada.
