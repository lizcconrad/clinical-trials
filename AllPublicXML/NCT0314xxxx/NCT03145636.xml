  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a five-year, single arm, multi-center trial to evaluate the long-term safety and
      efficacy of the Maestro Rechargeable System in treating obesity. The study will include an
      observational arm and a randomized sub-study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the vBloc Therapy delivered by the Maestro
      Rechargeable System for the treatment obesity. The Maestro Rechargeable System delivers
      intermittent, electrical blocking signals to the anterior and posterior trunks of the
      intra-abdominal vagus nerve (termed vBloc Therapy) and is designed to reduce sensations of
      hunger and produce satiety leading to weight loss.

      Subjects in the observational arm (100 subjects total) will receive the device implant and
      use the vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program.

      The randomized sub-study (100 subjects) will randomly assign subjects (1:1) to either
      treatment (50 subjects) or control (50 subjects). The treatment arm will receive the device
      implant and use of the vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program. The control arm will
      participate in the Control Weight Management (CWM) during a 6 month period prior to receiving
      the device implant and using the vBloc Achieve program.

      The vBloc Achieve Weight Management Program consists of recommendations regarding diet,
      exercise and behavior modification, and will be utilized by all subjects following their
      device implant.

             pregnancy test at Screen and also within 14 days of implant procedure followed by
             physician-approved contraceptive regimen for the duration of the study period.

          4. At least 18 years of age

          5. Failure to respond to supervised diet/exercise program(s) in which the subject was
             engaged within the last five years

          6. Ability to complete all study visits and procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver, portal hypertension, or esophageal varices.

          2. Patients with a large (&gt;5cm) symptomatic hiatal hernia

          3. Patients for whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is planned

          4. Patients at high risk for surgical complications

          5. Patients who have a permanently implanted, electrical-powered medical device or
             gastrointestinal device or prosthesis (e.g. pacemakers, implanted defibrillators,
             neurostimulators)

          6. Patients for whom shortwave, microwave, or therapeutic ultrasound diathermy is planned
             Note: Diathermy is any treatment that uses high-frequency electromagnetic radiation,
             electric currents, or ultrasonic waves to produce heat in body tissues. Patients
             absolutely CANNOT be treated with any type of shortwave, microwave, or therapeutic
             ultrasound diathermy device whether or not it is used to produce heat. These
             treatments should not be applied anywhere on the body.

          7. Current medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the
             subject unfit for surgery or that would be exacerbated by intentional weight loss.
             Some examples include diagnosis of cancer, recent heart attack, recent stroke or
             serious trauma.

          8. Recent cessation of cigarette smoking (prior 2 months)

          9. History of bariatric surgery, Nissen fundoplication, gastric resection, major
             upper-abdominal surgery, or other abdominal procedures at the discretion of the
