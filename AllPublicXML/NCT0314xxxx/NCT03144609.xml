  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obese patients in a great number of patients scheduled for elective surgery
      under general anesthesia has been on the increase. Recent studies suggest an intraoperative
      protective mechanical ventilation for the obese. Surgical procedures in the oral cavity
      increase the risk of perioperative complications of obese patients. By making this randomized
      clinical study, investigators want to determine whether the protective intraoperative
      ventilation with the use of higher positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers
      compared to ventilation with low positive end-expiratory pressure and without recruitments
      cause better postoperative respiratory function parameters of obese patients during oral
      surgical procedures. Investigators also aim to establish the fact which value of a positive
      end-expiratory pressure has a favorable impact on the respiratory function without negative
      hemodynamic effect.

    <textblock>
      Oral surgeries of obese patients in general endotracheal anesthesia are a special challenge
      as in the most extensive types of interventions any form of regional anesthesia is
      inadequate, duration of surgery is short but requires deep level of anesthesia after which a
      quick awakening and most rapid release from hospital are expected, with a known high
      perioperative risk complications of obese patients.

      Oral surgical procedures in the oral cavity due to possible postoperative upper airway oedema
      increase the risk of postoperative hypoxia in obese patients. Therefore, it is important to
      intraoperatively mechanically ventilate obese patients with the aim of good
      ventilation-perfusion ratio without creating new atelectasis, to minimize the risk of
      postoperative respiratory decompensation and to provide rapid recovery.

      As the prevalence of obesity in the world increases as chronic diseases, the number of obese
      patients scheduled for oral surgery is growing. Studies involving different ways of
      intraoperative mechanical ventilation of obese patients are mostly processed laparoscopic
      abdominal studies that can not exclude the additional effect of intraabdominal pressure on
      the formation of pulmonary atelectasis.
