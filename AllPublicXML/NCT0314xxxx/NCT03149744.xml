  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is looking at a currently available technology to see if it could have
      another use i.e. in helping to diagnose patients with sleep apnoea.

      With 2-4% of the population suffering from this disease, and the current wait time for a test
      at approximately 20 weeks, it is hoped that a simple screening method could help speed up the
      process of finding these patients and getting them on treatment faster.

      The current standard of care test involves a sleep study in the patients own home with a
      device with multiple parts and wires. The RespiraSense Sleep Screener is completely cableless
      and consists of one small, discrete unit attached to the patients side and a mobile device
      plugged in by the bed.

      Patients at Queen Alexandra Hospital who are prescribed sleep studies will be invited to
      participate. The RespiraSense Sleep Screener data is only for comparison purposes and will
      have no effect on their clinical care.

      If patients agree to participate they will undergo the sleep study with both devices in the
      same night and may be followed up with over the phone on their experiences with the test.
