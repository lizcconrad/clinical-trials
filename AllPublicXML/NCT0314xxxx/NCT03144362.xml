  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sciatica is a debilitating and costly condition. Prognostically, patients presenting with leg
      pain often have a poor recovery and some go onto have spinal surgery. However, in the absence
      of nerve root compression on MRI, no surgical option is viable and patients are often
      discharged and encouraged to self manage. Neurodynamics offers a means to treat patients with
      non-compressive leg pain. To date, there is no research exploring which form of neurodynamic
      sliding technique offers the greatest therapeutic benefit in patients presenting with
      sciatica. The aim of this pilot study is to calculate how many patients would be needed to
      run a full scale trial evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the pilot will assess the
      overall workability of the study and the feasibility of patient recruitment.

      Patients who have given informed consent will be randomly allocated to one of three groups in
      a ratio of 1:1:1 (Control Group, Intervention Group 1, Intervention Group 2). Randomisation
      reduces selection bias and controls for unknown variables that may affect the outcome.
      Treatment allocation will occur through the use of sealed, opaque envelopes and will be
      implemented by the Graves Move More reception team as the patient attends the clinic. The
      reception staff will hand an opaque envelope to the subject for them to open. Randomisation
      undertaken by an independent third party improves internal validity. Patients will be treated
      according to the group they have been randomised to.

      Data Collection, Analysis &amp; Statistical Opinion Prior to undertaking the study, baseline
      socio-demographic data will be recorded (E.g. age, sex, weight, height, occupation and
      duration of symptoms). Pre and posttest outcome data will also be recorded for the
      Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) and Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI).
      Long-term data (I.e. 6-12 months post-treatment) will not be recorded as treatment effect is
      not being analysed as part of the pilot study.

    <description>The questionnaire will be completed prior to treatment starting and again at the conclusion of the study. Change scores will be recorded. Roland &amp; Fairbank (2000) advise a change score of 2-3 points on the 24-item version of the RMDQ as the minimally clinically important difference (MCID).</description>

    <measure>The Oxford Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Disability Index (ODI) accounts for the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire shortcomings as it is more responsive to patients presenting with more chronic, and or severe disability (Roland &amp; Fairbank, 2000). The MCID for the ODI has been specified as 4 points (Co et al, 1993). Neither questionnaire require permission to be used in this trial Again, pre and post-test data will be recorded to calculate change scores.</description>
