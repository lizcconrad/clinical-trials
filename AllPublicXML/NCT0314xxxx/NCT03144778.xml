  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving durvalumab alone or in
      combination with tremelimumab to patients with oropharynx carcinoma before standard-of-care
      surgery can help to control the disease.

      The safety of these drugs will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Durvalumab and tremelimumab are not FDA approved or
      commercially available for treatment of head and neck cancer. Their use in this study is
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 28 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study cohorts. This is done because no one knows if one
      cohort is better, the same, or worse than the other.

        -  If you are in Cohort 1, you will receive durvalumab.

        -  If you are in Cohort 2, you will receive durvalumab and tremelimumab.

      Both you and the study doctor will know to which group you have been assigned.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive durvalumab by vein over 1 hour every 4 weeks. If you are in Cohort 2, you
      will also receive tremelimumab by vein over 1 hour every 4 weeks.

      After your first dose of study drug(s), you will be observed for 1 hour to watch for any side
      effects.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may receive the study drug(s) for up to 2 doses. You will no longer be able to take the
      study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are found in
           the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your symptoms. It should take about 15 minutes
           to complete.

      On Day 29 and Day 57:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your symptoms.

        -  On Day 57, you will have a CT scan.

      Surgery:

      Between Days 52 and 72, you will have surgery as part of your standard care. If it appears
      that the tumor is growing after your first dose of study drug(s), you may not receive the
      second dose of drug(s) and you will be taken to surgery early. If you are taken to surgery
      early, you will have the Day 57 procedures (described above) performed before surgery.

      You will sign a separate consent explaining the surgery in more detail, including its risks.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 28 days after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

      After surgery, depending on what the doctor thinks is in your best interest, you may receive
      additional standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The study doctor will
      discuss this with you and if you choose to receive it, you will sign a separate consent form
      describing the therapy and its risks.

      Within 42 days after surgery or, if you are receiving it, within 14 days before you receive
      standard-of-care chemotherapy/radiation therapy:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your symptoms.

      About 4 months after surgery or, if you are receiving it, within 28-63 days after you receive
      chemotherapy/radiation therapy, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and
      biomarker testing.

      About 6 months after surgery:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your symptoms.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After your last dose of study drugs, you (or your family or other designee) may be contacted
      by phone or in writing or during routine, clinic visits to learn how you are doing. If you
      are called, it should last about 5 minutes. This information may be collected from your
      medical records instead.

      You may be called or have information from your medical records collected for up to 5 years.
