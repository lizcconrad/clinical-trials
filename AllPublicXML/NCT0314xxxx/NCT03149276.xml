  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A systematic literature review from March through June 2014 supports the premise that limited
      English proficiency (LEP) persons face barriers and disparities to medical care that
      English-speaking persons do not face. Language barriers have a negative impact on health and
      health care, including lower health status, lower likelihood of having a primary care
      provider, lower rate of preventative care, higher use rate of diagnostic tests, higher rate
      of severe psychopathology diagnoses, and higher risk of drug complications . Additionally,
      LEP persons experience problems with effective communication with providers, inappropriate
      diagnoses and treatments, lower comprehension of medication instructions and adherence to
      regimens, fewer follow up visits, low quality care, poorer health outcomes, and low patient
      satisfaction.

      Research has proven a relationship between LEP and health care outcomes, specifically a
      relationship between positive outcomes and use of professional interpreters. Not sharing a
      common language creates a barrier to providing safe, effective, client-centered Occupational
      Therapy (OT) and knowledge of outcome satisfaction for this population. Using trained
      interpreters would reduce the barriers created by language discordance.

      This evidence-based project intends to measures the influence of interpreter service on LEP
      patients' perceived quality of care using a satisfaction survey. Gathered data will be used
      to consider development and implementation of practice guidelines for use of professional
      interpreter services for LEP patients receiving OT services at Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush.
      Development and implementation of practice guidelines that include use of trained
      interpreters when providing OT services to LEP patients will facilitate a client-centered
      approach and improve quality of care for this population.

      The project is also being implemented as part of a degree requirement for the Doctorate of
      Occupational Therapy Program at Chatham University.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sampling frame will consist of adults, age 18 or older, with limited English proficiency
      (LEP), with an upper extremity injury or disorder, that have been referred to occupational
      therapy (OT) at Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush (MOR), require services that span four weeks or
      more, agree to use of interpreter services, agree to completing a paper and pencil survey at
      the end of four weeks, and agree to be interviewed after four weeks of occupational therapy
      services, following completion of the survey. LEP is determined by a preference to receive
      medical information in a non-English language. Sampling frame is four participants. The
      sampling frame will be purposive. As LEP individuals present for OT services they will be
      recruited for participation. Recruitment could happen simultaneously or in tandem.

      The comparison group sampling frame will consist of adults, age 18 or older, proficient in
      English, with an upper extremity injury or disorder, that have been referred to OT at MOR,
      and require services that span four weeks or more. English proficiency is determined by use
      of English as preferred language. Sampling frame is four participants. For each LEP
      individual recruited, the following English-speaking individual will be asked to participate.
      When participants in each group are recruited, further recruitment will cease. The total
      sampling frame will be eight. Enlisting an English proficient individual following
      recruitment of an LEP individual ensures having equal participation in each group.

      A paper and pencil survey will be administered in person at MOR after the initial
      occupational therapy visit and at the end of four weeks of OT services to the 4 Limited
      English proficient subjects and 4 English-speaking subjects, for 16 completed surveys.
      Completion will take place in a private room in the OT department. Subjects will self-select
      a 4 digit identification code that they will write in at the top of the survey. The sole
      purpose of the code is to match the pre-OT satisfaction survey with the post-OT satisfaction
      survey. No personal identification markers will be used on the surveys. Interviews will be
      conducted with each LEP individual following four weeks of OT services and after completion
      of the paper survey. No personal identification markers will be placed on the interview form.
      The interviews will be conducted in person at MOR, in a private room in the OT department.
      The primary investigator will present the open-ended questions with the assistance of Rush
      University Medical Center (RUMC) interpreter services. The documented data will be reviewed
      by the primary investigator for emerging themes that may provide insight and additional
      information.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-Occupational Therapy satisfaction survey was developed for this project by the primary investigator to measure perceived satisfaction. The pre-OT satisfaction survey consists of five demographic items and four items that employ a Likert scale rating method. The total quantitative scoring range for the survey is four to twenty, with a score of four indicating the lowest satisfaction and a score of 20 indicating the highest satisfaction. The paper and pencil survey was completed in person by all participants after the initial OT visit. Survey scores of the LEP group were compared to the English-speaking group. Equal or better scores reflect agreement that LEP OT perceive quality of care and satisfaction equal to English-speaking patients.</description>

    <description>The Post-4 weeks OT satisfaction survey was developed for this project by the primary investigator to measure perceived satisfaction. The survey consists of five demographic items and four items that employ a Likert scale rating method. The total quantitative scoring range for the survey is 4 to 20, with a score of 4 indicating the lowest satisfaction and a score of 20 indicating the highest satisfaction. The post-4 weeks OT satisfaction survey contains three additional items, using a Likert scale rating method to explore qualitative experiences. Total qualitative scoring range for the survey is 3 to 15, with a score of 3 indicating a low belief in the benefits of OT and a score of 15 indicating a high belief in the benefits of OT. Scores of the LEP group were compared to the English-speaking group. Equal or better scores reflect agreement that LEP OT patients receiving IS perceive quality of care and satisfaction equal to English-speaking patients.</description>

    <measure>Occupational Therapy Satisfaction Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Interviews were conducted by the primary investigator, Eileen Turgeon, assisted by Interpreter Services (IS), with each LEP individual following four weeks of OT services and after completion of the post-4 weeks OT satisfaction survey. The interviews were conducted in person. The interview consisted of seven open-ended questions meant to capture the qualitative experience of the use of Interpreter Services during OT service delivery. The literature supports the use of surveys and interviews to gather feedback on LEP patients' perceived quality of care and satisfaction (Gonz√°lez et al., 2010; Green et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2002; Shi et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2005). The primary investigator presented the open-ended questions with the assistance of IS. The recorded interviews were reviewed by this primary investigator for emerging themes to provide insight and additional information.</description>
