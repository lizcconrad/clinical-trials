  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, observational, comparative study with no intervention.The objective of the
      study to compare the efficiency of detecting glycemic abnormalities using Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring (CGMs) versus Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and HbA1C (Glycated Hemoglobin)
      and their relation to iron overload detected by T2* MRI of the pancreas in high-risk patients
      due to insulin deficiency (potential beta cell injury) and those with insulin resistance and
      to study the different factors that may affect the glycemic control in these patients in
      relation to their results like the Dose of corticosteroids and chemotherapy in ALL and
      Hemoglobinopathies, Liver function in ALL and Hemoglobinopathies, and Serum ferritin in
      Hemoglobinopathies and their transfusion status. Using Validated Tools with Permission, the
      participants will be selected through probability (random) sampling method with expected
      subjects numbers ALL/L: 30-50, Thalassemia Major: 20, Sickle cell disease: 20.

        The targeted sample size is up to 100 patients (we aim to recruit approximately 70-100
        cases based on the statistics from the outpatient clinics at NCCCR and the cancer registry
        data; over a period of 3 years). All cases of ALL, Lymphoma, Thalassemia and sickle cell
        disease diagnosed in HMC will be identified as subjects and they will be recruited based on
        informed consent and IRB approval.
