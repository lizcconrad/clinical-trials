  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusits (CRS) is common disease with reports of prevalence ranging from 4-16%
      in the western population. The main outcome measure for chronic disease treatment, such as
      CRS, is quality of life. Several large multi-institutional studies have shown that
      improvement in disease specific Quality of life was greater in patients who had surgery for
      their CRS with polyps. The timing of surgery in these patients has not been well studied but
      it is generally agreed upon that surgical candidates much had failed medical management. The
      definition of medical management varies greatly but usually includes some form of nasal or
      oral steroids and a prolonged ( &gt;10 days) course of antibiotics.

      Another known way to improve QOL is through education and individualized optimization. This
      has been utilized successfully in other fields with good success and improved QOL. Similar
      studies looking at combining non-surgical optimization and education have not been performed
      in CRS. This study aims to address this potential area for improvement in patient quality of
      life outcomes. Investigators plan to assess the potential role for pre-operative non-surgical
      medical and educational optimization in CRS standard of care treatment.
