    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) on lung
      homogeneity and recruitment in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS).

      It will do this by comparing the homogeneity of ventilation and recruitment prior to a
      patient being ventilated on APRV, and at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after starting APRV.

    <textblock>
      Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is a well-recognised problem of ventilation in patients
      with ARDS, and is currently treated with lung-protective ventilation, which limits tidal
      volumes and airway pressures by applying higher levels of positive-end expiratory pressure
      (PEEP). However, it is not known whether higher levels of PEEP increases recruitment and
      homogeneity of ventilation within the lungs.

      APRV is a mode of inverse ventilation, where high levels of PEEP are maintained with brief
      releases of pressure, and has been proposed as an appropriate method of ventilation in
      patients with ARDS.

      This study will assess homogeneity of ventilation and recruitment in 15 patients before APRV
      is started, and 30, 60 and 120 mins after commencing APRV. It will do this using Electrical
      Impedance Tomography (EIT), nitrogen wash in/wash out technique, and lung strain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare lung homogeneity estimated with EIT upon commencing APRV (APRVpre) and after 30 - 60 - 120 min of APRV ventilation (APRV30, APRV60, APRV120) in patients with moderate to severe ARDS</measure>
    <time_frame>30, 60 and 120 mins</time_frame>
    <description>EIT will be measured at time APRVpre during a &quot;low-flow maneuver&quot; consisting of a brief switch to PC ventilation: with a flow of 4 L/min, airway pressure will be gradually increased up to 30 cmH20 in order to see how the lung changes elastically minimising resistance. EIT will also be measured after 30 min (time APRV30), 60 min (time APRV60), 120 min (time APRV120) since APRV has started.</description>

    <description>Airway pressure release ventilation is a method of inverse ventilation, where high levels of positive end expiratory pressure are maintained to optimise oxygenation with brief releases of pressure to allow ventilation and release carbon dioxide. It is an approved and frequently used method of ventilation.</description>
