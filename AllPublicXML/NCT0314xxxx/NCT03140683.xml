  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, the percentage of Cesarean section deliveries has dramatically increased
      in most countries. Concomitantly, the rates of vaginal birth after Cesarean have decreased
      steadily.

      The pregnant women with previous Cesarean section face a difficult choice for their next
      delivery between a trial of labor after Cesarean or repeat caesarean section delivery.

      The performance of multiple Cesarean section exposes women to greater risks of complications;
      furthermore, the risk of complications increases with each subsequent Cesarean section.

      In fact, women with previous Cesarean section are more likely to experience short and
      long-term maternal complications in future pregnancies, or a trial of labor after Cesarean,
      with the risk of [uterine dehiscence, uterine rupture, genitourinary tract damage, hemorrhage
      and hysterectomy, abnormal placentation (placenta previa and placenta accreta) and
      difficulties during surgery
