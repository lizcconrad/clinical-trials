  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to estimate the effect size of a technology based intervention
      for older adults with cancer for nausea and vomiting. Participants will be randomized to
      either an intervention or a wait control group. Outcomes such as symptom severity, quality of
      life and resource use will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to increase the self-management behaviors for chemotherapy induced
      nausea and vomiting (CINV) and reduce treatment-related negative outcomes in older adults
      with cancer. CINV is a common reason for unplanned emergency department and/or hospital
      admissions in older adults with cancer. Early reinforcement of standard education and
      reframing preconceived beliefs about the potential serious consequences of CINV and the
      symptoms ability to be successfully managed will increase effective self-management behaviors
      and improve patient outcomes

    <description>Symptom Representation Questionnaire (SRQ)[20] , a 24-item self-report measure will be used to identify presence and severity of common treatment-related symptoms (0-10 Likert scale), including nausea and vomiting (N/V).

    <description>This intervention is an educational intervention, a serious game, which allows older adults under treatment for cancer to practice making self-care decisions for an avatar who is being sent home after their first chemotherapy treatment. This serious game is coupled with a discussion with a nurse about choices related to managing nausea and vomiting at home.</description>
