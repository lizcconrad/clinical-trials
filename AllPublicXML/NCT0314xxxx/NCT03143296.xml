  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate speech understanding in simulated reverberant
      environments with MED-EL cochlear implant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine if electrode length and coding strategy effect performance. We will
      also study performance over time with new recipients.
