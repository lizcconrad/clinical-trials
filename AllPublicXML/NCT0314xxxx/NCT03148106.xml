  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what are the best settings for applying electrical
      nerve stimulation over the skin for the short-term improvement of hand dysfunction after a
      stroke. The ultimate goal is to some day design an effective long-term training program to
      help someone recovery their ability to use their hands and function independently at home and
      in society. In order to know how to apply electrical nerve stimulation to produce a good
      long-term effect on hand dysfunction, we first need to know how to make it work best in the
      short-term, and improve our understanding of for whom it works and how it works.We will use a
      commercially available transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit to gently
      apply electrical nerve stimulation over the skin of the affected arm. This is a portable,
      safe and easy to use device designed for patients to operate in their homes.

    <description>We will put adhesive electrodes on the affected arm and connect it to a device that will deliver a gentle electrical stimulation to the hand and arm. The stimulation will last for different amounts of time, depending on the stimulation condition. This can be 30 minutes twice a day (1 hour apart), 1 hour continuously, 2 hours continuously, or 3 hours continuously. The stimulation conditions will also vary in stimulation strength. It is normal that some people may feel a tingling sensation, while others may feel nothing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-80 years, has residual hand motor dysfunction caused by a single ischemic
             and/or hemorrhagic stroke greater than 6 months prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant; uncontrolled medical problems including but not limited to severe
             cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary disease; active cancer; significant hand joint
             deformity or other diagnosis with major effect on hand function besides stroke; severe
             alcohol or drug abuse within the past year; untreated or inadequately treated major
             depression; spasticity score &gt;3 on the MAS; lack of finger range of motion of at least
             10 degrees; severe aphasia or other communicative, behavioral or cognitive impairment
             that significantly interferes with the participant's ability to comply with the
             protocol or provide informed consent. In addition, patients will be excluded if they
             have a pacemaker.
