    <textblock>
      Spina Bifida can lead to physical neurocognitive and psychological symptoms. Still little is
      know about the daily impact of spina bifida on participation possibilities in social life.
      This exploratory research project want to investigate which lif choices patients with spina
      bifida has to make and in which way their daily life is organized. In a second part, quality
      of life will be measured and we hope to discover some dynamics in order to improve patient
      care.

      This exploratory research project wants to investigate how patients with spina bifida live
      their daily life and which impact spina bifida has on their choices of life. This will be
      done by a survey that will ask questions about different domains in life: demographic
      variables, education, work, social functioning, spare time, housing, mobility, independency
      and quality of life. The survey is based on empirical findings in literature. The quality of
      life questioning is based on the SF36. The survey will be done once during a clinical
      consultation.
