  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In a previous study, children who consumed a high-carotenoid juice over 8 weeks
      significantly increased skin carotenoid levels as compared to children who consumed a placebo
      juice. A naturally carotenoid-rich baked product, potentially marketable as a healthy
      breakfast food alternative, was developed by Utah State University researchers.

      Objective: To determine the effect and response of a carotenoid-rich baked product on change
      in skin carotenoid levels among children.

      Design: A six week randomized controlled trial. Participants/setting: Participants were
      children age 5-18 during March-June, 2015 living in Cache County, UT (n=46). Intervention:
      Children were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment (n=23) with a high carotenoid
      baked food or control (n=25) who consumed a baked food with no carotenoids. Children were
      asked to eat the designated portion of the assigned food once a day for six weeks. Skin
      carotenoid levels were measured every two weeks by a BioPhotonic scanner and reported in
      Raman intensity counts. Participants were asked to maintain their diet and completed a food
      frequency questionnaire at Baseline, Week 3, and Week 6. Uneaten portions of the food were
      returned to clinic, counted, and recorded.

      Main outcome measures: Change in skin carotenoid levels as measured in Raman counts over 6
      weeks.

      Statistical analysis performed: Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to assess the group
      differences in Raman counts.

    <description>The skin carotenoid levels were determined by calculating the average height of the peak Raman absorbance signal obtained and quantified from excitation of skin carotenoids using a low-intensity blue light-emitting diodes light (Î»=473 nm) with green light (510 nm) detection.24 The BioPhotonic Scanner Everest 2TM skin carotenoids were reported as Raman intensity counts. The higher the count, the higher the concentration of carotenoid molecules detected at the site of measurement. The scanner reports total carotenoid count, rather than individual carotenoid counts, as there is overlap in the absorption spectra of each carotenoid. During the warm-up process, the black calibration cap, which covers the scanner's light-emitting diodes light, allows the scanner to self-calibrate using a patented process.</description>
