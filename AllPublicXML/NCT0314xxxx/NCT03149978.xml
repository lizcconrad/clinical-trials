    <textblock>
      This study suggested an effective application of pattern recognition, which figured the
      possible biological function of potential bio-markers of rectal cancer found in our study
      based on their chemical structures. Hence, this study identified the precursor protein and
      metabolic mechanism of these bio-markers and may contribute to the neoadjuvant chemoradiation
      of locally advanced rectal cancer
