    <textblock>
      General objective of the research project: To evaluate the alterations of systemic
      microvascular reactivity during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), in children submitted to
      cardiac surgery for repair of congenital heart defects.

      â€¢ Specific objectives:

        -  To test the usefulness of skin laser Doppler flowmetry monitoring (LDPM) in the
           non-invasive evaluation of endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity during CPB in
           children.

        -  To investigate whether skin LDPM could be proposed as a clinical monitoring of tissue
           perfusion during CPB in pediatric cardiac surgery.

        -  To investigate the effects of different anesthetic agents on microvascular reactivity
           during CPB.

        -  To investigate the effects of cardiovascular and vasoactive drugs used during CPB on
           microvascular reactivity.

        -  To evaluate the correlation of microcirculatory alterations observed during CPB with
           classical markers of tissue perfusion and oxygenation, including plasma lactate levels.

        -  To evaluate the correlation of microcirculatory alterations observed during CPB with
           markers of systemic inflammation, including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

        -  To evaluate the correlation of microcirculatory alterations observed during CPB with the
           plasma bioavailability of nitric oxide.
