             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate (PR)
             measurement, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), or clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - History of allergic reactions to diagnostic or therapeutic protein. History of recurrent
        infections or active infection within 28 days of screening.

        Exposure to live vaccines within 28 days of screening.

        - History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive
        testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody
        (HepBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb). As an exception, a positive hepatitis B surface
        antibody (HBsAb) finding as a result of subject vaccination is permissible.
