  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will preliminarily determine if a course of high frequency rTMS applied to
      the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, will reduce cue elicited craving, and cue reactivity
      in treatment seeking cannabis use disordered participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate if a course of excitatory DLPFC rTMS
      results in reduced cannabis cue-induced craving in treatment seeking individuals with CUD
      (Aim1). Additionally, the investigators seek to explore the mechanistic underpinnings of any
      observed effect, by collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging data during cannabis
      cue-administration before and after the treatment course (Aim 2). These aims will be
      addressed through a seven week, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study in which 72
      treatment seeking cannabis use disordered participants (36/group) will be given 20 sessions
      of either Active or Sham excitatory rTMS applied to the DLPFC. TMS will be delivered in an
      accelerated fashion over two weeks (2 sessions each day, five days each week). TMS will be
      applied in conjunction with a validated two-session Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)
      behavioral intervention.

    <description>The investigators hypothesize that as compared to those participants receiving sham rTMS, those participants receiving active rTMS will have a reduced level of cannabis cue-induced craving following their final rTMS session as compared to prior to their first rTMS session. The investigators will measure self-reported cannabis craving during a validated cannabis cue-reactivity paradigm, and define cue-induced craving as change in self reported craving from pre-to-post cue administration using the marijuana craving questionaire.</description>

    <description>The investigators hypothesize that as compared to those participants receiving sham rTMS, those participants receiving active rTMS will have a reduced percent signal change in BOLD response in reward structures during a validated cue-reactivity fMRI paradigm following their final TMS session as compared to prior to their first rTMS session.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that those participants receiving active rTMS will be more likely to be abstinent over the final two-weeks of the study period than those receiving sham rTMS. We will define abstinence as no self reported cannabis use over the final two weeks of the study, and a ratio of four week to two week creatinine corrected urine THCCOOH of &lt; 0.5, suggesting no new use of cannabis.</description>

    <description>rTMS will be delivered via a MagPro double blinded rTMS Research System (MagVenture, Denmark) with a Cool-B65 Butterfly Coil (a combined active and sham coil). We will use a standard resting motor threshold (rMT) determination to determine the TMS dose (49). Treatment will be delivered at 120% rMT. Each active TMS treatment will consist of a total of 4000 pulses of 10Hz stimulation (5s-on,10s-off). Treatments will be delivered at the EEG coordinate for F3 (which approximates the left DLPFC), and will be found using the Beam-F3 method.</description>

    <description>Sham sessions will be delivered using an electronic sham system consisting of a coil that mimics the appearance and sound of TMS, combined with a TENS device which produces a small electric shock mimicking the feeling of real TMS. This type of sham has been demonstrated to be indistinguishable from real TMS.</description>
