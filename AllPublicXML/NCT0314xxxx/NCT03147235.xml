  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial with patients randomly assigned to
      either the experimental or control group. The experimental group will be exposed to the
      independent variable (IV) and the control group will not be exposed to the IV. The IV will be
      a music therapist- designed listening program during surgery. A total of 60 patients will be
      consecutively enrolled and undergo block randomization to either a music listening group or a
      control group (no music). Trained medical research personnel will assist with various parts
      of the study and will be defined as those individuals who have completed and are up-to-date
      on the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) training. These individuals
      will consist of a board certified music therapist, practicing ophthalmologists, and
      physicians-in-training.

      This prospective trial will block randomize a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing
      routine vitrectomy surgery at an university hospital to a designed listening program during
      surgery or to nothing in order to determine whether music listening during surgery can
      measurably result in decreased patient pain assessed by the Wong-Baker Faces Pain scale.
      Secondary outcome measures will be blood pressure, need for anxiety medication, postoperative
      pain medication, and patient overall experience.
