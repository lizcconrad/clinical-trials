  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary germ cell cancer of the testicles confined to the testis can avoid
      adjuvant treatment by entering a surveillance protocol. In the surveillance protocol,
      patients are followed for up to ten years with serial computed tomography scans to detect
      recurrence. Multiple CT scans expose patients to a significant amount of radiation, which may
      be associated with an increased risk of secondary malignancies. This study hypothesizes that
      low dose CT scans are as effective as standard dose CT scans in detecting disease recurrence
      in this setting and will significantly reduce radiation exposure in this group of patients.

    <description>Patients with testicular germ cell cancer who have either been newly diagnosed, or have stage I cancer already on surveillance program will undergo conventional and low dose CT. Based on the imaging, they may undergo a surveillance program using low-dose CT.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)</intervention_name>
    <description>In phase A of the study, patients will undergo conventional CT along with low dose CT. If patients have a normal conventional CT and a satisfactory low dose CT, they will move onto Phase B of the study in which they will undergo surveillance using low-dose CT. Three outcomes are possible with low-dose CT surveillance:
Normal LDCT:
- Patient continues on the study (i.e. continued surveillance)
Suspicious LDCT:
- Will undergo conventional CT and if results are normal, patient will continue on study. If conventional CT is abnormal, they will be taken off study
Elevated serum tumour markers or other evidence of metastatic disease:
Patient goes off study</description>
