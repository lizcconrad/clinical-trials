      Observe palonosetron hydrochloride capsules'(Ruo Shan®) safety and efficacy information in
      the real world using.

        1. Observe the adverse effects of palonosetron hydrochloride capsules(Ruo Shan®) that we
           already known, and whether there is any new adverse effects.Observe the incidence and
           the situation of adverse effects. Pay attention to the adverse effects in special
           groups, like pregnant women, children, elderly patients, and patients with liver and
           kidney dysfunction. Observe other safety issues related to drug using method, drug
           packaging method and drug quality.

           [Time Frame: A period between the first day of using Palonosetron Hydrochloride Capsules
           (Ruo Shan®) to the fifth day]

           Secondary Outcome Measures:

        2. Furtherly clarify the efficacy of palonosetron hydrochloride capsules, and the widely
           used population characteristics, and clinical using features of palonosetron
           hydrochloride capsules.
