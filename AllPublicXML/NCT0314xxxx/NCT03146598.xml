    <textblock>
      Transverse-plane foot deformities are a frequently encountered issue in children with
      neurological disorders. They are the source of many symptoms, such as pain and walking
      difficulties, making their prevention very important. It is thus important to prevent the
      occurrence of transverse-plane foot deformities and limit their development regarding the
      high risk of morbidity. In order to prevent such deformities, in the department of pediatric
      physical medicine and rehabilitation department of Lyon, since 2001 the investigator use a
      side pole static ankle foot orthosis (SPS AFO) in children with a neurological disorder
      predisposing such deformities. The aim of the study this study is to describe the use,
      tolerability and potential side effects of this orthosis in children with neurological
      disorders from the investigator's department
