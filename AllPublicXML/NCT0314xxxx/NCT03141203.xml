    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre phase I/II trial looking at the combination of romidepsin and
      carfilzomib. The aim of the phase I part is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the
      combination. This part will recruit up to 27 patients.

      The aim of the phase II part is to assess the activity of the combination at the maximum
      tolerated dose in 28 patients.

      Patients will receive 8 cycles of romidepsin with carfilzomib and response will be assessed
      every second cycle. Patients will be followed up for progression and survival until the end
      of the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase I/II, multicentre, dose finding study of romidepsin
      in combination with carfilzomib.

      The aim of the phase I is to establish the MTD of the combination using a restricted
      two-stage CRM. The MTD is defined as the dose level that is closest to the level at which 25%
      of patients experience a DLT over the first cycle of treatment.

      The intention in phase I is to evaluate the DLT-inducing effects of doses in cohorts of
      patients. Patients will be treated in cohorts at a dose level and each patient will be
      evaluated for presence or absence of DLT. In stage I, the first cohort of 3 patients will be
      enrolled at the starting dose, i.e. dose level 2. If none experiences a DLT, the next cohort
      of 3 patients will be recruited at the next higher level, i.e. dose level 3. This escalation
      routine will continue until the first DLT is observed or the maximum recruitment for stage I
      is reached. As soon as the first DLT is observed, dose escalation and de-escalation will be
      guided by the CRM design that will recommend the dose believed to have associated DLT-rate
      closest to 25%, as described in Section 12.1. If the trial escalates, each dose below the
      newly tested dose is regarded as being tolerable.

      In stage II, a variable cohort sizes of up to five patients will be considered. Patients are
      screened for eligibility before they are formally registered. During screening, it is
      expected to transpire that some patients will be ineligible. To maximise recruitment and
      reduce trial suspension period between cohorts in this rare disease, the flexibility of
      variable cohort sizes will be allowed for by screening cohorts of up to five patients.
      Screening slots will be allocated so that the sum of: a) the number of patients already
      receiving treatment in the current cohort; and (b) the number of patients in screening; does
      not exceed five. If a patient is screened and proves to be eligible, they will be recruited
      to the trial. The first three patients in a cohort will receive the dose-level allocated to
      the cohort. Patients who are inevaluable, as described immediately above, can be replaced. If
      a fourth or fifth patient is recruited to a cohort and the dose allocated to the cohort is
      not yet regarded as tolerable, the fourth and fifth patients will receive the next dose-level
      below. Otherwise, they will receive the same dose level as the previous patients in the
      cohort. The aim of the described strategy is to maximise recruitment but not expose more than
      three patients to a dose that has not yet been demonstrated tolerable. The model will usually
      be updated after every 2 to 3 evaluable patients and subsequent recommended doses will be
      assigned to patients iteratively until the maximum sample size is reached, or the trial is
      stopped early because there is a high chance that the lowest dose is too toxic.

      The initial guess of MTD is at dose combination level 4, however to exercise caution, dose
      level 2 is defined as the starting dose level.

      Dose Levels

        1. 8mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/36mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16)

        2. (Starting dose) 10mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/36mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2,
           8, 9, 15, 16)

        3. 10mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/45mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16)

        4. 12mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/45mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16)

        5. 12mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/56mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16)

        6. 14mg/m2 Romidepsin (days 1, 8, 15), 20/56mg/m2 Carfilzomib (days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16) For
           all dose levels, the carfilzomib dose will be 20mg/m2 for the first 2 doses (i.e. day 1
           and 2 of cycle 1), rising to the target dose for subsequent doses and cycles.

      Once the MTD is defined, patients recruited at a lower dose may receive the MTD for any
      subsequent cycles of treatment at the discretion of the treating Investigator and the Chief
      Investigator.

      The phase II component will aim to provide a preliminary estimate of activity in 28 patients
      at the MTD combination established in phase I. The phase II component is based on A'Hern's
      single arm, single stage design and would utilise patients allocated to the MTD in phase I.
      Patients will be recruited over a 36-month period and will receive a minimum of 8 cycles of
      treatment. Patients will continue to be followed up for progression and survival until the
      end of the trial.
