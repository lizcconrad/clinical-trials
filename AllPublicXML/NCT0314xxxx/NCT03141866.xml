  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will take the form of a feasibility study; designed to assess the feasibility of a
      proposed future clinical trial in this setting. This proposed future clinical trial is
      proposed to assess the impact of physical activity, in the form of specialised chair based
      physical activity interventions, on the physiological, psychological, cognitive, social and
      emotional health, and functional capacity of geriatric populations with pre-existing frailty
      within a clinical hospital ward setting; recognising health as a holistic concept
      incorporating a multitude of inter-related dimensions. This feasibility study is
      single-centre (taking place in the Harborne Ward of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham,
      Mindelsohn Way, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom).

    <description>The primary dependent variable of this feasibility study will relate to the eight primary areas of focus of feasibility studies (Bowen et al. 2009), relating to:
Acceptability
Demand
Implementation
Practicality
Adaptation
Integration
Expansion and
Limited-efficacy testing
These eight aforementioned areas (constituting the one variable of feasibility) will serve as the primary dependent variable for this study, in order to establish the feasibility of a proposed future clinical trial within this setting. The dependent variable of feasibility will be assessed through semi-structured interviews with participants post intervention, while focus groups will be utilised with both the intervention implementers and study support staff in order to assess the primary dependent variable of the study. Participant uptake and adherence records will also be employed throughout.</description>

          -  ≥ 65 years of age

          -  Frail according to the Fried Frailty criteria: meeting at least three of the five
             characteristics of frailty (Fried et al. 2001)

          -  Have the capacity to speak and read in English

          -  Anticipated by their care team to remain on the ward for approximately 14 days post
             enrolment into the study. This will be advised by the patient's care team.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently taking part in any other clinical trial which could potentially have an
             impact upon or influences the findings of the current study

          -  Currently terminally ill with life expectancy which is less than the duration of the
             study's interventions

          -  Severe sensory impairment which would profoundly impact on their capacity to undergo
             the interventions, even once appropriate adaptations have been made.
