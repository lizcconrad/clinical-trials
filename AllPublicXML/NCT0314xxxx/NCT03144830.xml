  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and feasibility of using an exoskeleton in subjects who
      are less than 6 months post spinal cord injury (SCI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants with acute SCI (&lt;6 months post injury) will be involved in an indoor,
      overground walking program.

      Locomotor training will include 90 minute sessions (including time to don and doff the
      device) for 30 training hours (90 minutes, 2-3 times weekly for 8 weeks.)

    <measure>Change from baseline cardiorespiratory status throughout each of the 25 sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 15 minutes during each training session including: pre and post initial stand, at 15 minute intervals during training and at the end of each of the 25 total sessions, on average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure, heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation and will be used to identify any cardiovascular issues of orthostatic hypotension or autonomic dysreflexia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin integrity</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning and end of each training session for 25 sessions, on average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>A visual inspection of areas of significant weight bearing and skin/machine interface will take place at the beginning and end of each training session to monitor for skin breakdown or compromise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>From onset to cessation of each training session for 25 sessions, on average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Any incidence of falls will be recorded and the participant will be evaluated for injury by unit medical staff or on site emergency staff if warranted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning and end of each training session for 25 sessions, on average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants draw an intersecting line on a 10 cm line (scale) in order to rate their amount of subjective pain. The distance on the 10 cm line is measured from the left side (no pain) and turned into a numerical value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Borg scale of perceived exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning, mid point (30 min) and end (60 min) of each training session for 25 sessions, on average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are shown the Borg scale of perceived exertion and are asked to choose the number/descriptor that best aligns with their current level of exertion at 0, 30 and 60 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Training sessions 1, 13 and 25 out of the 25 total sessions, on average of 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time in seconds it takes a subject to walk a distance of 10 meters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Training sessions 1, 13 and 25 of the 25 total sessions, on average of 2 months</time_frame>
