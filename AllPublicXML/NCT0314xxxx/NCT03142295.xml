    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      controlled human urine transfusion in female patients with recurrent UTI's.

      Seconday and exploratory objectives are to evaluate the diversity of the urine microbiome
      after urine transfusion, to assess the longevity of changes in the urine microbiome in
      patients after urine transfusion over a period of 6 months and to assess the frequency of
      UTI's after the transfusion.

    <textblock>
      Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in nursing
      homes, in acute care and the general practice. Increasing antibiotic resistance of
      enterobacteriaciae poses a challenge to the treatment of UTIs. Unlike previously thought, the
      bladder is colonized with bacteria, which together form the urine microbiome. Recurrent
      urinary tract infections are associated with a decreased urinary microbiota diversity,
      potentially making recolonization by bacterial interference in the bladder an alternative
      therapy for UTI. Pioneering studies showed that local bacterial interference in the bladder
      can be performed safely and has potential as prophylactic intervention.

      We now propose to expand this bacterial interference to a polymicrobial inoculum to increase
      adherence of the donor microbiome and as such expand the prophylactic effect. This pilot
      trial will investigate the safety and tolerability of urine transfusion from healthy donors
      to the bladders of patients with recurrent UTIs.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      controlled human urine transfusion in female patients with recurrent UTI's.

      Secondary and exploratory objectives are to evaluate the diversity of the urine microbiome
      after urine transfusion, to assess the longevity of changes in the urine microbiome in
      patients after urine transfusion over a period of 6 months and to assess the frequency of
      UTI's after the transfusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is premenopausal, aged ≥ 18 and ≤45 years

          -  Subject had recurrent UTI's (≥3 documented UTI's in the last year with documented
             symptom-free interval of at least 2 weeks) following the definition of a urinary tract
             infection: the presence of significance bacteruria (10^3 CFU/ml or more), pyuria and
             fever plus one or more of the following signs and symptoms: suprapubic or flank
             discomfort, dysuria, bladder spasms or pollakiuria

          -  Subject has a documented urinary tract infection (see definition), for which oral
             antibiotic therapy has been initiated.

          -  Subject has adequate understanding of the procedures of the study and agrees to abide
             strictly thereby.

          -  Subject is able to communicate well with the investigators and is available to attend
             all study visits.

          -  Subject has signed informed consent.

          -  Subject will remain available during the first 3 weeks of the study period
