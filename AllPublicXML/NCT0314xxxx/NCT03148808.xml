  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NVS Therapy is being studied to evaluate the safety and efficacy of retention of acute
      luminal gain, leading to acute hemodynamic improvement in superficial femoral and popliteal
      arteries with reference vessel diameters between 3.5 and 7.0 mm and lesion lengths between 36
      and 96mm. The system is intended for use in patients with de novo lesions in the superficial
      femoral and proximal popliteal arteries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, open label Phase 1 study to assess the
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy trends of applying NVS Therapy to de
      novo lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and proximal popliteal artery (PPA)
      during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with life-style limiting
      claudication due to obstructive SFA and proximal popliteal artery atherosclerosis. Each
      investigator will receive supervised training for each procedure.

      Eligibility to participate in the study is determined during the screening period and prior
      to the index procedure. Once a subject has been determined to be suitable for a peripheral
      intervention and all general eligibility criteria are met, angiographic eligibility will be
      evaluated at the time of the index procedure. Subjects then undergo the procedure with the
      NVS Therapy. Study data will be analyzed through the Day 365 follow-up visit.
