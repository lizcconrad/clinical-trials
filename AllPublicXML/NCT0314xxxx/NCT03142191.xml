  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study evaluating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), quality of life and exploratory
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of two treatment doses of CC-90001, 200 mg and 400 mg, compared with
      placebo, when delivered once daily per os (PO) in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
      (IPF). This study is designed to assess response to treatment by using measures of lung
      function, disease progression, fibrosis on radiography, and patient-reported outcomes. It
      will also assess dose response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 135 adult male and female subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of Idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (according to the most recent IPF guideline for diagnosis and
      management) will be randomized 1:1:1 (45 subjects per arm) to treatment with oral CC-90001
      (200 mg QD or 400 mg QD) or matching placebo for an initial 24 weeks. Subjects completing 24
      weeks of treatment will continue onto the blinded 28-week Treatment Extension Phase.
      Following an initial screening at Visit 1, eligible subjects will be randomized to either
      CC-90001 200 mg or 400 mg PO QD or matching placebo beginning on Day 1 (Baseline Visit) of
      the study. Subjects completing the 24-week Double-blind Treatment Phase will continue the
      same blinded treatment assignment for 28 weeks in the Treatment Extension Phase. In the
      28-week Treatment Extension Phase, all subjects will have the opportunity, if deemed
      appropriate by the Investigator, to use standard of care (SOC). The time to add and the
      choice of SOC will be at the Investigator's discretion. All subjects who complete the study
      treatment phases, or those subjects who discontinue Investigational product (IP) prior to the
      completion of the study, will participate in the 4-week Post-treatment Observational
      Follow-up Phase.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

      An external DMC, comprised of independent physician experts and a statistician who are not
      affiliated with the Sponsor and for whom there is no identified conflict of interest will be
      responsible for safeguarding study participants' interests and for monitoring the overall
      conduct of the study.
