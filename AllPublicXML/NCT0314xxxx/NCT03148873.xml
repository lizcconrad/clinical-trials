    <textblock>
      Your respiratory rate is your number of breaths per minute. The standard way for this to be
      measured is by a nurse looking at you for one minute and manually counting your breaths over
      this time. They normally do this once every few hours. At times, it can be useful to have
      your respiratory rate continuously monitored. A device that can do this is a capnograph. For
      the patient, this involves wearing a tube in their nose and around their ears while trying to
      minimise their movement and talking so the measurements can be taken.

      This research study is looking at a new respiratory rate monitor and comparing how well it
      works against the current accepted methods.

      Patients who are admitted to the Acute Medical Unit will be invited to participate should
      they meet all eligibility criteria.

      Subjects will be monitored for two hours:

      (i) For the first hour subjects will wear a capnograph, RespiraSense and have their
      respiratory rate manually counted by a research nurse. During this time the subject will be
      asked to keep talking and moving to a minimum.

      (ii) For the second hour subjects will wear RespiraSense and have their respiratory rate
      manually counted by a research nurse. During this time the subject can talk and move as they
      wish.
