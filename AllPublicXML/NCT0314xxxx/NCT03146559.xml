  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate learning transfer from the healthy hand to the
      paretic hand in stroke patients. EMG signals from the healthy hand - while performing wrist
      dorsi flexion movement - will be used to activate electric muscles stimulation of the dorsi
      flexors of the paretic hand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      14 post-stroke subjects will be recruited from neurological rehabilitation department at
      Loewenstein rehabilitation hospital, Ra`anana, Israel. The patients will be randomly assigned
      to one of two groups: 1) Experimental group. 2) Control group. The 3 weeks intervention (15
      sessions) in each group will include electric muscles stimuli (pulse rate 35-100Hz pulse
      width 200 microseconds, 5 sec on and 10 sec rest ) of the hemiparetic hand for 15 minutes.
      The patients in the experimental group will wear a wireless Bluetooth EMG (&quot;Myo&quot; bracelet) on
      their healthy forearm and when they will execute wrist dorsi flexion, the data will be
      transmitted to a PC which will be used to activate (via Arduino controller) a Transcutaneous
      Electric Nerve Stimulator (TENS) that is attached to the paretic dorsi flexors (electrodes
      are placed on the paretic forearm). The control group will get only automatic stimuli on the
      paretic forearm via the TENS.

      The assessments will be done before the intervention, at the end of three weeks of
      intervention, and after 1 month from the end of the intervention (follow up).

      The outcomes will include: active range of motion of fingers and wrist dorsi flexion (using
      cybermin 5DT glove for digital measures), upper limb section of Fugl-Meyer test, Box and
      Blocks test and Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. Only before the beginning of the
      intervention the sensory ability of the patient will be assessed using the Sensory section of
      Fugl-Meyer (FM) and Semmes-Weinstein filaments for superficial sensation. Normalized lesion
      data will be computed using the ABLE module within MEDx software (Medical Numerics).

      Differences between groups will be calculated using t-tests or Mann-Whitney, depending on
      distribution of normality with corrections for multiple comparisons.
