  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female pelvic organ prolapse (FPOP) is one of the main diseases affecting the quality of life
      of middle aged and elderly women in non-neoplastic diseases. An aging population makes the
      incidence of this disease to increase year by year. Surgical operation is the main treatment.
      While the recurrence rate of classic repair surgery is high, the method of patch implantation
      reinforces the supporting force, which significantly reduce the recurrence rate. However,
      this method is costly and is associated with complications which may trigger new symptoms. As
      such, there is still no perfect surgical method. The main reason for this is that the
      assessment method of pelvic defects is crude and indirect, which results in the diagnosis of
      FPOP only representing external problems whereas, inner defected parts are not properly
      assessed. In recent years, research with the use of 2D and 3D MRI reconstructions on the anus
      levator muscle and ligament has become a hot topic. It found that the characteristic of the
      high resolution of soft tissue in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a big advantage in
      pelvic floor study.The investigators commenced the study of 3D reconstruction technology
      based on the MRI datasets in 2009. The investigators have mastered the most common, key
      technologies of MRI three-dimensional reconstruction. The investigators have done research
      targeted on the reconstruction methods of the normal pelvis, viscera, ligaments, pelvic floor
      muscles. This project is aimed at 3D reconstruction of the whole pelvic base on static and
      dynamic MRI images from FPOP patients, and establish the corresponding space coordinates
      assessment system to do location and quantitative research of the pelvic viscera and its
      support structure, thus providing a FPOP diagnosis platform that is more precise, direct and
      comprehensive.

        This is a study comparing 60 cases (POP) to 20 controls (Non POP,with normal pelvic floor
        support) defined by using Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) exams.All recruits
        will undergo the MRI evaluation,and the basic information of them will be recorded.
