  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if performing MRIs after radiation treatment for
      head and neck cancer can predict osteoradionecrosis (a change in non-cancerous tissue).

      This is an investigational study. MRIs are performed using FDA-approved and commercially
      available methods. It is considered investigational to use MRIs to study the effects of
      radiation treatment on normal tissue.

      Up to 1400 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Baseline Visit:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will compete the following tests and procedures
      at the baseline visit:

        -  You will have an MRI at the Center for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), in the South
           Campus Research Building at MD Anderson or at the Proton Therapy Center depending on
           your assigned study group. It should take about 45-60 minutes to complete. You will be
           asked about any medical implants or metal that you may have in your body.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

        -  You will complete 4 questionnaires about any symptoms of cancer and side effects from
           treatment you may be having. You will also be asked about your daily life, your diet,
           and your ability to swallow and speak. It should take about 30 minutes to complete these
           questionnaires.

      Study Groups:

      You will be placed into a study group based on the status of the disease treatment:

        -  Cohort 1, Group 1: Patients who will have radiation to treat head and neck cancer.

        -  Cohort 1, Group 2: Patients who have already had radiation to treat head and neck
           cancer.

        -  Cohort 2: Patients who have already had radiation to treat head and neck cancer and who
           will have additional radiation.

        -  Cohort 3: Patients who have already had radiation and will have conservative treatment
           for early stage osteoradionecrosis.

        -  Cohort 4: Patients who have already had radiation and will have surgery for late stage
           osteoradionecrosis.

      If at any point your treatment plans change or the disease gets worse, you may switch to a
      different cohort. The study doctor will inform you of this.

      Study Visits:

      At each study visit, you will complete the same study procedures that were performed at the
      baseline visit. Your study visit schedule is determined by your study group. Each study visit
      may be performed within 1-3 months of the time points listed below.:

      Cohort 1, Group 1 will have study visits 3-5 weeks after starting radiation and then 2
      months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, and 3 years after completing radiation.

      Cohort 1, Group 2 study visits will depend on how much time has passed since completing
      radiation:

        -  If you completed radiation in the last year, you will have study visits at 6 months , 12
           months, 2 years, and 3 years after completing radiation.

        -  If you completed radiation in the last 2 years, you will have study visits 2 years, and
           3 years after completing radiation.

        -  If you completed radiation in the last 3 or more years, you will have a study visit 3
           years after completing radiation. Depending on how long after your treatment you join
           this study, you may have a study visit every year for at least 2 years in a row.

      Cohort 2 will have study visits within 3-5 weeks after starting re-radiation, and then 2
      months, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years, and 3 years after completing re-radiation.

      Cohort 3 will have study visits 2 months and 6 months after treatment.

      Cohort 4 will have study visits 5-10 weeks after surgery and 12 months after surgery.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have additional study visits.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking part in this study for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take part in the study if the cancer gets worse,
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after your last study visit is completed.

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent;

          -  Current or previous diagnosis of histologically proven malignant neoplasms of the head
             and neck;

          -  Receipt of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with curative intent, with or
             without concomitant chemotherapy;

          -  Good performance status (ECOG score 0-2)

          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures; and

          -  Willing to participate for the duration of the study.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for each Cohort:

        Cohort 1 (Longitudinal)

        Group 1 (Pre-Radiation) Subjects who are currently undergoing or scheduled to undergo
        treatment with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (induction or concurrent) with
        intent to eradicate the malignancy. Treatment will include the following: 1) primary or
        nodal disease adjacent to (within 2 cm) the mandible (i.e., likely to receive a dose of at
        least 50 Gy to some portion of the mandible volumes) and 2) &gt;60% probability of survival
        for 3 years after treatment.

        Group 2 (Post-Radiation) Subjects who were previously treated with radiotherapy with or
        without chemotherapy (induction or concurrent). Treatment will have included the following:
        1) unilateral maximum mandible dose of ≥ 60 Gy and a gradient of dose across the mandible
        of ≥ 20 Gy, 2) oncological cure and now in disease surveillance; and 3) no clinically
        diagnosed ORN at the time of enrollment.

        Cohort 2 (Enriched)

        Subjects with recurrent and/or new head and neck cancer disease who will undergo
        re-irradiation to the head and neck with intent to eradicate the malignancy. Treatment will
        include the following: 1) any mandible dose of at least 50 Gy; and 2) no clinically
        diagnosed ORN at the time of enrollment.

        Cohort 3 (Early ORN intervention)

        Subjects with clinically confirmed low-grade/early stage osteoradionecrosis requiring
        therapeutic (medical and/or dental surgery) intervention as diagnosed by a qualified

        4.0 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events).

        Cohort 4 (Surgical intervention for advanced ORN)

        Subjects with clinically confirmed high-grade/high stage osteoradionecrosis requiring
        surgical intervention. Clinical staging of ORN will be conducted using the CTCAE 4.0
        (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events).

        Subjects can move from Cohort 1 and 2 into Cohort 3 and/or 4 if they develop ORN. Cohort
        assignment will depend on the stage of ORN. Additionally, subjects in Cohort 3 can move to
        Cohort 4 if conservative treatment fails.
