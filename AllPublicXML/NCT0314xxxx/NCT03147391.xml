      The study was to retrospectively analyse the efficacy and safety of percutaneous left atrial
      appendage (LAA) closure using the LAmbre (Lifetech Scientific Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) in
      our center from April 2014 to November 2015. 89.4% has finished the 12-month esophageal
      ecllocardiogrhy (TEE) examination. The average followup was 2-years.

        The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the long-term follow-up results
        associated with left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) with the LAmbre (Lifetech Scientific
        Corp., Shenzhen, China) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).
