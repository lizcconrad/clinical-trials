  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, our best psychological treatments for anxiety and mood disorders only focus on
      individual diagnoses. So, there are separate treatments for Panic Disorder, or Depressive
      Disorder, or Social Anxiety, etc. These 'diagnosis-specific' treatments work well for people
      whose problems fit neatly into a single diagnosis. However, they work far less well for
      people with complex problems involving multiple diagnoses, and 50% of patients fail to
      respond well to these existing treatments.

      The purpose of this study is to test a new psychological treatment for anxiety and mood
      problems (the Modular Protocol for Mental Health [MPMH]). Instead of focusing on any single
      diagnosis, MPMH combines the best treatment techniques into 10 modules to target problems
      common across all of the different mood and anxiety diagnoses (e.g., intense emotions,
      negative thinking, upsetting memories, distressing habits). MPMH should therefore be a better
      treatment for the large numbers of individuals whose problems do not fit neatly into a single
      diagnosis and for whom any treatments targeting a single diagnosis would leave significant
      difficulties unaddressed.

    <description>The Modular Protocol for Mental Health (Psychological Therapy) will last up to 18 regular weekly face-to-face sessions. Treatment follows a standard structured treatment session as per Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. The MPMH Treatment Manual was written by clinical psychologists. The selection and ordering of the modules for treatment will be delivered and determined by the Trial Clinical Psychologist in collaboration with the service-user. The treatment modules include:
M1. Getting Acquainted M2. Understanding Emotions M3. Managing and Tolerating Emotions M4. Behavioural activation M5. Tackling Avoidance M6. Tackling Unhelpful Thoughts M7. Tackling Unhelpful Habits M8. Overcoming Repetitive Thinking M9. Managing Upsetting Memories and Images M10. Relapse Prevention and Future Orientation</description>
