  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumor. The reference treatment of advanced
      forms of stage C according to the Barcelona classification (BCLC C) is sorafenib, a
      multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor with predominant anti-angiogenic action. In order not
      to underestimate the efficacy of sorafenib, scannographic evaluation of the tumor response
      should be performed with mRECIST criteria that are significantly better correlated with
      survival. These criteria take into account the tumor size and also the modification of the
      tumor contrast enhancement after anti-angiogenic treatment. It seems appropriate to evaluate
      tumor control rather than tumor response since sorafenib is more stable than tumor response.

      This evaluation will be made according to the mRECIST criteria after 3 months of treatment
      since the progression-free survival is of the order of 3 to 4 months. The determination of
      early predictive criteria for the response to sorafenib would optimize the management of
      advanced HCCs. Indeed, sorafenib only improves overall survival by 3 months in selected
      patients, and with undesirable effects and a significant cost. Predictive biological criteria
      have already been studied, such as alpha foeto-protein (AFP), whose early decrease with
      sorafenib is associated with better overall survival. The same applies to the early reduction
      at 4-6 weeks of tumor arterial contrast according to mRECIST criteria. The perfusion scanner
      appears to be an accessible and reproducible choice imaging technique for assessing tumor
      vasculature. In metastatic kidney cancers, it was demonstrated that some criteria for tumor
      perfusion prior to treatment with sorafenib were predictive of better control of the disease
      and even a better tumor response according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria. The determination of
      pre-therapeutic tumor perfusion criteria in order to predict tumor control or even overall
      survival has never been studied in advanced CHCs. On the other hand, an early variation in
      the criteria for tumor perfusion under treatment would tend to be correlated with the tumor
      response and even with overall progression-free survival.

      Therefore, the study of tumor vascularization by the perfusion scanner could make it possible
      to demonstrate early predictive criteria for tumor control under sorafenib in order to
      optimize the management of patients with advanced HCC.
