  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will aid in the development of a research instrument for rapid and highly
      sensitive detection of perinatal salivary oxytocin, by non-invasive means. There will be two
      study cohorts: Induction of labor cohort (20) and Cesarean delivery cohort (5) for a total of
      25 participants.The standard clinical protocols for administering oxytocin to human subjects
      at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital will be followed. Oxytocin will be prescribed and dosed
      as per standard of care with no change due to study enrollment. The study will only involve
      sampling of saliva and blood.

      The general hypothesis to be tested is that 1) the sensor will accurately report the levels
      of oxytocin in saliva samples as compared with standard reference methods and 2) the sensor
      yields rapid (&lt;20 minutes) oxytocin results with minimal discomfort to subjects. Overall,
      this will allow to optimize the administration of oxytocin, and for a better understanding of
      the blood concentration and effects of oxytocin on mother and child.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin, a neuropeptide hormone, plays an important role in the dynamic function of the
      brain and a variety of complex social behaviors including affiliation, sexual behavior,
      social recognition, and aggression. Oxytocin is best known for its role to facilitate the
      birth process through induction of uterine smooth muscle contractions. Oxytocin is primarily
      used to induce labor, and contract the uterus after delivery. Oxytocin is considered the
      first line uterotonic to prevent and treat uterine atony and manage postpartum hemorrhage.
      Currently, there is no instrument that is capable of point-of-care oxytocin detection. A
      practical research tool to monitor peripheral levels of both endogenous and exogenous
      oxytocin is therefore needed to better understanding the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of oxytocin in the mother, fetus and newborn. A better understanding of drug
      concentration and effect may lead to optimal dosing and better management of induction of
      labor and/or uterine atony after delivery.

      With increased research on the importance of oxytocin monitoring, a bedside oxytocin monitor
      is envisioned that would allow healthcare professionals to improve our
      pharmacokinetic/dynamic understanding of oxytocin and to monitor and adjust the dose of
      oxytocin administered during childbirth. Currently, there is no instrument that is capable of
      point-of-care oxytocin detection.

    <description>Saliva samples will be obtained both during induction and infusion, every 15 minutes after each change in dose. An estimated total of 5 saliva samples will be collected from each patient. Therefore, the last collection point (sample 5) will be during the oxytocin infusion after the 4th dose change. In addition, 2 blood samples will be collected from 5 patients - one baseline sample and another sample at same time as last saliva sample.</description>

    <description>A total of 3 saliva samples will be collected from each patient - one at baseline preoperative, one intrapartum at least 15 min after starting the standard 250 ml/h oxytocin infusion, and one postpartum in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) at least 15 min after starting the standard 125 ml/h oxytocin infusion. Therefore, the last collection point (sample 3) will be during the oxytocin infusion in PACU. In addition, 1 blood sample will be collected from each patient in this cohort - at same time as last saliva sample.</description>
