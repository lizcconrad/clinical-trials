  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the study will be adults with full mobility, with the capacity to give
      informed written consent. The investigators will recruit a group of volunteers in order to
      represent a variety of BMIs, in an attempt to gain a sample of the BMIs found in the
      population. The investigators will mimic current practices and standard equipment in order to
      replicate real conditions as closely as possible.

      Participants will lay on the following surfaces in the following scenarios

        1. Ambulance scoop: supine (lying flat on their back)

        2. A&amp;E trolley: supine

        3. Hospital bed: supine

        4. Theatre table: supine

        5. Theatre table: Left lateral (lying on their left side at 90 degrees to the operating
           table) with pelvic binders (pads designed to keep the hip immobile).

      Each participant will remain in each position on that particular surface for a period of 25
      minutes. A pressure mapping mattress will lie between the participant and the surface
      assessed to generate a pressure map.

      Following completion of data collection, data will be analysed and any areas of potential
      pressure damage vulnerability will be identified.

    <description>The investigators propose a snap shot study in a group of healthy volunteers of varying BMIs, laying on surfaces a patient would be exposed to during their hospital stay. Participants will lie on a variety of surfaces they may find themselves on during an emergency admission to hospital, including an operating table, in a variety of positions. Participants pressure distributions in each scenario will be measured with a pressure sensing mattress.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

        â€¢ Subjects will be individuals aged 18 and over, with good command of spoken and written
        English, full mobility, and the capacity to give informed, written consent. Provided there
        is no impairment to mobility, there is no upper age limit to participation.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed written consent

          -  Having a BMI that falls outside of the stated ranges for the study (&lt;19)

          -  Any significant impairment to mobility, for whatever reason, that prevents the patient
             from getting in and out of bed unaided, walking 100 metres unaided, or climbing a
             flight of stairs unaided.

          -  Patients who lack sufficient command of written and spoken English to allow them to
             give written informed consent take part.
