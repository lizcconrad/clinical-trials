  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trametinib works in treating patients with epithelioid
      hemangioendothelioma that has spread to other places in the body, nearby tissue or lymph
      nodes, or cannot be removed by surgery. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the 6-month and median progression free survival (PFS) rates. II. Estimate the
      2-year and median overall survival (OS) rates. III. Evaluate the safety of trametinib in
      patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.

      IV. Evaluate patient-reported symptoms using National Institutes of Health Patient Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (NIH PROMIS) global health; pain intensity,
      interference and behavior short form inventories prior to, after 4 weeks and after 6 months
      (if stable or better disease) of treatment, and on evidence of disease progression.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the rates of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma progression prior to starting
      trametinib to rates on treatment by central review of radiology images.

      II. Evaluate the effect of trametinib on change in tumor volume and compare to RECIST 1.1
      response through central imaging review.

      III. Evaluate the effect of trametinib on markers of inflammation including c-reactive
      protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and plasma connective tissue growth
      factor (CTGF).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trametinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 52 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 6 months.

The second will be a landmark analysis (done at either the first radiographic assessment or at the second radiographic assessment) to compare the survival of patients classified as a responder (based on tumor volume) to those who have not responded by the selected landmark time. Patients who died prior to the landmark time point will be omitted from analysis.</description>
