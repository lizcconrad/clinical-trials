  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a home visitation program incorporating sugar sweetened
      beverage and juice (SSB/J) reduction and home water delivery affects maternal and infant risk
      for obesity. The postpartum period is a time of both opportunity and vulnerability for
      mothers and their infants to diminish risk for obesity and related health problems. This is
      particularly relevant in the context of Hispanic families. Hispanic mothers are at high-risk
      for excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention, and their infants are at
      high-risk for rapid weight gain associated with early onset obesity. A contributing factor
      may be their intake of SSB/J. There is a high prevalence of reported SSB/J consumption in
      low-income Hispanic households, and Hispanic mothers are more likely to incorporate sweet
      foods during weaning. Because evidence suggests that obese Hispanic children are responsive
      to SSB/J reduction and substitution with non-caloric beverages, this may be a potential
      strategy for Hispanic mothers that may also be beneficial for their infants.

      This study will be conducted in collaboration with Antelope Valley Partners for Health, who
      will deliver a home visitation program intervention once a week for 24 months.
      Two-hundred-and-forty overweight/obese Hispanic mothers and their infants will be recruited.
      They will be randomly assigned to: group 1, a standard home visitation program only; group 2,
      a standard home visitation program that incorporates sugar reduction; and group 3, a standard
      home visitation program that incorporates sugar reduction with home water delivery. The main
      outcomes are maternal BMI and infant weight-for-length growth. We will also assess maternal
      and infant diet using 24-hour recalls, and maternal feeding style and infant eating behaviors
      using questionnaires. Linear mixed effects models will be used to compare changes between the
      intervention groups in maternal BMI and infant weight-for-length.
