    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug, called TEW-7197, is safe and determine
      what the best dose is to treat future patients when given in combination with pomalidomide
      (POM). The study will also look to see if it has any effect on multiple myeloma, when given
      in combination with POM.

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum tested dose level of TEW-7197
           given in combination with pomalidomide (POM) for the treatment of relapsed or relapsed
           or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability profile of TEW-7197 in combination with POM
           at the MTD

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess response and clinical benefit response rates according to international
           uniform response criteria

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) and PFS at 6 months (PFS-6)

      Study Design This study is a Phase I, open label trial of TEW-7197 in combination with
      standard doses of POM. The study will be conducted as a modified Fibonacci 3 + 3 dose
      escalation design to determine the MTD of TEW-7197 in combination with standard doses of POM.
      Patients will receive combination TEW-7197 /POM.

    <description>TEW-7197 tablets, taken once daily for 5 days followed by 2 days without treatment, repeated for 28-day cycles until appearing evidence of progressive disease or intolerable toxicity, or subject discontinuing the study for other reasons. For dose escalation during this study, dosing will be initiated at 60 mg once daily by oral administration and will be increased to determine the MTD. Provisional subsequent doses are 60, 120, 240 mg once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19 and 22-26.
POM is administered orally (4 mg/day daily on Days 1 - 21 days). Treatment will occur in a suitable outpatient ambulatory care setting that is equipped for monitoring of patients with hematopoietic malignancies undergoing early clinical trial research.</description>

    <description>TEW-7197 is an inhibitor of protein serine/threonine kinase activity of TGF-β receptor type 1 (TGFBR1; ALK5). TEW-7197 inhibits the phosphorylation of the ALK5 substrates, Smad2 and Smad3, and the intracellular signaling of TGF-β. Dosing begins at 60mg by mouth, daily and may increase to 240mg by mouth daily in the absence of dose limiting toxicities</description>

    <description>POM, an analog of thalidomide, is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic activity. Myeloma tumor cells exposed to POM, undergo growth arrest and increased apoptotic cell death. POM enhances T cell- and natural killer cell-mediated immunity and inhibit production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes. POM may be taken orally with water. Capsules should not be broken, chewed or opened. POM should be taken without food (at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal). POM will be commercially available. POM will be taken by mouth at a dose of 4mg per day</description>
