  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the safety of the guided healing and
      adhesion prevention membrane, COVA™+ CARD, in adult cardiac surgery. The causality of the
      collagen membrane according to the occurrence of peri and post-operative complications will
      be evaluated.

      Assessment of the safety of COVA™+ CARD, collagen membrane to prevent adhesion appearance, in
      cardiac surgery in adult patients:

        -  collection of post-operative complications, causality of the membrane

        -  collection of complications in the 3-month period after the surgery, causality of the
           membrane

        -  collection of peri-operative complications, causality of the membrane

        -  collection of complications, 3 months after the surgery

        -  assessment of the efficacy of COVA™+ CARD if re-operation

        -  assessment of the surgeon's satisfaction
