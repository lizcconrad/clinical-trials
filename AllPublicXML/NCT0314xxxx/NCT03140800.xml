  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine contraceptive device is one of the most efficient and reversible methods of
      birth control with low cost and long duration of use However, in the first year after
      insertion, between 5 and 15% of women will have their Intrauterine contraceptive device
      removed because of irregular uterine bleeding which have been attributed to the effect of
      contact between the device and the endometrium and even the pressure on the uterine muscle .
      The disharmonious relationship between the Intrauterine contraceptive device and the uterus
      is the cause of most of the bleeding complaints, so bleeding is related to improper position
      rather than the contraceptive method itself which should be excluded before abandoning the
      Intrauterine contraceptive device for any other method of birth control
