      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of the
      anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug delamanid (DLM) in combination with an optimized multidrug
      background regimen (OBR) for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in HIV-infected and
      HIV-uninfected children with MDR-TB.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      the anti-TB drug DLM in combination with OBR for MDR-TB in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
      children with MDR-TB.

      Participants will be enrolled in one of four age cohorts: 12 to less than 18 years, 6 to less
      than 12 years, 3 to less than 6 years, or 0 to less than 3 years. All participants will
      receive DLM dosed according to their age group and weight for 24 weeks.

      Study visits will occur at study entry; Weeks 2 and 4; every 4 weeks through Week 40; and at
      Weeks 48, 60, 72, and 96. Visits may include physical examinations; blood, urine, and sputum
      collection; chest x-rays; electrocardiograms (ECGs); hearing tests; adherence assessments;
      and acceptability questionnaires.
