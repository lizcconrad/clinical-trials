  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in patients
      with relapsed or refractory hepatocellular carcinoma. Single or multiple doses of
      GPC3-targeted CAR T cells will be given to subjects with unmet medical needs for which there
      are no effective therapies known at this time.

      A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and
      engraftment potential of CAR-GPC3 T cells in patients with GPC3-positive hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

      Primary objectives:

      Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the autologous T cells transduced with
      the anti- GPC3 lentiviral vector in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

      Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of CAR-GPC3 T cells in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma by the following parameters:

      Objective response rate (ORR); Disease Control Rate (DCR); Time of tumor progression (TTP);
      Overall survival (OS).

    <description>Study related adverse events are defined as signs above CTCAE Grade 3, laboratory toxicities and clinical events occurred at any time from the first day of infusion to week 24 that are &quot;possibly&quot;, &quot;likely&quot;, or &quot;definitely&quot; related to the study, including infusion related toxicity and CAR-GPC3 T cells related toxicity. Include but not limited to:
Fever; Chills; Nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms; Fatigue; Hypotension; Respiratory distress; Tumor lysis syndrome; Cytokine release syndrome; Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia; Liver and kidney dysfunction; Other toxicities.</description>

    <description>Duration of in vivo survival of CAR-GPC3 T cells is defined as &quot;engraftment&quot;. The primary engraftment endpoint is the number of DNA vector copies per mL blood of CAR-GPC3 T cells at regular intervals through week 4 following the initial infusion. Q-PCR for CAR-GPC3 vector sequences will be performed until any 2 sequential tests are negative, documented as engraftment and persistence of CAR-GPC3 T cells.</description>
