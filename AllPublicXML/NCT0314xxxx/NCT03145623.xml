      Retrospective Efficacy and Safety Study With Elbasvir (EBR) 50 mg/Grazoprevir (GZR) 100 mg in
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-infected Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stage 4-5 During
      the French Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU) Program: Data From Real-life
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective : Retrospectively collect and describe the real life efficacy (SVR 12)* and
      safety data of EBR 50 mg/GZR 100 mg based therapy, 12 or 16 weeks dosed in HCV-infected
      patients with chronic kidney disease. These data are collected following French ATU
      allocation.
