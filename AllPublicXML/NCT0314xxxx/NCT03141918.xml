  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the many changes associated with the impact of HIV and the long-term use of
      antiretroviral therapy, metabolics are important because they are important risk factors for
      the development of cardiovascular diseases. The objective of the present study is to evaluate
      the effect of the supplementation of two bioactive compounds, curcumin and
      epigallocatechin-3-gallate, on the oxidation of resting energetic substrates in HIV / AIDS
      patients. The sample will be composed of adults living with HIV / AIDS on antiretroviral
      therapy for at least 6 months. Supplements will be made separately for 30 days and will be
      evaluated before and after the intervention the following parameters: body composition,
      energy metabolism, biochemical parameters and a structured anamnesis. Food consumption and
      the level of physical activity of the volunteers will be controlled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is characterized as a double-blind randomized clinical trial. Participants in the
      study will be adults living with HIV / AIDS who undergo regular clinical follow-up at some
      Specialized HIV / AIDS Care Service.

      The sample will consist of 20 volunteers, 10 in the experimental group (GE) and 10 in the
      control group (CG). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the groups by lottery by
      a researcher not participating in the study. The researcher responsible, as well as the
      volunteers, will not be aware of which participants are in the GE or the GC.

      The study will be carried out in the Movement Laboratory of the Physical Education Department
      of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.

    <description>The oxidation of energetic substrates evaluation at rest will be performed by indirect calorimetry, a gold standard method for the measurement of energy expenditure, making feasible through the breath by breath technique, weightings to quantify the Caloric expenditure from oxidation fats and carbohydrates. Evaluation will not offer any discomfort since the volunteer will lie flat without moving with a mask fixed on his face, which picks up the breathed and expired gases to be measured by the Respiratory Analyzer - Metalyzer 3B-MICROMED®.
To determine oxidation of energetic substrates, subjects will be instructed to sleep approximately for 8 hours the night before, to fast for 12 hours, not to exercise and not to drink caffeinated beverages or alcohol in the 24 hours before the test. Such care should be taken in order to reduce the influence of the thermal effect of food and physical activity on resting metabolism</description>
