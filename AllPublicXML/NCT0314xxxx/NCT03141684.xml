    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab works in treating patients with alveolar
      soft part sarcoma that has not been treated, has spread from where it started to other places
      in the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab,
      may allow the immune system cells to find and kill the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 of atezolizumab in patients with advanced alveolar soft part
      sarcoma (ASPS) in adult subjects &gt;= 18 years and in pediatric/adolescent subjects &gt;= 6 years.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine duration of response (DOR) using RECIST v 1.1 and/or change in clinical
      symptoms.

      II. Measure progression-free survival (PFS) time as determined by investigator using RECIST v
      1.1.

      III. Correlate response with expression of potential immune biomarkers in paired biopsies.

      IV. Compare RECIST v 1.1 versus (vs) immune RECIST (iRECIST) in patients with ASPS on
      atezolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 27-30 days.
