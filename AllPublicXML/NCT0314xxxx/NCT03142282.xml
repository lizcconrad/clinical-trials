  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized phase II trial of maintenance chemotherapy versus consolidative
      radiotherapy plus maintenance chemotherapy for patients with unresectable metastatic
      colorectal cancer (MCRC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to accrual on the trial, patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer will
      be treated with palliative chemotherapy. And patients who achieve a partial response or
      stable disease by imaging criteria will receive maintenance chemotherapy. In our study, these
      group patients will be randomized to maintenance chemotherapy or consolidative radiotherapy
      to all sites of disease (followed by maintenance chemotherapy at the medical oncologist's
      discretion). Choices of palliative and maintenance chemotherapy will be determined by the
      medical oncologist based on clinical appropriateness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have biopsy proven unresectable MCRC.

          2. Patients must have received induction chemotherapy for 3-6 months, and achieved stable
             disease or a partial response.

          3. Age ≥ 18 years

          4. Patients must have measurable disease at baseline.

          5. Patients can have up to only 5 discrete active extracranial lesions (≤3 in the liver
             and ≤3 in the lung) identified by position-emission tomography (PET) scan and also
             seen on correlative plain film, CT scan, or MRI within 8 weeks prior to the initiation
             of radiotherapy.

          6. Patients who previously received radiotherapy to the primary site will be ineligible
             if there is CT evidence of disease progression within the past 3 months.

          7. Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Scores (KPS) &gt;60
