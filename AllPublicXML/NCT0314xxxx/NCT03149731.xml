  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) functions in a manner similar to pulse oximetry, using the
      difference in absorptive qualities of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin to infrared light to quantify
      the percent saturation. There is also available evidence shows that tissue oximetry is
      sensitive and has a quicker response to physiological derangement, such as bradycardia, in
      preterm newborns. Additionally, it is demonstrated that reduced postoperative cerebral tissue
      oxygenation index variability in neonatal survivors of congenital heart disease surgery with
      poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. The SafeBoosC phase II randomized clinical trial
      hypothesizes that the burden of hypo- and hyperoxia can be reduced, and consequently the risk
      of brain injury, by the combined use of close monitoring of the cerebral rStO2 and an
      evidence-based treatment guideline to correct deviations in rStO2 outside a predefined target
      range. In this study, we will monitor 2 different tissue beds including cerebral and
      abdominal somatic tissue rStO2 and SpO2 in neonates. Further research is needed to
      investigate clinical implications for using this measure to drive therapeutic interventions.

    <description>Cerebral and abdominal tissue oxygen saturation was obtained using 4-wavelength (690, 780, 805 and 850nm) near-infrared spectroscopy (FORE-SIGHT, CAS Medical Systems, Branford, CT) with a transducer containing a fiber optic emitter and one detector located 25mm from the light source. A non-adhesive optode (FORE-SIGHT sensor kit small, CAS Medical Systems, Branford, CT) was placed on the left forehead and abdomen.</description>
