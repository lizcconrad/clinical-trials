  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Project PrEP-R intervention is a brief, theory based and culturally sensitive
      intervention designed to capitalize on organic yet underutilized social support networks in
      the lives of young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The intervention has been
      developed with input from clients and their support network members, case managers, social
      workers, primary care providers. The goal of the intervention is to improve retention in PrEP
      care for young Black MSM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project PrEP-R will recruit, consent and randomize 160 men, with 80 men randomized to each
      arm of the study. Men randomized to the control condition will receive standard PrEP care at
      each clinical site. Men randomized to the experimental condition will receive standard PrEP
      care and also will be asked to recruit a supportive contact from their social network. The
      support contact will then be engaged in a brief intervention designed to support their
      friend/family member around PrEP Care. Men and support contacts in the PrEP-R intervention
      also will receive booster sessions via telephone and text. All participants will complete
      surveys at baseline and at three and twelve months post intervention.
