  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study is to visualize biodistribution of a PET tracer called [18F]F-AraG
      (VisAcT) in cancer patients expected to undergo immunotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory Phase 1, prospective study assessing the biodistribution and radiation
      dosimetry of the Positron Emission Tomography [18F]FAraG (VisAcT) in cancer patients selected
      for immunotherapy. Each patient may have up to two [ 18F]FAraG PET imaging sessions, a
      baseline image and a post start of immunotherapy image. For each imaging session, patients
      will receive a single injection of [ 18F]FAraG and undergo up to four whole-body PET scans in
      the same day. Blood samples may be collected at up to 9 time points post-injection to analyze
      whole-blood/plasma time activity of [18F]FAraG. Following each imaging session, we will also
      assess safety in each subject. Blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, temperature, and
      respiratory count measurements as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) recording will be taken
      prior to imaging, and after whole-body PET scans are completed.
