      This is a pivotal, non-randomized, single arm, multi-center, prospective, non-significant
      risk study to evaluate the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled at up to six clinical research sites in the United States.
      Subjects will wear two Sensors of Three unique sensor lots. Each Sensor will have a paired
      Reader that will be given to the subject. All Readers will be masked during the study (i.e.
      subjects will not be able to view glucose results obtained from the Sensor on the Reader
      screen).

      Subjects will be asked to perform at least 8 capillary Blood Glucose (BG) tests per day using
      the primary Reader. Interstitial glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained with the
      corresponding Readers immediately following each BG test. Subjects will follow the same BG
      testing schedule during in-clinic visits. Subjects will be instructed to report any problems
      with the device.

      Subjects will make seven (7) scheduled visits to the clinical study site, including the
      Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit 1). Subjects will have four (4) in-clinic visits during
      which intravenous blood draws and YSI reference testing will occur. Each in-clinic visit is
      anticipated to last approximately 10 hours.

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject must have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

          -  Subject must require insulin therapy through an insulin pump and/or multiple daily
             insulin injections (at least 3 injections daily).

          -  Willing to perform a minimum of 8 finger sticks per day during the study.

          -  Subject must be willing to fast four individual times prior to in-clinic visits, each
             fast lasting a minimum of eight hours.

          -  Subject must be able to read and understand English.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the subject must be able to follow the instructions
             provided to him/her by the study site and perform all study tasks as specified by the
             protocol.

          -  Subject must be available to participate in all study visits.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to provide written signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is pregnant, attempting to conceive or not willing and able to practice birth
             control during the study duration (applicable to female subjects only).

          -  Subject has extensive skin changes/diseases at the proposed application sites that
             could interfere with device placement or the accuracy of interstitial glucose
             measurements. Such conditions include, but are not limited to extensive psoriasis,
             recent burns or severe sunburn, extensive eczema, extensive scarring, dermatitis
             herpetiformis, skin lesions, redness, infection or edema.
