  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular events, such as stroke, are a devastating complication of Fabry disease that
      results in part from storage of complex lipids in both large and small vessels. Understanding
      how the genotype influences the phenotype or clinical presentation can help us understand
      which patients are at risk for the complications of Fabry disease. This study aims to follow
      the natural history of this disease will help us understand and predict long-term outcomes
      for patients.

      This longitudinal study will be conducted at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). Subjects
      recruited for the study will have routine clinical care assessment with a complete physical
      and neurological exam and biochemical monitoring with venipuncture. In addition as part of
      the study, subjects will be given questionnaires to assess details of medical and
      psychosocial history, will complete self-reported measures of neuropsychological evaluation,
      pain scores, quality of life, executive functioning and cognitive functioning. All patients
      assessments will be repeated every 2 years.
