      Analysis of Gene expression and microbiome profiling in hidradenitis suppurativa to identify
      immunological biomarkers of disease activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A variety of molecular techniques can be used to investigate diseases by analyzing protein,
      DNA, and RNA. Flow cytometry, PCR, histology and immunohistochemistry are assays which can
      identify specific cell populations and provide valuable information regarding the pathologic
      characteristics of those populations. Flow cytometry analyzes the surface markers of cells.
      Histology and immunohistochemistry further characterize surface and cellular molecules and
      aid in the diagnosis of certain skin diseases. Gene expression profiling allows investigators
      to examine the genes detectable to determine the function of the cells involved, and PCR
      techniques are useful for the diagnosis of certain conditions and for DNA analysis.

      By procuring blood, skin tissue, and swab samples from patients with and without neoplastic
      and inflammatory skin disorders at the time of their appointments, the hypothesize that
      future translational research can be conducted on such specimens using the aforementioned
      techniques to further understand disease mechanisms in cutaneous disorders, and to
      potentially discover defective function and genetic mutations within cells from patients with
      neoplastic and inflammatory skin disorders. By establishing a tissue bank, we aim to lay the
      foundation for future work that will improve our understanding of the biology and natural
      history of neoplastic and inflammatory cutaneous diseases.
