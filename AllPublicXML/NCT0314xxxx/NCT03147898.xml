        Inclusion Criteria:

        An individual must fulfill all of the following criteria in order to be eligible for study
        enrollment:

        Toddler Cohort:

          -  Aged 15 to 24 months on the day of (V01)

          -  Has received 3 doses of a licensed pertussis-containing vaccine for a priming series
             during infancy in accordance with the recommendations of the NIP or his / her primary
             care physician

          -  Has written documentation (e.g., immunization record, physician's certificate,
             vaccination unit registry) available to verify the receipt of 3 doses of a licensed
             pertussis-containing infant vaccines as per national immunization schedule

          -  ICF has been signed and dated by the subject's parent(s) / legally acceptable
             representative(s) and, if required, an independent witness, in accordance with local
             regulations

          -  Planned receipt of routine pertussis booster vaccine, preferably, on same date as, and
             no more than 2 days following, V01

          -  Participant and parent / legally acceptable representative are able to attend all
             scheduled visits and to comply with all study procedures

        Preschooler Cohort:

          -  Aged 48 to 59 months on the date of V01

          -  Has received 4 doses of pertussis-containing combination vaccines as per national
             immunization schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

        An individual fulfilling any of the following criteria is to be excluded from study
        enrollment:

          -  Participation at the time of study enrollment or planned participation during the
             present study period in another clinical study investigating a vaccine, drug, medical
             device, or medical procedure

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the study or planned receipt of any
             vaccine (other than a booster pertussis vaccine) between V01 and V03a

          -  Receipt of immunoglobulins, blood, or blood-derived products in the past 3 months

          -  Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, or receipt of
             immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy,
             within the preceding 6 months, or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy
             (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks) within the preceding 3
             months

          -  History of clinically- or laboratory-confirmed pertussis as per the WHO recommended
             case definition

          -  Bleeding disorder, verbal report of thrombocytopenia, or receipt of anticoagulants in
             the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating venipuncture, in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might
             interfere with study conduct or completion

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (in the opinion of the investigator) or
             febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C) at physical examination on V01 of the study. A
             prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition has
             resolved or the febrile event has subsided.

          -  Receipt of oral or injected antibiotics therapy within the 72 hours preceding the
             first blood draw. (Topical antibiotics and antibiotic drops are not included in this
             exclusion criterion).

          -  Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or an employee with
             direct involvement in the proposed study
