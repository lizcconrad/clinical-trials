  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our study is to evaluate the use of a self-management application (&quot;app&quot;) that
      the investigators have developed to help facilitate self-management among individuals with
      SCI who live in the community. The main purpose is to create and fulfill individual
      self-management goals. Other purposes include improving self-management and health conditions
      related to SCI.

      During the initial phase, participants (SCI clinicians and patients with SCI) reported
      positive usage of the self-management app and all agreed it would benefit people with SCI.
      With the widespread use of portable electronic devices, an opportunity exists to help
      patients and informal caregivers on the journey from rehabilitation to integration back into
      the community. The investigators will use a randomized controlled trial (randomly putting
      participants into two groups), including both surveys and interviews. The study will involve
      the use of the app that focuses on the self-management of SCI, along with five to six
      in-person or telephone meetings over a three-month period.

      Our proposal is original in that it will be one of the few randomized control trials for
      e-health interventions for self-care management for those with SCI. The overall goals of the
      study is to develop an affordable self-management app that can be used to encourage
      self-management in people living with SCI. This app would be used along with other health
      problem specific apps that are more detailed and expensive, while helping participants to
      manage their long-term health problems related to their SCI in an easily usable and
      affordable form.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most people with spinal cord injury (SCI) will develop debilitating secondary conditions,
      such as autonomic dysreflexia and pressure ulcers. Self-management programs, which recognize
      patients' central role in managing their condition, have been found to improve
      health-outcomes in a variety of populations, such as those living with diabetes and asthma.
      Given the increase in health care costs and funding constraints, alternative self-management
      interventions are being explored, such as the use of electronic health (e-health) treatments.
      Despite the potential benefits of self-management among people with SCI, the investigators
      were able to identify little experimental research in this area.

      Our goal is to evaluate the efficacy of a broad-based self-management application (&quot;app&quot;) the
      investigators have developed to facilitate the improvement of self-management skills among
      community-dwelling individuals with SCI. The primary outcome is attainment of self-selected
      self-management goals. Secondary outcomes include general and self-management self-efficacy,
      secondary conditions related to SCI, self-reported healthcare utilization, self-reported
      health events, and app usage data.

      During the preliminary phase of the study, participants (SCI clinicians and patients with
      SCI) reported favourable usage of the self-management app and unanimously agreed it would
      benefit people with SCI. With the ubiquity of portable electronic devices, an opportunity
      exists to help participants and informal caregivers navigate the journey from rehabilitation
      to integration back into the community. The research team will use both quantitative and
      qualitative methods involving a rater-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a stepped
      wedge design and semi-structured interviews. The participant-specific intervention will
      involve the use of the self-management app focusing on the self-management of SCI accompanied
      by five to six in-person or telephone/Skype contacts that will occur over a three-month
      period.

      Our proposal is original in that it will be one of the few randomized controlled trials in
      the area of e-health interventions for self-care management for those with SCI. Although the
      use of qualitative and qualitative methods has been recommended in randomized controlled
      trials, relatively few studies have used this design, so the proposed study may provide a
      model for assessing the effectiveness of other self-management interventions. The overall
      purpose of the study is to develop an effective self-management application that can be used
      to promote self-management in a variety of populations and is less resource intensive. This
      app would be complementary to other complication specific apps that are more in-depth and
      expensive to deliver, while providing an accessible and affordable form of tertiary
      prevention for those who develop secondary complications.

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 months (baseline), 3 months after baseline, 6 months after baseline, and 9 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>GAS is a promising approach for evaluating psychosocial interventions in community settings. This measure will be used to identify self-management goals that participants want to achieve. Objective outcomes are identified that indicate degrees of attainment of participant-selected goals on a five-point scale ranging from -2 to +2, where -2 is a much worse than expected outcome, 0 represents attaining the goal (the anticipated outcome) and 2 means a much better than expected outcome, and then aggregate T-scores are calculated. The minimally clinically important change for GAS is 10, based on the linear T-score, which represents a change in score from the anticipated values.</description>

    <measure>Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 months (baseline), 3 months after baseline, 6 months after baseline, and 9 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is designed to evaluate confidence in managing long-term disease. It has been used extensively in many different populations including people with spinal cord injury to evaluate self-management interventions. Each of the 6-items are rated on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 indicating 'not at all confident' and 10 indicating 'totally confident') and an average score is calculated.</description>

    <measure>Spinal Cord Injury Secondary Conditions Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 months (baseline), 3 months after baseline, 6 months after baseline, and 9 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is one of two outcome measures that assesses self-efficacy. This scale targets secondary conditions related to spinal cord injury that have both direct and indirect impacts on health. The 16-item scale uses a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from 'no problem' to 'significant problem' with the total score ranging from 0-49.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Healthcare Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study, up until the end-point (9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Healthcare utilization will be measured by having participants record visits to see a physician, visits to hospital emergency departments, number of hospitalizations, and the number of nights spent in hospital. Although there may be recall issues within self-reported healthcare utilization, it has been found to be highly correlated with days in hospital (r=0.83) (17). Participants will complete a weekly journal to help improve the accuracy of the report.</description>

    <measure>Spinal Cord Independence Measure III</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 months (baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a disability scale developed to specifically address the ability of spinal cord injury patients to perform basic activities of daily living independently. It assesses three areas: 1) self-care (e.g., feeding, grooming, bathing, and dressing), 2) respiration and sphincter management, and 3) mobility (bed and transfers and indoor/outdoor). The item scores are weighted related to the assumed clinical relevance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 months (baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a clinical examination conducted to test whether sensation is 0-absent; 1-impaired; or 2-normal. Muscle function is rated from 0-total paralysis to 5-normal (active movement, full range of motion against significant resistance). Although the investigators will be unable to administer the measure as it requires significant and specialized training, a research team member will ask participants if they have been evaluated and what their motor and sensory impairment level is, if they know. This is included in the demographics form.</description>

    <measure>Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 months (baseline), 3 months after baseline, 6 months after baseline, and 9 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This list measures the perceptions of social support among individuals in the general population. It examines the ways in which others affect persons' responses to stressful events. It consists of a list of 40 statements concerning the perceived availability of potential social resources. The items are counterbalanced for desirability - half the items are positive statements about social relationships while the other half are negative statements. Items fall into four 10-item sub-scales: tangible support, appraisal support, self-esteem support, belonging support.</description>

    <measure>Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire-SCI</measure>
    <time_frame>At 0 months (baseline), 3 months after baseline, 6 months after baseline, and 9 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is an SCI-specific, self-report measure of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) that assesses minutes of mild, moderate, and heavy intensity LTPA performed over the previous 7 days. It is unique because it captures different types of LTPA performed at different intensities.</description>

Over the next month, there will be 2 follow-up contacts to review any questions/issues participants have. Participants can set additional goals during this time. Over the last 2 months, there will be monthly contacts to address the same issues.</description>
