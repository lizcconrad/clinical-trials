  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on new evidence renal dietitians in Ireland are revising the diet sheet that is used to
      teach patients about reducing blood phosphate. Changes that renal dietitians plan to make to
      the dietary phosphorus prescription

        -  Inclusion of some nuts and pulses

        -  More detailed education re phosphate additives

        -  More accurate protein prescription

        -  Inclusion of more whole grains

        -  Encouraging the use of foods with a low phosphorus to protein ratio

      The investigators want to test the two diet prescription to find out, which one is better at
      reducing blood phosphate and which one is more acceptable to patients. The investigators also
      want to make sure it is safe.

      Background:

      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) afflicts one in twenty Irish citizens who are over age 45 and is
      a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, premature death and significantly
      impacts healthcare utilisation. As kidney function deteriorates, phosphorus, upregulates
      counter regulatory hormones (immunoreactive Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH) and Fibroblast Growth
      Factor 23 (FGF23), the elevated levels of which are maladaptive. Collectively these
      abnormalities and their complications are referred to as Chronic Kidney Disease, Mineral &amp;
      Bone Disorder (CKD MBD). Hyperphosphataemia or high blood phosphate levels is associated with
      increased mortality, in dialysis patients, in the earlier stages of CKD and even in patients
      with normal renal function. The use of phosphorus restricted diets in combination with oral
      phosphate binders has become well established in the management of patients with CKD stages
      3-5 (including CKD stage 5D).

      Experts have called for research into the dietary management of phosphate in the CKD
      population. The current evidence base is weak and in a recent Cochrane systematic review the
      authors concluded that there was limited low quality evidence to indicate that dietary
      interventions may positively affect CKD-MBD.

      In recent years there has been increased focus on dietary phosphorus restriction in the
      management of CKD-MBD and a number of experts have suggested changes in how we manage dietary
      phosphorus. Several potential strategies have been suggested and in response the Renal
      Interest Group (RIG) of the Irish Nutrition &amp; Dietetic Institute (INDI) held a 1 day meeting
      in Dublin in January 2015 which brought together numerous experts in the field to summarise
      our current understanding and the recent advances in the field.

      Following on from this, RIG set up a working group to translate the new knowledge from the
      advanced study day and from further literature reviews into a modified low phosphate diet
      sheet.

      Almost all people who have end stage kidney disease (ESKD) and require dialysis to survive,
      follow a dietary phosphorus restriction, to control high blood phosphate, with the aim of
      reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, fractures and death.

      Research Hypothesis: The modified low phosphate diet sheet is superior to current treatment
      in haemodialysis patients

      Study Objectives

      Primary Objective: To determine if the modified low phosphorus dietary prescription is
      superior to current management in reducing serum phosphate levels in HD patients

      Secondary Objectives To determine if the modified low phosphorus diet is tolerable To
      determine if the modified low phosphorus diet is safe To determine if the modified low
      phosphorus diet brings the renal diet closer to healthy eating advice e.g. increased fibre
      intake.

    <masking_description>As with most education based interventions compared to routine care it is difficult to reliably mask either the subjects or the investigators to the proposed intervention. We will attempt to blind patients referring only to the diets as diet A and diet B and avoiding the use of terminology such as old and new. We will reprint the dietary information for both arms so they do not resemble current illustrated formats.</masking_description>

    <description>Routine / Standard Care: Routine dietary intervention is currently provided by one-to-one counselling to the subject and his/her relevant family members or carers, by a state registered dietitian regarding a diet which provides &lt;15mg Phosphorus /g Protein (over the day). This is equivalent to approximately 1000mg P / day. This is based on the 'Eating Well with Kidney Disease' dietsheet produced by the Renal Interest Group (RIG) of the Irish Nutrition &amp; Dietetic Institute (INDI) in 2010 and includes following main components:
Restricting protein intake to requirements (1-1.2g/kg Ideal Body Weight)
Restricting dairy intake (1-1.5 portions per day)
Avoiding foods high in phosphate
Avoiding foods with phosphate additives</description>

    <description>Modified Low Phosphorus Diet Prescription: The new prescription recommends five changes to current management
Introduction of some plant protein in the form of pulses and nuts where the phosphorus is largely bound by phytate
Increased focus on avoiding additives
Introduction of more whole grains e.g. wholemeal sliced pan/ pasta/rice .
Avoiding over-prescription of protein which carries an obligatory phosphorus load.
Focus on high protein foods with a low phosphorus to protein ratio</description>
