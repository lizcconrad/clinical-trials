  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are seeking to study whether or not there is benefit in keeping patients flat
      after Angioseal for extended periods of time after diagnostic heart catheterization or if a
      more aggressive approach of early ambulation would be just as safe while improving cost and
      patient comfort.

    <textblock>
      Diagnostic left heart catheterization is the gold standard to assess coronary anatomy. A
      number of post procedure closure devices have been used in order to be able to ambulate
      patients after the procedure. Without closure device of the arterial sheath the typical time
      a patient must lay flat following a diagnostic left heart catheterization at Providence
      hospital is approximately six hours. This extended time of having to lie flat for the patient
      is both uncomfortable and time consuming for hospital employees.

      The Angioseal closure device is a vascular plug that has been approved by the FDA in order to
      seal the femoral artery arteriotomy and allow for a faster ambulation time after cardiac
      catheterization. Currently, the Angioseal device has been approved for ambulation times of 20
      minutes after diagnostic left heart catheterization but a more conservative approach is
      typically used after device. A very common strategy after Angioseal is to keep the patient
      flat for 2 hours prior to ambulation and then to keep the patient another hour after
      ambulation for observation of the femoral site.

      While a conservative strategy may be considered safer to the operator the Angioseal device
      has already been approved for an early ambulation strategy. The goal of this study is to
      reaffirm the safety and efficacy of using Angioseal for early ambulation. If early ambulation
      is performed it could improve patient comfort and even reduce cost.
