    <description>Hepatic embolization will occur on Day 0 of the study for all cohorts. On the day of the procedure, baseline angiography including celiac and superior mesenteric angiography will be performed to delineate arterial anatomy and blood supply to the tumor. After the entire dose has been used, the embolized vessels will be re-catheterized and embolized to stasis with Bead Block beginning with 100-300 micron spheres and using a maximum of 10 cc of any given size per vessel before moving to the next size microsphere.</description>

In cohort 1, participants will begin nivolumab two weeks (+/- 5 days) after deb-TACE every two weeks. In cohort 2, participants will begin nivolumab every 2 weeks for 1 year and undergo deb-TACE 4 weeks after the initiation of nivolumab (+/- 5 day). Nivolumab will not be dosed on the day of embolization in this cohort. In cohort 3, nivolumab will be dosed every two weeks starting 4 weeks (+/- 5 days) prior to deb-TACE and continue every 2 weeks for up to one year. Nivolumab will be dosed on the day of embolization in this cohort. It will be administered before the deb-TACE procedure.</description>
