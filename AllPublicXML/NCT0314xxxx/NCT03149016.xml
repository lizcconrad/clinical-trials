    <textblock>
      We aim to assess the treatment outcomes following upper incisors retraction accelerated by
      corticotomy procedure. So, we intend to randomize orthodontic patients with class II division
      I malocclusion into two groups: experimental group and control group. Both groups will start
      orthodontic treatment. Once a 0.019*0.025-inch stainless steel wire is fully engaged to the
      brackets, 1st premolars will be extracted. Canines will be retracted in the conventional
      manner. Then, the actual evaluation period starts when the upper incisors are retracted using
      two different methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last three decades, the number of adult patients seeking short orthodontic treatment
      time has apparently increased as the conventional orthodontic treatment usually lasts for
      20-24 months. Furthermore, orthodontic treatment is often associated with root resorption,
      bone degradation and caries development. Patients nowadays desire to end the orthodontic
      treatment as soon as possible due to phsycosocial reasons and to get the goals of the
      treatment without affecting their social life .

      So many tooth movement accelerating methods have been proposed. However, the surgical
      approached are considered the most effective and promising methods in accelerating tooth
      movement. The current research aims to evaluate the efficacy of the a new proposed surgical
      method compared to the conventional method in upper incisors' retraction.

    <measure>Anchorage loss</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured one day following the completion of retraction of the upper four incisors using plaster study models and is expected to be within 2 months in the accelerated group and 4 months in the control group</time_frame>
    <description>the amount of anchorage loss (in mm), which is the distance from a perpendicular line to the midpalatal suture and extends between central fossa of both upper first molars to the third palatal rugae . These measurements are made on plaster study models.</description>

    <measure>Root resorption</measure>
    <time_frame>An panoramic image will be taken at T1: one day before the commencement of incisor retraction and T2: one day following the completion of retraction and is expected to be within 2 months in the accelerated group and 4 months in the control group</time_frame>
    <description>This variable is related to the amount of incisor root resorption after treatment in both groups. This is measured on a panoramic image. The amount of root resorption = the length of an incisor after retraction subtracted from the length of an incisor before retraction. Two radiogrpahs are needed.</description>
