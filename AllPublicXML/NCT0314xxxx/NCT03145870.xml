  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant hemopathies, such as solid cancers, increase the risk of venous and arterial
      thromboembolic events. The incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolic events is
      particularly high in myeloma, linked to the usual risk factors for venous thromboembolic
      disease, biological risk factors specific to myeloma, and especially to its treatments.

      The prevalence of asymptomatic venous thromboembolic events and arterial events are not known
      to date and remain important data for planning a possible randomized study to determine the
      most suitable thromboprophylaxis in these patients.
