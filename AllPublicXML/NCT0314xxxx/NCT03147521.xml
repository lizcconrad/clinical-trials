    <textblock>
      Accidental falls represents an elderly very important health problem, both in the community
      and within the hospital. The aim of this research project is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      accidental falls prevention care bundle in geriatrics, internal medicine, post acute, and
      rehabilitation wards, in terms of incidence and outcome reduction. It will be also
      investigated the cost effectiveness ratio, in terms of falls avoided, care bundle
      implementation costs, and falls related healthcare costs. The study will permit to evaluate
      the implementation feasibleness in time, considering the study will last for 20 months.

    <description>Risk fall assessment at hospital admission with Conley scale or with findings of specific risk characteristics (previous falls, cognitive impairment, neuropsychological damage, increased need to go to the bathroom for increased evacuative needs, neuroleptic or cardiovascular drugs assumption); if risk is found shear the information with the team, writing it in patient chart, and positioning a specific symbol on patient bed. Inform patient and family about fall risk and ask, if possible, a continuous caregiver presence. Universal strategy application for the environmental safety and patient safety. Periodic assessment of drugs therapy, with the aim of reduce those that acts on central nervous system and cardiovascular system. If patient is at risk and alone, verify each 2 hours the need to go to the bathroom, change position or drink.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with ≥ 75 years of age with or without documented fall risk and patients with
             &lt; 75 years of age, but ≥ 18, only at documented fall risk, admitted at participant
             wards. The risk assessment will be performed with Conley scale and/or on the base of
             some specific fall risk characteristics (previous falls, cognitive impairment,
             neuropsychological damage, increased need to go to the bathroom for increased
             evacuative needs, neuroleptic or cardiovascular drugs assumption);

             their consent to the study participation .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients or legal guardian that don't give their consent to study participation.
