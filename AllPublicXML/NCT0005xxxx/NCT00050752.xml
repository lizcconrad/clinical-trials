    <textblock>
      This study will investigate what causes hereditary leiomyomatosis renal (kidney) cell cancer,
      or HLRCC, and how the disease is related to the development of kidney tumors. Leiomyomas are
      benign (non-cancerous) tumors arising from smooth muscle. HLRCC can cause various health
      problems. Some people develop red bumps on their skin that can be painful at times. Some
      women with HLRCC can develop leiomyomas of the uterus. In some families, people with HLRCC
      develop kidney tumors. This study will try to determine:

        -  What gene changes (mutations) cause HLRCC

        -  What kind of kidney tumors develop in HLRCC and how they grow

        -  What the chance is that a person with HLRCC will develop a kidney tumor

      People with known or suspected HLRCC (and their family members of any age) may be eligible
      for this study. This includes people in families in which one or more members has skin
      leiomyoma and kidney cancer; skin leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma; multiple skin leiomyomas;
      kidney cancer and uterine leiomyomas, or kidney cancer consistent with HLRCC, including, but
      not limited to, collecting duct or papillary, type II. Candidates will be screened with a
      physical examination, family history, and, for affected family members, a review of medical
      records, including pathology slides and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans.

      Participants will undergo tests and procedures that may include the following:

        -  Review of medical records, x-rays, and tissue slides

        -  Physical examination and family history

        -  Skin examination

        -  Gynecological examination for women

        -  Interviews with a cancer doctor, cancer nurses, kidney surgeon, and genetic counselor

        -  Blood tests for:

             1. Genetic research to identify the gene responsible for HLRCC

             2. Evaluation of liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, and thyroid function

             3. Complete blood count and clotting profile

             4. Pregnancy test for pre-menopausal women

             5. PSA test for prostate cancer in men over age 40

        -  CT or MRI scans (for participants 15 years of age and older only)

        -  Skin biopsy (surgical removal of a small sample of skin tissue)

        -  Cheek swab or mouth rinse to collect cells for genetic analysis

        -  Medical photographs of lesions

        -  Questionnaire

      When the tests are completed, participants will discuss the results with a doctor and
      possibly a genetic nurse or genetic counselor. The genetic findings will not be revealed to
      participants because their meaning and implications may not yet be understood. Participants
      may be asked to return to NIH from every 3 months to every 3 years, depending on their
      condition, for follow-up examinations and tests.

      Background:

        -  Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC) is a rare autosomal dominantly
           inherited disorder which confers susceptibility to develop cutaneous and uterine
           leiomyomas and renal cell carcinoma.

        -  HLRCC is caused by mutations in the Krebs cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase localized on
           chromosome 1q42.3-q43.

      Objectives:

        -  Define the risk of developing renal cancer, cutaneous leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma in
           this hereditary cancer syndrome

        -  Define the types and characteristics (including patterns of growth) of renal cancer
           associated with HLRCC.

        -  Determine the incidence and characteristics of HLRCC-associated fumarate hydratase gene
           mutations.

        -  Determine genotype/phenotype correlations.

        -  Determine if other genes caused HLRCC.

      Eligibility:

      -An individual from a family in which one or more family members have:

        -  Cutaneous leiomyoma and kidney cancer.

        -  Cutaneous leiomyoma and uterine leiomyoma.

        -  Multiple cutaneous leiomyoma.

        -  Kidney cancer and uterine leiomyomata.

        -  Renal tumor histology consistent with HLRCC including, but not limited to: Collecting
           Duct and/ or Papillary, Type II.

      Design:

        -  These rare families will be recruited to genetically confirm diagnosis, determine size
           and location of renal tumors, size at presentation, growth rate and metastatic potential
           of renal tumors.

        -  Genetic testing will be offered to gain appreciation of the effect of mutations on the
           relative activity of various germline and somatic mutations.

        -  We will determine if there is a relationship between mutation and disease phenotype.
