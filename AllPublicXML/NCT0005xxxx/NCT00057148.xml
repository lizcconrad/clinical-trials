      Postoperative pain is often undertreated. Although studies have demonstrated that many
      patients experience a substantial degree of unrelieved pain following operative procedures
      and that this pain can increase the incidence of serious complications, the management of
      discomfort continues to be suboptimal. Narcotic analgesia is the mainstay of acute
      postoperative pain management but patient, clinician, and institutional barriers often limit
      the effectiveness of drug treatment. Furthermore, pharmacologic interventions alone may not
      address all the factors involved in the conscious experience of pain. Massage is a
      complementary or adjunctive medical technique that has been used for thousands of years. Yet
      there is scant research related to the use of massage therapy in postoperative pain
      management. Used in tandem with pharmacologic treatments, massage may have the potential to
      substantially improve acute pain relief.

      BACKGROUND / RATIONALE:

      Postoperative pain is often undertreated. Although studies have demonstrated that many
      patients experience a substantial degree of unrelieved pain following operative procedures
      and that this pain can increase the incidence of serious complications, the management of
      discomfort continues to be suboptimal. Narcotic analgesia is the mainstay of acute
      postoperative pain management but patient, clinician, and institutional barriers often limit
      the effectiveness of drug treatment. Furthermore, pharmacologic interventions alone may not
      address all the factors involved in the conscious experience of pain. Massage is a
      complementary or adjunctive medical technique that has been used for thousands of years. Yet
      there is scant research related to the use of massage therapy in postoperative pain
      management. Used in tandem with pharmacologic treatments, massage may have the potential to
      substantially improve acute pain relief.

      OBJECTIVE(S):

      The proposed research will test the hypotheses that: 1) perceived post-operative pain and
      anxiety decrease over time (5 days) more rapidly in the massage group compared with the
      focused attention and routine care groups; 2) perceived post-operative pain and anxiety are
      immediately reduced in the massage group compared with the focused attention and routine care
      groups. (differences in pre/post daily scores); 3) post-operative complication rate is
      reduced and function is improved by the adjuvant use of massage compared to the control
      groups; 4) the adjuvant use of massage reduces postoperative length of stay and cost of care;
      and 5) patient satisfaction with postoperative pain relief is enhanced by the adjuvant use of
      massage.

      METHODS:

      The study is a prospective, randomized clinical trial conducted at the Ann Arbor and
      Indianapolis VA medical centers. Patients undergoing operative procedures involving either a
      sternotomy or an abdominal incision at least 8 cm in length will be randomly assigned to one
      of three parallel treatment groups: 1) routine postoperative care, 2) focused attention where
      a massage therapist spends dedicated time (but no massage is given) with the patient once a
      day (20 min) during post-operative days 1 through 5; or 3) effleurage massage (20 min)
      performed by a massage therapist once per day on post-op days 1 through 5. The anticipated
      sample size is 582 patients. Postoperatively patients will be asked to rate their intensity
      of pain, well-being, function (ability to cough, deep breathe, sleep and activity level)
      daily for up to five days (less if discharged prior to day five). Data will be collected on
      all aspects of narcotic analgesia use including the name of each drug, dose, route, and time
      of administration. On day six patients will complete a survey to assess their satisfaction
      with pain management. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs National Surgical Quality
      Improvement Program (NSQIP) format, data will be collected on postoperative complications
      during the first 30 days after the procedure. Other factors relevant to the veteran
      population that may affect pain control will be assessed in relationship to pain management.

      STATUS:

      This study began in September 2002. We are currently in the data analysis phase of the
      project and plan to be finished by December, 2005.

      IMPACT:

      Although pharmacologic agents have the ability to effectively limit pain, acute postoperative
      pain is often poorly managed with analgesic drugs alone. This study will be the first
      large-scale randomized clinical trial of massage as a complementary treatment in the
      management of acute postoperative pain. This study will help to determine if massage can
      serve as a useful adjuvant therapy in the management of acute postoperative incisional pain.
      Results from this study would inform pain management guidelines and allow the VA and the
      scientific community to make informed decisions regarding the potential benefits of one form
      of CAM (Complimentary and Alternative Medicine).
