  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine tissue from gliomas (a type of brain tumor) removed during surgery
      for gene mutations, or changes, thought to be involved in tumor formation and growth. One
      common gene mutation causes the receptor for a protein called epidermal growth factor (EGF)
      to be in an active state all of the time, allowing uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to
      tumor formation. This study will analyze blood and tumor tissue samples from patients with
      gliomas for:

        -  Changes in the EGF gene in the tumor

        -  Changes in other genes, such as that for the EGF receptor (EGFR)

        -  Changes in levels of EGF and EGFR, and in other proteins and genes that respond to
           changes in the levels of these proteins in the tumor

        -  Changes in the EGF gene and protein in the blood

      The study will also determine if production of EGF and EGFR obtained from glioma and from
      blood cells derived from the tumor can be altered in the laboratory to grow indefinitely in
      culture.

      Patients between 18 and 75 years of age with a brain tumor that requires surgical treatment
      may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for about 3 to 10 days. They will
      have a physical and neurological examination, blood and urine tests, other tests, if
      medically necessary, and will be evaluated and prepared for surgery. During surgery, as much
      of the tumor as possible will be removed. A small amount of the tumor tissue will be
      collected for this study. No tissue will be removed for this study that would not otherwise
      have been removed. Some of the tissue will be used to culture glioma cells and the rest will
      be frozen and stored for examination, as described above. If any normal-appearing brain
      tissue is removed during surgery in order to enhance safety in removing the tumor, the normal
      tissue will be studied as well. Brain tissue that appears normal will not be removed strictly
      for research.

      During surgery and the day after surgery, a blood sample will be drawn from a catheter
      (plastic tube) that was placed in an artery or vein for surgery. If catheters are no longer
      in place, blood will be drawn through a needle in a vein.

      The epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important biological mediator of normal growth and
      repair and is critical to epithelial tissue development and maturation of the central nervous
      system, among other functions. EGF is a natural focus of interest in cancer research because
      of its influence over mitogenesis, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. In addition, unregulated
      expression of its receptor, EGFR, has been identified as a common event in neoplastic
      transformation. In patients with the most malignant primary tumor of the brain, the
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), alterations in the EGFR or in its expression levels have been
      identified in approximately 50% of patients. We postulate that EGF-EGFR interactions may be
      important for the development, progression, and prognosis of human gliomas and that
      alterations of the EGF gene may predict the potential for glioma progression and the severity
      of disease.

      Patients suspected of having, or with prior biopsy proof of, a WHO grade II-IV central
      nervous system (CNS) glial tumor(s) seen in the Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, will be
      considered for entry into this study. Tissue samples of tumor resected as part of standard
      care will be collected at surgery and preserved for research. Blood samples will also be
      collected. Blood will also be collected from anonymous normal volunteers who donate blood at
      the NIH Blood Bank; these anonymous donors will serve as controls.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Radiographic evidence of a primary glial neoplasm of the CNS (WHO grade II-IV) or any
        patient with known primary neoplasms of the CNS.

        Medically indicated diagnostic and/or therapeutic tumor resection.

        Informed consent from patient, age 18 or older to 75 years of age.

        Females of child-bearing capacity: Pregnant women will be entered into the study for tumor
        collection, but blood will not be drawn at the time of surgery. Six weeks or more after the
        completion of pregnancy, these women will be contacted and 10cc (2 tsp) of blood will be
        collected for genotyping.

        No racial or ethnic group or gender is excluded.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inability to provide informed consent prior to surgery.

        Medical conditions that cannot be corrected prior to surgery that would be standard
        contraindications for neurosurgery.
