        Disease Characteristics:

          -  Patients with a documented histologic or cytologic diagnosis of B-cell NHL.

          -  Patients who have failed at least one regimen of chemotherapy and are not eligible for
             any alternate therapies of higher therapeutic priority.

          -  Patients with at least one measurable tumor site &gt; 1.5 cm in at least one dimension.

        Prior/Concurrent Therapy:

          -  Chemotherapy: Patients must have failed standard therapy or are not eligible for any
             alternate therapies of higher therapeutic priority.

          -  Biologic Therapy: Patients who have received human or humanized monoclonal antibodies
             will be eligible provided pre-study evaluations demonstrate no significant reactivity
             with hLL2 IgG (i.e., HAHA).

          -  Radiotherapy: No prior radiation therapy to &gt;25% of the bone marrow. No prior
             radiation to maximal tolerable levels for any critical organ (e.g., 2,000 cGy for the
             lungs and kidneys). Patients who have had whole pelvic irradiation are not eligible.

        Patient Characteristics/Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age Range: Male or Female at least 18 years of age

          -  Performance Status: Patients with a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60% (or equivalent,
             ECOG 0-2) and expected survival of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Hematopoietic: Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL; ANC &gt; 1.5x10^9/L; Platelets &gt; 100x10^9/L;

          -  Hepatic: Serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL; AST and ALT &lt; 2 x ULN w/o liver metastases or &lt;5
             x ULN w/liver metastases

          -  Renal: Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Cardiovascular: Patients with LVEF &gt;/= 50% by MUGA or 2D-ECHO.

          -  Pulmonary: Patients with DFCO and FEV1 &gt;/= 60% by required Pulmonary Function Tests.

          -  Other: Patients agreeing to use a medically effective method of contraception while
             enrolled in the study. A pregnancy test will be performed on each premenopausal female
             of childbearing potential immediately prior to entry into the study. Patients able to
             understand and give written informed consent.
