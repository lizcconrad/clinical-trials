        Inclusion Criteria:

             Western Blot).

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Plasma HIV viral load less than 10,000 copies/ml (by bDNA assay or less than 14,000
             copies/ml by RT-PCR) on at least 2 occasions within 8 weeks prior to study entry with
             no more than a 0.5 log increase between the most recent and the earlier viral load
             measurements.

          -  CD4 + T-cell count greater than or equal to 200/mm(3) on at least 2 occasions within 8
             weeks of study entry.

          -  On a stable HAART regimen for greater than or equal to 8 weeks.

          -  Karnofsky Score greater than or equal to 80.

          -  Written informed consent. Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with IL-2 or an IL-2 analogue.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding. - Use of any known immunomodulators, cytokines, growth
             factors or systemic corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone greater than or equal to 15
             mg/day or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  History of an AIDS defining illness by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
             definition within 8 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Acute bacterial or viral infection within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Received an immunization within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Received an investigational drug in the past 30 days other than Food and Drug
             Administration (FDA) sanctioned treatment IND antiretroviral agents.

          -  Renal insufficiency with a serum creatinine level greater than 1.5 times the upper
             limit of normal.

          -  Bone marrow suppression as defined by one or more of the following: granulocyte count
             less than 1,000 cells/ÂµL; hemoglobin less than 9.0g (females) or less than 9.5g
             (males); or platelet count less than 75,000 cells/ÂµL.

          -  Evidence of hepatic disease indicated by one or more of the following: SGOT (AST)
             and/or SGPT (ALT) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal. Bilirubin greater
             than 2 times the upper limit of normal (except for patients with known Gilbert's
             syndrome or those receiving indinavir who may be enrolled if the serum bilirubin is
             less than or equal to 5 times the upper limit of normal).

             systemic nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers, and afterload reducers
             including ACE inhibitors. Patients requiring any of these medications solely for the
             treatment of hypertension remain eligible for the study.

          -  Presence of significant cardiac insufficiency (greater than or equal to New York Heart

             seriously compromise the subject's ability to adhere with the demands of the study.

          -  Any central nervous system (CNS) disease that requires active treatment with
             anticonvulsants.

          -  Use of an antimetabolite such as hydroxyurea within 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Known co-infection with Hepatitis B or C virus unless serum transaminases are less
             than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal on at least two occasions within 8
             weeks prior to study entry.
