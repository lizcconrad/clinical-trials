    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how tumors in patients with colorectal carcinoma
      respond to treatment with VELCADE alone versus VELCADE given with irinotecan, and also to see
      what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your cancer.

      In this study, patients with colorectal cancer that is no longer responding to standard
      medical treatment with irinotecan or an irinotecan containing treatment will be randomized to
      treatment with VELCADE alone or to treatment with VELCADE in combination with irinotecan.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that

             future medical care.

          -  Patient is, in the investigator's opinion, willing and able to comply with the

             Toxicity Criteria (CTC):

               -  Grade 2: Objective sensory loss or paresthesia (including tingling), interfering
                  with function, but not interfering with activities of daily living (ADL).

             the following laboratory values:

               -  Platelet count ≤ 100,000 x 109/L

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥ 3 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN)

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥ 3 times ULN

               -  Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times ULN, unless clearly related to the disease

               -  Calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/minute.

          -  Patient has had a myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment or has New York
             Hospital Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any
             electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the
             investigator as not medically relevant.

             drug-related toxicity.

          -  Patient is known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Patients assessed
             by the investigator to be at risk for HIV infection should be tested in accordance

          -  Patient is known to be hepatitis B surface antigen-positive or has known active
             hepatitis C infection. Patients assessed by the investigator to be at risk for
             hepatitis B or C infection should be tested in accordance with local regulations.

          -  Patient has poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or another serious
             medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially

          -  Female patient is pregnant or breast-feeding. Confirmation that the patient is not
             pregnant must be established by a negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin
             (β-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during the Screening period. Pregnancy testing
