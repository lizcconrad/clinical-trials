  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether adding the drug risperidone (Risperdal®) is more effective
      than placebo in treating schizophrenic patients who are taking the drug clozapine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clozapine is the only antipsychotic drug that has been approved for treatment resistant
      patients with schizophrenia. However, up to 50% of patients treated with clozapine fail to
      respond and continue to exhibit clinically significant residual positive and negative
      symptoms and cognitive impairments. An emerging trend in treatment is the addition of a
      second antipsychotic drug. This study will determine if risperidone when given as adjunctive
      treatment is more effective than placebo in treating schizophrenic patients failing clozapine
      therapy.

      Participants are randomly assigned to add either adjunctive risperidone or placebo to their
      current clozapine treatment in a single, daily dose for 16 weeks. Positive and negative
      symptoms, cognitive impairments, side effects of the treatment, anxiety, depression,
      hostility symptoms, and quality of life are assessed. Neurological tests, self administered
      questionnaires, and interviews are used to assess patients.

    <measure>Positive Symptom Item Scores by Week and Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every two weeks for 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) positive symptom items are: conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, unusual thought content, and suspiciousness. The total score is calculated by adding the scores for each item. Each scale ranges from &quot;1=Not Present&quot; to &quot;7=Very Severe&quot;. The minimum score is 4 and the maximum score is 28. A higher score indicates a more severe positive symptom rating. A mixed model for unbalanced repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), in which follow-up symptom score = baseline symptom score + treatment + week + treatment x week, and week is treated as a categorical, rather than a continuous measure. The treatment term estimates the average across weeks of the week-specific group differences, and is used as the main test for treatment effects on symptom change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological Testing - Overall Composite Z-score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The neuropsychological testing measured attention, executive function/problem solving, motor speed, processing speed/response generation, and verbal, visual, and working memory. The individual test raw scores were converted to z-scores and an overall composite z-score was computed from the average of the individual test z-scores. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations up to +3 standard deviations. Higher scores indicate better test performance.</description>

    <measure>Negative Symptom Total Score by Week and Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every two weeks for 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) total score, minus the global items, inappropriate affect, poverty of content of speech, and attention items, used to measure negative symptoms. SANS total score range = 0-85. Higher scores indicate more severe negative symptoms. A mixed model for unbalanced repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), in which follow-up symptom score = baseline symptom score + treatment + week + treatment x week, and week is treated as a categorical, rather than a continuous measure. The treatment term estimates the average across weeks of the week-specific group differences, and is used as the main test for treatment effects on symptom change.</description>

          <title>Positive Symptom Item Scores by Week and Treatment Group</title>
          <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) positive symptom items are: conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, unusual thought content, and suspiciousness. The total score is calculated by adding the scores for each item. Each scale ranges from &quot;1=Not Present&quot; to &quot;7=Very Severe&quot;. The minimum score is 4 and the maximum score is 28. A higher score indicates a more severe positive symptom rating. A mixed model for unbalanced repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), in which follow-up symptom score = baseline symptom score + treatment + week + treatment x week, and week is treated as a categorical, rather than a continuous measure. The treatment term estimates the average across weeks of the week-specific group differences, and is used as the main test for treatment effects on symptom change.</description>
          <population>The intent to treat analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of study medication and completed the BPRS rating at the specified week.</population>

Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations up to +3 standard deviations. Higher scores indicate better test performance.</description>
