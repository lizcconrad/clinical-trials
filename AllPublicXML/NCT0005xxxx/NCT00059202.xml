  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of high dose ursodiol versus placebo for
      patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The average duration of follow-up will be
      approximately five years with important clinical endpoints such as death, eligibility for
      liver transplantation, changes in histology and cholangiogram as well as liver biochemistries
      and quality of life data collected.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To complete the evaluation of the effects of urso at a dose of 28-30 mg/kg/day on time to the development of cirrhosis, varices, cholangiocarcinoma, meeting minimal listing criteria for liver transplantation, or death in patients with PSC.</measure>

        -  Chronic cholestatic disease of at least six months' duration.

          -  Serum alkaline phosphatase at least 1 Â½ times the upper limits of normal.

          -  Retrograde, operative, percutaneous, or magnetic resonance cholangiography
             demonstrating intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary duct obstruction, beading, or
             narrowing consistent with PSC within one year of the study entry.

          -  Liver biopsy in the previous one year which is available for review and compatible
             with the diagnosis of PSC. Compatible biopsy features include fibrous cholangitis,
             ductopenia with periportal inflammation and biliary fibrosis.
