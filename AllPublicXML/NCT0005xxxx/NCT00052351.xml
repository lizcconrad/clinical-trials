    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may make the body build an immune
      response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase
      the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim and chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus
      sargramostim and combination chemotherapy in treating women who have undergone surgery for
      stage II or stage III breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the immunological effects of 2 different schedules of vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM
           vaccine, fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM vaccine, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) administered with
           standard adjuvant chemotherapy in women with high-risk stage II or III breast cancer.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of obtaining determinations of CD4 response in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM: Beginning 2-3 weeks after surgery and before initiation of standard
           adjuvant chemotherapy, all patients receive vaccinia-CEA-TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously
           (SC) on day 1 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4 of week 1.

        -  Fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM: Patients are treated on 1 of the following schedules:

             -  Arm I: During chemotherapy, patients receive fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM vaccine SC on day 1
                and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4 of weeks 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, and 23. After
                chemotherapy, patients receive additional vaccinations on weeks 26, 38, and 50.

             -  Arm II: Prior to chemotherapy, patients receive fowlpox-CEA-TRICOM vaccine SC on
                day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4 of week 2. After chemotherapy, patients receive
                additional vaccinations on weeks 26, 38, and 50.

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-7 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV
           over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients then receive paclitaxel IV
           over 3 hours on day 1 of weeks 15, 18, 21, and 24. Treatment continues in the absence of
           disease progression (after at least 1 course of chemotherapy) or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy during weeks 26-32 in the absence of disease
           progression.

      Patients with hormone-receptor positive tumors receive oral tamoxifen for 5 years beginning
      on approximately week 32.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 (14 per treatment arm) patients will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
