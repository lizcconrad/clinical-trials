      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to
      light to kill cancer cells. Combining photodynamic therapy with surgery may be an effective
      treatment for malignant mesothelioma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining photodynamic therapy with
      surgery in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of adjuvant photodynamic therapy with large diffuser fibers in
           patients with malignant mesothelioma undergoing surgery.

        -  Compare results of this regimen in these patients to historical controls.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive porfimer sodium IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo pleurectomy
      or pleuropneumonectomy followed by intracavitary photodynamic therapy on day 3.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
