      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known if one regimen will require patients to spend more time in the hospital than the
      other regimen for treatment of chemotherapy-related side effects.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the hospitalization rates of patients who are
      receiving gemcitabine combined with cisplatin with that of patients receiving gemcitabine
      combined with carboplatin for unresectable stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the rates of overnight hospitalization due to toxicity (e.g., blood transfusion,
           antibiotic use, and to obtain relief of treatment-related symptoms) of patients with
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine and cisplatin vs gemcitabine and
           carboplatin.

        -  Compare the need for hospitalization for chemotherapy administration in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the tumor response rate of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the relief of tumor-related symptoms in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the effect on Karnofsky performance status in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage
      (IIIA vs IIIB [dry] vs IIIB [wet] or IV) and performance status (50-60% vs 70-100%). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours
           on days 1 and 8.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin
           IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months and then every 3-4 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
