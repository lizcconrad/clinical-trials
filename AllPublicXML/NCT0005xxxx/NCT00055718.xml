      RATIONALE: Silymarin (milk thistle extract) is an herb that may be effective in treating
      liver disorders caused by cancer therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of silymarin in treating
      patients who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia with chemotherapy-related side effects to the
      liver.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of silymarin, in terms of liver function tests, in patients with
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving hepatotoxic chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on free and conjugated serum silibinin values in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the serum antioxidant capacity by Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the oxidative damage, as determined by 8-oxodeoxyguanosine adducts, in
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral silymarin daily for 28 days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at day 56.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
