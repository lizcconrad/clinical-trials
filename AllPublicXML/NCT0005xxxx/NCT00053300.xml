      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who
      have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer that has responded to previous chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of thalidomide on time to disease progression and survival in
           patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer who achieve a complete or partial
           response to induction chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide daily beginning 3-4 weeks after completion of induction
      chemotherapy. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      18 months.
