      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of deep brain stimulation in the the
      globus pallidus (Gpi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) on motor, neuropsychological and
      psychiatric function, and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical therapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      After several years of drug therapy, however, a large proportion of patients experience
      worsening of their parkinsonism and develop incapacitating motor fluctuations and
      dyskinesias. To deal with this, attention has been directed to surgical procedures, such as
      deep brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, stimulating the areas of the brain that control
      movement, the globus pallidus (Gpi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), has been proposed as a
      therapy for treating many of the disabling symptoms associated with PD and drug-induced side
      effects.

      The major aim of this 5-year study is to carry out a prospective, double blinded, randomized,
      clinical trial of DBS for medically intractable PD. The study will evaluate the effect of DBS
      in the Gpi and STN on motor, neuropsychological and psychiatric function, and quality of life
      in patients with PD. The study also will address two key issues: 1) whether there are
      differences between unilateral Gpi-DBS and STN-DBS and 2) which patients are the best
      candidates for bilateral DBS.

    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a commonly used survey tool used to assess symptom severity of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It covers several different domains including 1) thought, behavior and mood 2) activities of daily living 3) motor activity 4) complications of therapy and others. The mean change from baseline to six months after DBS surgery for patients with DBS in the GPi vs the STN will be compared after being adjusted for differences in age and time since PD diagnosis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in UPDRS subscales and individual scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subscales include domains including behavior and mood, activities of daily living, motor function, complications of therapy and others.
Individual scores to be evaluated include scores for tremor, rigidity, bradykensia, gait, and postural stability.
Other secondary endpoints include: Hoehn and Yahr staging, Modified Schwab and England Scale, timed test results, scores from psychiatric and quality of life assessments.</description>

    <description>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical intervention used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Target sites of stimulation may differ among patients. The Gpi and STN are two commonly targeted sites within the brain for treatment of PD, yet differences in outcomes between stimulation at the Gpi vs the STN (unilateral and bilateral) are not currently well understood.</description>
