      This two-part study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS (see below), to
      explore how the brain forms memories. People remember only some of the events they experience
      every day, such as faces they perceive, words they read, speech they hear and interpret, and
      so forth. The events remembered are those that have been saved or formed in the brain. Part 1
      of this study involves testing materials for Part 2, the TMS experiment. Part 2 uses TMS to
      examine what parts of the brain are involved in forming memories. Information gained from
      this study may be used in developing methods of enhancing memory in both healthy people and
      in patients with memory impairments.

      Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 35 years of age may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates may be screened with a medical interview and physical examination and a
      brief test of short- and long-term visual and verbal memory. Eligible volunteers may
      participate in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study, as follows:

      Part 1 - Preparation of Words and Picture Materials

      Participants look at several words or shapes that appear in random order on a computer screen
      and try to remember them as well as possible for a memory test that will be given 20 minutes
      later. Each image appears on the screen for 3/4 of a second, with 1-1/4-second intervals
      between them. For the test, words and shapes are again shown on the computer screen at the
      same timing and intervals. When the items appear, the subject presses one of three buttons as
      quickly as possible, determining if he or she has recognized the items with a high or low
      level of confidence. The entire procedure lasts up to 1 hour, with breaks in between. The
      purpose of this experiment is to find appropriate words and pictures to use as stimuli in the
      TMS study described below.

      Part 2 - TMS Experiment

      For TMS, the subject sits in a comfortable chair. An insulated wire coil is placed on the
      scalp, and brief electrical currents are passed through the coil, creating magnetic pulses
      that stimulate the brain. The pulses may cause a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil
      and twitching in muscles of the arm or leg. Electrodes are taped to the skin over some
      muscles of the hands to record the electrical activity of the muscles. Pulses are delivered
      in trains or short bursts of impulses, each lasting half a second. Participants receive 90
      trains for a total of 900 pulses. TMS is applied during the first part of the memory study,
      when the words and shapes are first presented on the computer screen, but not during the
      second presentation for memory testing. The entire procedure takes up to 2 hours, with breaks
      in between.

      Before the TMS session, participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine
      where to place the coil for TMS. For MRI, the subject lies still for up to 30 minutes at a
      time on a table that slides into the scanner, a narrow metal cylinder surrounded by a strong
      magnetic field. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur while the scanner
      takes pictures. Subjects can communicate with the MRI staff at all times and can ask to stop
      the procedure at any time.

      Recent functional imaging studies showed that memory retrieval is associated with activation
      in the prefrontal cortex during the encoding process. However, a cause-effect link between
      prefrontal activity and encoding has not been demonstrated. The purpose of this protocol is
      to test the hypothesis that inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      over left prefrontal cortex interferes with encoding of verbal items (words) into episodic
      memory, thereby identifying this region as a substrate mediating verbal encoding.
      Identification of the role of the prefrontal cortex in verbal memory encoding is the first
      step to try to develop strategies to enhance such encoding processes in patients with memory
      impairments, an issue of relevance in neurorehabilitation.

      We plan to apply rTMS over left prefrontal cortex and over two control sites, during encoding
      of verbal and nonverbal items into episodic memory. Normal, healthy volunteers will be
      studied. The outcome measure will be performance on a subsequent memory test for words
      presented during left prefrontal rTMS, as compared to performance for words presented during
      rTMS over the control sites or without rTMS. This measure will indicate if left prefrontal
      stimulation can disrupt memory encoding of words relative to other stimulation sites or to no
      stimulation.

      A secondary outcome measure will be performance on a subsequent memory test for words
      presented during left prefrontal rTMS, as compared to performance for pictures presented
      during left prefrontal rTMS. This measure will indicate if disruption of left prefrontal
      function with TMS affects verbal and more than non-verbal memory encoding.
