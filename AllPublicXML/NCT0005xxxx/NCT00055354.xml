  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate acupuncture as a treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) and to correlate the diagnosis of PTSD with Traditional Chinese Medicine
      (TCM) diagnostic patterns.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate: 1) the TCM diagnostic differentiation patterns of people who have
      PTSD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition; 2) if an acupuncture
      treatment approach is acceptable to people with PTSD; and 3) if an acupuncture treatment
      approach is associated with a reduction in PTSD symptoms that is comparable to that of
      standard treatments. Because symptoms of depression, insomnia, and pain are often associated
      with PTSD, we will also evaluate the potential benefit of an acupuncture approach to
      depression, insomnia, and pain symptoms in people with PTSD.

      Patients in this study will be randomized to one of three groups. Group A will receive
      acupuncture therapy. Group B will receive standard Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Group C is a
      control group and will receive no treatment. Patients in Groups A and B will undergo a total
      of 24 hours of therapy over the 3 month study course. All patients will have five
      nontherapeutic study visits; these visits will address diagnosis and assessment. Study visits
      will include assessments of PTSD symptoms, sleep symptoms, and level of impairment.
