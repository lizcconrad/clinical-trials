      Children with specific phobias may experience academic, social, and personal distress, as
      well as interference in day-to-day activities. One-Session Treatment has been found a rapid
      and effective treatment for adults with phobic disorders. However, its utility in the
      treatment of childhood phobia has not been examined.

      Participants are randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: a one-session treatment group, an
      education/support group, and a waitlist control group. The one-session treatment group is
      directly exposed to a phobia object or situation during a 3-hour treatment session. In the
      education/support group, children are given information about fear and phobias and are taught
      how to deal with them through workbook activities. Children who participate in the
      one-session treatment group or the education/support group are assessed 1 week post-treatment
      and again after 6 months. Participants with improved symptoms have a 1-year follow-up.
      Participants with phobias that persist at 6 months are encouraged to participate in
      alternative treatment. Waitlist control participants are assessed pre-treatment and 1 month
      post-treatment. Those who continue to have phobias at the 1-month assessment are randomly
      assigned to 1 of the 2 active treatments.
