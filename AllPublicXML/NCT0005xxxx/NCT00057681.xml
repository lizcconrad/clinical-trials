  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the medications, lithium (Eskalith®), valproate
      (Depakote®), and risperidone (Risperdal®) in treating children and adolescents with bipolar
      disorder or symptoms of mania.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomly assigned to receive lithium (Eskalith), valproate (Depakote), or
      risperidone (Risperdal) for 8 to 16 weeks. They will have weekly visits to monitor their
      response to the medication. When the study is complete, care will be transferred to the
      child's treating psychiatrist.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Mania Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar (CGI-BP) assessment instrument measured improvement in mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness. The primary outcome measure was mania improvement, which measured the change in mania from baseline. Scores were 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Modified Side Effects Form for Children and Adolescents</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Side Effects Form for Children and Adolescents includes 62 potential side effects, with measures of frequency and severity for each item. Frequencies are 0=not present, 1=1-2 days, 2=3-4 days, 3=5-7 days. Severity scores are 0=not present, 1=mild (does not interfere with functioning), 2=moderate (some interference with functioning), 3=severe (functioning is significantly impaired because of side effects). Items for cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, ocular, mouth and nose, genito urinary, dermatology, musculo-skeletal, and other side effects are included. For analyses, side effects that were reported at any frequency and a severity of 2 or greater were considered present.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>K-SADS Mania Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The K-SADS Mania Rating Scale (KMRS) is comprised of 15 items modified from WASH-U-KSADS items. The individual items are scored on a 1-6 severity scale and then these item scores are summed to create an overall KMRS score. Guidelines for interpretation are as follows: 0-11 = no or minimal mania, 12-17 = mild mania, 18-25 = moderate mania, 26+ = marked or worse mania. The maximum possible score is 64.</description>
