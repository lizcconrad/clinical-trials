  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best way to give radiation therapy when
      given together with topotecan and cisplatin in treating patients with locally advanced
      cervical cancer. This trial is also studying the best dose of topotecan when given in this
      regimen. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as topotecan and cisplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of pelvic radiotherapy, cisplatin, and topotecan in
      patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan when administered in this regimen
      in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the site of recurrence (local vs distant) in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of topotecan.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients receive cisplatin IV and
      topotecan IV over 30 minutes once weekly for a total of 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 1 of 6 patients experiences
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort of 20 patients
      receives treatment as above at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
