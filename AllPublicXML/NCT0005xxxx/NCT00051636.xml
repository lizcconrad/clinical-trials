  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The core study looked at the effect of Zoledronic Acid given once as an intravenous (i.v.)
      infusion compared to 60 days of oral Risedronate in patients with Paget's disease of bone.
      The effect was demonstrated in the reduction of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP). The
      extended observation period included participants of the core study who responded to
      treatment.

      <pre_assignment_details>172 participants entered period 1; of these, 127 were identified as treatment responders and entered the extended observation period 2. Responders defined as patient who had ≥75% decrease from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) excess (difference between measured level and midpoint of normal range) or SAP within normal range at 6 months.</pre_assignment_details>
