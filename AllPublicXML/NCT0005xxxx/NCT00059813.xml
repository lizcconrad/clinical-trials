  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oblimersen with interferon alfa in
      treating patients who have metastatic renal cell (kidney) cancer. Interferon alfa may
      interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Oblimersen may increase the effectiveness of
      interferon alfa by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate of metastatic renal cancer to the combination of
      G3139 plus α-Interferon (α-IFN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further assess the clinical toxicity of this combination. II. To evaluate the impact of
      G3139 plus α-IFN on molecular targets involved in the regulation of apoptosis in tumor cells
      and lymphocytes.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of G3139 when given with α-IFN at this dose and
      schedule.

      IV. To evaluate the potential toxicity of this combination on cells of the immune system.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7 and interferon alfa subcutaneously on
      days 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 of course 1 and on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of all subsequent
      courses. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) receive an additional 2 courses past
      CR.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 20-24
      months.

             prior chemotherapy regimen; full recovery from all toxicities must have occurred; for
             high-dose IL-2, at least 8 weeks must have elapsed since prior treatment
