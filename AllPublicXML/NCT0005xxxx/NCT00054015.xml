      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 3-AP in treating patients who have
      advanced prostate cancer that has been previously treated with hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer
           treated with 3-AP.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-AP IV over 2 hours on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to
      1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-27 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer by one of the following
             methods:

               -  Measurable disease

               -  PSA level of at least 5 ng/mL with a positive bone scan

          -  Objective evidence of progressive metastatic disease in the past 3 months defined by
             any of the following:

               -  An increase in PSA value of at least 25% (minimum absolute increase of 5 ng/mL)
                  on at least 2 successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart

               -  A new symptomatic lesion on bone scan

               -  A new metastases not in bone

               -  Growth of existing non-bone measurable metastatic disease NOTE: An increase in
                  pain or symptoms alone without other evidence of progression, or elevation of PSA
                  or serum alkaline phosphatase alone without evidence of metastatic disease is not
                  sufficient

             treatment failure

                  than 50 ng/mL and must continue leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy
                  while on study
