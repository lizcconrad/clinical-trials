      This study will examine whether the new investigational drug EPO906, given by intravenous
      infusion (IV directly into the vein), is effective in shrinking tumors and preventing the
      growth of cells that cause metastatic carcinoid and other neuroendocrine tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with biopsy-proven metastatic carcinoid tumors or other neuroendocrine tumors
             (Islet cell, Gastrinomas and VIPomas) with at least one measurable lesion (other than
             bone) that has either not been previously irradiated or if previously irradiated has
             demonstrated progression since the radiation therapy

          -  The patient has no major impairment of renal or hepatic function, as defined by the
             following laboratory parameters: total bilirubin &lt;1.5 X ULN; AST, ALT&lt;2.5X ULN (&lt;5 X
             ULN if liver metastases are present)

          -  Patients on Sandostatin Lar (long acting somatostatin analogue) must be on a stable
             dose for 30 days prior to study entry and short acting somatostatin analogues must be
             judged to be on a clinically stable dose by the investigator prior to study entry

          -  Must have a life expectancy of greater than three (3) months

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 60

          -  Female patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. (Not
             applicable to patients with bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or to those
             patients who are postmenopausal.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases or leptomeningeal involvement

          -  Patients with known brain metastases, unless these metastases have been treated and/or
             have been stable for at least six months prior to study start. Subjects with a history
             of brain metastases must have a head CT with contrast to document either response or
             progression.

          -  Patients with bone metastases as the only site(s) of measurable disease

          -  Patients with hepatic artery chemoembolization within the last 6 months (one month if
             there are other sites of measurable disease)

          -  Patients who have been previously treated with radioactive directed therapies

          -  Patients who have been previously treated with epothilone

          -  Patients with any peripheral neuropathy or unresolved diarrhea greater than Grade 1

          -  Patients with severe cardiac insufficiency patients taking Coumadin or other
             warfarin-containing agents with the exception of low dose warfarin (1 mg or less) for
             the maintenance of in-dwelling lines or ports

          -  Patients taking any experimental therapies history of another malignancy within 5
             years prior to study entry except curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer,
             prostate cancer, or cervical cancer in situ

          -  Patients with active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled infection including
             abcesses or fistulae

          -  Patients with a medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude study or informed
             consent and/or history of noncompliance to medical regimens or inability or
             unwillingness to return for all scheduled visits

          -  HIV+ patients

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.
