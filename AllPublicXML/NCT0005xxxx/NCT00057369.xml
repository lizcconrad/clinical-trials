  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate a new medication dosed once a week in the treatment of bacterial
      infections in the blood from intravenous catheters (CR-BSI). The primary objective is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin in the treatment of adults with CR-BSI
      relative to a standard of care treatment, vancomycin.
