      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gefitinib with fluorouracil,
      leucovorin, and irinotecan in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent colorectal
      cancer. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining gefitinib with
      fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan may kill more tumor cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety of gefitinib, fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan in
      patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.

      II. Determine the major side effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      IV. Correlate response and other measures of outcome with epidermal growth factor receptor
      expression and the expression of genes that impact upon pathways of fluoropyrimidine
      cytotoxicity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib daily beginning on day 1, irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on
      days 1 and 15, and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 3-5 seconds
      followed by a 22-hour infusion on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
