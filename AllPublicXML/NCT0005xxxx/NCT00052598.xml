    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studies the side effects of giving therapeutic allogeneic
      lymphocytes together with aldesleukin and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      high-risk or recurrent myeloid leukemia after undergoing donor stem cell transplant.
      Biological therapies, such as therapeutic autologous lymphocytes, may stimulate the immune
      system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Aldesleukin may stimulate the
      white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Giving therapeutic autologous lymphocytes together
      with aldesleukin may kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with infusing donor CD8+
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) clones specific for Proteinase 3 (Myeloblastin) in patients
      with relapse/progression of high risk myeloid leukemias after transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and assess migration to the
      bone marrow, a predominant site of leukemic relapse.

      II. To determine if adoptively transferred proteinase 3 (PR3)-specific T cells mediate
      antileukemic activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive allogeneic CD8+ PR3-specific CTLs intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days
      0, 7, 14, 28, and 49 and aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 28-41 and 49-63
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 1-3 months.

             or other treatments resulting in the ablation or inactivation of T cells (such as
             other anti-T cell monoclonal antibodies); although the concurrent use of cyclosporine,
             FK506, or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is not strictly an exclusion criterion, attempts

          -  Patients with a preexisting nonhematopoietic organ toxicity that is deemed by the
