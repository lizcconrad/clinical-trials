      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of plasma
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Having a peripheral
      stem cell transplant to replace the blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy, allows
      higher dose of chemotherapy to be given so that more plasma cells are killed. Giving a
      chemoprotective drug such as amifostine may protect kidney cells from the side effects of
      chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of melphalan given
      together with amifostine in treating patients who are undergoing peripheral stem cell
      transplant for primary systemic amyloidosis.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of high-dose melphalan administered with
           amifostine in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis undergoing autologous
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the toxicity of high-dose melphalan when administered at the MTD in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of melphalan.

      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily until peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) collection is complete. Apheresis begins on day 5 of G-CSF administration and
      continues until the target number of PBSCs are collected.

      Within 6 weeks of PBSC collection, patients receive amifostine IV over 5 minutes on days -2
      and -1 and high-dose melphalan IV over 30-60 minutes on day -1. Patients undergo autologous
      PBSC infusion on day 0.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an
      additional 10 patients are treated at that dose.

      Patients are followed approximately 3 months following transplantation, then every 6 months
      for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.3 years.
