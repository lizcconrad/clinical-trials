    <textblock>
      This investigation is a sub-study of the 6-year multinational ESPRIT (Evaluation of
      Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomized International Trial) protocol. It will compare the
      effectiveness of the influenza (FLUVAC) and tetanus-pneumococcal (TEPVAC) vaccines in
      HIV-infected patients receiving interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus anti-HIV drugs with those receiving
      only anti-HIV drugs. IL-2 is a protein naturally produced by immune cells called lymphocytes.
      Lymphocytes from patients with HIV do not produce IL-2 normally. The ESPRIT trial is
      evaluating whether HIV-infected patients treated with antiretroviral drugs plus IL-2 have
      fewer serious infections and improved survival than those receiving only anti-HIV drugs.

      Participants in this sub-study will be drawn from patients enrolled in ESPRIT. They must be
      18 years of age or older, have HIV infection with no symptoms of significant HIV illness.
      They will be vaccinated against either influenza or tetanus and pneumococcus, as follows:

      FLUVAC

      Potentially eligible patients will be screened for the FLUVAC study during an ESPRIT
      follow-up visit. Those who are eligible and agree to participate will have 10 ml (1
      tablespoon) of blood drawn to assess baseline antibody levels and then receive the
      vaccination. They will be vaccinated annually for 3 years. A blood sample (10 ml) will be
      drawn 1 month after each vaccination to measure the immune response. Some of the blood drawn
      for this study will be stored and used for research purposes.

      TEPVAC

      Participants will have 10 ml of blood drawn to assess their baseline antibody levels. They
      will receive two vaccinations (tetanus and pneumococcus) 12 months after enrolling in ESPRIT
      and another two vaccinations 24 months after enrollment. A blood sample (10 ml) will be drawn
      1 month after each vaccination to measure the immune response. Some of the blood drawn for
      this study will be stored and used for research purposes.

    <textblock>
      Evaluation of Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomized International Trial (ESPRIT) is a 4,000
      patient, 6-year study investigating the clinical effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients
      with HIV infection. Because of the size and duration of this study, substudies to the parent
      trial are being performed in order to improve the knowledge regarding the use of IL-2 in
      HIV-infected individuals and to enhance the overall scientific output of this international
      effort. This protocol will serve as the umbrella under which the ESPRIT substudies will be
      performed at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - ESPRIT PROTOCOL:

        Documentation of HIV-1 infection by any licensed ELISA test and confirmed by a second
        method (e.g. Western Blot); or any one of the following at any time: detectable HIV p24
        antigen, quantifiable plasma HIV RNA, or detectable proviral DNA.

        Absolute CD4 plus cell count of greater than or equal to 300/mm(3) within 45 days prior to
        randomization. (For patients who are status post-splenectomy, also a CD4 plus cell
        percentage greater than or equal to 20%.)

        No evidence of active clinical disease for at least one year, in the judgement of the
        clinician, for any AIDS-defining illness (category C., CDC, 1993) or any of the following
        conditions: extrapulmonary Pneumocystis carinii disease; multi-dermatomal Herpes zoster
        (greater than or equal to 10 lesions in a non-contiguous site); American trypanosomiasis
        (Chagas disease) of the CNS; Penicillium marneffii disease; visceral leishmaniasis;
