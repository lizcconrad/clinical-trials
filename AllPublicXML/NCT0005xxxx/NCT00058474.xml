      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin
      work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and either
      capecitabine or fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin and comparing them to see how well
      they work when given before surgery in treating patients with resectable rectal cancer. It is
      not yet known whether radiation therapy and either capecitabine or fluorouracil is more
      effective with or without oxaliplatin in treating rectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the rate of local-regional relapse in patients with resectable rectal cancer
           treated with chemoradiotherapy comprising radiation therapy and either capecitabine or
           fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the rate of clinical complete response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the rate of pathologic complete response in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine the increase in the number of patients who are able to undergo
           sphincter-saving surgery after treatment with these regimens.

        -  Correlate genetic patterns and the presence or absence of specific tissue biomarkers
           with response and prognosis in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare preoperative quality of life (QOL) of patients treated with oral capecitabine
           versus continuous infusion with fluorouracil.

        -  Determine the impact of oxaliplatin on neurotoxicity in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the convenience of care in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the impact of the type of surgical management on QOL at 1 and 5 years
           postoperatively in these patients.

        -  Describe the long-term impact of cancer treatment on symptoms (e.g., vitality and
           neurotoxicity) and QOL at 5 years after randomization (5-year follow-up visit).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, gender, clinical tumor stage (stage II vs stage III), and surgical
      intent (sphincter saving vs non-sphincter saving). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm 1: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously and undergo radiotherapy once daily
           5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.

        -  Arm 2: Patients receive fluorouracil and undergo radiotherapy as in arm 1. Patients also
           receive oxaliplatin IV over 1 hour once weekly for 5 weeks.

        -  Arm 3: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo radiotherapy once
           daily 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.

        -  Arm 4: Patients receive capecitabine and undergo radiotherapy as in arm 3. Patients also
           receive oxaliplatin as in arm 2.

      Within 6-8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with responding or
      stable disease undergo surgery. Patients with progressive disease are treated at the
      discretion of the investigator and continue to be followed.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at completion of chemoradiotherapy, and at 1 and 5
      years after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,606 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.

             disease (class III* or class IV** myocardial disease as described by the New York
             Heart Association), a recent history (within 6 months) of myocardial infarction, or
             symptomatic arrhythmia at the time of randomization. *Class III: Patients with cardiac
             disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Such patients are
             comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity that causes fatigue,
             palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. **Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease
             resulting in inability to perform any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms
             of cardiac insufficiency or anginal syndrome may be present even at rest.

             interventions or who are symptomatic).

          -  Prior pelvic radiation therapy for any reason.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, or oxaliplatin.

          -  Clinically significant peripheral neuropathy at the time of randomization (defined in
             the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 [CTCAE v3.0] as
             grade 2 or greater neurosensory or neuromotor toxicity).
