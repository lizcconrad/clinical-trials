    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bevacizumab when given
      together with fluorouracil and external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients with
      stage II or stage III rectal cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block
      cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.
      Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they
      stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) neutralizing antibody, bevacizumab, when administered concurrently with 5-fluorouracil
      (5-FU) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with clinical stage T3 or T4
      rectal cancer prior to surgery.

      II. To obtain preliminary data of the pathological response rate after preoperative therapy.

      III. To obtain preliminary data regarding progression free survival, local control, and
      overall survival.

      IV. To obtain preliminary data of the changes in the angiogenic profile of rectal cancer
      induced by this therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bevacizumab.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 (courses 1-4). Beginning with
      course 2, patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-14 and undergo
      external beam radiotherapy on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo surgery 7 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 20 additional
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 2 years.

                  warfarin, international normalized ratio [INR] of &lt; 1.5; appropriate use of
                  heparin should be discussed with the Medical Monitor)

               -  Chronic, daily treatment with aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or nonsteroidal anti-

             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab, radiation therapy,
             and 5-FU have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with bevacizumab; these potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study
