      This study will determine whether a prevention program reduces the incidence of postpartum
      depression in pregnant women who receive public assistance and are at risk for postpartum
      depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of major depression in the postpartum period is profound, with considerable
      emotional pain for the new mother as well as disturbances in infant development.
      Unfortunately, few preventive interventions have been developed or systematically tested to
      reduce the risk of postpartum depression. An area of even greater neglect is the development
      of such an intervention for financially disadvantaged women who are at high risk for
      postpartum depression and for the disturbances associated with postpartum depression. This
      study will develop a psychosocial intervention for financially disadvantaged pregnant women
      at risk for postpartum depression.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either the &quot;Life at Home with a New Baby&quot;
      intervention or care as usual. Women who receive the intervention join a counseling group in
      which information about mother-baby relationships is shared. This information is reinforced
      with a follow-up &quot;booster&quot; session after the infant is born. Participants are assessed at
      baseline, after the booster session (for the intervention condition) or after 2 weeks
      postdelivery (for the care as usual condition), and at 3 months postpartum. Depression levels
      and social adjustment are measured at baseline and 2 weeks after delivery. Functional status
      is also measured. A self-report questionnaire is completed by the mothers to measure parental
      distress, parent/child dysfunctional behavior, and difficult child interactions. At 3 months
      postpartum, a brief standardized interview is used to assess the presence of a depressive
      disorder.
