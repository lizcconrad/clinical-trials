      This study will conduct tests in patients with primary chronic autonomic failure (CAF) to
      learn more about these disorders, which include pure autonomic failure, multiple system
      atrophy, Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure, and autoimmune autonomic neuropathy.

      Healthy volunteers and patients with primary CAF 18 years of age or older may be eligible for
      this study. Participants undergo some of the following tests:

        -  Blood studies, including arterial catheter insertion to measure blood pressure and
           collect arterial blood samples, blood flow studies using sensors applied to the skin and
           a pressure cuff around a limb, and blood draw for genetic studies.

        -  Bladder motility: Ultrasound test of bladder function.

        -  Electrocardiogram and heart ultrasound.

        -  Responses to changes in temperature: Warm water and then room temperature water are
           passed through watertight pads applied to the back and front of the body and body
           temperatures are measured.

        -  Gastrointestinal motility: Bowel sounds are recorded using a microphone placed on the
           abdomen.

        -  Lower body negative pressure: The lower body is placed into an airtight barrel-like
           chamber. Some air is sucked out of the barrel, causing blood to pool in the legs, as
           occurs during standing.

        -  Lumbar puncture: A needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back
           to collect a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid.

        -  Microdialysis to measures levels of chemicals in the body fluid of certain tissues. A
           solution is passed through a thin tube inserted into the skin. Chemicals in the body
           tissues enter the solution. The solution is collected and the chemical levels are
           measured.

        -  PET scanning: A nuclear medicine test to produce images of body organs. For patients
           with urinary problems, a catheter is inserted into the bladder before starting the scan.

        -  Pupillometry: The pupil of the eye is measured using a special camera in a
           light-controlled room.

        -  QSART. A small amount of a brain chemical is applied to the skin with a tiny amount of
           electricity, and the sweat in a nearby patch of skin is measured.

        -  Measurement of saliva production, using a cotton-like material placed between the teeth
           and gums to absorb saliva.

        -  Skin electrical conduction test, using sensors on the skin to measure sweat production.

        -  Skin and core temperature measurements using sensors on the skin and in the ear canal.

        -  Speech and swallowing assessment for patients with speech and swallowing difficulties.

        -  Stress echocardiogram: A catheter is placed in the subject's arm for sampling blood or
           giving a drug while the subject exercises. During the test, blood pressure, pulse rate,
           and EKG are continuously monitored.

      Objective:

      In dysautonomias, altered functions of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system
      adversely affect health. Primary dysautonomias have been classified clinically into chronic
      autonomic failure (CAF) syndromes that include pure autonomic failure (PAF), multiple system
      atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson disease (PD) with autonomic failure (manifested especially by
      neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH)). Clinical assessment alone is often inadequate for
      correct diagnosis and does not provide insights into mechanisms or identify new therapeutic
      targets. This protocol calls for continuous development and assessment of physiological,
      neuropharmacologic, neurochemical, neuroimaging, and other clinical laboratory approaches, to
      identify lesion types and sites in CAF and improve diagnosis, increase mechanistic
      understanding, and incite novel therapeutics. PAF, MSA, and PD exemplify alpha
      synucleinopathies, in which deposits of the protein alpha-synuclein occur in Lewy bodies in
      catecholamine-producing neurons (PD, PAF) or in the cytoplasm of glial cells (MSA). Only the
      Lewy body forms of synucleinopathy are consistently associated with loss of catecholaminergic
      neurons. Under this protocol we have obtained evidence that patients with Lewy body diseases
      have decreased ability to take up intra-neuronal catecholamines from the cytoplasm into
      storage vesicles. Cytoplasmic catecholamines are cytotoxic, such as by enzyme-catalyzed
      conversion to highly reactive catecholaldehydes. By studying CAF patients we hope to make
      discoveries that will yield a unifying, integrative concept for the pathogenesis and
      different clinical manifestations of Lewy body diseases. Autonomic function testing under
      this protocol is also required for screening purposes for entry into other protocols of the
      Clinical Neurocardiology Section. Moreover, comprehensive autonomic function testing is
      requested in patients of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program. Finally, in a long-term
      project as a member of the Autonomic Rare Diseases Clinical Research Consortium we are
      applying this testing to study the natural history of neurogenic OH.

      Study Population:

      The study population consists of patients with idiopathic, or primary, CAF, with emphasis on
      PAF, MSA, and PD. Comparison groups include healthy volunteers (HVs), patients with PD who do
      not have OH, and patients with iatrogenic CAF such as from bilateral thoracic
      sympathectomies.

      Design: Subjects undergo multiple physiological, neuropharmacologic, neurochemical, and
      neuroimaging, and other tests, to see if the results by different modalities agree and point
      to specific sites and types of lesions.

      Outcome Measures:

      Physiological outcome measures include hemodynamic responses to the Valsalva maneuver,
      orthostasis, and altered temperature at skin of the back. Neuropharmacologic measures include
      cardiovascular responses to test drugs that probe specific components of the autonomic
      nervous system. Neurochemical measures include plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialysate,
      urine, and skin biopsy tissue levels of catecholamines and related compounds. Neuroimaging
      measures include positron emission tomographic scanning after injection of 18F-dopamine,
      18F-DOPA, 13N-ammonia, or 11C-methylreboxetine.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The subjects are patients with known or suspected primary CAF, based on referral
        information and confirmation of the clinical diagnosis at the intake evaluation. They are
        classified by results of the intake evaluation and then undergo comprehensive autonomic
        function testing.

        Patients with primary or iatrogenic CAF are included. Control patients have been previously
        diagnosed with PD or MSA without OH, confirmed at the time of the intake evaluation.

        Healthy Volunteers 18 years old or older are included. People at increased risk for PD or
        CAF consent in this study as if they were patients (e.g., to enable DNA extraction and
        storage).

        All subjects must be able to provide their own consent to participate or have an existing
        Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) in place.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: People younger than 18 years old are excluded.

        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator or
        Clinical Director, protocol participation would place the subject at substantially
        increased acute medical risk. This includes the risks associated with air travel to the
        NIH. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or
        Clinical Director, the medical risk outweighs the potential scientific benefit.

        Disqualifying Conditions A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are hepatic or renal failure (defined by
        serum creatinine more than 1.5 g/dL), symptomatic congestive heart failure, severe anemia,
        psychosis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, and symptomatic coronary heart disease.
        Patients are excluded from further participation if the results of the intake evaluation
        lead to a diagnosis of a secondary form of CAF, such diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
        Candidate subjects who are unable to give their own consent and who do not have an existing
        DPA in place are excluded. Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from the study.

        Medications Patients with known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any test drug
        are excluded from receiving that drug. Patients are not to discontinue any medications
        before the patient or the patient s doctor discusses this with the Principal Investigator,
        Research Nurse, or Nurse Practitioner. If it is decided that discontinuing medications
        would be unsafe, then the patient may be excluded from all or part of the study.

        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal
        medicines or dietary supplements may be disallowed before enrollment in the study. For many
        herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.

        Practical Limitations Patients in whom we feel it would be difficult to insert a catheter
        into a vein may be excluded. Subjects who are not expected clinically to tolerate lying
        still during the procedures may be excluded.

        Pregnancy Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from the protocol overall. In women with
        child-bearing potential, blood testing for pregnancy will be done with 24 hours before
        initial testing (except for obtaining the medical history and physical examination) or any
        testing involving radioactivity under the protocol. Repeat pregnancy testing will be done
        before any procedure or drug administration under the protocol that takes place more than
        one week from a previous pregnancy test. Participants will not start or remain in the study
        if pregnancy test is positive.

        Refusal to Undergo Certain Procedures Candidate subjects are excluded if they refuse to
        undergo certain procedures. These are: (1) IV catheter; (2) electrocardiogram; (3) blood
        drawing; (4) DNA extraction and storage (patients and non-HV controls only); and (5) DNA
        analysis (patients and non-HV controls only).
