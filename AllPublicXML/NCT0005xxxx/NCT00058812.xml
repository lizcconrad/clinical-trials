  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have a type of blood cell cancer or other blood problem that is very hard to cure
      with standard treatments and s/he will receive a bone marrow transplant. If the patient does
      not have a brother or sister whose marrow is a &quot;perfect match&quot;, this bone marrow will come
      from a donor whose marrow is the best match available. This person may be a close relative or
      an unrelated person whose bone marrow best &quot;matches&quot; the patient's, and who agrees to donate
      marrow.

      In normal people, the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus infection causes a flu like illness and usually
      gets better when the immune system controls the infection. The virus, however, remains hidden
      in the body for life. After a transplant, while the new immune system is growing back, the EB
      virus can come out and infect cells and cause them to grow in an uncontrolled manner.
      Patients can develop fevers, swollen lymph nodes and damage to other organs such as kidneys
      and lungs. This infection acts like a cancer because the cells infected with EB virus grow
      very quickly and there is no known effective treatment. This sort of infection will occur in
      between 10-30% of patients receiving a transplant from a donor who is not a perfect match,
      and has been fatal in nearly all these cases.

      This infection occurs because the immune system cannot control the growth of the cells. We
      want to see if we can prevent it from happening or treat it by giving the patient a kind of
      white blood cell called T cells that we have grown from the marrow donor. These cells have
      been trained to attack EB virus infected cells. We will grow these T cells from blood taken
      from the donor at the time of bone marrow harvest. These T cells will be stimulated with the
      donor's EB virus-infected cells which have been treated with radiation so they cannot grow.
      After mixing these cells together we will be able to grow special T cells from the donor that
      can attack EB virus infected cells. We will then collect the T cells and make sure they can
      kill the virus infected cells. These EBV specific T cells are an investigational product not
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

      We will obtain blood from the donor and will first make a B cell line called a lymphoblastoid
      cell line or LCL by infecting the blood with a laboratory strain of EBV called B95. We will
      then use this EBV-infected cell line (which have been treated with radiation so that they
      cannot grow) as stimulator cells and mix it with more blood. This stimulation will train the
      T cells to kill EBV infected cells and result in the growth of an EBV specific T cell line.
      We will then test the T cells to make sure that they kill the EBV infected cells and not the
      normal cells and freeze them.

      The marrow donor's T cells will be thawed and injected through an intravenous line for a
      period of 10 minutes. The subject may be premedicated with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and
      acetaminophen (Tylenol). We would give one dose of the cells on or after day 45 following
      transplant if the subject agreed and was well enough. If the EBV DNA levels remain high or
      the subject has persistent disease, s/he may be eligible to receive up to 5 additional
      injections of T cells at the original dose at monthly intervals. After the subject has
      received the T cells, s/he will be contacted by the research nurse or another member of the
      study team weekly for 6 weeks, then once every three months for a year so that we can check
      on his/her progress.

      We will continue to follow the subject in the BMT clinic after the injections. To learn more
      about the way the T cells are working, an extra 40 mls (about 8 teaspoonfuls) of blood will
      be taken pre-infusion, 4 hours after the infusion, 3-4 days post infusion (optional) and at
      1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the T cell infusions, and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post
      infusion. The blood should come from the central intravenous line, and should not require
      extra needle sticks.
