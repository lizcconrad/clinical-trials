  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is a major cause of mortality among AIDS patients in the developing world. The
      diagnosis of tuberculosis in HIV infected children is complicated by inefficient and
      expensive tuberculosis tests and vague diagnostic criteria. This study will evaluate the
      accuracy and efficiency of several different tuberculosis tests that could be used in
      developing countries.

    <textblock>
      HIV infection has been shown to increase mortality from tuberculosis (TB) fivefold in parts
      of Subsaharan Africa. Increasingly, HIV infected children in developing countries are
      becoming infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and dying at an early age. This
      project will evaluate novel approaches to the diagnosis of AIDS-related pediatric TB in a
      hyperendemic setting using rapid, cost-effective Mtb culture and susceptibility methods based
      on direct microscopic observation techniques. This study will utilize alternative noninvasive
      Mtb tests that are performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and stool. An optional
      component will assess improved rapid detection of Mtb by a semi-nested polymerase chain
      reaction assay (N2 PCR), a technique appropriate for regional reference laboratories in
      developing countries.

      Two hundred-sixty children with clinically diagnosed pulmonary TB (including at least 100 HIV
      infected children) from the Hospital del Nino, Lima, Peru, and 260 age-matched controls will
      be enrolled in this study. Mtb will be detected in NPAs and stool by new and traditional
      culture methods and by N2 PCR. Gastric aspirates from children with a clinical diagnosis of
      TB will also be tested. Children with a positive N2 PCR but without clinical evidence of TB
      requiring antituberculous therapy will be followed longitudinally.
