  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized phase II trial comparing treatment with a monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) drug immunoconjugate, SGN-15, administered weekly in combination with weekly
      Gemzar® (Gemcitabine) to treatment with Gemzar® alone. The primary objectives of this study
      are to determine the toxicity and safety profile of the combination of SGN-15 and Gemzar®, to
      estimate the clinical response rate and to estimate the duration of response of this
      combination therapy administered to patients with advanced ovarian cancer, compared to
      treatment with Gemzar® alone.

        Brief Overview of Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologically confirmed ovarian cancer, which is advanced or
             recurrent carcinoma, who have failed at least two, but no more than three prior
             therapies for metastatic disease

          -  Patients must have &gt; 20% Lewis-y antigen expression documented by immunohistochemistry

          -  LVEF &gt; 50% by echo or MUGA

          -  Must be platinum resistant as defined by:

               -  Progression while on initial platinum therapy or

               -  Progression while on retreatment with initial platinum regimen or

               -  Relapse &lt; 6 months after initial therapy

        Brief Overview of Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior therapy with Gemzar®

          -  Cumulative anthracycline exposure &gt; 300 mg/m2

          -  More than three prior chemotherapy regimens for ovarian cancer (Retreatment with
             Taxane/Platinum after initial combination is considered only one regimen)
