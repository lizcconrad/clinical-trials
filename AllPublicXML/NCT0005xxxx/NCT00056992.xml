  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amino acid deprivation therapy is an effective means for the treatment of some forms of
      cancer. Recently it has been found that human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) cell lines
      appear to require arginine for growth. Arginine is not an essential amino acid for human
      adults or infants as it can be synthesized from citrulline (for review see Rogers 1994).
      Therefore, selective elimination of arginine from the circulation may be a means of treating
      patients with metastatic melanoma or non resectable HCC.

      The enzyme arginine deiminase (ADI) metabolizes arginine into citrulline (Cunin 1986).
      However, ADI is only found in microbes and not in humans. ADI is therefore, highly
      immunogenic and has a short serum half-life following injection. These potential drawbacks
      (microbial source and thus viewed as foreign by the human immune system, and a short serum
      half-life) can be overcome by covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to
      argininedeiminase and termed this drug ADI-PEG 20.

      ADI-PEG 20 appears to be an effective anti-cancer treatment for human HCC. Pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic data indicates a once a week injection of 160 IU/m2 of ADI-PEG 20
      eliminates all detectable arginine from the circulation for at least 7 days. This treatment
      appears to be well tolerated. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of this
      treatment in patients with HCC. Efficacy is a primary end point of this study. No patients
      will recieve placebo.
