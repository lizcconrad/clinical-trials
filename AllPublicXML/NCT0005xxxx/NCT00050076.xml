    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of two different doses of MCC-135, once
      daily (QD) or twice daily (BID), on the disease state and the quality of life in subjects
      with congestive heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years the usefulness of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and vasodilators
      as well as beta-blockers has been realized in the treatment of heart failure. Multi-center
      studies clinical trials have shown some benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
      on the morbidity and mortality of heart failure subjects, and physicians are also prescribing
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for the initial treatment of subjects with left
      ventricular dysfunction. Some subjects do not respond to angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitors and intolerance to these compounds has also been observed. Despite the significant
      reduction in mortality observed in limited controlled studies, the 5-year mortality of
      subjects with congestive heart failure continues to be high, indicating that there is a
      significant therapeutic gap in the treatment of this disease.

      MCC-135 is being studied to assess its usefulness as a supplement or replacement to current
      treatment and to provide subjects with specific and predictable therapy that will reverse the
      remodeling of the diseased heart and markedly improve the subject's survival. The current
      study is an exploratory clinical trial to determine the efficacy of two doses and two dose
      regimens of MCC-135 when compared to placebo by evaluating improvement in the subject's
      plasma b-type (brain) natriuretic peptide levels, regular rate (heart rate) variability and
      clinical signs and symptoms.
