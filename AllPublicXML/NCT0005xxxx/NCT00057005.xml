  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study have a hematologic malignancy which is a disorder in the bone
      marrow that affects the body's ability to create blood. Participants might benefit from
      receiving an allogeneic stem cell transplant (meaning the cells come from a donor). The
      participants donor is a family member. Stem cells are cells in the bone marrow and blood that
      can form a whole new blood system.

      Patients are given high doses of chemotherapy before receiving a stem cell transplant to keep
      their immune system from rejecting the donor stem cells and to kill any diseased cells that
      remain in the body. To try and improve on the results of transplants that use high dose
      chemotherapy alone, we are adding an agent called anti-CD45 to the treatment prior to the
      stem cell transplant. Anti-CD45 is an antibody that specifically finds and destroys leukemia
      cells.

      Patients will receive the anti-CD45 with high dose chemotherapy (including Ara-C and
      Cyclophosphamide) and radiotherapy. Patients will also receive Mesna which is a drug that
      helps prevent bladder damage which can be caused by the cyclophosphamide. High dose
      radiotherapy is also known as Total Body Irradiation or TBI.

      Patients will receive the anti-CD45, high dose chemotherapy, and high dose radiotherapy
      before the stem cell transplant. We expect participation in this study will last 2 years.

      A summary of the treatment follows:

        -  Day - 7: Ara-C, Cyclophosphamide, Mesna

        -  Day - 6: Ara-C, Cyclophosphamide, Mesna

        -  Day - 5: Ara-C, Anti-CD45

        -  Day - 4: Anti-CD45, TBI

        -  Day - 3: Anti-CD45, TBI

        -  Day - 2: Anti-CD45, TBI

        -  Day - 1: TBI

        -  Day 0: Stem Cell Infusion (transplant)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with advanced leukemia or other hematologic malignancy including AML, ALL,
             CML, and MDS. Advanced features include: a) Induction failure, prolonged induction
             beyond 6 weeks b) Incomplete response to salvage therapy c) CML in blast crisis or
             acute leukemia in chemotherapy resistant relapse d) secondary leukemia or secondary
             myelodysplastic disease

          2. Patients must have a suitable HLA identical sibling donor or 5/6 matched related
             donor, or fully matched or 5/6 matched unrelated donor, or haploidentical related
             donor.

        Exclusion Criteria:
