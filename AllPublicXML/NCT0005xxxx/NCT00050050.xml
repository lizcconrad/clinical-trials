    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating
      the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults who have not
      responded to drug treatment.

      Study hypothesis: CBT is an effective treatment for adult ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD, previously believed to be a disorder of childhood, affects as many as 5 percent of
      adults. Adults with ADHD are at high risk for academic and occupational underachievement,
      relationship difficulties, and reduced quality of life. This study will determine whether CBT
      is more effective than drug therapy in treating ADHD symptoms in adults who have been
      resistant to previous drug therapies.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 12 to 15 weekly sessions of either CBT or
      drug therapy which may include new or previously taken drugs. Questionnaires will be used to
      assess participants' ADHD symptoms at study start and at study completion.
