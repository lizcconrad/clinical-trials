    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who have advanced
      cancer and kidney dysfunction. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of PS-341 in patients with
      advanced malignancy and mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency.

      II. Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 for patients
      with varying degrees of renal insufficiency.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      most recent creatinine clearance (greater than 60 mL/min vs 40-59 mL/min vs 20-39 mL/min vs
      less than 20 mL/min vs any creatinine clearance and undergoing renal dialysis).

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional
      cohort of up to 12 patients is treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-69 patients (at least 12 per stratum) will be accrued for
      this study.
