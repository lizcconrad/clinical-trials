      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ixabepilone in treating patients who
      have relapsed or refractory lymphoproliferative disorders.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the frequency and duration of complete and partial response rates for patients
           with relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoproliferative disorders treated with
           ixabepilone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5 years.
