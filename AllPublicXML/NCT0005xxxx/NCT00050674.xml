    <textblock>
      Determine whether patients have a decreased incidence of grade 3 and grade 4 neutropenia when
      Filgrastim-SD/01 is given with docetaxel and gemcitabine in patients with advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel and Gemcitabine given on day 1 and 8 of a 21-day schedule has substantial activity
      in non-small cell lung cancer. Both first and second-line patients have response rates
      comparable to or better than other standard combination regimens. Grade 3/4 neutropenia
      occurs in up to half of patients not given growth factor support.

      Studies demonstrate that a single dose of Filgrastim-SF/01 at 100 mg/kg effectively enhances
      post chemotherapy neutrophil recovery in a manner similar to that of daily Filgrastim. This
      current study is designed to characterize the incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia when a fixed
      dose of Filgrastim-SD/01 is added to a well-studied myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimen
      consisting of Gemcitabine and Docetaxel.
