  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-center study of GM-CT-01, which has been shown to increase the
      anti-tumor activity of 5-fluorouracil in mice. The primary reason for doing the study is to
      determine the safety of GM-CT-01 given alone and in combination with therapeutical dosage of
      5-Fluorouracil, in patients who have advanced cancer that can be measured by CT scan.

    <textblock>
      5-Fluorouracil is a chemotherapy drug commonly used in cancer patients. Patients with
      different type of solid tumors who have failed standard, approved treatments can be enrolled
      in the study. Escalated doses of GM-CT-01 will be given alone in Cycle 1, and in combination
      with 5-fluorouracil in cycle 2. Patients will be on study for approximately 60 days for
      determination of safety. However, with patient consent treatment can continue until disease
      progression is determined by CT scan. The study secondary reason is to determine whether
      treatment has stabilize the tumors or change it in size (get bigger, smaller or stay the
      same)after Cycle 2 and any additional cycles of treatment.

             chemotherapy of proven value.

          -  Subjects must have completed previous therapy (chemotherapeutic agents or other
             therapies including radiation) at least 4 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Following major surgery (e.g. laparotomy), &gt; 4 weeks must have elapsed and subjects
             must have recovered from effects.

          -  Following minor surgery (does not include insertion of vascular access device), &gt; 2
             weeks must have elapsed.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  The subject has a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Female subjects must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective

          -  The subject has a known hypersensitivity to GM-CT-01 or any of its components.

          -  The subject has congestive heart failure or any other medical condition that could be
             adversely affected by intravenous infusion of up to approximately 200 mL of fluid over
