  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if high dose antibiotic (meropenem, MERREMÂ® I.V.),
      along with another drug called an aminoglycoside (a different type of antibiotic) is
      effective in decreasing or reducing the rate of antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      Acinetobacter (germs that can cause pneumonia), and the rate of resistance in other difficult
      to treat germs which may cause hospital-acquired pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilatory
      support. The study hopes to show that by increasing the amount of meropenem administered and
      increasing the duration of infusion (release of the drug into the bloodstream), levels of the
      drug will stay at target levels in the bloodstream and decrease the ability of difficult to
      treat germs to resist, or not be killed by, the treatment using this antibiotic (meropenem)
      or other antibiotics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Onset or exacerbation of pneumonia at least 72 hours after admission to an acute care

          -  Patients with other underlying conditions that would make it difficult to interpret
             response to study drug.

             study.
