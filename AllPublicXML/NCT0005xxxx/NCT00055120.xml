      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of starting anti-HIV drugs in HIV
      infected patients who are being treated for opportunistic infections (OIs). This study will
      follow two patient groups: those who received anti-HIV drugs soon after being diagnosed with
      an OI and patients with OIs who deferred beginning anti-HIV drugs until after recovering from
      the OI.

    <textblock>
      Despite the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), many HIV infected
      patients without access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) present with acute OIs. Such
      presentations pose a management problem, as there are currently no data available as to
      whether initiating HAART during the acute presentation is of benefit. Reports of an immune
      reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) marked by increasing hypoxia or new pulmonary
      infiltrates have been associated with the initiation of ART in patients with AIDS. There is
      also concern as to drug interactions between ART and antimicrobials used to treat the
      presenting OI. This study will evaluate the possible benefits and costs of initiating ART in
      HIV infected patients who present with an AIDS-defining OI.

      There are 2 steps in this study. In Step 1, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two
      study arms. Arm A will receive ART within 2 weeks of starting therapy for the acute OI. Arm B
      will have ART deferred until Step 2, at least 4 weeks and no more than 32 weeks after
      beginning therapy for the acute OI. Only Arm B participants will enter Step 2, which will
      likely begin between Weeks 6 and 12. The study will make the following drugs available for
      construction of an antiretroviral (ARV) regimen: emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (FTC/TDF), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV), and stavudine (d4T). Use of other ARV drugs is at
      the discretion of the study official. Drug regimen additions and substitutions will be made
      on a case-by-case basis.

      Patients will be followed for 48 weeks and will have 10 study visits. All study visits will
      include a physical exam, medication history, and blood collection. Patients will be asked to
      complete questionnaires assessing health status and adherence at selected visits.

        Note: Participants who enrolled in this study prior to Version 3.0 will be offered and
        allowed to switch to FTC/TDF if they wish. However, participants under the age of 18 cannot
        receive FTC/TDF through this study.
