      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy uses certain drugs to try to prevent the development or
      recurrence of cancer. Celecoxib may be effective in preventing the development or recurrence
      of lung cancer in former heavy smokers.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing the
      development or recurrence of lung cancer in former heavy smokers who are at risk of
      developing cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of chemoprevention of lung cancer with celecoxib in former
           heavy smokers at risk for developing primary or second primary lung cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and side effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the role of COX-2-specific inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) on antitumor immunity
           within the lung microenvironment of these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of COX-2 inhibition on angiogenesis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to presence of preinvasive lesions (yes vs no). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 6 months. Treatment in both arms
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed every 6 months during treatment and then annually for up to 4
      years.

      Patients are followed annually for up to 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (90 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
