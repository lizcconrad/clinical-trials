      To evaluate the efficacy of Seocalcitol in prolonging time to relapse following intended
      curative resection or percutaneous ablative treatment, i.e. percutaneous ethanol
      injection(s), percutaneous acetic acid injection(s), percutaneous microwave coagulation
      therapy, or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
