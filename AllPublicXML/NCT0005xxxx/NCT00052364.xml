    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of oxaliplatin in treating patients who have
      unresectable, recurrent or metastatic liver cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate and progression free survival in patients with hepatocellular
      cancer treated with oxaliplatin.

      II. To assess the toxicity and tolerance of oxaliplatin in patient with hepatocellular
      cancer.

      III. To evaluate the mRNA expression of enzymes in tumors of the patients entered on this
      study which may be important to the cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin (ERCC1, mismatch repair,
      ribonucleotide reductase, bcl-2, bax, p53). An attempt will be made to obtain tumor biopsies
      from all patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of the
      fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular cancer (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed HCC which is recurrent, metastatic or
             unresectable

          -  Patients may have up to two prior chemotherapy regimes; in addition, they may have had
             previous radiation, chemoembolization, and/or alcohol injections

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as lesions that can be accurately
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with
             conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral CT scan, and which has clearly
             progressed during the observation interval prior to participation in this study;
             pleural effusions and ascites will not be considered measurable, but may be present in
             addition to the measurable lesion(s)

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70%; patients should have an expected survival of at
             least 2 months

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/μl

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/μl

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/μl

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 g/dl

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 OR measured creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min for patients with
             creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Brain metastasis is not an exclusion, however, patients are only eligible if they have
             had successful control of the brain tumor(s) by surgery or stereotactic RT

          -  Patients with no evidence of clinically significant neuropathy

          -  All prior therapy must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to the patient's
             entry on this trial

          -  The effects of oxaliplatin on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because DNA alkylating agents are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately

          -  Because the risk of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to oxaliplatin treatment of
             the mother is unknown but may be harmful, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with oxaliplatin

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has prior oxaliplatin treatment or undergoing therapy with other
             investigational agents

          -  History of allergy to platinum compounds or to antiemetics appropriate for
             administration in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or unstable angina pectoris, or
             cardiac arrhythmia

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are excluded from the
             study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis or a pulmonary interstitial process
