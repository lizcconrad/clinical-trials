  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of field-initiated
      magnesium sulfate in improving the long-term functional outcome of patients with acute
      stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the
      United States. Each year, more than 750,000 Americans suffer a symptomatic stroke.

      Currently, tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved treatment for acute
      ischemic stroke; however, its usefulness is limited because most patients cannot reach
      medical attention within the necessary 3-hour time window. In addition, rt-PA cannot be given
      in the field because it is contraindicated for treatment of patients with brain hemorrhage.

      The purpose of this multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial is to demonstrate that
      paramedic initiation of the neuroprotective agent magnesium sulfate in the field is an
      effective and safe treatment for acute stroke. This study will analyze magnesium sulfate, an
      experimental therapy for stroke, versus placebo among ambulance-transported patients with
      acute stroke. This trial will also demonstrate that paramedics can safely, effectively, and
      rapidly start neuroprotective therapies for stroke.

    <description>Modified Rankin Scales (mRS) is a measure of global disability. Total Scale range is 0-6, with lower values indicating better outcomes.
0 No symptoms at all
No significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities
Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance
Moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance
Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance
Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention

    <description>Magnesium sulfate (Mg) was administered intravenously with a 15 minute bolus load followed by a 24 hour infusion. The bolus-loading dose consisted of 4 grams Mg in 54 ml normal saline. The maintenance infusion contained 16 grams Mg diluted in 240 ml 0.9% normal saline, infused at 10 ml/hr for 24 hours. Paramedics in the field initiated the bolus-loading dose, administered at 216 ml/hr over 15 minutes through a rate controlled IV infusion set. The maintenance infusion was initiated in hospital immediately upon completion of the loading dose.</description>

The statistic used to test the primary hypothesis was the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test statistic stratified by transport vehicle.</groups_desc>
