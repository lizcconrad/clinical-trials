      This study will evaluate the safety of and immune responses to a dendritic cell vaccination
      for HIV-1 infection. The vaccine will be made from a patient's own cells combined with small
      fragments of HIV-1 (made synthetically in a laboratory). These cells will be administered
      back to the patient either into a vein (intravenously) or the skin (subcutaneously).

    <textblock>
      Untreated HIV-1 infection is characterized by progressive immune dysfunction and the
      development of opportunistic infections and AIDS-associated malignancies. Highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in suppressing HIV replication and
      restoring partial immune function. However, HIV-specific immunity remains poor, as evidenced
      by rapid rebound of HIV-1 RNA following HAART withdrawal. Studies of individuals with acute
      HIV-1 infection, as well as those who are long-term nonprogressors, have suggested that
      robust HIV-specific immune responses are associated with control of HIV-1 viremia. Dendritic
      cells (DCs) are potent antigen presenting cells that may increase HIV-specific immune
      responses. This protocol will evaluate the use of DCs to help control HIV infection.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either intravenous or subcutaneous administration of
      HIV antigen expressing DCs. Each subject will receive two administrations of mature DCs given
      3 weeks apart. Subjects will be followed weekly for 8 weeks, then at Weeks 12, 16, 24, 36,
      and 48. Two doses of DCs will be evaluated (low dose: 1-3 million cells; high dose: 5-10
      million cells) for safety and immune system response.
