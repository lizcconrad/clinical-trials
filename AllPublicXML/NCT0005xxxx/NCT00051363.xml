      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

      BACKGROUND:

      Nasal CPAP therapy is in widespread use as the primary treatment for OSAS, a sleep-related
      breathing disorder affecting more than 15 million Americans. The therapeutic effectiveness of
      CPAP in providing significant, stable, and long-term neurocognitive or other functional
      benefits to patients with OSAS has not been systematically investigated.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study is a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled, multi-center trial of CPAP therapy. The
      principal aims of the study are: 1) to assess the long-term effectiveness of CPAP therapy on
      neurocognitive function, mood, sleepiness, and quality of life by administering tests of
      these indices to subjects randomly assigned to active or sham CPAP; 2) to identify specific
      neurocognitive deficits associated with OSAS in a large, heterogeneous subject population; 3)
      to determine which deficits in neurocognitive function in OSAS subjects are reversible and
      most sensitive to the effects of CPAP; 4) to develop a composite multivariate outcome measure
      from the results of this study that can be used to assess the clinical effectiveness of CPAP
      in improving neurocognitive function, mood, sleepiness, and quality of life; and 5) to use
      functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare cortical activation before and after CPAP
      therapy, and to assess whether this change is associated with improvement in specific
      neurocognitive task performance. The primary endpoint of the study is the effect of six
      months of CPAP treatment on neurocognitive function. A total of 1100 subjects (550 per
      treatment group) will be enrolled from the patient populations at five sites (Stanford
      University; University of Arizona; Brigham and Women's Hospital; Massachusetts; St. Luke's
      Hospital, Missouri; St. Mary Medical Center, Washington).

    <measure>Effect of CPAP on Neurocognitive Function: E/F Function- SWMT-OMD</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months and 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>There are three primary measures of neurocognitive function measured for APPLES, each representing a different domain: Executive and Frontal-lobe (E/F) Function- Sustained Working Memory Test Overall Mid-Day Index (SWMT-OMD), Attention and Psychomotor (A/P) Function- Pathfinder Number Test Total Time (PFN-TOTL), and Learning and Memory (L/M) Function- Buschke Selective Reminding Test Sum Recall (BSRT-SR).
This is domain #1: Executive and Frontal-lobe (E/F) Function- Sustained Working Memory Test Overall Mid-Day Index (SWMT-OMD)
SWMT-OMD is a scaled score that indicates whether the participant scored lower or higher relative to baseline using standard deviation units. It is computed as the mean of three sub-scores, one based on working memory (WM) task performance (behavioral WM sub-score: speed, accuracy), and the other two on electroencephalogram (EEG) (cortical activation sub-score: neural workload, attentional effort during WM task; alertness sub-score: resting alertness).</description>

    <measure>Executive and Frontal-Lobe (E/F) Function: Sustained Working Memory Test- Mid-day Behavioral Index (SWMT-BehMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months and 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The APPLES a priori Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis Plan specified a dimension reduction method to reduce twelve secondary neurocognitive variables from three neurocognitive domains to seven variables from three neurocognitive domains. Three of the selected variables came from the domain of Executive and Frontal-Lobe (E/F) Function: SWMT-BehMD, SWMT-ActMD, and SAT-D-NumRuCh.
These data are for variable #1: Sustained Working Memory Test- Mid-day Behavioral Index (SWMT-BehMD)
SWMT-BehMD is a scaled score that indicates whether the participant scored lower or higher relative to baseline using standard deviation units. It is computed as the difference from baseline relative to measures of working memory (WM) task performance accuracy (percent correct) and mean and standard deviation of reaction time (milliseconds). High-load WM tasks receive twice the weight of the low-load WM tasks.</description>

These data are for variable #2: SWMT- Mid-day Activation Index (SWMT-ActMD)
SWMT-ActMD is a scaled score that indicates whether the participant scored lower or higher relative to baseline (BL) using standard deviation units. It is computed as the difference from BL relative to EEG power spectral variables (decibels) measured during the easier vs. more difficult working memory (WM) tasks. A positive activation sub-score indicates a larger cortical neuronal population was recruited to perform the more difficult WM task relative to BL, while a negative score indicates a smaller population was recruited.</description>

    <measure>Objective Sleepiness/Alertness: Maintenance of Wakefulness Test- Mean Sleep Latency (MWT-MSL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at diagnostic visit (baseline) and 2 months and 6 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Objective sleepiness/alertness was measured using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT); the outcome variable was MWT Mean Sleep Latency (MWT-MSL).
The MWT was administered using four twenty-minute trials where the participant was asked to sit in a chair, in a quiet and dimly lit room, with instructions to stay awake. Trials were performed at 10 AM, Noon, 2 PM and 4 PM. The mean sleep latency was calculated using the 4 trials from a given visit, and required that at least 3 of the 4 trials were performed and validated.</description>

    <description>Subjective sleepiness/alertness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); the outcome variable was ESS Total Score (ESS-TS).
The ESS is a validated questionnaire (8 questions) that ask the chances of dozing off in specific situations. Summing the scores produces a scaled total score between 0 and 24, with higher numbers indicating more subjective sleepiness. The ESS was administered the evening before the polysomnogram (PSG), or overnight sleep study. Data reported here include questionnaires collected at the DX, 2M, and 6M visits.</description>

    <description>Quality of life was measured using the Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI), which is an interview-administered instrument with high internal consistency and reliability. The SAQLI was designed to assess components identified as important to patients including daily functioning, social interactions, emotional functioning, symptoms experienced, and treatment-related symptoms. Items are scored on a seven-point scale, averaged (taking into account treatment-related symptoms), to yield a composite score between 1 and 7, where higher scores represent better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Effect of CPAP on Neurocognitive Function: E/F Function- SWMT-OMD</title>
        <description>There are three primary measures of neurocognitive function measured for APPLES, each representing a different domain: Executive and Frontal-lobe (E/F) Function- Sustained Working Memory Test Overall Mid-Day Index (SWMT-OMD), Attention and Psychomotor (A/P) Function- Pathfinder Number Test Total Time (PFN-TOTL), and Learning and Memory (L/M) Function- Buschke Selective Reminding Test Sum Recall (BSRT-SR).
This is domain #1: Executive and Frontal-lobe (E/F) Function- Sustained Working Memory Test Overall Mid-Day Index (SWMT-OMD)
SWMT-OMD is a scaled score that indicates whether the participant scored lower or higher relative to baseline using standard deviation units. It is computed as the mean of three sub-scores, one based on working memory (WM) task performance (behavioral WM sub-score: speed, accuracy), and the other two on electroencephalogram (EEG) (cortical activation sub-score: neural workload, attentional effort during WM task; alertness sub-score: resting alertness).</description>

          <description>There are three primary measures of neurocognitive function measured for APPLES, each representing a different domain: Executive and Frontal-lobe (E/F) Function- Sustained Working Memory Test Overall Mid-Day Index (SWMT-OMD), Attention and Psychomotor (A/P) Function- Pathfinder Number Test Total Time (PFN-TOTL), and Learning and Memory (L/M) Function- Buschke Selective Reminding Test Sum Recall (BSRT-SR).
This is domain #1: Executive and Frontal-lobe (E/F) Function- Sustained Working Memory Test Overall Mid-Day Index (SWMT-OMD)
SWMT-OMD is a scaled score that indicates whether the participant scored lower or higher relative to baseline using standard deviation units. It is computed as the mean of three sub-scores, one based on working memory (WM) task performance (behavioral WM sub-score: speed, accuracy), and the other two on electroencephalogram (EEG) (cortical activation sub-score: neural workload, attentional effort during WM task; alertness sub-score: resting alertness).</description>

        <description>The APPLES a priori Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis Plan specified a dimension reduction method to reduce twelve secondary neurocognitive variables from three neurocognitive domains to seven variables from three neurocognitive domains. Three of the selected variables came from the domain of Executive and Frontal-Lobe (E/F) Function: SWMT-BehMD, SWMT-ActMD, and SAT-D-NumRuCh.
These data are for variable #1: Sustained Working Memory Test- Mid-day Behavioral Index (SWMT-BehMD)
SWMT-BehMD is a scaled score that indicates whether the participant scored lower or higher relative to baseline using standard deviation units. It is computed as the difference from baseline relative to measures of working memory (WM) task performance accuracy (percent correct) and mean and standard deviation of reaction time (milliseconds). High-load WM tasks receive twice the weight of the low-load WM tasks.</description>

          <title>Executive and Frontal-Lobe (E/F) Function: Sustained Working Memory Test- Mid-day Behavioral Index (SWMT-BehMD)</title>
          <description>The APPLES a priori Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis Plan specified a dimension reduction method to reduce twelve secondary neurocognitive variables from three neurocognitive domains to seven variables from three neurocognitive domains. Three of the selected variables came from the domain of Executive and Frontal-Lobe (E/F) Function: SWMT-BehMD, SWMT-ActMD, and SAT-D-NumRuCh.
These data are for variable #1: Sustained Working Memory Test- Mid-day Behavioral Index (SWMT-BehMD)
SWMT-BehMD is a scaled score that indicates whether the participant scored lower or higher relative to baseline using standard deviation units. It is computed as the difference from baseline relative to measures of working memory (WM) task performance accuracy (percent correct) and mean and standard deviation of reaction time (milliseconds). High-load WM tasks receive twice the weight of the low-load WM tasks.</description>

        <title>Objective Sleepiness/Alertness: Maintenance of Wakefulness Test- Mean Sleep Latency (MWT-MSL)</title>
        <description>Objective sleepiness/alertness was measured using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT); the outcome variable was MWT Mean Sleep Latency (MWT-MSL).
The MWT was administered using four twenty-minute trials where the participant was asked to sit in a chair, in a quiet and dimly lit room, with instructions to stay awake. Trials were performed at 10 AM, Noon, 2 PM and 4 PM. The mean sleep latency was calculated using the 4 trials from a given visit, and required that at least 3 of the 4 trials were performed and validated.</description>

        <population>Analyses conducted in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. Analyses performed by OSA severity level categorized by apnea hypopnea index (AHI: # of respiratory events/hr of sleep) obtained via baseline polysomnography. Categories are: Mild OSA (AHI = 10-14.9; exclusion if AHI &lt;10), Moderate OSA (AHI = 15-29.9), Severe OSA (AHI &gt;=30).</population>

        <title>Subjective Sleepiness/Alertness: Epworth Sleepiness Scale- Total Score (ESS-TS)</title>
        <description>Subjective sleepiness/alertness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); the outcome variable was ESS Total Score (ESS-TS).
The ESS is a validated questionnaire (8 questions) that ask the chances of dozing off in specific situations. Summing the scores produces a scaled total score between 0 and 24, with higher numbers indicating more subjective sleepiness. The ESS was administered the evening before the polysomnogram (PSG), or overnight sleep study. Data reported here include questionnaires collected at the DX, 2M, and 6M visits.</description>

        <description>Quality of life was measured using the Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI), which is an interview-administered instrument with high internal consistency and reliability. The SAQLI was designed to assess components identified as important to patients including daily functioning, social interactions, emotional functioning, symptoms experienced, and treatment-related symptoms. Items are scored on a seven-point scale, averaged (taking into account treatment-related symptoms), to yield a composite score between 1 and 7, where higher scores represent better quality of life.</description>

        <population>Analyses performed for group of participants with SAQLI data. Baseline demographics were generally similar (mean age, sex ratio, proportion of white participants, average body mass index), and participants in both groups had similar SAQLI scores at baseline, which are presented below.</population>
