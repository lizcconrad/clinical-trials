  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug ABR-217620 is a combination of two proteins, one that recognizes tumor cells and one
      that triggers an attack on the tumor cells by activating some white blood cells belonging to
      the body's normal immune system. In animals, this results in an accumulation of white blood
      cells in the cancer that can fight the cancer. This study will test how much of the drug can
      be given to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, or
      pancreatic cancer without causing unacceptable side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer,
             which is refractory to (progressed on or following) currently available standard
             therapies. Patients must have received (or declined) at least one standard regimen for
             advanced/metastatic disease.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

             equal to 1500/mm3, and platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin
             greater than or equal to 10 g/dL.

          -  Adequate renal function: creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin less than or equal to 2 x upper limit of normal,
             and SGOT (S-ASAT) and SGPT (S-ALAT) less than or equal to 2.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or any concurrent malignancy, with the exception of the following
             malignancies, which may still be included: non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical cancer
             in situ, DCIS or LCIS of breast, past history of resected melanoma without clinical
             evidence of recurrent melanoma, past history of prostate cancer without clinical
