    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the overall survival of patients diagnosed with
      Stage 3b or 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an oral Farnesyl Protein
      Transferase Inhibitor (Lonafarnib/SCH 66336) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin
      with that of patients treated with placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin.
