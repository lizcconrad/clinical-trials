      RATIONALE: CP-724,714 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for tumor cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of CP-724,714 in treating patients who have
      metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of CP-724,714 in patients with metastatic
           HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, any antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship of drug-related adverse events to pharmacokinetic exposure
           parameters in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship of changes in serum HER2 extracellular domain and HER2
           receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation to pharmacokinetic exposure parameters and
           clinical outcome in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral CP-724,714 on days 1 and 3-21 during course 1 and then daily during
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CP-724,714 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
