      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from monoclonal antibodies combined with tumor cells may make the
      body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating
      patients who have ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of varying routes and doses of monoclonal antibody ACA125
           anti-idiotype vaccine in patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal
           cancer.

        -  Determine an optimal dose and route of this vaccine for a phase II study.

        -  Determine the immune response induced by this vaccination in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to development of objective tumor response in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose monoclonal antibody ACA125 anti-idiotype vaccine
           (MOAB ACA125) intramuscularly (IM) on weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 14 in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose MOAB ACA125 IM as in arm I.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive lower-dose MOAB ACA125 subcutaneously (SC) on weeks 0, 2, 4,
           6, 10, and 14 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive higher-dose MOAB ACA125 SC as in arm III. Patients are followed
           every 6-12 weeks for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (10 patients per cohort) will be accrued for this
      study.
