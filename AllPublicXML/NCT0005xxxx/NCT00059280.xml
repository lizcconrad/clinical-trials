  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease type II, &quot;GSD-II&quot;) is caused by a
      deficiency of a critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally,
      GAA is used by the body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within
      specialized structures called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount
      of glycogen accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal
      muscle, which prevents their normal function. This study is being conducted to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) as a potential
      enzyme replacement therapy for Pompe disease. Patients diagnosed with infantile-onset Pompe
      disease who are less than or equal to 6 months old will be studied.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  The patient or the patient's legal guardian(s) must provide written informed consent
             prior to any study-related procedures being performed;

          -  The patient must have clinical symptoms (documented in his or her medical record) of
             infantile-onset Pompe disease. In addition, the patient must have: a. an endogenous
             GAA activity less than 1% of the mean of the normal range as assessed in cultured skin
             fibroblasts; AND b. cardiomyopathy (LVMI greater than 65 g/m2) by echocardiography;

          -  The patient must be no older than 26 weeks and 0 days, when he/she receives the first
             dose of rhGAA;

          -  The patient and his/her legal guardian(s) must have the ability to comply with the
             clinical protocol.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Symptoms of respiratory insufficiency, including: a. Oxygen saturation less than 90%
             in room air as measured by pulse oximetry; OR b. venous PCO2 greater than 55 mmHg on
             room air OR arterial PCO2 greater than 40 mmHg on room air; c. any ventilator use at
             the time of enrollment;

          -  Major congenital abnormality;

          -  Clinically significant organic disease (with the exception of symptoms relating to
             Pompe disease), including clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary,
             neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious intercurrent
             illness, or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             preclude participation in the trial or potentially decrease survival;

          -  Use of any investigational product within 30 days prior to study enrollment;

          -  Received enzyme replacement therapy with GAA from any source.
