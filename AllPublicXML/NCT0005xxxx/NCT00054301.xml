      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving radiation
      during surgery followed by external-beam radiation to the entire breast may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy during surgery
      followed by whole-breast radiation therapy in treating women who have undergone lumpectomy
      for ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of intraoperative radiotherapy boost to the tumor bed on acute
           complications after lumpectomy (before whole breast irradiation) in women with ductal
           carcinoma in situ or invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast.

        -  Determine the local recurrence rates in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the cosmetic outcome in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo excisional biopsy or surgery followed by an intraoperative dose of
      radiation to the tumor cavity. Postoperatively, patients undergo external beam radiotherapy
      to the entire breast 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.

      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
