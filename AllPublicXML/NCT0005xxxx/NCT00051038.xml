        -  Documented history of co-infection with HIV and HBV

          -  Stable Anti Retroviral Therapy regimen containing lamivudine 150 mg BID for at least
             24 weeks prior to enrollment;

          -  Documented HBV viremia on screening and at least at 4 weeks prior to screening

          -  HBe Ag-positive or HBe Ag-negative / anti-HBe-positive

          -  HIV viral load below 400 copies/mL by the Roche Amplicor(TM) 1.5 HIV PCR assay at
             screening and equally low at least 12 weeks prior to screening

          -  Absence of Co-Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis D virus (HDV)

          -  Absence of other forms of liver disease e.g., alcoholic, autoimmune, biliary disease

          -  Less that 1/2 weeks of prior therapy with nucleoside/nucleotide analogue (excluding
             lamivudine) with activity against HBV (including e.g. famciclovir, tenofovir,
