      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational
      chemotherapy agent in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

      Patients will be enrolled in the study after all study-specific entry criteria are met and
      informed consent is obtained. Patients will be required to attend regular clinic visits to
      receive study medication and have their status monitored. Patients will also be required to
      have radiologic tumor assessments performed at multiple times throughout the study. A
      detailed explanation can be provided by the study physician (Investigator) conducting this
      study. Trabectedin at a starting dose of 0.58 mg/m2 will be given to patients intravenously
      (i.v). as a 3-hour infusion every week for 3 weeks (on Days 1, 8, and 15) of a 4 week cycle
      via a central venous catheter (also referred to as a &quot;central line&quot; which is a tube ie,
      &quot;catheter&quot; placed into a large vein). All patients will receive dexamethasone 10 mg i.v. 30
      minutes prior to each trabectedin infusion. Patients may receive multiple cycles of
      trabectedin in the absence of disease progression.
