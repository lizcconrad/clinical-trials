    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) in
      controlling Crohn's disease symptoms as patients taper their corticosteroid dose. Crohn's
      disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Patients commonly have chronic diarrhea with
      abdominal pain, loss of appetite and weight loss. Acute disease flares are treated with large
      doses of corticosteroids, but long-term use of these drugs can have harmful side effects. ECP
      (described below), is approved to treat skin symptoms associated with a type of cancer called
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and has been used experimentally in conditions involving abnormal
      inflammation.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have had Crohn's disease for at least 6 months, who
      are corticosteroid-dependent, and whose symptoms are controlled well enough so that their
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is less than 220, may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and review of medical records, physical
      examination, electrocardiogram, blood tests, urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing
      potential, and a questionnaire about how Crohn's disease affects their life and activities.

      Patients with a CDAI score of less than 150 will begin ECP treatments as soon as possible.
      Those with scores from 150 to 219 will have their corticosteroid dose increased enough to
      bring their CDAI score to below 150 before beginning ECP. Patients who do not achieve a CDAI
      of less than 150 after 4 to 6 weeks of increased corticosteroids will be excluded from the
      study.

      Participants will have ECP treatments for 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, for
      a total of 26 treatments. For ECP, patients undergo leukapheresis, a method of collecting
      large numbers of white blood cells, or leukocytes-cells that may be responsible for many of
      the medical problems in Crohn's disease. Whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm
      vein, similar to donating a unit of blood. The blood flows through a machine that separates
      it into its components by spinning. The white cells are removed and collected in a plastic
      bag, and the red blood cells and plasma are returned to the patient's bloodstream through the
      same needle. The collected white cells are mixed with a drug called UVADEXÂ® (Registered
      Trademark), exposed to ultraviolet (UVA) light, and then returned to the patients'
      bloodstream. (The UVADEX allows the blood cells to absorb more UVA.) The UVA changes the
      cells in a way that, once they are back in the body, they cause changes in other cells like
      them. Each ECP treatment takes 3 to 4 hours. On the first day of each 2-day treatment,
      patients will undergo a review of symptoms, check of vital signs, and blood draw. They will
      complete a CDAI diary for 7 days before the first of the two ECP treatments and a
      questionnaire about their life and activities at 4-week intervals. During the ECP treatment
      period, corticosteroids will be slowly reduced as long as disease symptoms do not worsen.

      Patients whose disease remains under control with cessation of all steroids may begin
      maintenance ECP, 2 days in a row every 4 weeks for an additional 20 weeks (another 10
      treatments), with the same follow-up as described above, and a full physical examination 4
      weeks after the final treatment. Patients who were able to reduce, but not stop, steroid
      treatment may be considered for maintenance therapy if it is thought that continuing
      treatment may enable further reduction of steroids. Patients whose disease symptoms worsen
      with ECP or who have not been able to decrease their steroid dose will not be eligible for
      maintenance therapy and their participation in the study will end.

      This protocol aims to measure the safety and effectiveness of extracorporeal photopheresis
      (ECP) therapy for maintaining remission of symptoms during withdrawal of corticosteroids from
      patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Potential subjects will be asymptomatic or
      have a low level of symptoms that respond to an increase in their steroid dose; furthermore
      potential subjects will be dependent on steroids to control their symptoms and have a history
      of failing other immunosuppressive drugs to control their symptoms.

      This is an unblinded, single-arm study of ECP in Crohn's disease. This trial will use ECP
      twice a week every two weeks over 24 weeks during which time the dose of corticosteroids will
      be tapered. If the corticosteroids are able to be withdrawn without an increase in symptoms,
      then subjects may be eligible for further ECP (twice a week every four weeks over 24 weeks)
      as a maintenance regimen.

      Outcome parameters include the rates of complete and partial steroid tapering while
      maintaining remission, the rates of adverse events, and secondary clinical outcomes such as
      duration of response, rate of and time to relapse, and changes in symptom index scores. In
      addition, the NIH will perform a substudy that includes serial colonoscopy to measure
      cytokine and cell population changes in mononuclear cells extracted from biopsies.

      The long-term goals of this study are to test the safety and efficacy of ECP as a
      steroid-sparing and remittive therapy in Crohn's disease, to determine the immune response it
      effects in the gut mucosa, and identify factors associated with responders versus
      non-responders to ECP.
