      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either Systems Training for Emotional
      Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) or treatment as usual (TAU) for 20 weeks. STEPPS
      is a new cognitive behavioral treatment which involves skills training for emotion management
      and lifestyle behaviors as well as education for the affected individual's family members,
      friends, and professional caregivers. Participants are assessed at baseline and Weeks 4, 8,
      12, 16, and 20. Interviews of patient's health care providers and family members and
      self-rating scales are used to assess patients. Follow-up assessments are made 1, 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 months after study completion. Participants must live within a reasonable driving
      distance of Iowa City, IA.
