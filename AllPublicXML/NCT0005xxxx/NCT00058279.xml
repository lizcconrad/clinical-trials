      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as MDX-010, work in different ways to stimulate the
      immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white
      blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with interleukin-2 may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining monoclonal antibody therapy
      with interleukin-2 in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
           antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-CTLA4) in combination with high-dose interleukin-2
           (IL-2) in patients with metastatic melanoma. (Phase I is closed to accrual as of
           4/13/2004).

        -  Determine the activity of MDX-CTLA4 administered at the MTD with high-dose IL-2 in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether the administration of IL-2 alters the pharmacokinetics of MDX-CTLA4 in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of anti-cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody (MDX-CTLA4).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive MDX-CTLA4 IV on days 0, 21, and 42. Patients also receive
           high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 15 doses
           beginning on days 22 and 43. Treatment repeats every 63 days for up to 3 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an ongoing
           partial response and no greater than grade 1 toxicity may receive additional courses of
           therapy. Patients who require discontinuation of MDX-CTLA4 due to toxicity may continue
           receiving IL-2 at the discretion of the investigator.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MDX-CTLA4 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (Phase I is closed to accrual as of
      4/13/2004).

        -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD of MDX-CTLA4. Patients who
           achieve a partial or complete response and later develop recurrent or progressive
           disease may be retreated at the same dose.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-51 patients (3-18 for phase I and 19-33 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study within 1 year. (Phase I is closed to accrual as of 4/13/2004).
