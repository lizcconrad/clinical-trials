    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Confirmed Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate Based on Bubley Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Day 1 of Cycles 1-17, and at 30 days after the last dose of pertuzumab</time_frame>
    <description>Response by tumor measurement occurred if there was documented and confirmed CR or PR. Response was assessed by both the RECIST and by PSA levels measurement, based on measurable or non-measurable disease at baseline. Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter. A PSA response was defined as a PSA decline of greater than or equal to (â‰¥) 50%, which had to be confirmed by a second PSA value at least 4 weeks later.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan Meier Estimate of Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Per RECIST, disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death (Progression Free Survival [PFS])</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Day 1 of Cycles 1-17, and at 30 days after the last dose of pertuzumab</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the first day of study drug treatment to the time of documented disease progression or death, whichever came first. Participants who were lost to follow-up or who had not progressed at the time of study completion or early termination were censored at the date of last tumor assessment. The percentage of participants experiencing disease progression or death was calculated as the number of participants with an event divided by the number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Progressed at 3, 6 and 9 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Per RECIST, disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Percentage of participants who were free from disease progression was calculated by subtracting the number of participants with disease progression at that time point from the total population at risk of disease progression, multiplied by 100.</description>

Pertuzumab was administered as an IV infusion every 3 weeks for up to 1 year (17 cycles) for participants who showed no evidence of progression. Participants with evidence of disease progression could have continued pertuzumab therapy, at the discretion of the investigator, if they had improvement in pain without an increase in narcotic use and if they had no other therapeutic options.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Confirmed Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate Based on Bubley Criteria</title>
          <description>Response by tumor measurement occurred if there was documented and confirmed CR or PR. Response was assessed by both the RECIST and by PSA levels measurement, based on measurable or non-measurable disease at baseline. Per RECIST, CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter. A PSA response was defined as a PSA decline of greater than or equal to (â‰¥) 50%, which had to be confirmed by a second PSA value at least 4 weeks later.</description>
          <population>Efficacy analysis population: All participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and either underwent at least 1 postbaseline assessment of response or died within 30 days after the last study treatment before any evaluation of response.</population>

          <description>All the participants received a loading dose of 840 mg of pertuzumab on Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed by 420 mg on Day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle. Pertuzumab was administered as an IV infusion every 3 weeks for up to 1 year (17 cycles) for participants who showed no evidence of progression. Participants with evidence of disease progression could have continued pertuzumab therapy, at the discretion of the investigator, if they had improvement in pain without an increase in narcotic use and if they had no other therapeutic options.</description>
