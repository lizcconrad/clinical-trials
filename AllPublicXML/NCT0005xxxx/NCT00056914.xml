  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop new techniques for optimizing resolution in magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) with a high magnetic field of 7 Tesla. MRI is a diagnostic tool that generates
      high-quality images of the body without the use of x-rays. It can also provide information
      about brain chemistry and physiology. The test is routinely done at magnetic field strengths
      of from 1.5 to 4 Tesla. This study will use an investigational device that operates at a high
      magnetic field of 7 Tesla. Except for the increase in magnetic field, all other aspects of
      imaging are the same as those at lower magnetic fields. This study will use techniques in
      conjunction with the higher magnetic field that may improve diagnostic imaging. The MRI will
      monitor the brain at high resolution to see structural features, to measure brain chemicals,
      and to determine how much and how fast blood flows into brain regions in response to simple
      tasks.

      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may participate in this study. Candidates
      will be screened with a medical history, neurological examination, and questionnaire.

      Participants will have a standard 1.5 or 3 Tesla MRI before the 7 Tesla scan, adding about 5
      minutes to the procedure. The procedure for both scans is the same. The subject lies on a
      table that is moved into the scanner. Because the machine makes loud sounds during the
      imaging, earplugs are provided to help reduce the noise. An insulated wire coil may be placed
      around the subject's head to obtain better images. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3
      hours, with most examinations lasting between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan, the subject
      may be asked to perform simple tasks, such as listening to tones, tapping fingers, moving a
      hand, watching a movie on a screen, or smelling pleasant odors. More complex tasks may
      require thinking about tones or pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons.
      Following the test, subjects will complete a brief questionnaire about comfort level and any
      unusual sensations they may have experienced during the test.

      Participants who undergo repeated MRIs for the evaluation of new techniques will have a
      standard 1.5 or 3 Tesla MRI brain study once a year while participating in the research
      protocol. A radiologist at NIH will read the MRIs, and if any abnormalities are discovered,
      the individual will be referred to his or her private physician or to a consult service at
      NIH.

      The goal of this protocol is to optimize new technology that enables Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) at a static magnetic field strength of 7 Tesla (7T). Techniques will be
      developed for anatomical, functional, and spectroscopic MRI that can take advantage of this
      high field. Routine clinical MRI has been performed at 1.5T for over twenty years and over
      the past ten years MRI at 3-4T has demonstrated large increases in sensitivity and is
      beginning to find widespread application for functional imaging of the brain and clinical
      research. Since the late 1990's it has been possible to produce magnets with field strengths
      between 7-9T large enough for human use. Indeed there are presently two sites with 7T and one
      with 8T MRI that have begun to produce exciting images. These initial results confirm that
      MRI can be performed safely at these high field strengths and that the whole range of MRI
      experiments can be performed. We will take delivery of the first 7T MRI system produced by
      General Electric, the leading producer of MRI equipment, sometime in late 2002/early 2003.

      Compared to 3-4T, the 7T scanner is expected to improve sensitivity by a factor of two and
      improve contrast to noise for functional imaging and spectroscopy by a factor of two - four.
      However, realizing these goals for routine practice and whole brain coverage will require
      technical developments and integrating these developments into optimized data acquisition and
      processing strategies. Therefore, we plan to extend parallel imaging strategies, currently
      becoming available for 3T MRI, to 7T in order to realize the full gain in sensitivity and
      apply these techniques to obtain high resolution anatomical MRI, generate high temporal and
      spatial resolution perfusion images using arterial spin labeling techniques, generate
      high-temporal and spatial resolution functional images of the brain using blood oxygenation
      (BOLD) and perfusion based techniques, and test the usefulness of 7T for spectroscopic
      studies of metabolites of the brain. All of these developments will be performed on normal,
      healthy volunteers.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Only neurologically and psychiatrically normal, male or female, healthy volunteers over 18
        years old will be used in these studies. Subjects must be capable of understanding the
        procedures and requirements of this study. Subjects must be willing to sign an informed
        consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject will be excluded if he/she has a contraindication to MR scanning such as the
        following: pregnancy, aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted cardiac
        pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings
        or insulin pump), dental work such as crowns or bridges with indeterminate metals,
        pre-existing eye conditions, and any pre-existing hearing problems. Subjects who underwent
        brain surgery, who have a neurological lesion, a psychiatric history or a history of
        migraine will also be excluded from this study. The contraindications for MRI at 7T are
        identical to those at 1.5T and 3T.
