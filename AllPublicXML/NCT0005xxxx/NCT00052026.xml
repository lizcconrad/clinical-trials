  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new medicine, called carvedilol, improves
      symptoms and heart function in children who have congestive heart failure (diminished
      function of their heart muscle that pumps blood to the body). To accomplish this, we will
      give carvedilol to some patients who have diminished heart function and congestive heart
      failure and see whether symptoms and heart function are better at the end of an 8 month
      period in those who received carvedilol compared to the other patients who did not receive
      carvedilol. We will be testing 2 different doses of carvedilol compared to no additional
      medicine.

      Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is thought to contribute to the
      pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF). Blockade of the sympathetic nervous system
      with β-adrenergic inhibitors could be expected to ameliorate these detrimental effects in a
      manner analogous to the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the
      overactive renin-angiotensin system.

      Carvedilol may be superior to pure beta-blockers in the treatment of CHF through its
      mechanism of action of blocking not only β-receptors but also α-receptors, which would allow
      vasodilation to reduce the afterload on the failing heart. Since beta-blockers may initially
      produce a negative inotropic effect on the heart, long term treatment has been needed to show
      benefits of removal of the adrenergic stimulation. The investigators will monitor the safety
      and efficacy of carvedilol administration in children with chronic CHF due to systemic
      ventricular dysfunction.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Male or female children from birth through 17 years of age with chronic symptomatic
             CHF due to systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction who are receiving standard heart
             failure therapy will be eligible. Since adolescents with left ventricular dysfunction
             are very similar to adults with this disease, this study will focus recruitment in the
             prepubertal age group of children, including children from birth through Tanner Stage
             3. The number of adolescents enrolled will be limited to approximately 10% of study
             enrollment. However, teenagers with single ventricles or morphologic right ventricles
             as systemic ventricles represent an important population that is unique to pediatric
             cardiology. The 10% limitation will only apply to teenagers who have dilated
             cardiomyopathies since these patients may be similar to young adults with dilated
             cardiomyopathies. Adolescents will be defined as Tanner Stage 4 through age 17.

          2. A diagnosis of CHF by NYHA Class II-IV (generally, children older than 5 years of age)
             or Ross' classification of CHF Class II-IV (12) (generally, children less than 5 years
             old) for at least 1 month (at least 2 weeks, for neonates) prior to screening.

          3. An estimated ejection fraction less than 40% in patients with systemic left
             ventricular dysfunction or qualitative evidence of a dilated ventricle with moderate
             systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with right ventricular or single
             ventricular physiology, documented within 4 weeks of randomization. Patients may be
             enrolled based on these criteria as determined by the site. However, all
             echocardiograms will be reviewed and interpreted by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)
             at the University of Utah. Upon subsequent review by the DCC, if it is determined that
             either the ejection fraction is greater than or equal to 40% or the ventricular
             function is not moderate to severely decreased, patients will be enrolled. However,
             their data analysis will be based upon the findings from the DCC at the University of
             Utah.

          4. The etiology of the cardiomyopathy will include idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy,
             post-viral myocarditis cardiomyopathy, anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, ischemic
             cardiomyopathies (e.g., Kawasaki's disease, repaired anomalous left coronary artery
             arising from the pulmonary artery, d-TGA s/p arterial switch), cardiomyopathies
             associated with single ventricle with ventricular systolic dysfunction, corrected
             transposition, etc. Excluded from enrollment will be dilated cardiomyopathies
             secondary to muscular dystrophies, hemoglobinopathies, HIV, carnitine deficiency, and
             systemic ventricular dysfunction due to ventricular outflow obstruction.

          5. Patients undergoing treatment for CHF with standard CHF therapy, such as diuretic,
             digoxin and ACE inhibitors. All patients should be receiving ACE inhibitors prior to
             enrollment in this study unless contraindicated or intolerant. If intolerance has been
             established, the patient must have been withdrawn from these drugs for at least one
             month prior to randomization. Other medications such as hydralazine, nitrates or
             amiodarone may also be used. Therapy with amiodarone should not have started or
             stopped within 2 months of randomization.

          6. All patients should be receiving diuretics prior to enrollment in this study unless
             contraindicated or intolerant. Patients must be in optimal fluid status prior to
             enrollment.

          7. Patients must be receiving a stable regimen of standard CHF medications for a period
             of at least one month (2 weeks in neonates) at the time of randomization into the
             study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients with any of the following will be excluded from the study:

          1. NYHA or Ross' CHF Classification Class I (asymptomatic).

          2. Patients actively listed for transplantation at time of entry into the study or
             anticipated to undergo heart transplantation or corrective heart surgery during the 8
             months following entry into the study. However, those patients in whom listing for
             transplantation is anticipated but may be waiting a long period of time (greater than
             8 months), such as Status 2 patients, may be considered for enrollment in this study.

          3. Sustained or symptomatic ventricular dysrhythmias uncontrolled by drug therapy or the
             use of an implantable defibrillator, and/or significant cardiac conduction defects,
             e.g., 2nd degree or 3rd degree AV block, or sick sinus syndrome, unless a functioning
             pacemaker is in place.

          4. Uncorrected primary obstructive or severe regurgitative valvular disease, nondilated
             (restrictive) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or significant systemic ventricular
             outflow obstruction.

          5. Dilated cardiomyopathies secondary to muscular dystrophies, hemoglobinopathies, HIV,
             carnitine deficiency, and systemic ventricular dysfunction due to ventricular outflow
             obstruction.

          6. Active myocarditis.

          7. Unacceptable blood pressures and heart rates. Sitting (supine in infants) systolic
             blood pressure must be &gt; 85 mm Hg in teens, &gt; 75 mm Hg in school-aged children, and &gt;
             65 mm Hg in infants (12). Resting heart rate must be greater than the 2nd percentile
             for age (13).

          8. Renovascular hypertension or evidence of pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular
             resistance index &gt; 6 Wood units-m2) unresponsive to vasodilator agents such as oxygen,
             nitroprusside, or nitric oxide.

          9. History or current clinical evidence of moderate-to-severe obstructive pulmonary
             disease or reactive airway diseases (e.g., asthma) requiring therapy.

         10. Significant renal (serum creatinine &gt;2.0), hepatic (serum AST and/or ALT &gt; 3 times
             upper limit of normal), gastrointestinal, or biliary disorders that could impair
             absorption, metabolism, or excretion of orally administered medications.

         11. Concurrent terminal illness or other severe disease (e.g., active neoplasm) or other
             significant laboratory value(s) which, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             preclude participation or survival.

         12. Endocrine disorders such as primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, hyper- or
             hypothyroidism, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

         13. Unwillingness or inability to cooperate, or for the parents or guardians to give
             consent, or for the child to give assent, or any condition of sufficient severity to
             impair cooperation in the study.

         14. Girls of child bearing potential who are pregnant, lactating, or sexually active and
             not taking adequate contraceptive precautions (e.g., IUD or oral contraceptives for 3
             months prior to entry into the study).

         15. Use of an investigational drug within 30 days of randomization, or within 5 half-lives
             of the investigational drug (the longer period will apply); investigational vaccines
             or biological agents (e.g., the monoclonal antibody Synagis), may be granted
             exceptions through consultation with the principal investigator and GlaxoSmithKline.

         16. History of drug sensitivity or allergic reaction to a-blockers or ß-blockers.

         17. Use of any of the following medications within two weeks of randomization:

               -  Intravenous ß-adrenergic agonists (including intravenous inotropes such as
                  dobutamine) or intravenous vasodilator agents such as amrinone or milrinone

               -  Intravenous CHF medications (e.g., diuretics, digoxin)

         18. Treatment with b-adrenergic blockers, including sotalol or carvedilol within 2 months
