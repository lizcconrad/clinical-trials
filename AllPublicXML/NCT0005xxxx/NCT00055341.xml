  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pegylated interferon (PEG-interferon) and ribavirin are accepted treatments for hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) infection. However, HCV infection progresses differently in patients who are
      coinfected with HIV and in hemophiliacs. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of
      PEG-interferon and ribavirin for treating HCV in HIV infected hemophiliacs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophiliacs with symptomatic disease often receive blood products to correct clotting factor
      deficiencies. Prior to routine use of heat inactivation and screening of donor blood for
      specific viral pathogens, hemophiliacs were routinely exposed to, and infected with, viruses
      such as hepatitis B (HBV), HCV, and HIV. Studies in hemophiliacs suggest several important
      findings that warrant further investigation, including: 1) hemophiliacs infected with HCV may
      have more rapid progression to liver failure and death; 2) pooled blood concentrate from
      multiple donors leads to a high risk of mixed infection; and 3) different clinical outcomes
      and altered immune responses of HIV coinfected hemophiliacs may enhance understanding of
      mutant virus selection and the associated clinical outcomes. The purpose of this trial is to
      determine response rates to PEG-interferon and ribavirin in hemophiliacs with HCV alone and
      with HCV/HIV coinfection.

      Participants in this study will be followed for 48 weeks on treatment and up to 36 months
      after treatment. Participants in this study will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center
      for 2 days at the beginning of the study. Participants will have 3 additional study visits in
      the first week of the study. After that, study visits occur at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32,
      40, and 48. The follow-up visits will be at 4, 12, and 24 weeks following the end of
      treatment. Study visits include a physical exam and blood tests. Patients who do not respond
      to treatment will be followed in a prospective cohort study for up to 3 additional years so
      that evolution of the virus and associated immune responses can be evaluated.
