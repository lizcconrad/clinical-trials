  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate safety and efficacy of multiple
      subcutaneous doses of DiaPep277 in patients with Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA).
      Study medication will be administered at time 0, 1 and 3 months, and then every 3 months for
      a total of 8 administrations. The total duration of the trial is 24 months (treatment for 18
      months and follow-up for an additional 6 months). Patients will be male or female between the
      ages of 30 and 65 years, inclusive, within 2 to 60 months of the diagnosis of diabetes
      mellitus. Subjects must be positive for glutamic acid decarboxylate (GAD) autoantibodies. At
      the Screen Visit (Visit 2), all subjects will be asked to discontinue their use of all oral
      antidiabetic medications with the exception of metformin. The subjects will be placed on a
      stable regimen of insulin and diet (plus metformin if needed). Prior to the Baseline Visit
      (Visit 3), diabetic control must be achieved by diet and insulin (plus metformin if needed).

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects meeting all of the following inclusion criteria at screening should be considered
        for admission to the study:

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus according to WHO classification for
             more than 2 months and less than 5 years before enrollment.

          -  The subject's diabetes has been controlled by diet and insulin (plus metformin if
             needed) for 2 or more weeks (14 days) prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 3).

          -  The subject is a male or female aged 30 to 65 years. If female and not postmenopausal,
             the subject is not pregnant and will use effective contraceptive methods throughout
             the study.

          -  The subject is positive for GAD autoantibodies, defined as a level greater than the
             99th percentile of the GAD antibody index of a normal control population for the
             laboratory (e.g., GAD antibody index equal to 0.085).

          -  The subject has a fasting C-peptide level 0.30 nmol/L or greater or 0.9 ng/mL at the
             time of the Screen Visit (Visit 1 or 2).

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at screening will not be enrolled
        in the study:

          -  The subject has any significant diseases or conditions, including psychiatric
             disorders and substance abuse that, in the opinion of the site investigator, are
             likely to affect the subject's response to treatment or their ability to complete the
             study.

          -  The subject has a history of any kind of malignant tumor.

          -  The subject has secondary diabetes mellitus.

          -  Within 2 weeks or 14 days of the Baseline Visit or during randomized treatment, the

             diabetes.

          -  The subject has clinical evidence of any diabetes-related complication that in the
             opinion of the site investigator would interfere with the subject's participation in
             and/or completion of the study.

          -  The subject has a history of allergy or asthma that in the opinion of the site
             investigator would interfere with the subject's participation in and completion of the
             study.

          -  The subject has a known immune deficiency from any disease, or a condition associated
             with an immune deficiency.

          -  The subject is receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents or cytotoxic
             therapy, or any medication that, in the opinion of the site investigator, might

          -  The subject has chronic hematologic disease.

          -  The subject has impaired renal function (serum creatinine greater than 1.4 mg/dL).

          -  The subject has severe ketonuria (+++ on urine stix testing; ++ on repeated urine stix
             testing).

          -  The subject has a BMI greater than 40kg/m2.

          -  The subject has hyperlipidemia (fasting serum triglycerides &gt;1000 mg/dL). Suitable
             medical therapy for treatment of hyperlipidemia is allowed.

          -  The subject has received any investigational drug within 3 months prior to Visit 1.
