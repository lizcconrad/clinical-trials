    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical research trial in which intravenous Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1 is a
      vasoactive hormone) will be used as supportive treatment along with the angioplasty procedure
      to treat or open up a blocked artery within one lower limb or the most affected of two limbs
      in subjects with Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease.

      PAOD results in a decrease in arterial blood flow to the lower limb and feet with symptoms
      that can include, pain at rest, a numbing sensation in limb or feet, limited ability to walk
      before pain occurs. PAOD can occur along with diabetic ulcers.

      Proposed treatment will be given at a medical center with an overnight hospital stay.
      Treatment includes angioplasty to open up one or two occluded arteries in a lower limb plus a
      drug (Liprostin) a special formulation of liposomal Prostaglandin E1,or PGE1, a natural
      occuring vasoactive hormone). Drug treatment is given twice to each artery to be treated,
      just before and after angioplasty. When angioplasty procedure is completed, a 12 hour
      intravenous infusion of Liprostin is given to complete the treatment procedure.

      A total of 12 PAOD subjects will be enrolled in a single center: Memorial Hermann Hospital,
      Houston, TX.

      Study will begin in February, 2003 with the last (12th) subject to be enrolled, likely by
      August, 20
