      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have progressive or recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with
           monoclonal antibody Hu1D10.

        -  Determine the duration of response and progression-free survival of patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 IV over 2 hours. Treatment repeats weekly for a
      total of 4 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at weeks 5 and 8 and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 12 months.
