      RATIONALE: Genistein may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for cancer cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of genistein in treating patients with
      localized prostate cancer who are planning to undergo radical prostatectomy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity of genistein in patients with localized prostate cancer treated
           with radical prostatectomy.

        -  Determine the decrease, if any, of prostate-specific antigen-positive cells in the
           operative field of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

        -  Group A: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 1-2 months, undergo radical
           prostatectomy, and then continue oral genistein once daily for 1-2 months afterward (for
           a total of 3 months of therapy).

        -  Group B: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy. Beginning 1 month after surgery,
           patients receive genistein as in arm I for 3 months.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 1 and 3 months after surgery.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 88 patients (44 patients per treatment group) will be accrued
      for this study within 2 years.
