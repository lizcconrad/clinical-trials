      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. Combining chemotherapy with imatinib
      mesylate may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining arsenic trioxide with
      imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of arsenic trioxide and imatinib mesylate in
           patients with resistant chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine potential dose-limiting toxic effects in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily and arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on
      days 1-5 of week 1 and then twice weekly. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients (at least 6 patients for phase I and at least 12
      patients for phase II) will be accrued for this study .
