      The overall purpose of this project is to improve the clinical outcomes of veterans with
      ischemic heart disease (IHD) through implementation of evidence-based lipid management, with
      a particular focus on veterans whose primary lipid abnormality is a low level of
      HDL-cholesterol (the �good� cholesterol).

      Background:

      The overall purpose of this project is to improve the clinical outcomes of veterans with
      ischemic heart disease (IHD) through implementation of evidence-based lipid management, with
      a particular focus on veterans whose primary lipid abnormality is a low level of
      HDL-cholesterol (the �good� cholesterol).

      Objectives:

      The major objectives are 1. to determine whether a multifaceted intervention results in
      improved guideline-concordant lipid management for patients with low HDL-cholesterol; and 2.
      to test the relative effectiveness of three different reminder systems on physician
      prescribing behavior.

      Methods:

      The primary care clinic at each of the six VISN 13 facilities will serve as intervention
      sites. Within those sites we will randomize providers to one of three reminder systems.
      Control sites will consist of twelve other facilities matched to the intervention sites on
      the basis of facility characteristics. We will use a modified �pre-post� nested cohort design
      that allows us to evaluate the effect of the intervention controlling for secular trends.
      Target patients will be identified based on the following: 1. an IHD diagnosis within the
      past 5 years; 2. regular follow-up in a primary care clinic; 3. most recent LDL-cholesterol &lt;
      130 mg/dl and HDL-cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dl; 4. No lipid therapy within prior 6 months. The
      intervention will consist of: a. an on-site interactive educational workshop for providers;
      b. reminders (either patient-directed mailed reminders, computer-chart reminders at the time
      of visit, or automatic consults); c. opinion leader recruitment and �activation�. The primary
      outcome is proportion of target patients receiving guideline-concordant therapy. For
      objective 1, the outcome will be compared between intervention and control sites. For
      objective 2, the outcome will be compared between the three groups randomized to the
      different reminder systems. In addition, providers will be surveyed with a written
      questionnaire to determine their reaction to the educational workshop and the different
      reminder systems.

      Status:

      Intervention and data collection are completed. Data analysis is being undertaken, final
      report will soon follow.
