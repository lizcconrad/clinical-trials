      RATIONALE: Beclomethasone may be effective in treating patients who have graft-versus-host
      disease of the gastrointestinal tract.

      PURPOSE: Compassionate use of beclomethasone in treating patients who have graft-versus-host
      disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has not responded to previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide beclomethasone dipropionate to patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host
           disease refractory to standard therapy or with a contraindication to systemic steroids.

        -  Minimize the serious side effects associated with systemic steroid use in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral beclomethasone dipropionate 4 times daily for 28 days in the
      absence of graft-versus-host disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then
      receive a second course for 31 days if symptoms of graft-versus-host disease persist.
      Patients may receive up to 4 treatments (1 or 2 courses each) per year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
