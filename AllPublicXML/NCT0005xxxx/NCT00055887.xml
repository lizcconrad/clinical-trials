      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Drugs such as efaproxiral may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. It is
      not yet known if chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy is more effective with or
      without efaproxiral in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy combined
      with radiation therapy with or without efaproxiral in treating patients who have stage III
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with or without
           efaproxiral.

        -  Compare time to progression, response rate, and pattern of failure of patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety of efaproxiral in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of efaproxiral in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to chemotherapy regimen, Karnofsky performance status (70-80% vs 90-100%), and
      disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB).

        -  Induction therapy phase: Patients receive 1 of the following induction chemotherapy
           regimens:

             -  Paclitaxel and carboplatin: Patients receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on
                day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 2 courses.

             -  Cisplatin and gemcitabine: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 2 and gemcitabine
                IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 2 courses.

             -  Cisplatin and vinorelbine: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and vinorelbine
                IV on days 1, 8, and either 15 or 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total
                of 2 courses.

        -  Randomized phase: Within 42 days after completion of chemotherapy, patients are
           randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive efaproxiral IV over 30-45 minutes with supplemental oxygen
                and then undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive supplemental oxygen and undergo radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on days 1 and 16 of radiotherapy, monthly for 3
      months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 659 patients will be accrued for this study.
