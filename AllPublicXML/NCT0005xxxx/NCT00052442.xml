      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin in
      treating patients who have recurrent or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin, in terms of objective
           response rate, duration of response, and time to disease progression, in patients with
           relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the impact of pharmacokinetics on toxicity and drug elimination in patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of prior chemotherapy response duration on duration of response in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate, if possible, the pharmacodynamics (area under the curve) of this drug with
           tumor response and toxicity (mucositis) in these patients.

        -  Correlate, if possible, intraerythrocytic folate or homocysteine levels with severity of
           mucositis in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine whether levels of the RFC-1 folate transporter, folylpolyglutamate synthetase,
           and folylpolyglutamate hydrolase are markers of response in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving a complete response (CR) may receive 2 additional courses beyond the CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39-72 patients (12-35 for cohort 1 and 17-37 for cohort 2) will
      be accrued for this study within 10-36 months.
