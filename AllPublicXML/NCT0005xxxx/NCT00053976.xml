    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of IL2 receptor antibody (also known as
      Daclizumab or Zenapax) and corticosteroids alone for control of GVHD. Treatment with
      corticosteroids is standard care for GVHD. This research is being done because the
      investigators do not know whether addition of this new medication to standard corticosteroid
      therapy improves response rates. Since Zenapax binds to a type of cell which is thought to
      cause GVHD and possibly inactivates them, investigators have reason to believe that addition
      of Zenapax night result in better control of GVHD This study will determine whether the
      addition of another medication, Zenapax, will be more effective than steroids alone in
      suppressing GVHD and improving symptoms of GVHD.

      Daclizumab (Zenapax) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patient
      with kidney transplant to help prevent graft rejection. This medication has been used in bone
      marrow transplant patients to treat GVHD.

      GVHD occurs when the donor's immune system recognizes a patient's body as foreign and reacts
      against it. GVHD may result in skin rashes and blistering, liver inflammation and
      gastrointestinal problems including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding. Mild GVHD may be
      treated with topical medications applied to the skin. More severe GVHD requires medications
      given intravenously (by vein) or taken by mouth. Steroids are usually given first to treat
      GVHD but only 40% of people respond to this alone.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare response to treatment in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
           treated with methylprednisolone with or without daclizumab.

        -  Compare differences in total methylprednisolone dose and complications in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare mortality, days of antibiotics and antifungal therapy, and required hospital
           days within the first 100 days for patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival and incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year in patients treated
           with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to prior graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis
      (immunosuppressive therapy vs T-cell depletion), GVHD organ manifestation (skin only vs
      other), donor type (6/6 matched sibling vs other), and participating center. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive methylprednisolone or equivalent corticosteroid IV or orally and
           daclizumab IV over 15 minutes on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and then weekly as indicated until
           day 100.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive methylprednisolone or equivalent corticosteroid as in arm I and
           placebo.

      Patients are followed at 1 year and then annually thereafter.
