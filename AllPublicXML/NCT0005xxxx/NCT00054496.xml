      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for cancer cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of erlotinib in treating patients who have
      recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma
           multiforme treated with erlotinib.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral erlotinib daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 73 patients will be accrued for this study.
