      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and the effectiveness of a new vaccine for
      the prevention of the disease, smallpox.

      In addition to assessment of safety parameters, the objective of this study is to determine
      the minimum dose of ACAM1000 that is calculated to produce a major cutaneous reaction in at
      least 90% of a population of healthy adults 18-29 years of age and naïve to smallpox vaccine.
      Specifically, the objectives of this study are to:

        1. Compare the safety and tolerability of three dose levels of ACAM1000 and a standard dose
           of Dryvax® in healthy adults 18-29 years of age and naïve to smallpox vaccine. Safety
           and tolerability will be determined by examination of the local cutaneous reaction,
           adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, structured interviews, and
           laboratory analysis.

        2. Determine the immunogenicity of three dose levels of ACAM1000 and a standard dose of
           Dryvax® in healthy adults 18-29 years of age by comparing: (a)the proportion of subjects
           at each dose level who develop a major cutaneous reaction; (b)the proportion of subjects
           in each treatment group who develop neutralizing antibodies, including the fold-increase
           in antibody titer between Baseline and Day 30 sera; and the geometric mean vaccinia
           neutralizing antibody titer on Day 30.

        3. Determine the minimum dose of ACAM1000 that is calculated to produce a major cutaneous
           reaction in at least 90% of a population of healthy adults 18-29 years of age and naïve
           to smallpox vaccine.
