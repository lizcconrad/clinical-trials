  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study treats patients with an inherited disease that prevents the body from making a
      specific protein or enzyme needed for the body's metabolism. Lack of this enzyme causes
      accumulation of harmful or toxic substances in the body, which leads to deterioration and
      failure of organs such as the brain or the heart. This disease can be fatal.

      Some patients with inherited metabolic storage disease may benefit from an allogeneic stem
      cell transplant ('allogeneic' means that the stem cells come from another person). Stem cells
      are created in the bone marrow. They mature into different types of blood cells that are
      needed including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Stem cells, when
      transplanted, can make a new blood system. Donor stem cells can make the protein or enzyme
      patients with this disease cells cannot. The donor cells may prevent further accumulation of
      toxic substances. It is hoped that the donor cells can prevent or stop the disease from
      progressing.

      This research study uses a new pre-treatment combination of two drugs, Anti-CD45 and
      CAMPATH-1H. Anti-CD45 and CAMPATH-1H are antibodies against certain types of blood cells.
      CAMPATH-1H is particularly important because it stays active in the body for a long time
      after infusion, which means it may work longer at preventing GVHD symptoms. In addition to
      antibodies, patients will receive Fludarabine, which is a chemotherapy drug. Fludarabine
      kills bone marrow cells and is given to reduce the bone marrow cells so that donor stem cells
      may 'take.'

    <textblock>
      Fludarabine will be given as a daily IV (intravenous, by vein) infusion for a total of 5
      days. CAMPATH-1H will be given as a daily 4-hour IV (intravenous, by vein) infusion for three
      days. Anti-CD45 will be given as a daily 6-hour IV infusion over the next 4 days. Then
      patients will have a one-day rest period before receiving the stem cell transplant. To help
      prevent the body from rejecting the transplant, patients will also receive the drug FK506,
      starting two days before the transplant and continuing for three months. If there is no GVHD,
      the amount of FK506 patients are taking will be reduced by 20% every 2 weeks until this
      medication is stopped.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with inherited metabolic storage diseases of all ages are eligible.

          -  Diagnosis of inherited metabolic storage disease confirmed by standard biochemical and
             genetic studies in consultation with the Department of Genetics at the Baylor College
             of Medicine

          -  Inherited metabolic storage diseases which may be stabilized or improved by stem cell
             transplantation include: Hurler, Hunter, Maroteaux-Lamy, Sly, Wolman, Gaucher, Farber,
