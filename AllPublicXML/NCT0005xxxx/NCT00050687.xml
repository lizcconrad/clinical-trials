    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of different doses of oral gallium
      maltolate. Patients will receive oral gallium maltolate twice daily for 28-consecutive days
      followed by 14 days off treatment. This dosing cycle will be repeated. Adverse effects will
      be assessed and the levels of gallium in serum will be measured. Any effect of the drug on
      the cancer and any improvement in cancer-related symptoms will also be measured.

    <textblock>
      Gallium maltolate is an orally bioavailable form of gallium. This is a safety,
      pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy study. The primary objective of the study is to
      assess the safety profile in patients after oral administration of different doses of gallium
      maltolate for up to six 42-day cycles (28 days of gallium maltolate, followed by 14 days off
      treatment). In addition, serum concentrations of gallium and associated pharmacokinetic
      variables will be measured. From this information, an optimal dose will be selected for
      assessment of anti-tumor efficacy. The study assesses the effects of oral administration of
      gallium maltolate on pain resulting from bony metastasis, on biochemical measures of bone
      turnover, and on disease progression and overall survival in patients with various refractory
      malignancies. Patients may receive up to 6 cycles of the investigational agent.
