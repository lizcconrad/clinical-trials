      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine a recommended phase II dose of IDEC-152 monoclonal antibody in patients with
           relapsed or recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive IDEC-152 monoclonal antibody IV over at least 2 hours on days 1, 2, 8, 15,
      and 22.

      Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of IDEC-152 monoclonal antibody until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 3, 2 of 6, or 3 of 10 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
