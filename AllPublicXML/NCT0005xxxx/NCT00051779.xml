  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and possible effectiveness of an
      investigational humanized monoclonal antibody (CAL) to the parathyroid hormone-related
      protein (PTHrP) when compared to zoledronic acid in patients with breast cancer metastatic to
      bone.

      The study will also evaluate the possible effects of both study drugs on performance status,
      markers of bone metabolism, and skeletal events related to bone metastasis including elevated
      blood calcium levels, bone pain, metastatic lesions, complications and interventions. The
      levels of CAL in the blood will also be evaluated.

          -  A total body bone scan and other radiographic scan(s) performed on you within 4 weeks
