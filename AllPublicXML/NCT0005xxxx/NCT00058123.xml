      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as poly-ICLC use different ways to stimulate the immune
      system and stop tumor cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how poly-ICLC works in treating patients with
      recurrent, progressive, or relapsed anaplastic glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent or progressive
           anaplastic glioma treated with poly ICLC.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the tumor response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the biological effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive poly ICLC intramuscularly 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed intracranial anaplastic glioma, including any of the
             following subtypes:

               -  Anaplastic astrocytoma

               -  Anaplastic oligodendroglioma

               -  Anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma

               -  Other anaplastic gliomas NOTE: Patients with an original histology of low-grade
                  glioma are allowed provided a subsequent histological diagnosis of an anaplastic
                  glioma is made

          -  Must have evidence of tumor recurrence or progression by MRI or CT scan* NOTE:
             *Steroid dose must be stable for at least 5 days before scan

          -  Prior radiotherapy required

               -  Patients who have had prior interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic
                  radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than
                  radiation necrosis by positron-emission tomography, thallium scanning, magnetic
                  resonance spectroscopy, or surgical documentation of disease

          -  Relapsed disease

               -  Progression after initial therapy (e.g., radiotherapy with or without
                  chemotherapy)

               -  No more than 3 prior therapies (initial therapy and treatment for no more than 2
                  prior relapses)

               -  Surgical resection for relapsed disease with no anticancer therapy for up to 12
                  weeks followed by another surgical resection is considered 1 relapse

               -  For patients who have had prior therapy for a low-grade glioma, the surgical
                  diagnosis of high-grade glioma is considered the first relapse

          -  Must be registered in the North American Brain Tumor Consortium Data Management Center
