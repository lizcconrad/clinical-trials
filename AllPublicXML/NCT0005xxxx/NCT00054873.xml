             disease.

             1,500/mm3; hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL; hematocrit greater than or
             equal to 30% (transfusion allowed); and platelet count greater than or equal to
             100,000/mm3.

          -  Adequate hepatic function: bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL; AST and ALT less
             that 2.5 X ULN (5 X ULN if liver involved with tumor); alkaline phosphatase less than
             5 X ULN

          -  Adequate renal function; serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or
             calculated creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min.

          -  Both male and female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a contraceptive
             method that is medically acceptable to the investigative center.

          -  Disease-free from a prior malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix, for greater than 5 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable angina or class III or IV New York Heart Association heart disease.

          -  CNS metastases.
