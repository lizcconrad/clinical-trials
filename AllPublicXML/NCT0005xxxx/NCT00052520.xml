      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of biological therapy and to see how well
      it works in treating patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid
      leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Biological therapies,
      including immunotherapy, can potentially be used to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy given to patients who have undergone donor stem cell
      transplantation may be a way to eradicate remaining cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and potential toxicities associated with infusing donor CD8+
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for Wilms' tumor (WT1) in patients who have
      relapsed or at a high risk of relapse post transplant for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS),
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the in vivo persistence of transferred T cells and assess migration to the
      bone marrow, a predominant site of leukemic relapse.

      II. To determine if adoptively transferred WT1-specific T cells mediate antileukemic
      activity.

      OUTLINE: Donors undergo leukapheresis for stem cell harvest to generate CD8-positive WT1
      gene-specific CTL clones at the time of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      After post-transplantation hematopoietic recovery, patients receive treatment for either
      highest-risk disease (prophylactically) or relapsed disease.

      Highest-risk disease group: Patients receive CD8-positive WT1 gene-specific CTL clones
      intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 0, 14, and 28. Beginning 2-4 hours after CTL
      infusion, patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 28-42 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Relapsed-disease group: Some patients with evidence of leukemic relapse may receive standard
      salvage chemotherapy prior to donor CTL infusions and then receive CD8-positive WT1
      gene-specific CTL clones and interleukin-2 as in the highest-risk group.

      Patients in both groups who have progressive disease after complete or partial response to
      therapy may be eligible for retreatment with CD8-positive WT1 gene-specific CTL clones.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

                  this protocol

          -  Eligibility for Prophylactic Treatment with CD8+ CTL After Transplant (Highest Risk
             Subgroup): At time of planned treatment, CD8+ CTL specific for WT1 must have been

                       lymphoblastic leukemia; (for CML) a PCR assay of bone marrow (BM) or
                       peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) positive for the presence of the
                       BCR/ABL mRNA fusion transcript that quantitatively increases by greater than
                       one order of magnitude on a subsequent sample

               -  b. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD at the time of relapse are
                  eligible for treatment if not receiving corticosteroids or if the dose of
                  corticosteroids can be tapered to &lt; the equivalent of 0.5 mg/kg/day of
                  prednisone; the patient's symptoms have to remain stable and unlikely to increase
                  to stage III or IV acute GVHD or chronic GVHD is unlikely to progress following
                  the change in immunosuppressive therapy, after an appropriate monitoring period,
                  as deemed by the patients treating physician and the principal investigator

          -  DONOR: Both the patient and donor must have an HLA-allele which it is possible to
             generate WT1-specific clones for

          -  DONOR: If a separate leukapheresis via peripheral intravenous access can be arranged,
             the stem cell donor will undergo leukapheresis to provide the required PBMC no sooner
             than 2 weeks before or after the stem cell mobilization and harvest

          -  DONOR: If a separate leukapheresis is not possible, a portion of the PBMC from the
             donor's peripheral blood stem cell harvest may potentially be used to generate
             WT1-specific CTL clones; the feasibility of this option will depend upon the minimal
             cell dose required for transplantation and the presence of an excess harvest yield and
             the possibility of generating CTL from this product

          -  DONOR: Some donors will be asked to provide both a separate leukapheresis and a
             portion of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the donor's peripheral
             blood stem cell harvest

          -  DONOR: Leukapheresis donors must be age 18 or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients for whom CD8+ CTL clones specific for WT1 have not been generated in time for
             planned infusion (these patients can potentially be treated later if CTL become
             available); Also we will exclude patients whose malignant cells do not over express
             WT-1, based on direct analysis of a bone marrow sample with &gt; 50% blasts or of
             leukemia cells isolated for expression analysis; in either case patients will be
             informed about the availability of other treatment protocols for which they might be
             eligible

          -  Patients with Karnofsky performance status or Lansky play score =&lt; 30%

          -  Patients with current stage III or IV GVHD unresponsive to therapy or requiring
             therapy with anti-CD3 mAb, prednisone &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day (or corticosteroid equivalent),
             or other treatments resulting in the ablation or inactivation of T cells (such as
             other anti-T cell monoclonal antibodies); although the concurrent use of cyclosporine,
             FK506, or MMF is not strictly an exclusion criteria, attempts should be made to
             discontinue it if possible

          -  Patients requiring concurrent therapy with hydroxyurea or other agents that may
             interfere with the function or survival of infused CTL clones

          -  Patients with a preexisting nonhematopoietic organ toxicity that is deemed by the
             principal investigator to place the patient at unacceptable risk for treatment on the
             protocol

          -  Patients with graft rejection or failure

          -  DONOR: Medical conditions precluding either leukapheresis or blood donation may
             include but are not limited to:

               -  Inadequate age or weight (leukapheresis donors must be age 18 or older, other
                  criteria per physician discretion)

               -  Active infection, with or without antibiotic treatment

               -  Recent hepatitis exposure, hepatitis A or B antigenemia, or hepatitis C antibody
                  positivity

               -  Pregnancy or nursing; HIV or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection

               -  Severe cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial
                  infarction [MI], or unstable angina)
