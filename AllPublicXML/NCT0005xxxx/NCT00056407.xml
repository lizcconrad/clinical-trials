  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-year study will compare how safe and effective an oral investigational medicine is
      (compared to placebo) in preventing the development of prostate cancer in men that are
      defined by the study entrance criteria as being at an increased risk for prostate cancer.
      Study visits to the clinic will occur every 6 months for up to 4 years (10 clinic visits),
      and a prostate biopsy will be performed at 2 and 4 years of treatment.

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Gleason Score at Diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Year 4</time_frame>
    <description>Gleason score was determined by examining prostate biopsies and surgical samples. The Gleason scoring system sums the two most common Gleason grade patterns in order to predict the likelihood of a participant doing well or badly with their cancer. Gleason grades range from 1 (normal) to 5 (advanced cancer). The lowest Gleason score is 2 (1+1), and the highest Gleason score is 10 (5+5). A Gleason score of 2-6 is a low-grade cancer; a Gleason score of 7-10 is high-grade cancer. The most severe high-grade cancers are the subset of Gleason scores 8-10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With HGPIN, ASAP, and Prostate Cancer at Biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Year 4</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence and quantity of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) at biopsy were measured. HGPIN and ASAP are considered precancerous conditions. A participant diagnosed with prostate cancer only (i.e., no HGPIN or ASAP) was counted in both the first category (&quot;HGPIN or prostate cancer diagnosis&quot;) and again in the last category (&quot;HGPIN, ASAP, or prostate cancer diagnosis&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Month 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Year 4 (Month 48)</time_frame>
    <description>The IPSS is a 7-item questionnaire that measures urinary symptoms. It measures the level of urinary symptoms (including incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) reported as the total IPSS score. Each of the 7 questions has a 6-point response scale (0=none/not at all to 5=almost always) with a total score that can range from 0-35: mild (0-7), moderate (8-19), or severe (20-35). Estimates are based on adjusted means from the general linear model: change from baseline = baseline value and cluster and treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Biopsy-detectable Prostate Cancer at Years 2 and 4 (Crude Rate Approach)</title>
        <description>Study biopsies consisted of 10 biopsy samples (cores) in a pre-defined pattern. Biopsies were read at the central pathology laboratory (CPL, which processed the majority, 94%, of biopsies). Biopsy cases that were positive for prostate cancer or precancerous lesions (high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia[HGPIN] or typical small acinar proliferation [ASAP]) and prostate surgeries were reviewed by the lead pathologist.</description>

          <description>Study biopsies consisted of 10 biopsy samples (cores) in a pre-defined pattern. Biopsies were read at the central pathology laboratory (CPL, which processed the majority, 94%, of biopsies). Biopsy cases that were positive for prostate cancer or precancerous lesions (high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia[HGPIN] or typical small acinar proliferation [ASAP]) and prostate surgeries were reviewed by the lead pathologist.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Gleason Score at Diagnosis</title>
        <description>Gleason score was determined by examining prostate biopsies and surgical samples. The Gleason scoring system sums the two most common Gleason grade patterns in order to predict the likelihood of a participant doing well or badly with their cancer. Gleason grades range from 1 (normal) to 5 (advanced cancer). The lowest Gleason score is 2 (1+1), and the highest Gleason score is 10 (5+5). A Gleason score of 2-6 is a low-grade cancer; a Gleason score of 7-10 is high-grade cancer. The most severe high-grade cancers are the subset of Gleason scores 8-10.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Month 48</title>
        <description>The IPSS is a 7-item questionnaire that measures urinary symptoms. It measures the level of urinary symptoms (including incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) reported as the total IPSS score. Each of the 7 questions has a 6-point response scale (0=none/not at all to 5=almost always) with a total score that can range from 0-35: mild (0-7), moderate (8-19), or severe (20-35). Estimates are based on adjusted means from the general linear model: change from baseline = baseline value and cluster and treatment.</description>

        <description>The BII is a 4-item questionnaire that rates the level of BPH-related physical discomfort, worry, and interference with normal activities the participant has experienced. The total BII score ranges from 1 (no impact on symptoms) to 13 (major impact on symptoms). Participants completed the questionnaire at Baseline and at each 6-month visit. Participants whose language did not have a validated translation of the questionnaire did not participate. Estimates are based on the adjusted means from the general linear model:change from baseline = baseline value and cluster and treatment.</description>

Participants completed the questionnaire at Baseline and at each 6-month visit. Participants whose language did not have a validated translation of the questionnaire did not participate. Estimates are based on the adjusted means from the general linear model: change from baseline=baseline value and cluster and treatment.</description>
