  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSD-II (also known as Pompe disease) is caused by a deficiency of a critical enzyme in the
      body called acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the body's cells to break
      down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures called lysosomes. In
      patients with GSD-II, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates and is stored in various
      tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their normal function. This
      study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      efficacy of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) as a potential enzyme
      replacement therapy for a pair of siblings with GSD-II. To be eligible for this study, a
      patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of GSD-II and have a sister or brother who also has a
      confirmed diagnosis of GSD-II.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from the parent or guardian prior to
             performing any study related procedures;

          -  Patient must have a clinical diagnosis of GSD-II confirmed by endogenous GAA activity
             below normal in at least one tissue;

          -  Patient must have a sibling with a clinical diagnosis of GSD-II confirmed by an
             endogenous GAA activity below normal in at least one tissue, who is eligible for
             participation in this study;

          -  Patient must have a sibling with identical GAA mutations who is eligible for
             participation in this study;

          -  Patient must have a sibling with evidence of different progression of GSD-II who is
             eligible for participation in this study;

          -  The patient or his/her guardian(s) must have the ability to comply with the clinical
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has significant organic disease (with the exception of symptoms relating to
             GSD-II), including clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary,
             neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious intercurrent
             illness, or extenuating circumstance that, would preclude participation in the trial;

          -  Patient is participating in another investigational study.
