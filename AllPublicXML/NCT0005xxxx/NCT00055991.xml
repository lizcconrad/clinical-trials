      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy uses certain drugs to try to prevent the development or
      recurrence of cancer. It is not yet known whether bexarotene is effective in preventing
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of bexarotene in preventing
      breast cancer in women who are at genetic risk of developing breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether bexarotene can modify immunophenotypic markers related to breast
           cancer progression in women at high genetic risk for breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to menopausal status (women with a uterus who have not had a
      menstrual period for more than 1 year vs any woman over 55 years old vs women 55 years and
      under without a uterus whose follicle-stimulating hormone is in the postmenopausal range).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral bexarotene once daily on days 1-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. In both arms, treatment continues in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or elevation of triglycerides to greater than 800
           mg/dL. Patients undergo 2 breast biopsies in the same location on days 1 and 29.

      Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.

    <description>This drug is a retinoid. The anti-tumor action of retinoids, as well as their potential in chemoprevention, supports the need to further identify the spectrum of responsive tumors, to identify the molecular mechanisms associated with retinoid action, and to identify and develop new retinoids that have unique properties and an improved therapeutic index.</description>
