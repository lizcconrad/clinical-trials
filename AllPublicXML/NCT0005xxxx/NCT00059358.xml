      This study will test the amount of anti-HIV drugs in the blood cells of HIV-infected patients
      who are also being treated for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 50,000 people in Puerto Rico are infected with HCV. HIV and HCV have similar
      routes of transmission, and HCV co-infection occurs in 8% to 23% of HIV infected patients.
      Researchers have shown that treatment for HCV with Rebetron (ribavirin plus interferon
      alfa-2b) significantly decreases HCV viral load without affecting HIV viral load. However,
      measurements of intracellular levels of the active forms of zidovudine (ZDV-MP and ZDV-TP)
      were not performed. Such measurements are needed to provide a more rational basis for dosing
      in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. This study will investigate the intracellular exposure to
      active ZDV metabolites prior to and after treatment with Rebetron or treatment with
      PEG-Intron (pegylated interferon) and ribavirin.

      Participants in this study will remain on their usual antiretroviral regimen; no changes may
      be made to that regimen for the first 4 weeks of the study. Upon study entry, participants
      will have intracellular pharmacokinetic studies. During Week 2, participants will start
      either Rebetron or PEG-Intron plus ribavirin therapy, will have intracellular pharmacokinetic
      studies, and will undergo liver biopsy. Additional intracellular pharmacokinetic studies will
      be performed at Weeks 12 and 24. Rebetron or PEG-Intron plus ribavirin will be given for 48
      weeks. A second liver biopsy will be performed 24 weeks after discontinuing Rebetron or
      PEG-Intron plus ribavirin therapy. Participants will be followed for 72 weeks.
