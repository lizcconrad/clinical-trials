      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of combination chemotherapy in
      treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as docetaxel and 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, work in different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may
      kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)
      administered with docetaxel in patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer or other
      progressive metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
      (17-AAG). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      Group 1: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and 17-AAG IV over 1-2 hours on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Group 2: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and 17-AAG as in group 1. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients per group receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 20 additional patients (10
      per group) are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 2-3 months.
