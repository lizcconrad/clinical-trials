  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find an effective and well-tolerated medical therapy for itching
      due to liver disease. Persons with primary biliary cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis C are
      currently being enrolled in the study. Persons participating in the study are given
      sertraline, a medication which is also often used for depression,to treat their itching. The
      dose is gradually increased as the effect on itching and any other potential side effects are
      carefully monitored.
