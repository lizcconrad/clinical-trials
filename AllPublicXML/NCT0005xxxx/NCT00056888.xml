      This study will use three neurophysiological tests (see below) to determine what areas of the
      brain are responsible for paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders. Patients with these
      disorders have sudden, brief attacks of movement, similar to epileptic seizures, but without
      loss of consciousness.

      Normal volunteers and patients with two subtypes of paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement
      disorder, paroxysmal dyskinesia and psychogenic variant, that can be induced by a specific
      trigger, such as a sudden movement or prolonged exercise, will be included in this study.
      Candidates must be 12 years of age or older. Women of childbearing potential will be screened
      with a pregnancy test.

      Participants will undergo one or more of the procedures detailed below. Patients' test
      results will be compared with those of normal volunteers. Before each test, participants will
      provide a medical history and undergo a brief physical examination. During each procedure,
      the subject will have surface electromyography (EMG) to measure the electrical activity of
      muscles. For EMG, electrodes (metal discs) filled with a conductive gel are taped to the skin
      over the muscle to be evaluated.

      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

      MRI uses a strong magnetic field, radio waves, and computer technology to provide detailed
      images of the brain. For this test, the subject lies in a narrow cylinder (the scanner),
      while pictures of the brain are taken. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by
      electrical switching of radio frequency circuits used in the scanning process. For functional
      MRI (fMRI), the subject is asked to mimic a movement that occurs during an attack, such as
      stiffening the hand to make a fist or flexing and rotating the arm inward, to detect changes
      in the brain regions involved in the movement. During the procedure, involuntary movements
      and voluntary movements will be monitored by surface EMG and by video camera. The test will
      last about 1-1/2 hours.

      Electroencephalography (EEG)

      EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain (brain waves) with electrodes placed on the
      scalp. During the procedure, muscle activity will be recorded with EMG. The subject will
      first relax and then will be asked to mimic a movement attack. The test will last from 1-1/2
      to 2 hours.

      Startle Reflex

      The subject will put on a headphone and hear loud noises in a random fashion. During the
      test, muscle activity will be recorded with EMG and with a video c...

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the brain regions responsible
      during attacks for psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders using functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The secondary objective is to determine the
      neurophysiology during attacks for the same subjects compared to normal controls using
      electroencephalography (EEG) and Startle Reflex.

      Study population: Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder patients and a
      control group of healthy volunteers.

      Design:

      fMRI: Anatomical MRI and fMRI sequences are performed to obtain blood-oxygenation
      level-dependent (BOLD) imaging of brain activation during (1) triggered or provoked
      involuntary hyperkinetic movements and voluntary imitated movements in subjects with
      psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders and (2) voluntary imitated movements
      and rest states in healthy volunteers.

      EEG: EEG will be recorded for jerk-locked back-averaging analysis.

      Startle Reflex: Electromyography (EMG) will be recorded during exposure to auditory stimuli.

      Outcome measures:

      fMRI: BOLD will be obtained using baseline correction.

      EEG

      Startle Reflex: The latency, mean amplitude, and habituation of EMG amplitude will be
      measured.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement patients:

        A. Established diagnosis of psychogenic hyperkinetic movement disorders. The diagnosis will
        be established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient
        Clinic, based on review of medical record, history, clinical evaluation, and videotapes of
        an attack.

        B. Patients with clear onset stereotyped and defined hyperkinetic attacks.

        C. Patients only with paroxysmal attacks of hyperkinetic movements.

        D. Age 8 or older.

        E. A reproducible trigger of paroxysmal hyperkinetic attacks, such as sudden movement,
        startle or prolonged exercise, which will produce attacks at least with 50% consistency.

        F. Patients whose attacks can be precipitated easily.

        G. Patients with typical attack involving unilateral extremities.

        H. Patients taking medication that may influence the central nervous system, such as
        phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and antidepressants (but not limited
        to these) will be asked to hold the medication prior to the study. A sufficient drug
        washout period will be established dependant upon the individual drug. Subjects may be
        admitted to the NIH if necessary. They will be asked to abstain from alcohol and caffeine
        24 hours prior to the study as well.

        Normal Subjects:

        A. Normal volunteers ranging from 8 to 65 will be included. Normal volunteers would be
        recruited from people who are registered as HMCS Normal Volunteers. All subjects should
        have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number.

        B. Alcohol abstention is required for all subjects for both fMRI and EEG for 24 hours
        before the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic patients:

        A. Age younger than 8 years old.

        B. Patients with attacks that involve head and neck movements, axial movements, bilateral
        limb involvement, or violent attacks that typically make patients fall to the ground. With
        respect to children, violent attacks are defined as any attack that can potentially result
        in injury (hitting the head, falls, violent flailing, hitting furniture or walls)

        C. Previous history of or MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, strokes, trauma or
        arterial venous malformations.

        D. Contraindication to MRI such as having devices not compatible with MRI (pacemaker, an
        implanted medical pump, brain stimulators, etc.), metallic prostheses in their body (metal
        pins and rods, heart valves, cochlear implants, etc.), and history of working with metals
        in the past, since such persons may potentially have small metal fragments in the eye
        without being aware of it.

        E. Any diagnosis of progressive neurological disorders other than psychogenic paroxysmal
        hyperkinetic movement disorder.

        F. Any history of significant medical disorders requiring chronic treatment with other
        drugs that affects the CNS, which cannot be stopped.

        G. Women who are pregnant or nursing. Female subjects of childbearing potential (including
        all girls after menarche) will have specific interview and a pregnancy test prior to the
        study (before each imaging procedure if required) to ensure that they are not pregnant or
        nursing.

        H. Any subject who is not capable of giving an informed consent. This will be determined at
        the initial evaluation at NINDS clinic. Patients with Mini Mental Score less than 25 or
        significant psychiatric history will be further evaluated by detailed neuropsychiatric
        testing, or consultation with a psychiatrist.

        Normal Volunteers:

        A. Normal subjects younger than 8 years and older than 65 will be excluded.

        B. Normal subjects with MRI findings consistent with organic brain lesions such as brain
        tumors, stroke, trauma or AVMs will be excluded.

        C. Normal subjects with a history of significant medical disorders such as cancers, or
        requiring continuous treatment with drugs will be excluded.

        D. Subjects with mental disorders will be excluded.

        E. We will not scan pregnant women because safety of high magnetic field to fetus is not
        established. Therefore, we will administer a urine pregnancy test for any female subjects
        of childbearing potential 24 hours prior to functional MRI scan.
