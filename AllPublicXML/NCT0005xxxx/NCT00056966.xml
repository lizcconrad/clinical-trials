  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study have a hematologic malignancy (a disorder in the bone marrow that
      affects the body's ability to create blood) that might benefit from receiving an allogeneic
      stem cell transplant (meaning the cells come from a donor) from a family member or nearly
      identical matched donor. The donor may either be a matched sibling, a mismatched family
      member, or an unrelated person.

      Usually these patients are given high doses of chemotherapy before receiving a stem cell
      transplant to keep their immune system from rejecting the donor stem cells and to kill any
      diseased cells that remain in the body. However, this group of patients have a high risk of
      developing possibly life-threatening treatment-related side effects such as infections,
      damage to vital organs such as lungs, liver, kidney and heart, as well as graft versus host
      disease (GVHD).

      Instead of the high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy usually given before a transplant,
      this research study uses a new pre-transplant combination of three drugs, Fludarabine,
      Anti-CD45 and CAMPATH-1H with low dose radiotherapy. Fludarabine is a chemotherapy drug while
      Anti-CD45 and CAMPATH-1H are antibodies against certain types of blood cells, including those
      which are causing this disease. CAMPATH-1H is particularly important because it stays active
      in the body for a long time after it is given, which means it may work longer to prevent GVHD
      symptoms. Anti-CD45 may help in eradicating residual malignant cells. All these agents also
      help in preventing rejection of donor stem cells. This study is designed to give a less
      intense chemotherapy and radiotherapy, so that the life-threatening toxicities of
      conventional high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimen can be reduced, while
      maintaining the ability to cure cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAMPATH-1H will be given as a daily IV infusion for three days. Fludarabine will be given as
      a daily IV infusion for four days. Anti-CD45 will be given as a daily IV infusion for 4 days.
      Patients will then receive radiotherapy (also known as Total Body Irradiation or TBI) for one
      day. A summary of the treatment follows:

        -  Day - 8: CAMPATH-1H and Fludarabine

        -  Day - 7: CAMPATH-1H and Fludarabine

        -  Day - 6: CAMPATH-1H and Fludarabine

        -  Day - 5: Anti-CD45 and Fludarabine

        -  Day - 4: Anti-CD45

        -  Day - 3: Anti-CD45

        -  Day - 2: Anti-CD45

        -  Day - 1: TBI

        -  Day 0: Stem Cell Infusion (transplant)

      To help prevent the body from developing GVHD, patients will also receive the drug FK506,
      starting two days before the transplant and continuing for at least one month.

      Both the CAMPATH-1H and the Anti-CD45 can cause allergic reactions so patients will be given
      drugs to help prevent those reactions before receiving daily doses.

      To see how CAMPATH-1H works in patients with hematologic malignancies, some patients will be
      asked to participate in pharmacokinetic studies. For this, approximately 13 blood samples
      will be taken from the central line scheduled before each infusion on Day -8 to Day -6, daily
      thereafter until Day 0, and then approximately once per week on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 post
      transplant. No more than 5 teaspoonfuls total will be drawn.

      To see how Anti-CD45 works in patients with hematologic malignancies some patients will be
      asked to participate in pharmacokinetic studies. Approximately 22 blood samples will be taken
      from the central line scheduled before, during and after each infusion and after the end of
      the last infusion of Anti-CD45. No more than 10 teaspoonfuls total will be drawn over the
      course of the four anti-CD45 infusions.
