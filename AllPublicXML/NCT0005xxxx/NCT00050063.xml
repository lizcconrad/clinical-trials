  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether therapeutic HIV vaccines can help the
      immune system control HIV viral load after anti-HIV drugs are discontinued.

      This study is a rollover study for patients who participated in A5058s: Augmentation of
      HIV-Specific Helper and CTL Responses Through Therapeutic Vaccination in Individuals
      Receiving Potent Suppressive Antiretroviral Therapies. In A5058s, patients received a series
      of therapeutic vaccinations to elicit HIV-specific immune responses. This study will examine
      whether these vaccine-induced responses can control viral load in the absence of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      Upon study entry, patients will discontinue ART. During the first 6 weeks of the study, viral
      load will be monitored weekly and CD4+ T-cell counts will be monitored every other week.
      Viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts will be measured every other week from Week 6 through Week
      24, then monthly until patients restart ART or until Week 48. Patients who reinitiate ART for
      any reason will be registered to Step 2 and followed for 10 weeks.
