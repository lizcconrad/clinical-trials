  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of an HIV DNA vaccine (EP HIV-1090) and to
      test whether or not the vaccine can stimulate immune system responses in HIV uninfected
      people. This vaccine uses only parts of the virus's DNA and cannot cause HIV infection.

    <textblock>
      Epidemiological and animal model data support the hypothesis that HIV specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte (CTL) responses contribute to control and clearance of the virus. Vaccines
      designed specifically to induce CTL responses are likely to be well suited for protection
      against HIV infection and disease progression. EP HIV-1090 is a DNA vaccine composed of 21
      highly specific CTL epitopes. The vaccine is designed to optimize the immune response in
      people expressing one of three HLA Class I antigen subtypes: HLA-A2, -A3, and -B7. This
      design is predicted to induce an immune response in 85% of individuals in the general
      population. There is also a helper T lymphocyte (HTL) facilitating epitope (PADRE) in the
      vaccine. The vaccine is formulated with a water soluble polymer (polyvinylpyrrolidone) that
      protects the DNA and facilitates cellular uptake. This study will assess the safety of and
      immune response to different doses of EP HIV-1090 in healthy, HIV uninfected adults.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either one of three different doses
      of vaccine or placebo. Participants will receive vaccinations or placebo at study entry and
      Months 1, 3, and 6. Both vaccinations and placebo are administered by intramuscular
      injection. Participants will be followed for 18 months and will have 12 study visits. Each
      study visit will include a physical exam, medical history, and blood and urine tests. Each
      participant will have four HIV tests during the study. Women will have at least five
      pregnancy tests during the study.
