      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating patients
      who have locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that has not responded to
      gemcitabine.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective response rate to arsenic trioxide in patients with pancreatic
           cancer who have progressed after first-line treatment with a gemcitabine-containing
           regimen when treated with arsenic trioxide.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response, median and overall survival, and time to progression
           in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12
      months.
