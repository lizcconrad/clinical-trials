      RATIONALE: Mistletoe may help the body build an immune response and may improve quality of
      life to help patients live more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying mistletoe to see how well it works in treating
      patients who are receiving palliative chemotherapy for stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether supplemental treatment with mistletoe increases immune function (as
           determined by total lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, and lymphocyte subset analysis)
           in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer receiving palliative
           chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate immune function and quality of life in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive mistletoe subcutaneously three times a week for 15 weeks.

      Dose of mistletoe is increased at weeks 2 and 3 and then every 3 weeks until a maximum
      response is seen, dose-limiting toxicity occurs, or the study ends.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.
