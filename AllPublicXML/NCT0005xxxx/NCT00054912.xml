  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EP2101 is a new cancer vaccine containing 10 different peptide antigens. The vaccine is
      designed to activate the immune system to develop a response against tumor cells in order to
      delay or prevent the recurrence of cancer. This study will test the safety and measure the
      level of immune stimulating capability of EP2101 in patients with Colon Cancer.
