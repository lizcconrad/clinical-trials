  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish the best dose of the drug naltrexone to treat patients with
      Pathological Gambling Disorder (PGD) and severe urge symptoms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PGD is a prominent and growing social problem. Unfortunately, there is no established drug
      treatment for this disorder. Preliminary investigations demonstrate that naltrexone in doses
      up to 250 mg/day is well tolerated and safe during an 11-week period and may be a viable
      treatment option for PGD patients with severe urges. The implications of this study extend
      from PGD to other impulse control disorders, including compulsive shopping, kleptomania, and
      possibly alcoholism.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either naltrexone or placebo for 16 weeks. The
      responses of men and women are compared to determine whether efficacy is distributed in a
      male:female ratio analogous to that of the PGD population in the United States. A Clinical
      Global Impression and a Gambling Symptom Scale are used to assess participants.

    <description>A gambling severity measure derived from the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. It sums gambling urges and thoughts questions to make a total score. Total scores range from 0 to 40, which higher scores indicating more severe gambling symptoms (worse outcome).Administered every week for the first 8 weeks and every other week for the remaining 10 weeks. Final visit scores were the scores measured at the last visit for each participant; data from previous visits were not combined to compute this value.</description>

          <title>Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for Pathological Gambling (PG-YBOCS)</title>
          <description>A gambling severity measure derived from the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. It sums gambling urges and thoughts questions to make a total score. Total scores range from 0 to 40, which higher scores indicating more severe gambling symptoms (worse outcome).Administered every week for the first 8 weeks and every other week for the remaining 10 weeks. Final visit scores were the scores measured at the last visit for each participant; data from previous visits were not combined to compute this value.</description>

          <description>17 weeks of double-blind Naltrexone. Subjects were randomized into one of these three conditions (if they weren't randomized to placebo): naltrexone 50mg/day, 100mg/day, 150mg/day. To minimize nausea, treatment for all subjects was initiated at 25mg/day naltrexone for two days, then the dose was increased to 50mg/day. At week 3, subjects were randomly assigned to 50mg/day continued at that dose, while subjects who were randomized to naltrexone 100mg/day or 150mg/day were raised to the higher doses.
