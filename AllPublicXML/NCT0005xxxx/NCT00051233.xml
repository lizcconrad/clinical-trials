      program in helping people with schizophrenia and their families manage the disease.

      This study will provide a comprehensive psychoeducational program which includes education,
      social support, information, coping strategies, and guidance from mental health, social
      services, and medical professionals. This study will work to reduce relapse, facilitate
      patient rehabilitation, decrease family distress, and improve family well being.

      Patients and their families participate in an in-person Psychoeducational Survival Skills
      Workshop that is designed to provide patients and their families with basic information about
      schizophrenia and its treatment. After the workshop, participants are provided with 6
      Web-based modules that are designed to increase mental health and schizophrenia knowledge.
      Patient relapse, family distress, family knowledge of schizophrenia, and data on user's
      acceptance and utilization are measured to determine the intervention's effectiveness.
