      This study examines patterns of behavioral health service use among a group of female
      household heads who receive Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and have serious
      mental illness (SMI). The findings from this study will be used to determine the feasibility
      of conducting a full-scale longitudinal study of the impact of welfare reform outcomes on
      female household heads who have SMI and are currently or formerly recipients of welfare.
