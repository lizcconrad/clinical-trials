  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy,
      administered by community agencies, for the treatment of patients with Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PE is a brief cognitive behavioral therapy that can ameliorate symptoms of PTSD, depression,
      and anxiety in survivors of various types of trauma. PE has been successfully implemented by
      counselors at a community rape crisis clinic (Women Organized Against Rape [WOAR]) who
      received extensive training and weekly supervision from PE experts. Such extensive expert
      involvement is not a practical model for long-term clinical practice in a community-based
      clinic. Therefore, Part 1 of this study will examine whether counselors at WOAR can maintain
      their PE implementation success with reduced expert involvement. In Part 2 of this study, PE
      will be implemented by counselors at another community clinic (Joseph J. Peters Institute
      [JJPI]) to examine its effectiveness in treating PTSD and to determine the generalizability
      of training procedures.

      Participants in this study are randomly assigned to either PE or to individual and group
      therapy. Treatment sessions are conducted weekly for 10 to 20 weeks, based on participants'
      rates of improvement. Participants are assessed before treatment, after 10 weeks, and again
      in the follow-up phase at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-treatment.

    <description>Prolonged Exposure (PE) consists of 10 weekly 90-minute treatment sessions, which may be extended up to 20 sessions, depending on client response. Treatment procedures include education about common reactions to trauma, breathing retraining, prolonged (repeated) exposure to trauma memories, repeated in vivo exposure to situations the client is avoiding due to trauma-related fear, and discussion of thoughts and feelings related to exposure exercises as well as beliefs about self and the world.</description>

    <description>TUGT (Treatment as usual group therapy - used in Study 1), delivered in ten weekly sessions, with 5 to 7 members and two counselors per group. There is no formal, structured format for these groups; counselors are sensitive to the participants' needs and follow their lead re content covered in discussions and exercises.
Supportive counseling (SC - study 2): individual therapy delivered in 10 weekly, 90 minute sessions. Therapist helps patient identify daily stresses that may or may not be related to traumatic events and discusses them in a supportive non-directive mode with a problem-solving orientation. The goal of this present-focused treatment is to provide support and to help the client to identify problems and stresses of daily living and to help her cope with these.</description>
