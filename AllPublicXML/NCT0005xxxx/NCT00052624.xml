      RATIONALE: Immunotoxins can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells.
      Immunotoxin therapy may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic
      astrocytoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of immunotoxin therapy in treating children
      who have progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intratumoral transferrin-CRM107 in pediatric
           patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic
           astrocytoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  Compare the efficacy of this drug in patients with different histological types of
           tumor, degrees of transferrin receptor expression, and serum antidiphtheria antibody
           titer levels.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1
      of 2 treatment groups by age (5-9 vs 10-18).

      All patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery for tumor biopsy and placement of 2
      intratumoral silastic infusion catheters pre-loaded with transferrin-CRM107 (Tf-CRM107).

        -  Group 1 (ages 5-9): Patients receive intratumoral Tf-CRM107 over 3-7 days via catheter.
           Treatment repeats after 6-10 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Three
           cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Tf-CRM107 until the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

        -  Group 2 (ages 10-18): Patients receive intratumoral Tf-CRM107 as in group 1. Two cohorts
           of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Tf-CRM107 until the MTD is determined.

      The MTD in both groups is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
