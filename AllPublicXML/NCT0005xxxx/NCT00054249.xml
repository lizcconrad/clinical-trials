      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of T900607 in treating patients who have
      gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with previously treated
           gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma treated with T900607. (Gastric carcinoma
           closed to accrual as of 02/04.)

        -  Determine the duration of response and time to disease progression in patients treated
           with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive T900607 IV over 1 hour once weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
