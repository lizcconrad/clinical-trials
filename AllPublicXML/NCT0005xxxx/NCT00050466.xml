      This pilot study will examine the usefulness of a new instrument called the Dynamic Light
      Scattering (DLS) device for documenting and monitoring changes in the cornea, the front part
      of the eye where contact lenses are placed. The DLS device uses a low-intensity laser similar
      to that used in supermarket checkouts to measure the cloudiness of the cornea. The results of
      this study may lead to further investigations using DLS to discover the cause of corneal
      clouding and to develop treatments to prevent it.

      Healthy volunteers and patients with corneal clouding or opacification 18 years of age and
      older may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will have a standard eye examination, including a check of visual acuity and eye
      pressure. The retina will also be examined and photographs of the cornea may be taken. For
      the DLS test, the subject sits in front of the device and looks at a yellow-green target
      while the cloudiness of the cornea is measured. Subjects will be tested four times. The
      entire procedure takes less than 30 minutes.

    <textblock>
      Corneal disease and injuries are the leading cause of visits to eye care clinics in the US
      today. These diseases are also some of the most painful eye disorders. Two important areas
      for research on the cornea are 1) to explore and understand the molecular basis of corneal
      transparency and 2) to analyze the molecular nature of corneal inflammation and wound
      healing. We have developed a new clinical device to understand molecular changes that occur
      in the lens, called Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) device. Studies have shown its potential
      in the detection of the earliest changes occurring in the cataract, and have also shown good
      test retest reproducibility of the system. We now would like to apply this technique to study
      changes that occur in corneal opacification. In this pilot project, we would like to study
      the normal cornea in young and older persons (volunteers) as well as cloudy, opaque corneas.
      This will allow us to determine if useful data can be obtained, and if so, lead to further
      studies in various corneal disorders caused by trauma, infections, and dystrophies, as well
      as those caused by systemic or inherited disorders.
