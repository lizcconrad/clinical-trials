  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine the safety and dosage of special cells that may make
      the patients own immune system fight the cancer. To do this, we will put a special gene into
      cancer cells that have been taken from the patient. This will be done in the laboratory. This
      gene will make the cells produce interleukin 2 (IL-2), which is a natural substance that may
      help the immune system kill cancer cells. Additionally, we will stimulate the cancer cells
      with another natural protein called CD40 ligand (CD40L), which preclinical human and animal
      studies suggest will help IL-2 perform better. Some of these cells will then be put back into
      the body. The cells are grown with normal embryonic fibroblasts. Studies of cancers in
      animals and in cancer cells that are grown in laboratories suggest that combining substances
      like IL-2 and CD40L helps the body kill cancer cells.

      The purpose of this study is to learn the side effects and the safest effective dose of these
      special cells on the disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before starting treatment some of the cancer cells will be taken from the patient and
      separated in the laboratory. A specially produced human virus (adenovirus) that carries the
      IL-2 gene will be put into the cells. The rest of the cancer cells will be stimulated to
      express on their surface a substance called the human CD40 ligand. These substances (IL-2 and
      CD40L), already naturally present in the body, are meant to help the immune system fight the
      cancer.

      In this study, the modified cancer cells will be injected under the skin. There will be up to
      six shots. We do not know the best amount of special cells to use, so different patients will
      get different numbers of cells.

      After the first three shots (if more modified cancer cells are available), patients may be
      able to have three additional shots. After they have received six shots, they may be able to
      have additional shots if the cancer has gotten smaller and more of the cells are available.

      A complete history and physical examination is necessary before a patient can be enrolled in
      the study. A physical examination will also be performed weekly for ten weeks after the
      injection, then on week twelve, then monthly for one year. Patients will then have yearly
      checkups for the next fifteen years. After the first and second shots, we will remove some of
      the modified cells that have been injected under the skin, to study them. We will do this by
      removing a section of skin (referred to as a skin biopsy) at the place where the cells were
      injected. These tests will help us to see whether or not the modified cells are killing
      cancer cells and whether or not the cancer cells are growing. If we suspect the cancer cells
      are growing, we may repeat this procedure after the third and fourth shots.

      To study how the immunity is working in the patients system, we will take blood samples
      before the first injection, then weekly for 10 weeks, on week 12, once a month for a year,
      and then eventually once a year for fifteen years. These blood samples must be taken at The
      Methodist Hospital. The total amount of blood that will be obtained is approximately two to
      three tablespoonfuls, which is considered a safe amount. If the patient has additional
      injections, blood will be drawn prior to each injection. Additional office visits may be
      necessary.

      If the patient decides to withdraw at any time during the study both samples and data
      collected during the study will be maintained with identifiers for safety reasons.

    <description>Patients may be treated with a minimum of three up to six injections of their IL-2-secreting and CD40L-expressing autologous B-CLL cells, separated by one to two weeks in an immunological treatment window, i.e. in the absence of concurrent cytotoxic therapy. Any patient whose disease regresses after the administration of 6 injections may be offered further injections (i.e. more than 6 injections) of tumor vaccine at the dose level previously administered, if enough vaccines are available. Patients will receive a fixed dose of IL-2 secreting B-CLL cells throughout the entire treatment protocol (see Section 5.8), determined by previous studies in acute leukemia and in neuroblastoma, in which this level of IL-2 production has been safe. The dose escalation of CD40L-expressing cells is designed to reach the IL2/CD40L ratio shown to be effective in our preclinical models of neuroblastoma and lymphoma.</description>
