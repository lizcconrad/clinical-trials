  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main causes of treatment failure in HIV infected individuals is lack of adherence
      to complicated drug regimens. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      behavioral intervention program designed to improve adherence to anti-HIV drug regimens.
      Participants in this study will be recruited from the University of Alabama at Birmingham
      (UAB) Outpatient HIV Clinic.

    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to complicated antiretroviral (ARV) drug regimens is one of the most pressing
      behavioral problems in the clinical management of HIV infected persons. Recent medical
      advances have made it possible to maintain tighter control of viral replication, allowing
      people with HIV to live longer, healthier lives. However, the complexity of ARV drug regimens
      and drug side effects make medication adherence problematic. Deviations from the prescribed
      regimen may allow the virus to resume rapid replication and develop drug resistant mutations
      that could render the prescribed drugs useless. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a
      6-month, theory-based behavioral intervention to enhance adherence to antiretroviral
      treatment regimens. HIV-related attitudes, depressive symptoms, coping strategies, and social
      support will also be assessed to examine theoretical assumptions regarding the causal
      relationship between psychosocial constructs and medication adherence.

      Participants in this study will be recruited from UAB Outpatient HIV Clinic patients who are
      taking ARV medication. Participants will be randomized to a Standard Adherence Promotion
      Group or an Enhanced Adherence Promotion Group. The Enhanced Adherence Promotion will
      systematically address specific psychosocial issues associated with medication adherence.
      Participants will be followed for 6 months, and adherence will be evaluated at monthly study
      visits. Pill counts, viral loads, self-reported adherence to ARV medication, CD4 count, and
      genotypic viral resistance will be assessed.
