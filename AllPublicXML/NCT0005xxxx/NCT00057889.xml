      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in treating
      patients who have metastatic renal cell cancer (kidney cancer) that is refractory to
      treatment with interleukin-2 or unable to be treated with interleukin-2.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the activity of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal
           antibody in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancer who are refractory to or
           ineligible for interleukin-2.

        -  Determine the impact of this drug on T-cell number and phenotype in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody IV over
      90 minutes once every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an ongoing partial response may receive additional
      courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-103 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-4
      years.
