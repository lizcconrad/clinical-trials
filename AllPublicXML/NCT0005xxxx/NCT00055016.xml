      The purpose of this study is to compile a registry of patients with Fabry disease, an
      inherited metabolic disorder. In this disease, an enzyme called a-galactosidase A, which
      normally breaks down a lipid (fatty substance) called globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), is missing
      or does not function properly. As a result, Gb3 accumulates, causing problems with the
      kidneys, heart, nerves, and blood vessels. It is not known exactly how lipid accumulation
      causes these problems, but in another lipid storage disease called Gaucher disease the
      illness can be reversed if the accumulated lipid is removed by repeated intravenous (into a
      vein) infusions of the deficient enzyme.

      The Fabry disease registry is a voluntary and anonymous list of patients that includes
      information about their health and allows doctors to follow changes in their symptoms and
      test results over time. It also allows doctors to compare symptoms between patients who are
      receiving certain therapies with those who are not receiving therapy. The goals of the
      registry are to:

        -  Better understand the natural history of Fabry disease, including disease variations
           within and between affected families;

        -  Provide a basis for developing guidelines for disease management;

        -  Evaluate how treatment affects the course of disease;

        -  Provide high-quality data and analyses that will help to continuously develop better
           treatments.

      Patients of all ages with biochemical or genetic evidence of Fabry disease (i.e., individuals
      who have a deficiency of the enzyme a-galactosidase A or a mutation in the gene that encodes
      this enzyme, or both) are eligible for this study. This worldwide study will include 100
      patients participating in Fabry disease studies at the NIH. These patients will come to the
      NIH Clinical Center only as required for participation their Fabry disease study. No
      additional procedures will be required for the current registry study.

      NIH patients will take part in the registry study for their lifetime, or as long as they are
      being followed at the NIH for their Fabry disease. At their regularly scheduled NIH clinic
      visits, participants will have routine medical procedures and examinations deemed necessary
      by the doctor. The results of blood and urine tests taken at these visits will be entered
      into the registry database. Blood tests will include information on genotype (determination
      of which gene mutation is responsible for the disease), a-galactosidase A levels, Gb3 levels,
      and creatinine. Urine tests results will include creatinine clearance (a measure of kidney
      function) and protein evaluation.

      PROTOCOL TITLE: Registry of Fabry Disease: A Multicenter, Longitudinal Observational Study

      PROTOCOL IDENTIFIER: FOS (Fabry Outcome Survey)

      PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: Post Marketing Outcome Survey (Outcome Survey)

      SURVEY OBJECTIVES/ENDPOINTS:

      The primary objectives of this outcome survey are to:

        -  enhance the understanding of the natural history of Fabry disease, including the intra-
           and inter-familial variations

        -  provide a basis for the development of management guidelines for Fabry disease

        -  evaluate the impact of therapeutic intervention on the clinical course of Fabry disease

        -  generate data and analyses to enable the continuous improvement of Fabry disease
           treatment

        -  collect long term safety and efficacy data on patients treated with Replagal enzyme
           replacement therapy

      INCLUSION CRITERIA:

      This registry/outcome survey is open for all patients of all ages, male and female, with a
      confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        -  Patients who are unwilling to give informed consent.

        -  Patients who are receiving enzyme replacement therapy other than Replagal for Fabry
           Disease

        -  Patients currently enrolled in an ongoing blinded clinical trial in which the product is
           considered investigational.

      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED AND DURATION OF SUBJECT PARTICIPATION:

      There is no predetermined number of patients that must be enrolled into the outcome survey.
      Patients who have been diagnosed (biochemically or genetically) with Fabry disease that
      consent to participate will be followed for an undetermined amount of time (i.e., until the
      sponsor closes the outcome survey or the patient withdraws consent).

      TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED AND TREATMENT SCHEDULE:

      Patients consenting to participate in the outcome survey will either be untreated or treated
      with Replagal ERT. It is recommended that patients be followed at increments determined to be
      necessary by the treating physician. It is also recommended that data on all patients be
      entered into the outcome survey on a bi-annual basis (every six (6) months).

      Patients will not be supplied with Replagal at no charge as a result of participating in the
      Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS). Patients will receive Replagal through their participation in
      ongoing open label clinical trials or compassionate programs. Additionally, patients may
      receive commercially available product.

      SURVEY ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE:

      It is recommended that patients be followed at clinically relevant intervals determined by
      their treating physician. Data collected is to be entered into the FOS database as soon as
      possible after physician assessments.

      SURVEY METHODOLOGY:

      Observational data will be recorded in the FOS database based on routine clinical evaluations
      performed by the treating physician.

      STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY:

      The statistical analysis of FOS data will be performed by a bio-statistician designated by
      Shire HGT and in accordance with documented company guidelines and standard operating
      procedures.
