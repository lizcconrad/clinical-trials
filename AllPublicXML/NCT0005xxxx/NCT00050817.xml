      RATIONALE:

        -  Atherothrombosis is a progressive and generalized vascular disease resulting in events
           leading to myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, and vascular death.

        -  In patients at risk for this disease, it is characterized by an unpredictable, sudden
           disruption of atherosclerotic plaques, which may lead to total occlusion of artery due
           to formation of a clot. The use of aspirin (blood thinner agent) for reducing those
           major ischemic events is either indicated, or recommended by international guidelines.
           However, aspirin fails to prevent a high percentage of such life-threatening events.
           Therefore, more effective blood thinning therapy may provide additional clinical benefit
           to such patients.

        -  The results of the CURE trial in patients with unstable angina demonstrate the
           additional benefit of long-term treatment (up to one year) with clopidogrel, (a blood
           thinner agent), when administered in combination with standard therapy including
           aspirin. The purpose of CHARISMA is to investigate whether a similar clinical benefit of
           clopidogrel may apply to a broad population of high-risk patients receiving low-dose
           aspirin therapy. Such population includes patients with previous cardiovascular,
           neurovascular or peripheral arterial manifestations of atherothrombosis and patients
           with combinations of recognized risk factors for atherosclerosis.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the efficacy of clopidogrel 75 mg once-daily by comparison with a placebo, in
           preventing cardiovascular morbidity/mortality. The study will compare the efficacy of
           the two regimens in preventing the occurrence of major cardiovascular complications
           (stroke, heart attack, cardiovascular death) in high-risk patients who are otherwise
           receiving low-dose aspirin therapy (75-162 mg daily).

        -  To evaluate the safety of clopidogrel in this population, and more specifically the
           incidence of fatal or severe bleeding (as per GUSTO definition), in order to estimate
           the global benefit of clopidogrel in this patient population.

      TREATMENTS:

        -  Clopidogrel (Plavix® and/or Iscover®) is an agent inhibiting platelet aggregation
           involved in clot formation. Each tablet contains 75mg of clopidogrel. A matching placebo
           of clopidogrel is an inactive substance that looks similar to the active clopidogrel
           tablet.

      TREATMENT PLAN:

        -  There will be two treatment groups; one will receive clopidogrel 75 mg (1 tablet qd),
           the second matching placebo of clopidogrel (1 tablet qd). These study drugs will be
           administered on top of low-dose aspirin (75-162 mg qd) systematically prescribed to such
           patients. In addition, patients enrolled in CHARISMA will be managed as appropriate for
           their risk factors for atherosclerosis: eg. high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
           diabetes…etc.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:

        -  Combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, acute myocardial infarction.

      STUDY EXECUTION:

        -  Some 7,600 patients per group will be recruited within two years. Patients will be
           observed over a maximum of 3.5 years.

      STUDY TERRITORY:

        -  Approximately 900 sites throughout North/South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and
           South Africa.
