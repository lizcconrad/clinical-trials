          -  Bidimensionally measurable disease meeting the minimum requirement of at least 1
             lesion &gt;/= 2.0 cm in a single dimension.

          -  No lymphoma therapy for 3 weeks prior to Study Day 1.

          -  Patients must be recovered from all toxicities associated with prior surgery,
             radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy.

             myeloablative therapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) or peripheral
             blood stem cell (PBSC) rescue.

          -  Prior radioimmunotherapy, including the Zevalin regimen.

          -  Prior immunotherapy, including Rituxan therapy within 6 months of Study Day 1.

          -  Rituxan-refractory (no response to most recent Rituxan-containing regimen, or TTP was
