    <textblock>
      The body produces a natural compound, nitric oxide (NO), which is known to improve the
      elasticity of blood vessels effect cardiac function and play a role in the remodeling process
      after a heart attack. The primary source of NO is one of the amino acids that the body uses
      to form new proteins, L-Arginine; although many individuals with heart disease also take
      medicines to increase the concentrations of NO such as nitroglycerine. The VINTAGE-MI trial
      is intended to investigate wether supplementation of the bodies supply of NO with oral
      administration of L-Arginine will improve the functional recovery of older patients who have
      recently suffered their first heart attack.

      BACKGROUND:

      As we age, both our blood vessels and heart muscle naturally become stiff and loose their
      ability to flex as the heart beats and blood pressure changes. This is believed to worsen
      both blood vessel and cardiac function in older individuals. The stiffened tissue is likely
      to be less able to adapt to the stresses and remodeling that occur after a heart attack
      (myocardial infarction) because the loss of functional heart tissue predisposes the heart to
      poor function and the hearts blood vessels undergo various changes in order to increase the
      supply of blood to the damaged areas.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      VINTAGE-MI is a randomized, double blind study enrolling patients who have recently suffered
      their first heart attack. There are two recruitment clinics within the Johns Hopkins
      University Network, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.
      Following preliminary testing to establish eligibility and baseline function of both the
      heart and blood vessels, study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      L-Arginine or a placebo pill which is identical except that it does not contain L-Arginine.
      These pills will be taken orally 3 times a day for 6 months. Participants will return to the
      clinic 1, 3, and 6 months after they begin taking their medication to have the same
      functional testing repeated.

        Patients will have suffered their first acute Q-wave MI within 3 to 21 days with creatine
        kinase levels 3 times normal. All patients will have systolic blood pressure over 100 mmHg
        and the permission of their attending physician and the ability to give voluntary informed
        consent. Patients will be excluded if they have had a prior Q-wave infarction, present
        cardiogenic shock, unstable angina or non-cardiac disease limiting life expectancy to less
        than 1 year. Other exclusion criteria include significant kidney or liver disease,
        uncontrolled diabetes, or symptomatic cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke). Patients
        who have been previously shown to be non-compliant will be asked not to participate.
