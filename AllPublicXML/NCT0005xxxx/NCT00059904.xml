    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-2
      may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining rituximab with
      interleukin-2 may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining rituximab with interleukin-2
      in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory intermediate- or high-grade
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical efficacy of rituximab and interleukin-2 in patients with relapsed
           or refractory intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the 2-year progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate response with natural killer cell numbers and rituximab, interleukin-2 (IL-2),
           and soluble IL-2 receptor levels in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV once weekly on weeks 1-4 and interleukin-2 subcutaneously 3
      times weekly on weeks 2-9. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-100 patients will be accrued for this study.

          -  Diagnosis of intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma according to the
             Working Formulation, including the following subtypes:

               -  Diffuse large cell lymphoma

               -  Diffuse mixed cell lymphoma

               -  Immunoblastic large cell lymphoma

          -  No primary CNS lymphoma or lymphomatous meningitis NOTE: A new classification scheme
             for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of
             &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of &quot;low&quot;,
             &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
             terminology.
