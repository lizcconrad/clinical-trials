    <textblock>
      Participants are randomly assigned to a year-long family-based intervention or to a no
      contact control group. The intervention focuses on improving parenting practices,
      parent-child interactions, and child social competence.

      Children are assessed at the beginning of the study and again after one year. The development
      of conduct problems, social competence, and school functioning is assessed from second
      through fifth grade. Assessments are made through observations, parent and teacher ratings,
      and diagnostic interviews.
