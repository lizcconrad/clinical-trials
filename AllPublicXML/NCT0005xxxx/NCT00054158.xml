      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop cancer cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping
      blood flow to the tumor. Combining chemotherapy with thalidomide may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and
      thalidomide in treating patients who have newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage III
      multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with newly diagnosed stage I, II, or III
           multiple myeloma treated with vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and low-dose
           thalidomide.

        -  Determine the ability to collect peripheral blood stem cells in patients after treatment
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive vincristine IV and doxorubicin IV continuously on days 1-4 and oral
      dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20. Patients also receive low-dose oral thalidomide
      daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed until disease progression or bone marrow transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
