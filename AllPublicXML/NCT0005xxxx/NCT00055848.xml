      RATIONALE: Genetic studies may help in understanding the genetic processes involved in the
      development of some types of cancer.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the cancer-related genes in patients who have colon cancer
      or adenomatous polyps.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify human colon neoplasia susceptibility genes in patients with colon cancer or
           adenomatous polyps.

        -  Correlate the inheritance of novel susceptibility alleles for adenomatous polyposis of
           the colon with colon neoplasia in these patients.

        -  Correlate colon neoplasia susceptibility with the presence of COX-2, sPLA2, and DNMT
           genes in these patients.

        -  Identify a novel gene that governs increased susceptibility to colon adenoma and cancer
           in the genome of these patients.

    <description>Patients donate blood samples for analysis of colorectal susceptibility genes. Patients also complete a questionnaire regarding family cancer history.
A certificate of confidentiality protecting the identity of research participants in this project has been issued by the National Cancer Institute.
Participants do not receive the results of the genetic testing, and the results do not influence the type or duration of treatment.</description>
