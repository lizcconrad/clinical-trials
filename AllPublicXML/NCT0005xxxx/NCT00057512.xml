  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to determine the safety and tolerability of intratumoral
      M4N. Patients suffering from cancer of the head and neck that is recurrent after primary
      treatment with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy may be eligible. The design is
      a Phase 1 dose escalation study of M4N administered intratumorally once weekly, initially for
      three weeks. Dose will be escalated on the starting schedule to a target of 20 mg/cm3 tumor
      volume and then, new patient cohorts will have their schedule extended to weekly M4N for 4
      weeks. Dose escalation will continue, assuming tolerability, so that cohorts will be treated
      for 6 weeks, and finally, 8 weeks.

      Study data collected will include pre-study demographics and measurements, treatment
      compliance, efficacy determined by tumor measurements, M4N levels in blood for
      pharmacokinetics, serum and biochemical determinations, hematology determinations, and
      patient vital signs.

    <description>The initial dose was 5 mg/cm3 of tumor volume on Days 1, 8, and 15. Dose escalation in cohorts on this schedule took place up to 20 mg/cm3 tumor volume. The dose per lesion was based upon the volume of tumor, and the total dose did not exceed 1197 mg M4N/m2 body surface area.</description>

          -  Measurable tumor by direct inspection, photography, or by imaging (CT scan or MRI).

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months in the Investigators' opinion.

          -  Negative pregnancy test if in women of childbearing potential within 1 week of
             starting therapy.

          -  Patients had provided written informed consent to participate in study.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  ALT/AST ≤ 3 x ULN (upper limit of the normal range), bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN and
             creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN, PT and PTT within normal limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who were pregnant or nursing.

          -  Women of child bearing potential who were unwilling to use an adequate method of
             contraception during the course of the study.

          -  Treatment with prior investigational agent within 30 days of entering the study.

          -  Patients who are unable to comply with the study requirements.

          -  Patients with known sensitivity to any of the study medication components.

          -  Patients not consenting to photography.

          -  Patients with tumors that have enveloped the carotid artery or whose anatomy had been
             distorted such that in the Investigator's opinion present high-risk of perforation or
             compromise during injection.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for the primary carcinoma within 30
             days of dosing and/or had not recovered from prior therapy toxicities.
