  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how tumors in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer respond to treatment with VELCADE alone versus VELCADE given with docetaxel and also
      to see what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your cancer.

      In this study, patients with non-small cell lung cancer that is no longer responding to
      standard medical treatment with another anti-cancer drug will be randomly chosen to receive
      treatment with VELCADE alone or VELCADE in combination with docetaxel. Patients have almost
      equal chance of getting into either of the two treatment arms listed above.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  KPS ≥70%.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          -  Female patient is either post-menopausal, surgically sterilized, or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study.

          -  Willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Peripheral neuropathy of Grade 2 or greater intensity, as defined by the NCI Common
             Toxicity Criteria (CTC):

               -  Grade 2: Objective sensory loss or paresthesia (including tingling), interfering
                  with function, but not interfering with activities of daily living (ADLs).

               -  Grade 3: Sensory loss or paresthesia interfering with ADLs.

               -  Grade 4: Permanent sensory loss that interferes with function.

          -  Previous treatment with VELCADE.

          -  Previous treatment with docetaxel (prior treatment with paclitaxel will be allowed).

          -  Chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Any major surgery within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Inadequate organ function at the Screening visit as defined by the following
             laboratory values:

               -  Platelet count ≤100,000 x 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≤8.0 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤1.5 x 109/L

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥3 times ULN

               -  Creatinine ≥1.8 mg/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≥2 times ULN

             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG
             abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically
             relevant.

          -  No history of brain metastases or central nervous system disease.

          -  Active systemic infection requiring treatment.

             exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ.

          -  History of allergic reaction attributable to compounds containing boron or mannitol.

          -  Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Patients assessed by the
             investigator to be at risk for HIV infection should be tested in accordance with local
             regulations.

          -  Known to be hepatitis B surface antigen-positive or has known active hepatitis C
             infection. Patients assessed by the investigator to be at risk for hepatitis B or C

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or another serious medical or
             psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion, potentially interfere

             pregnant must be established by a negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin
             (β-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during the Screening period. Pregnancy testing
             is not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.
