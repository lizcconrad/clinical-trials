    <textblock>
      This study hopes to evaluate whether the combination of Gemzar plus Alimta will have any
      beneficial effects for patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant
      ovarian or peritoneal cancer. Treatments are weekly for two weeks, with the 3rd week off and
      will be repeated every 21 days. Side effects and the overall safety of the treatment will
      also be monitored and evaluated. In addition, a Quality of Life questionnaire is part of this
      study to help measure patient perceived benefits or drawbacks to this treatment regimen.
