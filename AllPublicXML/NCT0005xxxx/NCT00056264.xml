    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of infliximab
      (Remicade) in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Infliximab
      (Remicade) targets specific proteins in the body's immune system to help control the
      development of inflammation to help reduce painful disease.

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a smoking-related inflammatory lung disease
      that results in reduced lung function, causing the symptoms or problems that you have when
      breathing. COPD includes both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. The symptoms of COPD are
      cough, sputum (phlegm) production, breathlessness, and wheezing. Advanced disease may also
      involve changes in appetite and weight loss. The drug used in this study is called Remicade√¢,
      and the active component is called infliximab. Infliximab binds to and blocks the activity of
      a naturally occurring substance in the body called tumor necrosis factor alpha or TNFa, which
      may be associated with inflammation and a decrease in lung function.The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of infliximab in the treatment of patients with
      symptoms of moderate to severe COPD.Patients will be receive infusions of either placebo, 3
      mg/kg infliximab or 5mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24.Safety evaluations
      will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory
      tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and
      severity of adverse events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive
      infusions of either placebo, 3 mg/kg infliximab or 5mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, 12,
      18, and 24.
