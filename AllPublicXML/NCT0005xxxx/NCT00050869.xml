  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor training results in use dependent plasticity (UDP), thought to underlie recovery of
      motor function after brain injury. The purpose of this protocol is to determine (a) if
      movement observation results in encoding of a motor memory in the primary motor cortex and
      (b) if observation of motor training can enhance the effects of physical training in healthy
      volunteers. If so, this may become an important tool in rehabilitative treatment for patients
      who are unable or partially able to train. We will test our hypotheses by means of focal
      single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a group of healthy volunteers. Our
      outcome measure will be the change in TMS-evoked movement direction as a function of training
      strategy. So far we found that this is the case in healthy volunteers (see data in analysis
      of the study). The purpose of this amendment is to determine if action observation can elicit
      the same effects in adult chronic ischemic stroke patients who have had originally
      significant motor weakness but recovered to the point of being able to perform the motor
      tasks, possibly resulting in a useful rehabilitative strategy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Healthy volunteers and patients with thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions at
        least 6 months after the stroke, aged 18 to 80 years. Patients who initially had a severe
        motor paresis (below MRC grade 2), which subsequently recovered to the point that they have
        a residual motor deficit but can perform the required tasks, and those in whom isolated
        thumb movements can be evoked by TMS. Handedness will be assessed by the Edinburgh
        inventory scale. Subjects should be able to sustain attention to the task over 30 minutes.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        History of surgery with metallic implants or known history of metallic particles in the
        eye.

        Patients with cardiac pacemaker, neural stimulators, cochlear implants, implanted
        medication pumps.

        Patients with history of alcohol and drug abuse, psychiatric illness (depression, attention
        deficit disorder, or dementia).

        Patients with severe uncontrolled medical problems (e.g. cardiovascular diseases,
        hypertension, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, active cancer, renal, liver, severe pulmonary
        diseases, infectious diseases).

        Patients with epilepsy or history of loss of consciousness.

        Patients with use of medications that influence synaptic plasticity as evaluated by the
        investigator, like antipsychotic, antidepressant acting drugs, benzodiazepines.

        Patients above 80 and less than 18 years of age.

        Children.

        Pregnant women in the last trimester.

        Patients with more than one stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory.

        Patients with bilateral motor impairment.

        Patients with cerebellar or brainstem lesions.

        Patients unable to perform the task (wrist or elbow flexion at least MRC grade 2).

        Patients with unstable cardiac arrhythmia.

        Patients with h/o hyperthyroidism or individuals receiving drugs acting primarily on the
        central nervous system that lower the seizure threshold or influence synaptic plasticity
        like neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptic medication.
