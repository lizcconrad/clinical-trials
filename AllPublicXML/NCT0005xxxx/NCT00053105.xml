      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effect of combination chemotherapy on the body when
      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose of pixantrone when
           administered with cytarabine, methylprednisolone, and cisplatin in patients with
           relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between toxicity and systemic exposure to this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study of
      pixantrone.

      Patients receive pixantrone IV over 1 hour on day 1, methylprednisolone IV over 15 minutes on
      days 1-5, cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1-4, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on day 5.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pixantrone until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the
      recommended dose, which is defined as the dose preceding the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
