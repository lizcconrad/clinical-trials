      RATIONALE: Analyzing genes that are present in cancer cells may be useful as a method for
      predicting the response of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to cancer treatment. Imaging procedures
      such as positron emission tomography (PET) scans may improve the ability to measure how well
      cancer has responded to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying molecular risk assessment to see how well it works
      in predicting response to therapy in patients who are receiving treatment for non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether molecular risk assessment can identify groups of patients with diffuse
           large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who will demonstrate at least 50% difference
           in early response rates to treatment as determined by positron-emission tomography (PET)
           imaging.

        -  Determine, by PET imaging, the response rate of patients treated with cyclophosphamide,
           doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab.

        -  Determine whether early response rates can be predicted by gene expression profiles at
           diagnosis in these patients.

        -  Compare gene expression profiles of patients with refractory or relapsed large cell NHL
           with profiles of the disease at diagnosis.

        -  Determine relapse-free and overall survival rates of these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of a new NHL treatment algorithm based on prognostic index and
           molecular risk, and early response assessment by PET imaging.

      OUTLINE: Molecular risk assessment is performed using lymph node tissue from initial
      diagnosis to test for &quot;activated&quot; genes before starting treatment.

      Patients receive rituximab IV over 3-6 hours, cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes,
      doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes, and vincristine IV over 5 minutes on day 1 and oral prednisone
      on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3-8 courses. Patients undergo whole-body
      positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning at baseline and after course 3 to determine
      response. Results from the genetic testing and PET scans are used to determine further
      treatment recommendations.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
