  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the best way to prevent heart disease and stroke in
      people with lupus (systemic lupus erythematosis, or SLE). The study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of medication and a phone-based education program in controlling four risk
      factors for heart disease: smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, and inactivity. The study
      will also test the safety of commonly used heart medications in people with lupus.

    <textblock>
      People with SLE are at much higher risk for mortality due to atherosclerotic vascular disease
      (ASVD). Available data suggest that the usual mechanics of and risk factors for
      atherosclerosis are enhanced by factors such as corticosteroid use and SLE itself. This study
      will evaluate a medication and education program designed to prevent ASVD complications
      (primary prevention) or their recurrence (secondary prevention). The study will also measure
      the compliance and retention rate for the prevention program over 4 years.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either preventive heart disease
      medications or placebo. Participants in the medication arm will receive pravastatin alone or
      in combination with the following: aspirin, ramipril, or a combination of vitamins B6, B12,
      and folate. All participants in this study will receive basic education on how to optimize
      their heart health. Educational material will be sent to the patients as well as to support
      persons whom they have named. One group will receive tailored education based on a particular
      risk factor. Participants will have three study visits and follow-up telephone visits four
      times a year. Study visits will include a medical history and basic laboratory blood tests.
      Participants with documented high blood pressure will receive a home monitoring unit and be
      asked to monitor their blood pressure. Participants will be followed for 2 to 4 years.
