    <textblock>
      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of SGN-00101 in preventing anal cancer in
      HIV-positive patients who have high-grade anal neoplasia. Chemoprevention therapy is the use
      of certain drugs to try to prevent the development of cancer. SGN-00101 may be effective in
      preventing anal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of SGN-00101 in HIV-positive patients with
      high-grade anal squamous intraepithelial lesions.

      II. Determine clinical response and histologic/cytologic regression in patients treated with
      this drug.

      III. Determine immune response in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the effect
      of this drug on HIV viral load and CD4 level in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously once on weeks 0, 4, and 8. Treatment continues in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 5-6 patients receive escalating doses of SGN-00101 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1, 4, and 10 months.
