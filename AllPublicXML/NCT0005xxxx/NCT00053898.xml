      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen may fight
      breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. Anastrozole may fight breast cancer by
      decreasing estrogen production. It is not yet known whether anastrozole is more effective
      than tamoxifen in preventing the recurrence of breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying anastrozole to see how well it works
      compared to tamoxifen in preventing the recurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women
      with ductal carcinoma in situ who are undergoing lumpectomy and radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the value of anastrozole vs tamoxifen, in terms of preventing recurrence (i.e.,
           local, regional, and distant recurrences and contralateral breast cancer), after
           lumpectomy and radiotherapy in postmenopausal women with ductal carcinoma in situ
           (DCIS).

        -  Compare subsequent disease occurrence, in terms of invasive breast cancer (local,
           regional, distant, or contralateral), ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer
           (invasive and DCIS), and non-breast second primary malignancies, in patients treated
           with these drugs.

        -  Compare quality of life and symptoms of patients treated with these drugs.*

        -  Compare quality-adjusted survival time of patients treated with these drugs.*

        -  Compare the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with these drugs. NOTE:
           *The quality of life study closed to accrual as of 12/28/04.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to age (under 60 vs 60 and over). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms (arm I and arm II closed to accrual as of 6/15/06).

        -  Arm I (closed to accrual as of 6/15/06): Patients receive oral tamoxifen and oral
           placebo once daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II (closed to accrual as of 6/15/06): Patients receive oral anastrozole and oral
           placebo once daily for 5 years.

      Beginning within 8 weeks of randomization, all patients also undergo whole breast
      radiotherapy, unless the patient is enrolled in protocol NSABP-B-39 and randomized to the
      partial breast irradiation group.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.

      For patients enrolled in the quality of life study, quality of life is assessed at baseline
      and then every 6 months for 6 years.*

      NOTE: *The quality of life study closed to accrual as of 12/28/04.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 patients (1,500 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 5 years (arm I and arm II closed to accrual as of 6/15/06).

          <description>The primary outcome of the QOL substudy was the Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 12 (SF-12) physical health component scale score. The SF-12 physical score was calculated to have a range of 0–100 and was normalized to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general population. Higher scores indicate better health.</description>
          <population>The Quality of Life study was performed in a subset of B-35 participants. Participants were required to have submitted a baseline and at least one follow-up QOL form to be included in the analysis.</population>
