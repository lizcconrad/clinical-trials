      This study will identify changes that occur in the nervous system of healthy normal
      volunteers while they are learning a cycling task.

      Healthy subjects 18 years of age and older who can cycle for 16 minutes may be eligible for
      this study. Candidates will be screened with a brief medical history and physical
      examination.

      Participants will be assigned to one of three groups:

        -  Complex training: Cycling for 16 minutes at a constant speed of 60 rpm with frequent
           changes in pedal resistance.

        -  Simple training: Cycling for 16 minutes at a constant speed of 60 rpm with no changes in
           pedal resistance.

        -  No training: Remaining seated on the bike for 16 minutes performing no exercise.

      Participants will cycle for 16 minutes for the training task, plus 4 minutes before and after
      the training. Reflexes will be measured with nerve conduction studies and somatosensory
      evoked potential (SSEP) recordings before and after training. Nerve conduction studies
      measure the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the
      connection between the nerve and the muscle. For these studies, a probe is placed on the skin
      over the calf muscles and the knee to deliver a small electrical stimulus, and wires are
      taped to the skin to record the impulses. SSEP recordings, which measure of the excitability
      of the brain to sensory stimuli, are collected from electrodes placed on the scalp.

      After the training period, multiple train stimulation (MTS) is applied for 10 minutes. For
      MTS, weak electrical currents are delivered for 10 seconds every 10 seconds. These stimuli
      produce a buzzing sensation without pain, discomfort, or muscle twitching. The MTS is
      followed by another 4 minutes of cycling.

      Participants also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For this procedure, an
      insulated wire coil is held over the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the
      coil, creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and skull and causes small
      electrical currents in the brain cortex (outer part of the brain). The stimulation may cause
      twitching in the muscles of the face, arm, or leg. The electrical activity of the muscles is
      recorded with a computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin
      with tape.

      In a previous study, we have shown that locomotor training with frequent changes in pedal
      resistances (complex training) elicits significant improvement in locomotor performance
      compared to training consisting of constant pedal resistance (simple training). Behavior
      gains associated with complex training correlate with down-regulation in the excitability of
      the alpha-motoneurone pools controlling muscles involved in the training task, as measured by
      changes in the soleus H-reflex, raising the hypothesis of a cause-effect link between
      performance improvements and modulation of spinal cord function. The purpose of this protocol
      is to determine if down-regulation in the excitability of the alpha-motoneuron pool is
      required for the improvement in locomotor performance. To address this issue, we hypothesize
      that up-regulation of alpha-motoneuron excitability will cancel improvements in locomotor
      performance elicited by complex training more than in subjects undergoing a period of simple
      training. The results of this study would provide novel information on the spinal substrates
      underlying learning of a locomotor task in intact humans and could be relevant to the design
      of rehabilitative strategies in patients with locomotor disorders.
