  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining BMS-247550 with cisplatin in
      treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose of BMS-247550 when administered with cisplatin in
      patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. (Phase I)
      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with this regimen.
      (Phase II) IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. V. Correlate
      selected markers from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor samples with toxicity and
      response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of BMS-247550.

      Phase I: Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 10 additional
      patients receive treatment as above at the recommended phase II dose of BMS-247550.

      Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in Phase I at the recommended phase II dose of
      BMS-247550.
