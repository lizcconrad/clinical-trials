  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a substudy of ACTG A5142. The purpose of this substudy is to evaluate blood vessel
      function in HIV-infected patients taking anti-HIV drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction, assessed by measurement of brachial artery reactivity, is associated
      with coronary artery disease. Previous studies showed that patients taking HIV protease
      inhibitors (PIs) had a buildup of fatty deposits in their arteries and impaired flow-mediated
      vasodilation of the brachial artery, whereas endothelial function was normal in HIV-infected
      individuals not taking PIs. The effect of three different antiretroviral regimens on
      endothelial function in antiretroviral naïve HIV-infected patients will be examined in this
      substudy.

      Patients in this substudy will have Brachial Artery Reactivity Tests (BARTs), which are
      painless ultrasound tests of an artery in the lower arm. Brachial artery reactivity will be
      measured at entry and at 4 and 24 weeks after patients are randomized to one of three
      open-label drug regimens in ACTG A5142. Brachial artery reactivity in response to two
      vasoactive stimuli (flow-mediated and nitroglycerin) will be assessed by measuring brachial
      artery diameter and flow velocity. Blood will be drawn at Weeks 4 and 24 for insulin and
      lipid tests. Patients will fast and refrain from tobacco and caffeine use for at least 8
      hours prior to each study visit. For the duration of the substudy, patients will be asked not
      to change the amount of fruits, juices, antioxidants, and tea that they consume.
