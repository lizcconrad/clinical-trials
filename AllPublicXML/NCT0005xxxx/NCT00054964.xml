  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to examine the effectiveness of a breath-operated albuterol inhaler
      in asthma patients who have difficulty using their standard &quot;press-and-breathe&quot; inhaler.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, 2-period, 2-sequence,
      single dose-dose, crossover comparison of the ability of Albuterol BOI-HFA to produce
      bronchodilation relative to that produced by to albuterol MDI-HFA in at least 12 asthmatics
      with poor inhaler coordinating ability.
