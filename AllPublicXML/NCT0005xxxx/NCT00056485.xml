      Depression in long-term care facilities is a significant public health issue. Up to 50% of
      nursing home residents are affected by significant depressive symptoms. The decreased health
      and limited cognitive ability of many nursing home residents makes treatment and research
      extremely challenging. This study will attempt to identify and implement treatments for
      depressed nursing home residents.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either an active intervention or treatment as
      usual for 6 weeks. The active intervention is followed by 4 weeks of maintenance. The
      intervention is implemented primarily by existing nursing facility staff and focuses on
      increasing opportunities for residents to experience pleasant events through increased levels
      of activity and positive affect. The maintenance treatment involves incorporation of
      protocol-based activities into patient care plans. Patients have a follow-up visit 12 weeks
      after the study. Psychiatric evaluations, depression and mood rating scales, observed affect
      and activity participation, behavior problems, and staff burden are assessed.
