             (including catheter-related).

          -  Pathogen resistant to, or patient intolerant of: beta-lactams, vancomycin,
             quinupristin/dalfopristin, or linezolid.

          -  Unable to receive any other standard commercially available antibacterial therapy for
             the infection.
