  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose of suramin when given together with paclitaxel in
      treating women with stage IIIB-IV breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Suramin may increase the
      effectiveness of paclitaxel by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose of suramin in combination with paclitaxel (TXT) that results in suramin
      plasma concentrations approaching 10-50 uM over the duration, when TXT in the plasma is at
      therapeutically significant levels, in women with stage IIIB or IV breast cancer. (Phase I)
      II. Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of low-dose suramin in these patients. (Phase I) II.
      Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)
      III. Determine the 1-year survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of suramin followed by a phase II
      multicenter study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive low-dose suramin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and paclitaxel
      IV over 1 hour once weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive adjusted doses of
      suramin until a target dose is determined. The suramin target dose is defined as the dose at
      which at least 5 of 6 patients achieve the target plasma concentration of 10-50 uM over the
      duration when paclitaxel levels are therapeutic.

      PHASE II: Patients receive paclitaxel in combination with the target dose of suramin as
      above.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients will be accrued for the phase I study within 9
      months. A total of 28 patients will be accrued for the phase II study within 18-24 months.
