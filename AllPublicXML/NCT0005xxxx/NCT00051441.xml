  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of benzydamine
      hydrochloride 0.15% oral rinse to a vehicle oral rinse in the treatment of radiation-induced
      oral mucositis, and to compare the care normally used for radiation-induced oral mucositis to
      vehicle oral rinse to ensure that the vehicle does not have detrimental effects on the oral
      mucosa

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study including an
      open-label standard of care arm, to determine the effectiveness and safety of benezydamine
      hydrochloride 0.15% oral rinse as compared with vehicle oral rinse, and vehicle oral rinse as
      compared to the care normally used in the treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis. The
      hypotheses are that benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15% oral rinse is better than vehicle oral
      rinse as measured by the proportion of patients reaching a WHO mucositis score of 3 by 5500
      cGy and vehicle is no worse than the standard of care as measured by the proportion of
      patients reaching a WHO mucositis score of 3 by 5500 cGy. Patients receiving benzydamine
      hydrochloride 0.15% or vehicle double-blind oral rinses will place 15 mL in the mouth for 2
      minutes, gargling for a few seconds at the beginning and end of the rinse, and then
      expectorate the entire dose. Dosing with oral rinses will be every 2 - 3 hours while awake
      for a minimum of 4 times daily to a maximum of 8 times per day. Double-blind oral rinses will
      continue daily throughout the duration of the subjects radiation treatment regimen plus 2
      additional weeks

             supraglottic area, nasopharynx, maxillary sinus and parotid gland

          -  high risk for developing oral and/or oropharyngeal mucositis due to radiation to head
             and neck areas

          -  scheduled to receive a continuous course (eg, often six to eight weeks) of
             conventional or hyperfractionated external beam radiation for cancer of the head and
             neck region (subjects who had surgery prior to radiation are eligible) with or without
             concomitant chemotherapy

          -  at least two oral tissue sites (not including areas of previous lesions, tumor,
             surgical resection, or the lips) must be included in the RT treatment volume and
             planned to receive a total radiation dose of 5500 cGy or higher, given in a single
             daily fraction of 180 to 220 cGy or twice daily fractions of 110 to 150 cGy

        Exclusion Criteria:
