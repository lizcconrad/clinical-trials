  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of giving TNFerade™
      with 5-FU, Cisplatin and radiation therapy to patients with locally advanced, esophageal
      cancer prior to surgical resection. TNFerade™ is a replication deficient (E1, E3 and E4
      deleted) adenovirus vector containing the gene for TNF-alpha controlled by a radiation
      inducible promoter. This allows the expression of TNF-alpha to be greatest in the area
      receiving radiation. TNF-alpha is a potent cytokine that has been shown to have potent
      anti-cancer activities but, due to systemic toxicity, could not be delivered at effective
      doses. TNFerade™ is a novel way of selective delivery of TNF-alpha to tumor cells.

      TNFerade™ will be delivered once a week for five weeks by direct intratumoral injection by
      using endoscopy or Endoscopic Ultrasound. 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/day) will be delivered via
      continuous infusion for 96 hours during weeks 1 and 4. Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) will be delivered
      on Day 1 and Day 29 intravenously. The dose of radiation delivered will be 45 Gy in 1.8 Gy
      fractions for 5 weeks.
