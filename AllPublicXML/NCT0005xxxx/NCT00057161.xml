      Money management is a neglected issue in maintaining persons with mental illness in the
      community. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessed whether a community-based
      representative payee program, i.e., money management of Social Security and/or VA benefits,
      coordinated with VA psychiatric care (CO-RP) could be more effective than customary treatment
      for veterans who had no representative payee.

      Background:

      Money management is a neglected issue in maintaining persons with mental illness in the
      community. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessed whether a community-based
      representative payee program, i.e., money management of Social Security and/or VA benefits,
      coordinated with VA psychiatric care (CO-RP) could be more effective than customary treatment
      for veterans who had no representative payee.

      Objectives:

      After 184 subjects were randomly assigned to CO-RP experimental group or customary care
      control group, hypotheses were that the CO-RP group would experience: 1) more frequent
      enrollment in the representative payee program, 2) improved residential status, 3) improved
      health-related quality of life, including less mental illness symptomatology, 4) less
      substance abuse, 5) improved money management.

      Methods:

      Six-month interviews were completed on 152 of 184 possible subjects (83%) and 12-month
      interviews were completed on 149 of 184 possible subjects (81%). The six and twelve-month
      outcomes were analyzed with analysis of covariance using data from the baseline pretest.

      Status:

      Completed.
