  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether modafinil improves cognition in patients with schizophrenia
      and healthy volunteers. Modafinil is a drug that has been FDA approved for day-time
      sleepiness and allegedly increase the amount of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the frontal
      cortex of the brain

      Psychopharmacological modulation of the catecholaminergic system can enhance some aspects of
      cognitive function. For example, COMT inhibitors can slightly improve working
      memory/executive function. Similarly, modafinil, a catecholaminergic agonist that increases
      extracellular dopamine in the prefrontal cortex was also shown to improve delay-dependent
      working memory. Differences in the response between individuals might be related to a number
      of factors, including variations in the genes. The recent finding that a polymorphism in the
      catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene, which produces a 4 fold change in enzyme activity,
      accounts for 4% of the variance in performance of working memory tasks in humans suggest that
      COMT genotype may predict response to COMT inhibitors or to other agonists that increase
      catecholaminergic function in the frontal cortex.

      In the present investigation our goal is to examine, in normal controls and patients with
      schizophrenia, the effect of modafinil, a drug that increases DA output in the frontal
      cortex, on cognitive function and brain physiology. We predict that both normal controls and
      patients with schizophrenia with the val/val genotype will have a significant improvement in
      working memory compared with individuals possessing other genotypes. Furthermore, in
      conjunction with other NIMH imaging protocols, we predict that modafinil will produce a
      similar genotype-dependent effect on the neurophysiological correlates related to working
      memory assayed with fMRI. The present protocol will provide new insights on the importance of
      this genetic polymorphism in the regulation of aminergic-controlled cognitive function in
      normal individuals. Furthermore, this protocol will test whether modafinil offers a new
      treatment -based on genotype - for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The FDA granted a
      waiver for the use of Modafinil in this study.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Prior participation under NIH protocol # 95-M-0150, or new normal volunteers. Patients with
        Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder that meet criteria for NIH protocol # 95-M-0150
        will be included.

        No active Axis I or Axis II diagnosis in normal volunteers.

        Age range: 18-50 years.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects with a history of cardiovascular disease, liver disease and other medical
        illnesses, current active substance abuse or history of substance abuse for more than 5
        years, and untreated or uncontrolled hypertension will be excluded. Individuals with
        persistent tardive dyskinesia will be excluded from the study. An electrocardiogram, blood
        pressure, pulse rate and metabolic panel including LFTs will be checked on all subjects
        prior to participation in the study.

        enhancers or any illicit drugs of abuse, or MAO inhibitors will be excluded.

        Normal control subjects taking any medications affecting brain function will be excluded.

        Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a urine
        pregnancy test the day the study initiates and screened by history for the possibility of
        pregnancy.
