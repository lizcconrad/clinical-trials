    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of karenitecin in treating patients who have
      persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer that has not
      responded to platinum-based treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the antitumor activity of karenitecin in patients with persistent or recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive karenitecin IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
