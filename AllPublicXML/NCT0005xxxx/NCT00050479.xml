      This study will compare the side effects of two laser treatments for diabetic macular edema,
      a common condition in patients with diabetes. In macular edema, blood vessels in the retina,
      a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye become leaky and the retina swells. The
      macula, the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision may also swell,
      causing vision loss. Traditional laser treatment (argon blue or green or yellow) for macular
      swelling, or edema, causes scarring that can expand and possibly lead to more loss of vision.
      Studies with a different type of laser (diode) may be less damaging. The results of this
      study on side effects of the treatments will be used to design a larger study of
      effectiveness. This study will also examine whether celecoxib (CelebrexÂ® (Registered
      Trademark)), an anti-arthritis drug that reduces inflammation and swelling, can reduce
      inflammation and swelling of the retina. Patients with elevated cholesterol levels will be
      invited to participate in a cholesterol reduction part of the study to compare normal-pace
      cholesterol reduction with accelerated reduction.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macular edema that
      requires laser treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the
      following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history: to review past medical conditions and treatments.

        -  Physical examination: to measure vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature,
           breathing rate) and examine the head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, arms and legs.

        -  Eye examination: to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and examine pupils, lens,
           retina, and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops for this examination.

        -  Blood tests: to measure cholesterol, blood clotting time, hemoglobin A1C (a measure of
           diabetes control), and to evaluate liver and kidney function.

        -  Eye photography: to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in
           the future. Special photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that
           flashes a bright light into the eye. From 2 to 20 pictures may be taken, depending on
           the eye condition.

        -  Fluorescein angiography: to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel
           abnormality.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to take celecoxib or placebo (an inactive, look-alike
      pill). Participants who have elevated cholesterol levels may return for a brief visit after 1
      month. All patients will return for follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients who
      require laser treatment will be randomly assigned to one of the two laser treatments. For
      these procedures, eye drops are put in the eye to numb the surface and a contact lens is
      placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Several visits may be required for
      additional laser treatments. The maximum number of treatments depends on how well the
      treatment is working. Patients who respond well to the study medication may receive no laser
      treatments. After the first year, patients will be followed every 6 months until either the
      patient returns for a 3-year visit, the last enrolled patient returns for the 1-year visit,
      or the patient requests to leave the study. During the follow-up visits, patients' response
      to treatment will be evaluated with repeat tests of several of the screening exams.

      This randomized pilot study is an important first step in planning a large multi-center
      clinical trial to evaluate medical and laser approaches that could improve the visual outcome
      for patients with diabetic retinopathy. This study will provide preliminary safety data on
      these therapies as well as allow for assessment of the performance of ocular outcomes and
      study design for use in subsequent trials. If there are no safety concerns, the results of
      this pilot will be helpful in the design of a large multicenter clinical trial by providing
      data on estimates of expected treatment effects.

      Using a factorial design, this study will compare (1) diode (micropulse) laser
      photocoagulation to mild ETDRS style focal photocoagulation and, (2) treatment with a COX-2
      inhibitor (celecoxib), or placebo prior to and following laser photocoagulation. The primary
      outcomes are a visual acuity drop or increase of 15 letters or more from baseline to year 3.
      The secondary outcome is a significant reduction in macular edema, defined as a 50% reduction
      in thickening as measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a two step reduction in
      macular thickness compared to standard stereoscopic fundus photographs, and a 50% reduction
      in the area of leakage as measured by fluorescein angiography. The University of Wisconsin
      Fundus Photography Reading Center will grade OCT, photographs, and angiograms and will be
      masked to treatment assignment. Other secondary outcomes will include the timing of the first
      required laser treatment, changes in visual acuity throughout the study, and the number of
      laser treatments required during the course of the study. In addition, all adverse events and
      abnormal laboratory values will be collected and tabulated. Specific objectives regarding
      safety and efficacy follow:

      Safety

      Is the risk of visual loss in patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema
      potentially different across treatment groups?

      Preliminary Assessment of Potential Outcomes

      Is there evidence that any treatment combinations could be effective in reducing retinal
      thickening?

      Is there evidence that celecoxib may inhibit or induce retinal thickening?

      What are the estimated treatment effects on vision?

      Is the number of laser treatments required to achieve a reduction in retinal thickening
      similar across treatment groups?

      The tertiary objective of this study will be to examine the effects of dramatically reducing
      low-density lipoproteins cholesterol in patients with diabetic macular edema and elevated
      serum lipid levels. Change vision and retinal thickness will be compared across three groups;
      (1) patients without elevated serum lipids at baseline, (2) patients with elevated lipid
      levels at baseline and receive standard of care treatment, and (3) patients with elevated
      lipid levels at baseline and are aggressively treated pharmacologically.
