      The purpose of this study is to determine any adverse effects of PRO 542 after administration
      and to determine the anti-HIV effects of PRO 542 in the patient.

    <textblock>
      A 2 arm study involving a series of 3 triweekly doses of PRO 542. One arm will involve
      patients on a stable dose of anti-retroviral therapy and the other arm will consist of
      patients not receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Three patients will be enrolled in each arm
      followed by a safety evaluation. Following the safety evaluation, 3 more patients may be
      enrolled in each arm. After the first 12 patients, an additional 12 patients may be enrolled
      pending safety data.
