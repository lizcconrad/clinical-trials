      Background:

      Although substance abuse treatment continuing care participation is strongly related to
      positive treatment outcomes, participation rates are low and few interventions have been
      developed that improve continuing care adherence and outcome.

      Objectives:

      The objectives of the study were: 1) to compare the effectiveness of an aftercare
      intervention consisting of a participation contract, attendance prompts, and attendance
      reinforcers (CPR) to a standard treatment (STX) on adherence to therapy; and 2) to assess the
      effects of this intervention on treatment outcome

      Methods:

      We recruited 150 veterans from the Salem VAMC�s SARRTP who could participate in aftercare.
      Our population is similar to those in other VA�s (97% male, 54% Caucasian, 46% minority, 49
      years mean age, 44% alcohol dependent only, 56% drug dependent, and 44% with a dual
      diagnosis). In this randomized clinical trial, treatment adherence and outcome were measured
      at baseline and 3-, 6- and 12-months after participants entered treatment using interviews,
      questionnaires, alcohol and drug screens, VA medical records, and therapist ratings. The
      study design is a repeated measures nested cohort design, with an intervention and a standard
      care group. The primary outcome, abstinence rate, will be analyzed using a logistic
      regression model in which the parameters of interest are estimated using Generalized
      Estimating Equations (GEE).

      Status:

      Participant recruitment and follow-up interviews were completed in June 2003 and August 2004,
      respectively. The HSR&amp;D final report was submitted in April 2005. The main results paper and
      additional papers will be submitted for publication in 2005.
