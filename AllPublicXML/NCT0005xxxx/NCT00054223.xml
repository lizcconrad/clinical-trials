      RATIONALE: Studying individuals who are enrolled in phase I clinical trials may help to
      improve the way in which clinical trials are conducted.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying patients' personality traits, reasons for
      participating in the trial, and understanding of their medical situation, prognosis, and
      risks and benefits of participating in a phase I trial.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the range of personality traits of patients enrolled in a phase I clinical
           trial.

        -  Determine these patients' understanding of their medical situation and prognosis.

        -  Determine these patients' understanding of risks and benefits of phase I clinical
           trials.

        -  Determine these patients' reasons for participating in a phase I clinical trial.

        -  Determine the risk/benefit trade-offs of these patients.

        -  Determine the existential outlook of these patients.

        -  Determine the information gathering nature of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Before beginning phase I clinical trial treatment, patients complete a survey over 30-45
      minutes administered by an interviewer. Patients then self-administer the Temperament and
      Character Inventory assessment over 30 minutes.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 250 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
