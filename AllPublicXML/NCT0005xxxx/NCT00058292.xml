      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies such as yttrium Y90 ibritumomab tiuxetan can
      locate cancer cells and deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to them without harming
      normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining yttrium Y90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and
      chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses
      of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well giving yttrium Y90 ibritumomab tiuxetan with
      high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant work in treating patients
      with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, in terms of
           absorbed radiation to critical organs, when administered with high-dose chemotherapy
           followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with
           relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine whether the residual radioactivity detected at the time of stem cell
           reinfusion affects the reinfused cells and delays engraftment in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-Y2B8).

        -  Radioimmunotherapy: Patients receive rituximab IV followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab
           tiuxetan (for imaging) IV over 10 minutes on day -22. Patients then receive rituximab IV
           and IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes on day -14.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  High-dose conditioning regimen: Patients receive BEAM chemotherapy comprising carmustine
           IV over 2 hours on day -6, etoposide IV over 2 hours twice daily and cytarabine IV over
           1 hour twice daily on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV over 1 hour on day -1.

        -  Autologous stem cell transplantation: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells are
           reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning
           on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed at 30 days, 3 and 6 months, and then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
