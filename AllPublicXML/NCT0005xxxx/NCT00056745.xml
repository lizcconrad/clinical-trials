  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and immune system response to the TBC-3B
      HIV vaccine when it is injected either into the groin area or into the arm. The goal is to
      determine which injection site is better at producing a particular type of immune response.
      This study is not evaluating the effectiveness of the vaccine, so volunteers must maintain
      low risk behavior for HIV transmission throughout the study.

      The goal of this vaccination study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the
      Therion Biologic Corporation (Cambridge, MA) TBC-3B vaccine. TBC-3B consists of live,
      recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the env and gag/pol genes of HIV-1 strain IIIB. TBC-3B
      will be administered by subcutaneous injection in the groin and in the deltoid region, with
      the aim of determining which site is better at inducing mucosal immune responses. Because the
      groin area drains to the inguinal lymph nodes, vaccines given there may stimulate local
      immunologic activity in the draining rectal mucosa as well as systemic immunologic activity
      in the blood.

      Volunteers will be followed for 20 months. The first 2 months of the study will be an
      evaluation of volunteers' normal immune function. Volunteers will then be randomly selected
      to receive the TBC-3B experimental HIV vaccine in either the groin area or in the deltoid
      region. Neither volunteers nor study personnel will know which group the volunteer will be in
      until the day of the first immunization. All volunteers will receive TBC-3B.

      During the 20 months of the study, volunteers will be asked to donate blood up to 14 times,
      undergo seven flexible sigmoidoscopies with biopsies, and receive three pairs of vaccine
      injections. For up to 36 days after each experimental vaccination, volunteers will be asked
      to abstain from activity that might spread the virus in the vaccine and put others at risk.
      Volunteers will receive specific instructions on how to avoid these risks. Volunteers will
      also be asked not to engage in receptive anal intercourse during the study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  HIV uninfected

          -  Low risk for HIV-1 (no sexually transmitted disease within 1 year of study entry, no
             history of injection drug use, no sex with an HIV infected individual or active
             injection drug user within 6 months of study entry, no unsafe sexual activity with
             unknown partners) or mutually monogamous relationship with a known HIV seronegative
             partner (per subject report) for 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Born after 1970

          -  Willingness to abstain from sexual activity for up to 30 days after each vaccination

             study

          -  Available for follow-up during the 20 month duration of the study
