      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Giving radiation therapy in different ways with combination chemotherapy may kill any
      remaining tumor cells following surgery. It is not yet known which radiation therapy regimen
      combined with combination chemotherapy is more effective in treating medulloblastoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare different radiation therapy regimens plus
      combination chemotherapy in treating children who have undergone surgery for medulloblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the event-free survival rate in pediatric patients with standard-risk
           medulloblastoma treated with conventional vs hyperfractionated radiotherapy and
           vincristine followed by maintenance with cisplatin, lomustine, and vincristine.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the pattern of relapse, especially local relapse (tumor bed or posterior fossa
           outside tumor bed), in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the toxicity of surgery and whether there are identifiable factors that
           correlate with toxicity in these patients.

        -  Determine the impact of any surgical complications on commencement of adjuvant therapy
           and event-free survival of these patients.

        -  Compare late sequelae, in terms of health status, endocrine deficiencies, and hearing
           loss, in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      country. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Within 28-40 days after surgical resection, patients undergo conventional
           fractionated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6-7 weeks. Patients also
           receive vincristine IV once weekly for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Beginning as in arm I, patients undergo hyperfractionated radiotherapy twice
           daily, 5 days a week, for 6-7 weeks. Patients also receive vincristine as in arm I.

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy:Six weeks after completion of radiotherapy, all patients
           receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours and oral lomustine on day 1 and vincristine IV on days
           1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 8 courses.

      Patients are followed at least every 6 months for 3 years.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 316 patients (158 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 4 years.
