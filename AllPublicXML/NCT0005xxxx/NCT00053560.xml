      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the effects of GL701 on bone mineral density
      in women with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are also receiving treatment with
      glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone).

             prior to Screening visit.

          -  Cumulative history of oral glucocorticoid use for at least 6 months over the last year
             prior to the Screening Visit (the 6 months do not have to be consecutive).

          -  Patient has lumbar spine and proximal femur anatomy suitable for measurement by DXA
             with at least 3 evaluable vertebrae from L1 to L4.

          -  SLEDAI ≥3 at the Qualifying Visit.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (at the
             Screening Visit) and agree to use a reliable form of birth control while participating
             in the study.

          -  Patient is fully ambulatory.

          -  Patient has read and signed an Informed Consent Form.

          -  History of endometrial hyperplasia.

          -  End stage renal disease or receiving hemodialysis treatment.

          -  Any disease or condition that would preclude the accurate measurement of bone mineral
             density of the lumbar spine or proximal femur by dual X-ray absorptiometry.

          -  A T-score of less than or equal to - 2.5 of the L-spine or proximal femur at Screening
             DXA assessment.

          -  Unstable cardiac disease.

          -  Conditions causing bone loss such as hyperparathyroidism, Cushing's disease,
             thyrotoxicosis, chronic diarrheal state or malabsorption, renal tubular acidosis, or
             anorexia nervosa.

          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's or Sponsor's opinion is sufficient to
             prevent adequate compliance with the study or likely to confuse follow-up evaluation
             (e.g., alcoholism, drug addiction, acute withdrawal from chemical dependency,
             psychiatric disease).
