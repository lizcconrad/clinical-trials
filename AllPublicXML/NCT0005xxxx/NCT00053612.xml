  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infected individuals with vitamin A deficiency may be more likely to transmit the virus
      to others than HIV infected individuals who have normal levels of vitamin A. The presence of
      HIV DNA in vaginal secretions may indicate a greater risk for transmission of HIV to others.
      The purpose of this study is to determine if taking vitamin A decreases the level of HIV DNA
      in vaginal secretions.

    <textblock>
      Vitamin A deficiency leads to pathological changes in mucosal epithelium, including the
      vagina, and is correlated with immune dysfunction in both HIV-1 infected and uninfected
      individuals. Recent studies of genital tract shedding of HIV-1 DNA in infected women have
      found that lower serum concentrations of vitamin A were strongly associated with detection of
      HIV-1 in vaginal secretions. In addition, maternal vitamin A deficiency has been associated
      with significantly increased risk of vertical HIV-1 transmission. This study will assess the
      effect of vitamin A supplementation on the prevalence and quantity of HIV-1 DNA and RNA in
      cervical and vaginal secretions.

      Participants in this study will be HIV infected nonpregnant women in Mombasa, Kenya.
      Participants will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of daily dosage of either 10,000 IU
      vitamin A or placebo. Cervical and vaginal swabs will be obtained at enrollment and at Week 6
      for detection and quantification of HIV-1 DNA and RNA. In addition, venous blood will be
      obtained at the two time points for quantification of plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4 lymphocyte count,
      and serum vitamin A levels.
