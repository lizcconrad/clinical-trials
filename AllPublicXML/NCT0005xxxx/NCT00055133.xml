  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paxceed™ is being developed by Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the treatment of
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness
      of treatment with Paxceed™ in patients with RA. In RA, there is an increase in cell growth
      and changes in cell function. The active substance in Paxceed™, paclitaxel, has undergone
      clinical studies as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and has demonstrated its usefulness as an
      agent that stops growth of cells and blocks certain types of cell function associated with
      RA. Because of these effects, it is thought that Paxceed™ might alter the destructive course
      of RA.
