      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of Reiki in the treatment of
      fibromyalgia (FM), a condition characterized by widespread muscle pain and stiffness, often
      accompanied by sleep disturbance, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, and psychological
      distress. Reiki is a form of energy medicine in which practitioners reportedly access
      universal life energy to heal patients, either by direct contact at specific hand positions
      or from a distance.

      Fibromyalgia is one of the most common rheumatologic diagnoses. Treatment is generally
      unsatisfactory and most randomized, controlled treatment trials have been unable to
      demonstrate a sustained effective intervention. A vast body of anecdotal literature as well
      as two randomized controlled trials suggest that Reiki may be an effective treatment for FM,
      appearing to relieve pain and improve psychological well being. Reiki appears to have no
      adverse effects and can eventually be self-administered, making it a low-risk, low-cost,
      potentially patient-empowering intervention. This study will investigate the efficacy of
      Reiki in the treatment of FM.

      One hundred Reiki-naive FM patients will be recruited from a chronic fatigue referral clinic
      and will participate in an 8-week trial. Patients will be randomized into one of two Reiki
      groups (direct-contact and distant Reiki) or one of two control groups (sham and placebo).
      Patients will receive either Reiki or placebo 16 times during the course of the study.
      Patients will be assessed at study entry, at Weeks 4 and 8, and 12 weeks post-treatment.
