      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who
      have metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of perifosine, in terms of response rate and duration of
           response, in patients with untreated metastatic or locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the early progression rate in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, non-blinded, multicenter study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine twice on day 1 and then once daily on days
      2-21 for the first course. For all subsequent courses, patients receive a loading dose of
      oral perifosine once on day 1 and then once daily on days 2-21. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 1 month. Patients with stable or responsive disease are followed
      every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
