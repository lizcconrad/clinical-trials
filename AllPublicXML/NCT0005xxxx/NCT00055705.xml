      RATIONALE: PV701 may be able to kill tumor cells while leaving normal cells undamaged.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of PV701 in treating patients who have
      advanced or recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, colorectal, or
      other cancer found primarily within the peritoneal cavity.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal PV701
           after desensitization in patients with advanced or recurrent malignancy largely confined
           to the peritoneal cavity these patients.

        -  Determine the optimal desensitization dose of intravenous PV701 in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug, in terms of cumulative toxicity, in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the presence and duration of viral shedding, viremia, and immunogenicity of
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study comprising 2 different treatment
      schedules.

        -  Schedule I (optimal desensitization dose): Patients receive PV701 IV over 30 minutes on
           day 1 followed by intraperitoneal (IP) PV701 on days 4, 7, and 9. Courses repeat every
           21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PV701 IV and IP until the optimal
      desensitization dose (ODD) is determined. The ODD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

        -  Schedule II (maximum tolerated dose):Patients receive the same regimen as in schedule I
           using PV701 IV at the ODD.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PV701 IP until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience DLT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-17
      months.
