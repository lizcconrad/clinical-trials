      This study will use single photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT (see below), to
      examine brain nicotine receptors in evaluating the role of a chemical called acetylcholine in
      memory and other problems in Parkinson's disease (PD). Acetylcholine acts by binding to these
      nicotine receptors.

      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease 40 years of age and older,
      with or without dementia, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with
      physical and neurological examinations, a pen and paper test of memory and other mental
      functions, blood tests, and, for women of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test. Patients
      with cognition problems will have more intensive mental function tests.

      All participants will undergo the following procedures:

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves
           to show structural and chemical changes in the brain. During the scan, the subject lies
           on a table in a narrow cylinder (the scanner). The time required in the scanner is about
           1 hour, during which the subject is asked to lie very still for 10 to 15 minutes at a
           time. He or she can speak with a staff member via an intercom system at all times during
           the procedure.

        -  SPECT: This nuclear medicine test produces a picture of the receptors in the brain. On
           the night before the scan, the day of the scan, and for 4 days after the scan, subjects
           take an oral dose of potassium iodide to protect the thyroid gland from the radioactive
           tracer used in the SPECT procedure. (People allergic to potassium iodide will take
           potassium perchlorate instead.) Before the scan, small radioactive markers containing
           99Tc are glued to the subject's head. Two catheters (thin, flexible tubes) are placed in
           veins in the arms to inject the radioactive tracer [123I]5-I-A-85380 and to draw blood
           samples. Another catheter is placed in an artery in the wrist to draw arterial blood
           samples. During the scan, the subject lies on a bed with his or her head held still with
           a head holder. The scans are taken over a 6-hour period after injection of
           [123I]5-I-A-85380. An electrocardiogram, respiration, and blood pressure measures are
           taken before the tracer is injected, then 5 minutes after the injection, and again 30 to
           60 minutes after the injection. Blood and urine samples are collected 5 to 6 hours after
           starting the scan. Participants are asked to urinate at least every 2 hours for 12 hours
           after injection of [123I]5-I-A-85380 to decrease radiation exposure.

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. PD is
      characterized primarily by motor impairment, but cognitive impairment is common and dementia
      may occur in up to 50% of patients. Cholinergic deficits have been widely demonstrated in PD
      patients with and without dementia. Cholinergic deficits are more profound in the setting of
      PD with dementia. The cholinergic system mediates aspects of learning and memory and deficits
      in cholinergic function are correlated with the degree of dementia in PD. Additionally, the
      cholinergic system may mediate certain aspects of motor function in PD. Data on cholinergic
      function, particularly relating to nicotinic cholinergic receptors, are limited to post
      mortem studies, and little is known about the role of the cholinergic system in vivo and how
      it relates to clinical phenomena. The aim of the current study is to assess the feasibility
      and usefulness of imaging of the high affinity alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic cholinergic receptor
      in vivo, using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging in patients with
      PD. The long-term goal of the present study is to further understanding of the role of the
      cholinergic system in the pathogenesis of PD and to elucidate potential diagnostic and
      therapeutic targets.

        Age greater than or equal to 40.

        Diagnosis of PD.

        Consent.

        Responsible Caregiver (only for patients with dementia).

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Controls:

        Age greater than or equal to 40.

        Dementia not due to PD, abnormal screening labs for dementia

        Or severe dementia with MMSE less than 15.

        safe conduct of the study.

        Both healthy subjects and patients will be excluded if they have more than moderate
        hypertension. The subject may be on anti-hypertensive medications. The initial screening
