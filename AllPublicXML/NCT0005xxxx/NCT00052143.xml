      The purpose of this study is to define the natural history and experiences of people who are
      at risk for developing Huntington's disease but who do not know their genetic status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic disease characterized by changes in movement and
      behavior. To date, little research has been done on individuals who are at risk for
      developing the disease. PHAROS is an observational study designed to monitor people who are
      at risk for developing HD, and to survey their attitudes and beliefs about their &quot;at-risk&quot;
      status. Investigators hope this study will help answer some important questions about HD,
      such as: 1.) What are the earliest signs of HD and when do they start? 2.) How accurate are
      the measures that physicians use in detecting the onset of HD? 3.) What factors influence the
      age at which a person carrying the HD gene develops the illness? and 4.) In a group of people
      at risk for HD, how many will develop signs of the illness over a minimum three-year period
      of observation?

      Participants in the study will be evaluated every 9 months (for 5 years) using the Unified
      Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS)--a clinical tool which looks at movement,
      psychological and behavioral function. The participants will also be asked to complete
      surveys about their mood, life events, and attitudes or beliefs about being at risk for HD. A
      blood sample, taken at the beginning of the study, will be confidentially tested to determine
      if the participant has the abnormal gene for HD. Neither the participant nor any of the
      PHAROS physicians or coordinators will learn the results of individual gene tests.

      The scientists hope that this study will provide essential information for future trials of
      experimental drugs for HD.
