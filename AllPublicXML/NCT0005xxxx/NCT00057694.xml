  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore adult adoptees' perceptions of the potential value of genetic and
      family history information. Unlike most people, many adopted individuals do not have access
      to personal or family medical information because of laws and practices that prevent
      disclosure. Research suggests that adopted individuals are interested in obtaining this
      information about their biological families. This study will examine adoptees':

        -  Satisfaction with the amount of genetic information they have, their motivations for
           wanting more information, and when it becomes important for them to have this
           information.

        -  Perceptions of the degree to which they believe genetics and family history influence
           various traits and conditions.

      The study will also explore adoptees' interactions with health care providers so that
      recommendations can be developed for helping genetic counselors meet the needs of these
      individuals.

      English-speaking adoptees 18 years of age and older are eligible for this study. Those
      enrolled will participate in a one-time telephone interview that will take about 45 to 60
      minutes. The interview will obtain demographic information, such as the adoptee's age, sex,
      racial and ethnic background, marital status, and education level, and will include questions
      in the following areas:

        -  Personal adoption story;

        -  Perceptions of the role of the biological family history and medical information and its
           importance and usefulness;

        -  Perceptions of the influence of genetics and family history on health;

        -  Reproductive history and pregnancy concerns related to being adopted;

        -  Experiences and interactions with health care providers related to adoption;

        -  Suggestions for improving interactions with health care providers.

      In contrast to the majority of the population, many adopted individuals do not have access to
      personal or familial medical information because of laws and practices that prevent
      disclosure. A body of research has suggested however that adopted individuals are interested
      in obtaining this information regarding their biological families. The proposed study broadly
      aims to explore adult adoptees' perceptions regarding the potential value of genetic and
      family history information. Specifically it will investigate adoptees' motivations for
      obtaining the information, their perceptions regarding the influence of genetics on health,
      and their experiences with healthcare providers related to adoption and medical information.
      These objectives will be addressed in telephone interviews with English-Speaking adult
      adoptees (over the age of 18 years) that were placed in unrelated adoptive families. A
      semi-structured guide for the telephone interviews consists of a series of open-ended
      questions that explore the objectives of the study. We hope to collect data on about 40
      individuals. The data will be subject to coding for thematic analyses to identify recurring
      trends and themes. This study has implications for genetic counselors as the findings may
      guide the development of appropriate educational messages and counseling recommendations for
      adopted individuals related to their genetic and family history information.
