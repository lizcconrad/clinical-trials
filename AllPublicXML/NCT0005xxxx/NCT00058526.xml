      Treatment phase:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the immune response elicited by a new
      anti-cancer therapy in patients with breast cancer in remission but who are at high risk of
      relapse. The study product is an immunotherapeutic consisting of the recombinant dHER2
      protein combined with an immunostimulant called AS15. The study aims to determine the optimal
      of three different dose levels of dHER2 combined with the same fixed dose of AS15 by
      assessing the safety and the immune response elicited after a series of injections of the
      study product.

      Five-year follow-up phase:

      This part of the study aims to assess any late onset toxicity of the study treatment through
      yearly follow-up visits and to monitor the patients' survival and disease status up to five
      years after the last administration of the study treatment. The patients' immune response is
      also measured to assess the robustness of the immune response elicited by the study
      treatment.

             period.

         15. Patients who have received any immunoglobulins and/or blood products within the 3
