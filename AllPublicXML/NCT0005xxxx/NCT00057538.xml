  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a stress management group
      intervention for people with HIV. The study will evaluate several outcomes, including
      perceived stress, quality of life, psychosocial factors, and physiological measures of
      stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well documented that living with HIV/AIDS can cause a great amount of stress, and
      evidence suggests that stress may hasten HIV disease progression by increasing viral
      replication and suppressing the immune response. Stress management intervention studies using
      more complex combinations of cognitive and relaxation therapies have shown improvements in
      both psychological and physiological measures in HIV infected persons. However, no studies
      have focused on only one intervention or have addressed the spiritual component using a
      comparable control group to determine which of these interventions is most effective.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a spiritually-based cognitive
      intervention to an educational control group. The intervention will be given over a 10-week
      period, with 5 weekly classes, 4 weekly automated phone calls, and one final class meeting.
      Assessments will be conducted at pre-intervention, fifth class midpoint, tenth week
      post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Time commitment can vary from 6 months to 9 months,
      depending on when participants are screened.
