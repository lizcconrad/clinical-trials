  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of bortezomib with or without
      gemcitabine in treating patients who have metastatic pancreatic cancer. Bortezomib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining bortezomib with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the objective response rate in previously untreated patients with metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with bortezomib with or without gemcitabine.

      II. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare the
      progression-free, 6-month, and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      IV. Compare the change in overall quality of life (QOL) and in subcomponents of QOL of
      patients after treatment with 2 consecutive courses of these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Patients with
      progressive disease crossover to arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive bortezomib as in arm I and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1
      and 8.

      Courses in both arms repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life (QOL) is assessed at baseline and before courses 2 and 4. Patients who
      crossover to arm II from arm I complete QOL questionnaires before the first 2 courses of arm
      II therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
