      RATIONALE: An anal sphincter prosthesis may replace the need for a permanent colostomy and
      may improve the quality of life of patients who are undergoing surgery for anal or rectal
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of an anal sphincter prosthesis in
      treating patients who have anal or rectal cancer and are undergoing surgery to remove the
      anus and rectum.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the risk of complications and feasibility of total anorectal reconstruction
           using the Acticon Neosphincter prosthesis after abdominoperineal resection in patients
           with anal or rectal cancer.

        -  Determine continence, bowel function, and quality of life of patients treated with this
           surgery.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo abdominoperineal resection (APR) with perineal colostomy and
      diverting loop ileostomy. At least 3 months after APR, patients undergo placement of the
      Acticon Neosphincter prosthesis. At least 6 weeks after prosthesis placement, the prosthesis
      is activated. When the patient demonstrates the ability to operate the prosthesis, the
      ileostomy is reversed.

      Quality of life is assessed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months and then annually thereafter.

    <description>All patients will follow a common treatment algorithm. Anorectal reconstruction with the ABS neosphincter device will be a staged surgical approach. Routine postoperative testing will then be performed at 6 months (+/- 8 weeks) and 12 months (+/- 8 weeks), following ileostomy reversal which we have designated as time zero. Postoperative testing will include completion of a series of questionnaires.</description>
