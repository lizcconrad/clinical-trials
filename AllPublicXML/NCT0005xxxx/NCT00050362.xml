  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of the drugs rofecoxib and bupivacaine to prevent pain
      following third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction. Rofecoxib is approved to treat pain of
      arthritis and menstrual cramps. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic similar to lidocaine, but
      longer acting.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 16 and 35 years of age who are in general good health and
      require extraction of their two lower wisdom teeth may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will have their two lower wisdom teeth extracted, and a biopsy (removal of a
      small piece of tissue) will be taken from the inside of the cheek around the area behind one
      of the extraction sites. Ninety minutes before surgery, patients will take a dose of either
      rofecoxib, or a placebo (a pill with no active ingredient) by mouth. Just before surgery,
      they will receive an injection of either lidocaine or bupivacaine to numb the mouth and a
      sedative called midazolam (VersedÂ® (Registered Trademark)) through an arm vein to cause
      drowsiness. After surgery, a small piece of tubing will be placed into one of the two
      extraction sites. Samples will be collected from the tubing to measure chemicals involved in
      pain and inflammation.

      Patients will remain in the clinic for up to 4 hours after surgery to monitor pain and drug
      side effects while the anesthetic wears off. During this time, they will complete pain
      questionnaires every 20 minutes. (Patients whose pain is unrelieved an hour after surgery may
      request and receive acetaminophen (Tylenol) and codeine.) The tubing then will be removed and
      they will be discharged with pain medicines (Tylenol, codeine and the study drug) and forms
      to record pain ratings. They will be given detailed instructions on how and when to take the
      medicines and how to record information in the pain diary.

      Patients will return to the clinic 48 hours after surgery with the pain diary and pain
      relievers. At this visit, another biopsy will be taken under local anesthetic (lidocaine).

      Central sensitization refers to persistent post-injury changes in the central nervous system
      resulting in greater pain sensitivity. The concept of preemptive analgesia is defined as a
      treatment that prevents establishment of central sensitization by providing analgesic
      coverage during the perioperative period of surgery. Previous acute pain studies using the
      oral surgery model have shown that suppression of postoperative pain, not intra-operative
      nociceptive barrage, diminishes the development of sensitization at 24 to 48 hours
      post-surgery. During the intermediate postoperative period, the nociceptive input from both
      surgical insult and inflammation leads to central sensitization, yet their relative
      contributions have not been clearly evaluated. The proposed study is designed to evaluate the
      relative impact of surgical insult and the subsequent inflammation on postoperative pain. The
      relative contribution of each of these nociceptive processes provides a basis for
      postoperative pain management and the development of preemptive strategies.

      All subjects (N = 136) will be healthy volunteers scheduled for third molar extractions.
      Using a double-blinded, randomized, parallel study design, subjects will be randomized into
      four groups. All patients will receive local anesthesia injections preoperatively (either 2%
      lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine) to manage surgical pain in conjunction with a preemptive
      medication (either 50 mg of rofecoxib or placebo) to control postoperative inflammation. The
      first dose of preemptive medication will be taken by mouth 90 minutes prior to conscious
      sedation and extractions, and later self-administered once a day for the next 48 hours. The
      analgesic effect of the drugs will be assessed in the clinic every 20 minutes for the first
      four hours after extractions, and then self-assessed at 24, and 48 hours after surgery using
      two pain intensity assessment instruments: category scale and visual analog scale (VAS).
      Microdialysis will be performed with sample collection concurrent with pain report over the
      immediate postoperative period of four hours. Two biopsies will be performed: preoperatively,
      and postoperatively at 48 hours. The combination regimen with bupivacaine and rofecoxib is
      predicted to maximally suppress the onset and intensity of postoperative dental pain to a
      greater extent than all other groups through a blockade of the nociceptive input from both
      surgery and inflammation. It is hypothesized that this preemptive treatment will maximally
      inhibit the development of central sensitization following tissue injury which manifests as
      hyperalgesia at later time points. It is also hypothesized that the administration of
      rofecoxib (a cyclooxygenase-2 selective anti-inflammatory medication) will reduce
      post-surgical pain experienced at later time points to a greater extent than suppression of
      the intra-operative nociceptive barrage alone (by bupivacaine), suggesting that suppression
      of inflammation plays a more pivotal role than attenuating nociception due to tissue injury
      in diminishing central sensitization.
