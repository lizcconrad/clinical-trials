      This study will use single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to determine what
      areas of the brain are responsible for paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders. Patients
      with these disorders have sudden, brief attacks of movement, similar to epileptic seizures,
      but without loss of consciousness. SPECT is a nuclear medicine test that produces
      three-dimensional images of the brain, showing blood flow and function in different brain
      regions. This test, which can detect the focus of epileptic seizures, will be used in this
      study to scan patients while they are experiencing a hyperkinetic movement attack, while they
      are not having and attack, and while they are simulating an attack.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have paroxysmal movement attacks that can be easily
      induced by a specific trigger, such as a sudden movement or prolonged exercise, may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and review of
      their medical records, physical examination, videotape of attacks, and, for women, a
      pregnancy test.

      Participants will have three SPECT scans, separated from each other by at least 48 hours.
      Before each scan, the subject will perform an activity that ordinarily precipitates a
      movement attack, such as standing up from a chair, assuming a certain posture, or doing
      something strenuous. Each scan will try to record one of the following conditions:

        -  The subject performs the trigger activity, but does not have an attack;

        -  The subject performs the trigger activity and has an involuntary attack as a result;

        -  The subject performs the trigger activity and does not have an attack, but then mimics
           an attack voluntarily.

      After the condition is recorded, the subject will be given an injection of a radioactive
      agent called 99m Technetium and will then relax quietly for 40 to 60 minutes before the SPECT
      scan. For the scan, the subject lies on an examination table and the SPECT camera is moved
      near and around the head to image the brain. The scan takes about 40 minutes.

      Participants will also undergo one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. For this test, the
      subject lies in a narrow cylinder (the scanner), while pictures of the brain are taken.
      Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises caused by electrical switching of radio frequency
      circuits used in the scanning process. The procedure takes about 30 minutes.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the areas of the brain responsible for paroxysmal
      hyperkinetic movement disorders. Paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders have been
      clinically recognized for a long time, although the exact neurophysiological mechanism
      leading to paroxysms of hyperkinetic movement attacks is not well understood. Paroxysmal
      hyperkinetic movement disorders are heterogenous, and the exact mechanism may differ in each
      subcategory. In paroxysmal dyskinesias, the idiopathic forms of paroxysmal hyperkinetic
      movement disorders, it is speculated that transient functional abnormality at the cellular
      level occurs in the basal ganglia without organic irreversible damage. Ion channel
      dysfunction is an attractive hypothesis to explain such transient dysfunction. Some patients
      with paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders have a psychogenic etiology.

      A promising technique to evaluate physiological changes in the brain during an attack is
      ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning. Ictal SPECT is a reliable
      method to detect a seizure focus during an epileptic seizure. We will utilize ictal SPECT
      scanning techniques during, and between attacks, and while they are simulating such attacks.
      The differential activation between the attacks of hyperkinetic movements and the voluntary
      movements may shed light on the regions of the brain and neurophysiological mechanisms
      responsible for generation of paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Paroxysmal Dyskinesia Patients:

        Established diagnosis of paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders. The diagnosis will be
        established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic,
        based on review of medical record, history, clinical evaluation, and video tapes of an
        attack.

        Age 18 or older.

        A reproducible trigger of paroxysmal hyperkinetic attacks, such as sudden movement, or
        prolonged exercise, which will produce attacks at least with 50% consistency.

        Patients only with paroxysmal attacks of hyperkinetic movements.

        Patients whose attacks can be precipitated easily.

        Patients whose typical attack last at least 15 seconds.

        Patients taking medication that may influence the central nervous system, such as
        phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and antidepressants (but not limited
        to these) for their paroxysmal dyskinesias (not seizures) will be asked to hold the
        medication prior to the study. A sufficient drug washout period will be established
        dependant upon the individual drug. Subjects may be admitted to the NIH if necessary. They
        will be asked to abstain from alcohol and caffeine 24 hours prior to the study as well.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkenetic movement attack patients:

        Established diagnosis of psychogenic hyperkinetic movement disorders. The diagnosis will be
        established by the preliminary screening in the NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic,
        based on review of medical record, history, clinical evaluation, and video tapes of an
        attack.

        Patients with clear onset, stereotyped, defined and evaluable hyperkinetic attacks.

        Patients only with paroxysmal attacks of hyperkinetic movements.

        Age 18 or older.

        A reproducible trigger of paroxysmal hyperkinetic attacks, such as sudden movement, startle
        or prolonged exercise, which will produce attacks at least with 50% consistency.

        Patients whose attacks can be precipitated easily.

        Patients whose typical attack last at least 15 seconds.

        Patients taking medication that may influence the central nervous system, such as
        phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and antidepressants (but not limited
        to these) will be asked to hold the medication prior to the study. A sufficient drug
        washout period will be established dependant upon the individual drug. Subjects may be
        admitted to the NIH if necessary. They will be asked to abstain from alcohol and caffeine
        24 hours prior to the study as well.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age younger than 18 years old.

        Previous history of or MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, strokes, trauma or
        arterial venous malformations.

        Contraindication to MRI such as having devices not compatible with MRI (pacemaker, an
        implanted medical pump, brain stimulators etc.), metallic prostheses in their body (metal
        pins and rods, heart valves, cochlear implants etc.), and history of working with metals in
        the past, since such persons may potentially have small metal fragments in the eye without
        being aware of it.

        Any diagnosis of progressive neurological disorders other than paroxysmal hyperkinetic
        movement disorder.

        Any history of significant medical disorders requiring chronic treatment with other drugs
        that affect the CNS, which cannot be stopped.

        Ongoing radiation therapy for medical condition such as cancer.

        Women who are pregnant or nursing. Female subjects of child bearing potential will have
        specific interview and a pregnancy test prior to the study (before each imaging procedure
        if required) to ensure that they are not pregnant or nursing.

        Any subject who is not capable of giving an informed consent. This will be determined at
        the initial evaluation at NINDS clinic. Patients with Mini Mental Score less than 25 or
        significant psychiatric history will be further evaluated by detailed neuropsychiatric
        testing, or consultation with a psychiatrist.
