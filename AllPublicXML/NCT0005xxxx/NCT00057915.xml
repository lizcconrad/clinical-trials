      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with peptides may make the
      body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients with refractory stage IV cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of administering 1 or 2 courses of vaccination with
           carcinoembryonic antigen peptide 1-6D (CAP 1-6D)- and CMV pp65 peptide-pulsed autologous
           dendritic cells in patients with refractory stage IV CEA-expressing malignancies.

        -  Determine the ability of this regimen to induce CAP 1-6D- and CMV pp65-specific T cells
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor effect of this regimen, in terms of progression-free survival,
           of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis and collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
      which dendritic cells (DC) are generated and pulsed with carcinoembryonic antigen peptide
      1-6D (CAP 1-6D) and CMV pp65 peptide. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 vaccination cohorts.

        -  Cohort I: Patients receive vaccination with CAP 1-6D-pulsed DC and CMV pp65
           peptide-pulsed DC subcutaneously and intradermally every 3 weeks for a total of 4
           vaccinations.

        -  Cohort II: Patients receive vaccinations as in cohort I every 3 weeks for a total of 8
           vaccinations.

      For both cohorts, a safe dose of the vaccine is defined as the dose at which no more than 1
      of 6 patients experiences unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients (6 per cohort) will be accrued for this study
      within 24 months.
