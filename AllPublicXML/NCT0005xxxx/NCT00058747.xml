    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, exploratory, open-label study of the investigational product AG-858, in
      patients who are cytogenetically positive after treatment with Gleevec.

      The trial will consist of three independent Phase II evaluations of patient groups according
      to their cytogenetic status as defined in the eligibility criteria (Eligibility Criteria 4a,
      4b, and 4c).

      The goals of this study are to determine the following:

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with a complete cytogenetic response (CCR) within
           each patient group

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with a substantial molecular response (SMR)
           within each patient group

        -  To evaluate the frequency and severity of adverse events.

        -  To assess the feasibility of AG-858 production.

          -  Must be Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in first chronic
             phase

          -  Must have a complete hematologic response
