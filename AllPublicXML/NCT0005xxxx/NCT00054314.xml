      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BAY 59-8862 in treating patients who
      have non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall response rate, including partial and complete response, in
           patients with taxane-resistant non-small cell lung cancer treated with BAY 59-8862.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BAY 59-8862 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease
      receive 2-4 additional courses beyond maximal response.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-84 patients will be accrued for this study.
