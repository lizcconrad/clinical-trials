  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study early brain and behavioral changes in people who have
      the gene expansion for Huntington's disease, but are currently healthy and have no symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's Disease (HD) is an inherited disease that causes changes in a person's ability
      to control movements, thinking, and feelings. The intent of this study is to learn more about
      the beginning changes in thinking skills, emotional regulation, and brain structure and
      function as a person begins the transition from health to HD.

      Preliminary studies indicate that people with HD may have marked decline before an actual
      diagnosis. This study will help reveal the earliest indicators of the disease and what
      factors influence the age at which a person carrying the gene develops the disease. It is
      necessary to get information on the early stages of HD in order to develop drugs that can
      slow or postpone the onset of HD. The investigators hope this study will provide essential
      information for future trials of experimental drugs for HD.

      During this study, participants will undergo several detailed tests, including MRI scans of
      the brain, cognitive assessments, physical exams, bio specimen (blood, urine, cerebral spinal
      fluid) collection and neurological and psychiatric testing.

    <measure>Establish possible validity and reliability of disease measures.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>This will require that we continuously analyze recently collected data, remove items that are insensitive, and add new items to be tested throughout the course of the study. The power and sensitivity of future multi-site trials and studies depend on accurate measures of marker validity.
HD diagnosis will be better predicted by UHDRS total motor score following new standardized reliability training and by the tapping task under modified more challenging, conditions. Psychiatric and functional ratings will be improved with item response analyses and dynamic piloting of item edits to establish the most psychometrically sound items for clinical trials.</description>
