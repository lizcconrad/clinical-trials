      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known whether polyglutamate paclitaxel is more effective than gemcitabine or vinorelbine
      in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of polyglutamate paclitaxel
      with that of gemcitabine or vinorelbine in treating patients who have stage IIIB, stage IV,
      or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of polyglutamate paclitaxel (CT-2103) vs gemcitabine or
           vinorelbine, in terms of duration of overall survival, in patients with stage IIIB or IV
           or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer who have a performance status of 2.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the disease control (percentage of patients with no disease progression for at
           least 12 weeks) and time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the improvement in lung cancer symptoms in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender, disease stage (IV vs other), geographic location (US vs Western Europe
      and Canada vs the rest of the world), and prior brain metastases (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel (CT-2103) IV over 10 minutes on day 1
           every 21 days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28
           days OR vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 every 21 days.

      Treatment repeats in both arms for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 370 patients (185 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 13 months.
