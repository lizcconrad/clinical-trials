      Patients will have immune cells collected and then expanded outside of the body. Patients
      will receive an infusion of a large number of expanded immune cells. There will be three dose
      levels studied. The goal of the study will be to determine the safety as well as potential
      efficacy of this treatment.

      This is a Phase I/II single arm dose escalation study of a novel T cell immunotherapy for
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients will receive one dose of Xcellerated T
      Cells(tm), an ex vivo activated and expanded autologous T cell product, in an attempt to
      enhance immune responses with anti-tumor activity. This study is being conducted to test the
      safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Xcellerated T Cells in patients with
      CLL. In addition, lymphocyte counts, lymph node area, and quantitative immunoglobulins will
      be assessed for preliminary evidence of a therapeutic effect. In correlative studies, changes
      in the phenotype of T and B lymphocytes will be evaluated by flow cytometry. Changes in T
      cell repertoire and anti-tumor immune activity will also be assessed. It is expected that 12
      to 18 patients will be treated.

                  lymphadenopathy

               4. Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of &gt;50% over a 2-month period, or an
                  anticipated doubling time of less than 12 months

          -  T cells (CD3+) comprising &gt; 1.5% and &lt; 10 % of peripheral white blood cells as
             assessed by flow cytometry
