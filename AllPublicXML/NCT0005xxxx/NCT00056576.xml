      The purpose of this study is to determine whether zonisamide alone is effective as a
      treatment for epilepsy in newly diagnosed cases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is characterized by repeated seizures caused by recurrent, abnormal, and excessive
      synchronous discharges from cerebral neurons. Seizures may be triggered by various causes
      such as CNS infections, fever, tumors, toxins, vascular disease, degenerative disease,
      trauma, or may be idiopathic. The type of seizure is usually defined by the initial event,
      the duration, alterations of consciousness, patterns of motor activity, and post-ictal
      symptoms. In addition, certain seizure types have characteristic EEG patterns. The
      International Classification of Epileptic Seizures classifies seizures as partial or
      generalized. Partial seizures are further classified as simple partial, complex partial
      (impaired consciousness), or partial seizures secondarily generalized. All partial seizures
      have onset in a discrete cortical region. Generalized seizures are bilaterally symmetrical
      and without focal onset and include absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, clonic seizures,
      tonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and atonic seizures. The goals of treatment include
      the prevention of seizures, medical management of seizures, and management of the
      consequences of epilepsy. The study will be conducted with patients who have new onset
      epilepsy characterized by complex partial seizures and will attempt to characterize the
      relationship between zonisamide dose and seizure prevention and demonstrate monotherapy
      efficacy.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Patient able and willing to give written informed consent or assent as appropriate in
             accordance with ICH and GCP guidelines

          -  Patient with newly diagnosed epilepsy who has complex partial seizures (with or
             without secondary generalization)

          -  Patient must have at least two well-documented, unprovoked, clinically evaluated and
             classified complex partial seizures or one well-documented, unprovoked, clinically
             evaluated and classified complex partial seizure and an abnormal EEG consistent with
             the diagnosis of epilepsy occurring within one year prior to enrollment

          -  Patient must have received less than 2 weeks of prior AED therapy, which will be
             discontinued at study entry

          -  EEG changes consistent with the diagnosis of epilepsy:

               -  For patients with two well-documented, unprovoked complex partial seizures within
                  one year prior to enrollment, the EEG results may be normal at the time of
                  testing but, in the opinion of the Investigator, the patient has epilepsy

               -  For patients with one well-documented, unprovoked complex partial seizure within
                  one year prior to enrollment, the EEG must be abnormal at the time of testing
                  consistent with the diagnosis of epilepsy

          -  Patient age 16 years or greater

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the patient is in good health

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant (serum HCG negative)
             or lactating, and must be using a medically acceptable form of birth control such as
             abstinence, an adequate barrier method, or hormonal contraceptive; or female patients
             who are post-menopausal or have had surgical sterilization

          -  Patient or caregiver able to follow Investigator instruction, study procedures,
             maintain diary of concomitant medication use, and report adverse events

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  History of status epilepticus

          -  Patient with simple partial seizures only

          -  A history of non-epileptic seizures (e.g. metabolic or pseudo-seizures)

          -  Progressive encephalopathy or findings consistent with progressive CNS disease or
             lesions (e.g. infection, demyelination, tumor)

          -  Clinically significant uncontrolled medical disease in the previous two years
             (including unstable cardiac, hematological, hepatic, or renal disease)

          -  History of acute intermittent porphyria, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
             or hemolytic anemia

          -  Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL) or impaired liver function (SGPT/ALT

          -  History of renal calculi

          -  Laboratory test results which, in the opinion of the Investigator, are clinically
             significant abnormalities
