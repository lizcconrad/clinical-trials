      This study will measure the safety and tolerability of three different doses of IdB 1016 in
      patients with hepatitis C disease who have not responded to or are poor candidates for
      interferon-based therapies.

      NOTE: THE STUDY WILL ONLY RECRUIT STUDY PARTICIPANTS AT UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON MEDICAL

    <textblock>
      Results from two open label and four randomized placebo-controlled studies in patients with
      liver disease of diverse etiology suggest that IdB 1016 (oral silybin-phosphatidylcholine
      phytosome) is well tolerated and significantly improves serum liver enzyme levels. However,
      IdB 1016 dosing in these studies ranged from 314 mg bid to 314 mg tid, which is below Phase I
      doses that were well tolerated in healthy volunteers. None of the studies tested the safety
      and efficacy of IdB 1016 strictly in patients with chronic hepatitis C disease or measured
      post-treatment histologic changes.

      This study will be an open label, randomized, dose-finding study. There will be three arms
      corresponding to three different IdB 1016 doses: 314 mg, 624 mg, and 942 mg tid. Each arm
      will have 15 patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C and will be stratified to five
      patients with fibrosis stage II (periportal fibrosis), five patients with fibrosis stage III
      (bridging fibrosis), and five patients with fibrosis stage IV (compensated cirrhosis). The
      treatment duration will be 12 weeks. Patients will be followed for an additional 4 weeks
      after treatment cessation to assess residual effects of measured parameters. Patients will
      have clinic visits on Day -21 (screening), Day 1 (treatment initiation), Day 29, Day 57, Day
      85 (end of treatment), and Day 113 (follow-up after washout).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HCV infection according to ELISA-2

          -  Detectable HCV RNA PCR as measured within the previous 6 months

          -  Poor responders to, inadequate candidates for, or unwilling to use interferon-based
             therapies

          -  Serum ALT &gt;= 1.3 times above normal

          -  Persistently elevated serum ALT levels according to two measures in the previous 12
             months

          -  Evidence of stage II (periportal fibrosis), III (bridging fibrosis), or IV
             (compensated cirrhosis) in the Batts-Ludwig scoring system according to a liver biopsy
             performed in the last 2 (stage II and III patients) to 5 (stage IV patients) years.
             Patients with clinical signs of compensated cirrhosis (portal hypertension,
             non-bleeding varices) do not require a biopsy.

             duration of the study
