    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the safety of combining O6-benzylguanine with temozolomide in treating
      children who have recurrent or refractory brain tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.
      O6-benzylguanine may increase the effectiveness of temozolomide by making tumor cells more
      sensitive to the drug.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide (Temodar) when administered with
      O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) with and without G-CSF support to pediatric patients with refractory
      brain tumors stratified by previous radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide and O6-BG when used in combination.

      II. To characterize toxicities associated with the combination of O6-BG and temozolomide with
      and without G-CSF support.

      III. To document antitumor response in patients when treated with O6-BG and temozolomide.

      IV. To determine the levels of MGMT enzyme and mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in tumor
      tissue, investigating a possible correlation with patient outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temozolomide with and without filgrastim (G-CSF).
      Patients are stratified according to prior radiotherapy (RT)/myeloablative therapy (no RT or
      focal RT vs craniospinal RT or myeloablative therapy).

      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV continuously on days 1 and 2 and oral temozolomide on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 2-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 25% of
      patients experience DLT. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that
      dose level for a total of 12 patients treated at the MTD.

      For courses 1-12, patients experiencing neutropenia may also receive G-CSF subcutaneously or
      IV daily beginning on day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      If neutropenia is the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for the first 2 strata, patients are
      further stratified according to concurrent G-CSF support (yes vs no).Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      in each stratum receive escalating doses of temozolomide with G-CSF until the MTD is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience DLT. Once the MTD is determined, 6 additional patients are treated at
      that dose.

      Patients are followed for resolution of all adverse events occurring while on treatment
      and/or within 30 days of the last administration of study drug. Patients will be followed for
      the shortest of 1) three months after the last protocol based treatment, or 2) the date other
      therapy is initiated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent or refractory pediatric brain tumors; a histopathologic diagnosis from
             either the initial presentation or at the time of recurrence is required for all but
             brain stem gliomas

          -  Karnofsky or Lansky ≥ 60%

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 8 weeks

          -  Patients with neurological deficits should have deficits that are stable for a minimum
             of 1 week prior to study entry

          -  Chemotherapy: No more than 2 previous chemotherapy/biologic therapy regimens; evidence
             of recovery from prior chemotherapy/biologic therapy; no myelosuppressive chemotherapy
             within 3 weeks (6 weeks if a nitrosourea agent) of study entry; patients who have
             received temozolomide are eligible if they have not received the drug in the past 3
             months and did not experience any non-hematopoietic Grade 3/4 toxicity with prior
             temozolomide therapy

          -  XRT: ≥ 3 months prior to study entry for craniospinal irradiation (≥ 18 Gy); ≥ 4 weeks
             for local radiation to primary tumor; and ≥ 2 weeks prior to study entry for focal
             irradiation to symptomatic metastatic sites

          -  Bone Marrow Transplant: ≥ 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Anti-convulsants: Patients will be eligible for this study even if they are receiving

          -  Growth factors: Off all colony forming growth factor(s) &gt; 2 weeks prior to study entry
             (G-CSF, GM-CSF, Erythropoietin)

          -  Dexamethasone: Patients who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable dose for
             at least 1 week prior to study entry

          -  ANC &gt; 1,000/μl
