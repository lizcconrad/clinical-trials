  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48 week study for HIV-infected patients who have failed several regimens including
      PI's, NNRTs and NRTIs. Patients will be randomly selected to be in 1 of 4 groups. Three of
      the 4 groups will contain capravirine in different doses combined with Kaletra and
      nucleosides and one of the groups will be a combination of Kaletra and nucleosides without
      the capravirine.
