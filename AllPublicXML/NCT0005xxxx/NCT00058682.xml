  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluconazole is an FDA-approved drug that is widely used to treat fungal infections due to
      candida. The experimental drug anidulafungin has been found to be active in treating
      life-threatening fungal infections. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      anidulafungin is as effective as fluconazole in treating candidemia, an invasive form of
      candidiasis.

      Three hundred patients 16 years of age or older will participate in this study. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one-half will receive anidulafungin; the
      other half will receive fluconazole. They will receive the drug for as few as 10 days or for
      up to 42 days, depending on the seriousness of the infection. The drug will be given over a
      four-hour period on the first day, and over two hours on the remaining days. While taking the
      study medication, participants will be required to give blood samples every week until the
      end of treatment. At two weeks and six weeks following the end of therapy, participants will
      return for evaluation.

      Prior to their participation in this study, patients will undergo the following evaluations:
      a physical exam, an eye exam, an electrocardiogram, and possibly blood work.

      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority,
      multi-center trial of the safety and efficacy of anidulafungin versus fluconazole in patients
      with candidemia or other forms of invasive candidiasis. The objective of this study is to
      determine if anidulafungin is at least as effective as fluconazole in the treatment of
      patients with a diagnosis of candidemia and/or other forms of invasive candidiasis. The
      secondary objectives are to compare the safety of the two study drugs and determine the
      efficacy for the prevention of late Candida infections in patients treated with anidulafungin
      versus fluconazole. Assuming 25% of patients will be unevaluable at the end of intravenous
      therapy, 248 patients will be enrolled to obtain a total of 222 evaluable patients. Patients
      older than 16 years of age with candidemia or invasive candidiasis will be randomized to
      receive either anidulafungin or fluconazole. Patients randomized to anidulafungin will
      receive an IV loading dose on day one of 200mg followed by 100mg once daily. Patients
      randomized to fluconazole will receive an IV loading dose on day one of 800mg followed by an
      IV daily dose of 400mg. Patients will be maintained on IV therapy for a minimum of 10 days to
      a maximum of 42 days. After 10 days of therapy, patients on either study drug may be treated
      on an ambulatory basis with oral fluconazole therapy.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Diagnosis of candidemia or other forms of invasive candidiasis from a blood culture or a
        culture specimen from a normally sterile site, the sample preferably having been taken
        within 96 hours before study entry. The diagnosis will be based on the following:

          1. Candidemia: at least one blood culture positive for yeast (in the absence of other
             demonstrated foci of infection).

          2. Other Forms of Invasive Candidiasis:

               -  Positive culture for yeast from a specimen from a normally sterile site with or
                  without a positive blood culture;

               -  Positive yeast culture from a newly-placed drain in a normally sterile site; or

               -  Any positive blood culture for yeast plus ophthalmic examination consistent with
                  Candida endophthalmitis (patients with mycological documentation of Candida
                  endophthalmitis with negative blood cultures will be included).

               -  Positive yeast cultures from urine or sputum do NOT qualify as a positive
                  culture.

          3. AND at least one of the following signs and symptoms:

               -  A fever defined as an oral temperature of 100.4° (Degree) F (38.0° (Degree)C) or
                  greater, rectal temperature of 101.4° (Degree) F (38.4° (Degree)C) or greater, or
                  an axillary temperature of 99.4° (Degree) F (37° (Degree)C) or greater.
                  Hypothermia defined as a temperature less than 96.8° (Degree) F (36.0°
                  (Degree)C).

             barrier contraceptive or condom in combination with contraceptive cream, jelly or
             foam). Patients are to continue contraceptive methods during the study and for at
             least 30 days after receiving their last treatment.

          2. Patients who have received greater than 72 hours of systemic antifungal therapy for
