      This study will examine loss of balance in the elderly. Falls due to balance problems are a
      major health issue in older people, often resulting in bone fractures and other bodily
      injuries, and functional decline. In addition, the fear of falling leads some elderly people
      to restrict their movements and social activities, causing depressed moods and decreased
      enjoyment of life. Risk factors for falling in the elderly include some standing positions in
      which older people usually experience balance problems, such as leaning forward or backward.
      This study will examine these unstable positions and the brain mechanisms associated with
      loss of balance in the elderly.

      Normal volunteers between 20 and 90 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      must be in good health, with no difficulties in performing activities of daily living, and
      must be able to walk for at least 400 meters (1/4 mile). They will be screened with a medical
      history, physical examination, and blood tests.

      Participants will undergo the following three experiments:

        -  Movement task: The subject stands on a platform with markers placed at different parts
           of the body to record body movements. A cap with electrodes (metal disks) is placed on
           the head for electrocardiographic (EEG) recording of the electrical activity of the
           brain (brain waves) during the experiment. The positions of the feet on the platform are
           measured. While standing on the platform, the subject leans forward and backward as far
           as possible without losing balance. (Subjects are secured in a safety harness to prevent
           actual falls.) The task is repeated 5 times. The experiment lasts up to 2 hours.

        -  Postural response task: This study is identical to the first, except that the subject
           does not voluntarily lean forward and backward, but is pushed with a device to cause
           forward and backward movements. The experiment lasts 1 to 2 hours.

        -  Perceptual task: The subject sits in front of a computer screen and watches the postural
           movements of a human body model in forward and backward directions. When the subject
           recognizes an unstable position in the movements, he or she presses a computer mouse. An
           EEG records brain activity during the task, which lasts up to 2 hours.

    <textblock>
      A number of studies have explored the role of visual, vestibular and somatosensory systems in
      the control of upright posture. However, the cortical control of postural stability, in
      general, and the role of higher cognitive function in assessment of postural stability, in
      specific, has been less studied. It is well established that certain features of postural
      control change during the advancing years of life so that the stability of posture can be a
      problem in the elderly. However, neural mechanisms of postural stability that decline with
      age and make older adults more prone to falling have not been identified specifically. To
      characterize specific causes of falling in the elderly in problematic, because human posture
      is a product of an extremely complex dynamical system and like any other physical activity
      undergoes dramatic changes in organization throughout the life-span. In our previous research
      we showed the existence of specialized neural detectors that are embodied in spatiotemporal
      patterns of brain activiation (Slobounov et al., 200) capable of discrimination the unstable
      postures in dynamic situations. We propose that these neural detectors may deteriorate with
      aging, which result in difficulty to (a) initiate compensatory postural adjustments when
      balance is in danger, and (b) to discriminate relevant from irrelevant information in control
      of upright posture. This can be documented via changes in behavioral correlates of postural
      control and spatiotemporal patterns of the brain activation as a function of advanced age.
      Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to investigate the age-related cortical control of
      postural stability combining electroencephalography and postural control measures. This will
      be done when a subject physically approaches the postural stability boundary and when a
      subject solves a cognitive task identifying unstable postures in dynamic situations.
