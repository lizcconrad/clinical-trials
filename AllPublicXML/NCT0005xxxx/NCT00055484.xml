      The purpose of this study is to determine if zonisamide is effective as a preventative
      medication for individuals with migraine headache.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacologic treatment of migraine may be acute (abortive, symptomatic) or preventive
      (prophylactic). Preventive medication is usually given daily for months or years; however,
      treatment may also be given in an intermittent regimen. Most migraine prophylactic
      medications were designed to treat other disorders, and they can be divided into three
      groups:

        1. Serotonergic or monoaminergic agents such as methysergide, which have demonstrated high
           degrees of effectiveness;

        2. Non-serotonergic drugs such as beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, valproate; and

        3. Drugs with lesser demonstrated effectiveness, such as selective serotonin reuptake
           inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

      The choice of treatment must be individualized, and is influenced by contraindications,
      potential side effects, the need to treat associated symptoms like tension-type headache and
      insomnia, and drug cost.

      Anticonvulsants, such as valproate, have shown significant degrees of efficacy in migraine
      prophylaxis when used in low doses. Considering the differences in proposed mechanisms of
      action of these agents, it is likely that a novel anticonvulsant such as zonisamide may also
      be an effective prophylactic treatment for migraine.

        INCLUSION:

        Subjects who meet all the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the study:

          -  Are men or women, between the ages of 18 and 65, inclusive.

          -  Satisfy diagnostic criteria for migraine headache, consistent with criteria described
             in Headache Classification Criteria.

          -  Have at least 4 migraine attacks per 28 days [each attack separated by at least 48
             hours] prior to the Screening Visit and experience at least 4 migraine attacks during
             the Screen/Baseline Phase.

          -  Agree to not become pregnant during the study and agree to use an adequate method of
             birth control during the study such as an adequate barrier method, hormonal
             contraceptive, or surgical sterilization. All women of childbearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy test before entering the study and during the study.

          -  Are able to swallow the capsules whole.

          -  Are willing and able to follow Investigator instructions and study procedures,
             complete the daily diary, and report adverse events.

        EXCLUSION:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in this
        study:

          -  Have required more than 3 different rescue medications for control of a single attack
             anytime within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Have cluster headache or chronic tension type headache and are unable to distinguish
             between their different types of headache.

          -  Have basilar or hemiplegic migraine.

          -  Have used triptans more than 3 times per week within 3 months prior to the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Have received botulinum toxin injection(s) within 3 months prior to the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Have taken any other prophylactic medications for migraine within 5 half-lives prior
             to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Have a history or current diagnosis of psychiatric disorder likely to require
             pharmacological intervention (e.g., antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, antipsychotics,
             mood-stabilizers, anxiolytics) during the study.

          -  Have clinically unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary,
             metabolic, endocrine or other systemic disease.

          -  Have laboratory test results that, in the opinion of the Investigator, are clinically
             significant abnormalities.

          -  Require treatment with any medication (e.g., daily opioids, daily beta-blockers, daily
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, eletriptan) or
             herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's Wort, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, kava kava,
             melatonin, petadolex) that might interact adversely with, or obscure, the action of
             the study medication.

          -  Have received psychoactive medication (e.g., other anticonvulsant drugs,
             antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers) within 5 half-lives
             prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Have previously enrolled in this study or previously treated with zonisamide.

          -  Have previously failed an adequate trial of another antiepilepsy drug for the
             treatment of migraine.

          -  Have a history of skin rash, without other diagnosis, associated with any medication
             or any medical condition.

          -  Have a history of nephrolithiasis.

          -  Have received an experimental drug or used an experimental device within 30 days of
