      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well alemtuzumab works in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory advanced mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with relapsed or recurrent advanced mycosis
           fungoides or Sézary syndrome treated with alemtuzumab.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 2 hours three times per week. Treatment
      continues for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
