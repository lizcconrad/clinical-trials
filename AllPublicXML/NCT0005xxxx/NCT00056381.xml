      Anidulafungin is an investigational drug being developed as an intravenous treatment for
      esophageal candidiasis, candidemia and other invasive fungal infections. Anidulafungin is an
      antifungal agent of the echinocandin class, which targets the fungal cell wall of yeast and
      other filamentous fungi.
