  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out the highest safe dose of
      DOTAP:Chol-fus1 that can be given to participants in the treatment of non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This study is an attempt to transfer a gene
      (fus1) into cancer cells, using the drug DOTAP:Cholesterol-fus1. Researchers will also study
      the side effects of this experimental gene transfer at different doses, and will conduct
      tests to see if there are any effects on tumor size at different doses. Experimental transfer
      of the fus1 gene into humans has never been tried before.

      Objectives:

        -  Assess the toxicity of DOTAP:Cholesterol-fus1 Liposome Complex (DOTAP:Chol-fus1)
           administered intravenously.

        -  To determine the maximal tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of DOTAP:Chol-fus1
           administered intravenously.

        -  Assess the expression of fus1 following intravenous delivery of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 in tumor
           and normal bronchial epithelial cell biopsies.

        -  Assess any anti-cancer activity for DOTAP:Chol-fus1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DOTAP:Chol-fus1 is a drug that helps transfer the fus1 gene into cancer cells. It is thought
      that the absence of the fus1 gene may be involved in the development of lung cancer tumors.
      The idea is to try to replace this gene in lung cancer cells.

      Participants in this study must have advanced lung cancer that has worsened after receiving
      prior chemotherapy. Before treatment begins, participants will have a physical exam. Blood
      (about 2 tablespoons) and urine tests will be performed. Women able to have children will
      have a blood pregnancy test. Please note that it is possible that the tumor could cause a
      &quot;positive&quot; pregnancy test result, when you are not pregnant. If a pregnancy test comes back
      positive, and for any reason you and/or the research staff believes that this may be an
      error, additional tests may be done to confirm or rule out pregnancy. The participant's tumor
      will be measured using CT, PET/CT or MRI scans. Participants will also have an EKG (heart
      function test) and a MUGA scan or echocardiogram.

      A treatment cycle on this study is 3 weeks. Participants will receive pre-medications of
      dexamethasone and diphenhydramine prior to the infusion of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 to try to lessen
      the potential reactions to the infusion. The participant will receive a short infusion of
      DOTAP:Chol-fus1 by vein once every 3 weeks. Participants will be examined by their doctor
      before each treatment. In addition, participants will return to the clinic on days 2, 3, and
      8 after the first dose to have blood tests done, their vital signs checked, and to look for
      side effects. After every two treatment cycles or 6 weeks, the participant's tumor will be
      measured using a CT or MRI scan. Participants can continue to receive treatments until the
      tumor gets worse, side effects become too severe, or a maximum of 6 treatments have been
      given. Treatment may continue for participants who continue to benefit from the treatment at
      the end of the planned 6 treatments if the treating physician, the principle investigator,
      and an advisor from the FDA all agree. Participants will return to the clinic 3 weeks after
      their last dose of DOTAP:Chol-fus1 to have their vital signs checked and to look for side
      effects. After all treatments are finished, participants will be contacted every 3 months for
      an update on their health and to gather information about any other treatment(s) they have
      received.

      Participants entered at a given dose level will not be able to receive a higher dose while on
      study. A group of 3 participants will receive DOTAP:Chol-fus1 by vein at each dose level.
      After treating 3 participants at a given dose level, the participants will be observed for 2
      weeks to evaluate the toxicity. The information showing if the participants develop severe
      side effects, referred to as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), will be recorded for computing the
      chance of toxicity. This information will be used to help select the dose level for the next
      group of participants. The goal is to find the dose level where 10% of participants develop
      severe side effects (dose-limiting toxicity).

      All the participants will be treated in a dose-escalation fashion starting from the lowest
      level. The next dose level can be moved up if calculation of the side effects shows that a
      higher dose is needed. However, no skipping of doses is allowed.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 51 individuals will receive study drug on this study.
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

             chemotherapy regimen for NSCLC. For SCLC subjects: Extensive disease or recurrent
             disease after initial treatment for limited disease. Patients must have received prior
             platinum-based chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. All subjects: There is no limit to
             the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received.

             enrollment if they have two Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS) scans one week apart and
             serial beta-HCG levels two weeks apart that are inconsistent with pregnancy and a
             Gynecology consult to ensure that the beta- HCG level was at a value high enough to
             see pregnancy with TVUS. Subjects must agree to practice effective birth control
             during the study period.

          6. Negative serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

          7. Patients must be &gt;/= 4 weeks beyond major surgical procedures such as thoracotomy,

          8. Adequate renal function documented by serum creatinine of &lt;= 1.5 mg/dl or calculated
             creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min.

          9. Adequate hepatic function as documented by serum bilirubin&lt; 1.5 mg/dl and SGOT and
             SGPT &lt;/= 1.5 * upper limit of normal.

         10. FEV1 and corrected DLCO of &gt;/= 40% of predicted.

         11. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases that have been treated are eligible if the
             following criteria are met: No history of seizures in the preceding 6 months.
             Definitive treatment must have been completed ≥4weeks prior to registration. Subjects
             must be off steroids that were being administered because of brain metastases or
             related symptoms for ≥2 weeks. Post-treatment imaging within 2 weeks of registration
             must demonstrate stability or regression of the brain metastases.

         12. Stable cardiac condition with a left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50%.

          2. Patients who received investigational therapy, monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab
             or cetuximab, or who received radiotherapy to the skull, spine, thorax or pelvis
             within 30 days of entry into the protocol. Patients are permitted to have received
             palliative radiotherapy to an extremity provided at least 14 days has elapsed since
             completion of therapy, provided the patient received no more than 10 radiotherapy
             fractions and a dose no higher than 30 Gy to that site, and provided skull, spine,
             thorax or pelvis were not in the radiotherapy field.

          5. Patients with serious concurrent illness or psychological, familial, sociological,
             geographical, or other concomitant conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would not permit adequate follow-up and compliance with the study
             protocol.

          6. Use of any investigational agent within four weeks of study treatment.

          7. Prior gene therapy.
