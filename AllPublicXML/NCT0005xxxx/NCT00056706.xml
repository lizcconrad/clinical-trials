      This study will determine whether impaired hand function due to stroke can be improved by
      blocking nerve impulses to the unaffected arm. Following a stroke, the unaffected side of the
      brain might negatively influence the affected side. Studies in healthy volunteers show that
      function in one hand improves when ischemic nerve block (inflating a pressure cuff to block
      nerve impulses) is applied to the forearm of the other hand. This study will examine whether
      similar improvement also occurs in the affected hand of patients with chronic impairment
      after stroke.

      Stroke patients with sensory (numbness) or motor impairment (weakness) in the hand that has
      persisted at least 12 months after the stroke may be eligible for this study. Patients who
      have had more than one stroke, whose stroke affected both sides of the body, who have a
      history of deep vein thrombosis (blood clotting), or who are receiving anticoagulant
      (blood-thinning) treatment at the time of the study will not be enrolled.

      Participants will have physical and neurological examinations and will undergo the following
      procedures:

      Session 1

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (if one has not been done within the previous 6 months): MRI
           uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For
           this procedure, the patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow
           cylinder) and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur
           during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 45 to 90 minutes, during which
           the patient lies still up to a few minutes at a time.

        -  Mini Mental State Examination - Patients will take a short test to assess cognitive
           function.

      Sessions 2 (and possibly 3 and 4)

        -  Motor task practice: Patients practice a motor task several times to achieve optimal
           performance. The task is a rhythmic, repetitive pinch grip at maximal strength at a
           frequency of one grip every 10 seconds. If technical difficulties arise during the
           session, the procedure will be repeated in sessions 3 and 4.

      Sessions 5 (and possibly 6)

        -  Pinch grip and ischemic nerve block (INB): Patients perform the pinch grip task several
           times and then INB is applied. For INB, a blood pressure cuff is inflated around the arm
           at the level of the elbow for 35 to 50 minutes. The procedure causes temporary numbness,
           tingling, loss of muscle strength, and discoloration or the forearm and hand. Patients
           repeat the pinch grip task during the INB and again 20 minutes after the INB is
           released. If technical difficulties arise during the session, the procedure will be
           repeated in session 6.

      Session 7

      This session is identical to session 5, except the INB is applied immediately above the ankle
      instead of on the forearm.

      There are very few therapeutic options for the treatment of disability resulting from chronic
      stroke. We recently found that transient deafferentation of one hand in healthy subjects
      enhanced performance in corticomotor excitability and a tactile discriminative task,
      targeting muscles in the opposite non-deafferented hand. The purpose of this protocol is to
      test the hypothesis that transient deafferentation of the intact hand in chronic stroke
      patients will improve functions in the paretic hand. We plan to study patients with chronic
      strokes dating back at least one year, and either predominantly motor or somatosensory
      deficits.

      Primary outcome measures are (a) in patients with predominantly somatosensory deficit,
      deafferentation-induced improvement in a tactile discrimination task (grating orientation
      task GOT and (b) in patients with predominantly motor deficit, deafferentation-induced
      improvement in pinch muscle strength.

      Modified primary outcome measure will be the decrease in interhemispheric inhibition
      targeting the paretic hand during deafferentation of the healthy hand (chronic stroke
      patients, motor deficit group).

      Secondary outcome measure will be the decrease in interhemispheric inhibition targeting the
      non-deafferented hand in healthy control subjects.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We will include patients with thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions and with
        hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions (subcortical in the corticospinal tract, or cortical in
        motor or somatosensory representations, as documented by CT or MRI) at least 12 months
        after the stroke. In addition, for the TMS measurements we will include 17 age- and
        gender-matched control subjects.

        For the GOT task, we will choose subjects who initially had a severe sensory paresis
        (sensory NIH-SS below 1), which subsequently recovered to the point that they have a
        residual somatosensory deficit but can perform the task.

        For the motor performance, we will choose subjects who initially had a severe motor paresis
        (below MRC grade 2), which subsequently recovered to the point that they have a residual
        motor deficit but can perform the required tasks.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with more than one stroke.

        Patients with bilateral motor impairment.

        Patients with cerebellar or brainstem lesions.

        Patients or subjects unable to perform the task (wrist or elbow flexion at least MRC grade
        2, less than 75% of performance in the grating orientation task with a grating of 3.0).

        Patients or subjects with history of severe alcohol or drug abuse, psychiatric illness like
        severe depression, poor motivational capacity, or severe language disturbances,
        particularly of receptive nature or with serious cognitive deficits (defined as equivalent
        to a mini-mental state exam score of 23 or less).

        Patients or subjects with severe uncontrolled medical problems (e.g. cardiovascular
        disease, severe rheumatoid arthritis, active joint deformity of arthritic origin, active
        cancer or renal disease, any kind of end-stage pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, or a
        deteriorated condition due to age, uncontrolled epilepsy or others).

        Patients or subjects with increased intracranial pressure as evaluated by clinical means.

        Patients or subjects with unstable cardiac arrhythmia.

        Patients or subjects with history of hyperthyroidism or individuals receiving drugs acting
        primarily on the central nervous system.

        Patients with more than moderate to severe microangiopathy, polyneuropathy, diabetes
        mellitus, or ischemic peripheral disease.

        Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis.

        Patients receiving anticoagulant treatment at the time of the proposed study.

        Excessive callus at the palm of the fingers.
