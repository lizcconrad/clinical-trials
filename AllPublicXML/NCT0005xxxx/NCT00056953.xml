  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a peer mentoring program designed for youths
      ages 9 to 15 whose parents or guardians are HIV infected. The program will focus on the
      youths' mental health, school performance, alcohol and drug use, personal and social
      behaviors, and behaviors that might expose them to HIV. The study is expected to enroll
      predominantly minority youth.

      This study will conduct an efficacy trial of peer mentoring for a high-risk, predominantly
      minority population of 9- to 15-year-old youths whose parents are HIV infected. The study
      will also determine mechanisms (mediating variables) through which peer mentoring improves
      outcomes for the mentees, for example, consistency and continuity of relationship,
      teaching/role modeling, emotional support/empathy, advocacy, and behavioral reinforcement.
      After the conclusion of the efficacy trial, the study will continue through naturalistic
      longitudinal research for an additional 2 years in order to examine the long-term outcomes of
      peer mentoring.

      Participants are randomized to either the peer mentoring program or a control condition (a
      recreation program). Surveys are conducted at entry into the study, at 6 months, 1 year, and
      then annually for 2 years. Youths will also participate in focus groups. The surveys and
      focus groups will assess the youthsâ€™ psychological functioning, academic adjustment, alcohol
      and drug use, HIV risk behaviors, delinquent/violent behaviors, peer relationships, prosocial
      activities, and coping/problem-solving skills. The study will also evaluate family outcomes,
      including parent/guardian functioning and improved permanency planning.
