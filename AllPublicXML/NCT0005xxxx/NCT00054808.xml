  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will have low- or intermediate-grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) that has
      progressed after standard chemotherapy. Patients will receive gallium nitrate 300 mg/m2/day
      by continuous IV infusion for 7 consecutive days using a portable infusion pump.
      Hospitalization is not required. Stable or responding patients will receive additional
      gallium nitrate infusions every 3 weeks until the time of disease progression, for a maximum
      total of 8 infusions, or 2 cycles after complete remission has been documented.

    <textblock>
      This study seeks to define the role of gallium nitrate in a specific population of patients
      who are expected to have received prior therapy. Preliminary clinical studies have suggested
      substantial evidence of antitumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory
      non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma treated with gallium nitrate.
