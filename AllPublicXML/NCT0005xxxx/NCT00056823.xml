  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if injections of rhuFab V2 into the eye in
      combination with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a safe and efficacious treatment
      for patients with age-related macular degeneration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             information

          -  Age &gt;=50 years

             Visudyne(R) product labeling

          -  Treatment with verteporfin anticipated or expected

          -  Primary or recurrent subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesions secondary to
             AMD in the study eye

          -  A classic CNV component (well-demarcated hyperfluorescence boundaries in the early
             phase of the fluorescein angiogram) that is &gt;=50% of the total lesion area

          -  Total lesion size &gt;=5400 um in greatest linear dimension (GLD)

          -  Best corrected visual acuity, using ETDRS charts, of 20/40 to 20/320 (Snellen
             equivalent) in the study eye

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with verteporfin in the study eye less than 3 months preceding Day 0

          -  Treatment with verteporfin in the non-study eye less than 7 days preceding Day 0

          -  More than three prior treatments with verteporfin PDT in the study eye within 12
             months preceding Day 0

          -  Prior treatment with external-beam radiation therapy or transpupillary thermotherapy
             in the study eye

          -  Previous participation in a clinical trial (for either eye) involving antiangiogenic
             drugs (pegaptanib, rhuFab V2, anecortave acetate, protein kinase C inhibitors, etc.)
             Previous intravitreal drug delivery (e.g., intravitreal corticosteroid injection or
             device implantation) in the study eye

          -  Previous subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation in the study eye

          -  Laser photocoagulation (juxtafoveal or extrafoveal) in the study eye within 1 month
             preceding Day 0

          -  History of vitrectomy, submacular surgery, or other surgical intervention for AMD in
             the study eye

          -  Previous participation in any studies of investigational drugs within 1 month
             preceding Day 0 (excluding vitamins and minerals studies)

          -  Subretinal hemorrhage in the study eye that involves the center of the fovea, if the
             size of the hemorrhage is either &gt;=50% of the total lesion area or &gt;=1 disc area in
             size

          -  Subfoveal fibrosis or atrophy in the study eye

          -  Clinical or angiographic evidence of retinal angiomatous proliferation in the study
             eye, if there is also no angiographic evidence of classic CNV

          -  CNV in either eye due to other causes, such as ocular histoplasmosis, trauma, or
             pathologic myopia

          -  Retinal pigment epithelium tear involving the macula in the study eye

          -  Any concurrent intraocular condition (e.g., cataract or diabetic retinopathy) that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, either could require medical or surgical intervention
             during the 24-month study period to prevent or treat visual loss that might result
             from that condition, or if allowed to progress untreated, could likely contribute to
             loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of best corrected visual acuity over the
             24-month study period

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye

          -  Current vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye

          -  History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the
             study eye

          -  History of idiopathic or autoimmune-associated uveitis in either eye. Infectious
             conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either eye

          -  Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye

          -  Spherical equivalent of the refractive error in the study eye demonstrating more than
             -8 diopters of myopia

          -  Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) on the study eye within 1 month
             preceding Day 0

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure &gt;=30 mmHg
             despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication)

          -  Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation
             of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from treatment
             complications.

          -  Current treatment for active systemic infection

          -  Contraindications to verteporfin photodynamic therapy (as determined by the
