      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug
      with imatinib mesylate may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining cisplatin, irinotecan, and
      imatinib mesylate in treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate when administered with
           cisplatin and irinotecan in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of imatinib mesylate in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate, median duration of response, progression-free survival,
           median survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 60 minutes on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 4 courses. Patients also
      receive oral imatinib mesylate daily continually for one week prior to, during, and after
      chemotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are treated at the recommended phase II dose (one dose level below the MTD).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
