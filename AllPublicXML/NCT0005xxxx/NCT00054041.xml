    <textblock>
      Vaccines made from antigens may make the body build an immune response to kill abnormal
      cervical cells and may be effective in preventing cervical cancer. Randomized phase II trial
      to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in preventing cervical cancer in patients who
      have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of SGN-00101, in terms of complete histologic regression, in
      patients with grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine change in lesion size in these patients after treatment with this drug.

      II. Compare histologic response before and after treatment with this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive SGN-00101 subcutaneously once on weeks 1, 4, and 8 in the absence of
      disease progression.

      Arm II: Patients receive standard care.

      At week 15, all patients undergo large loop excision of the transformation zone under
      colposcopy.

      Patients are followed at 19 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-84 patients (14-42 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 12-48 months.

    <description>Fisher's exact test (and if feasible, Chi-Square test) will be conducted to see if the probability of responding in the investigational arm is significantly different from the controls actively accrued to this study. The conditional distribution used in Fisher's exact test will be used to calculate a 90% confidence interval for the odds ratio of observing a response in the investigational arm to the control arm.</description>
