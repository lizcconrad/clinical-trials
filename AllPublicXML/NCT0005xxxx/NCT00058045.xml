      RATIONALE: Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.
      Stem cell factor may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral
      blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of cancer therapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining interleukin-2 with stem cell
      factor in treating patients who have AIDS or AIDS-related cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of low-dose interleukin-2 and stem cell factor in
           patients with AIDS or AIDS-related malignancies.

        -  Determine the immune status of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of stem cell factor.

      Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) six days a week and stem cell
      factor SC three times a week for 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of stem cell factor until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an
      additional cohort of 3 patients receives treatment at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
