  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if Allovectin-7®, an experimental
      gene-based immunotherapy, can shrink head and neck tumors. The trial will also examine if
      treatment can boost the immune system and if this treatment can improve the time to disease
      progression.

      Treatment - If you take part in this trial you will be treated for about four weeks. You will
      receive an injection of Allovectin-7® by needle, directly into your tumor. This will be
      repeated 14 days later. The injections may be given in a doctor's office. A week later, you
      will undergo surgery to remove the tumor. Your tumor will be measured before Allovectin-7®
      treatment and before surgery to see if Allovectin-7® was effective in shrinking it. This will
      be done by general physical exams and scans (such as X-ray scans). There will also be tests
      on the removed tumor to see if Allovectin-7® helped to boost the immune system to attack the
      cancer.
