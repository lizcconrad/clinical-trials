      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the physical separation between patient and
      physician required during telemedicine has an affect on physician-patient communication and
      related outcomes, including patient and physician satisfaction, patient compliance, and
      patient understanding of medical care.

      BACKGROUND/RATIONALE:

      The Veterans Administration system supports telemedicine (TM) to provide medical
      consultations between patients and physicians via videoconference. At present, little is
      known about the impact of such TM consultations on patient-physician communication and
      related health outcomes. Analyses of in-person (IP) medical encounters have shown that
      effective patient-physician communication is associated with improved health outcomes.

      OBJECTIVE(S):

      To determine whether the physical separation between patient and physician required during TM
      has an affect on patient-physician communication and related outcomes, including patient and
      physician satisfaction, patient compliance, and patient understanding of medical care.

      METHODS:

      In this clinical trial, 238 patients were randomized to receive either consultative care at
      the remote site via TM with a consultant physician located the Milwaukee VA (intervention) OR
      by an IP consultation with a consultant physician at the Milwaukee VA (control). The same
      group of consultant physicians provided both IP and TM consultations.

      Patients in both study arms had their medical encounter video recorded. We compared patterns
      and quality of patient-physician communication for the TM and IP encounters, using the Roter
      Interaction Analysis System. Data on patient and physician satisfaction with the encounter
      and patients' understanding of their medical problems were collected at the end of each
      medical encounter. Patient compliance (medication refill behavior) was assessed at 90 days
      post visit. The frequency of communication behaviors during the TM and IP encounters was
      compared using the analysis of a Linear Mixed Model. Comparison of patient satisfaction,
      physician satisfaction, patient compliance, and patient knowledge measures between TM and IP
      groups were conducted with similar Linear Mixed Models.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Only adult (age&gt;18) patients referred from the Appleton Clinic are eligible. All Appleton
        patients who are considered new patient referrals (ie, have never been seen in the
        pulmonary, rheumatology, and endocrine clinics at the Milwaukee VA) will be eligible.
        Appleton patients who have previously been seen by any of the nine participating endocrine,
        pulmonary, and rheumatology physicians at the Milwaukee VA will be eligible. These
        follow-up patients will be scheduled with the previously seen participating physician, so
        there is no disruption of the ongoing patient-provider relationship. Patients that have
        established care with a non-participating provider will not be eligible. Patients that have
        been referred to the specialist for an outpatient procedure (eg, request to perform
        pulmonary function testing or bronchoscopy) will not be eligible. Repeat visits to the same
        or any other participating physician will not be eligible. Adult patients who have a
        significant communication disability (severe speech and hearing impairment, severe
        dementia, or mental health condition resulting in a non-communicative patient) and are
        considered mentally competent to provide informed written consent will not be eligible.
        Patients with disabilities other than those mentioned will be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients that have established care with a non-participating provider will not be eligible
        to participate. Patients that have been referred to the specialist for an outpatient
        procedure (e.g. request to perform pulmonary function testing or bronchoscopy) will not be
        eligible. Repeat visits to the same or any other participating physician will not be
        eligible. Adult patients who have a significant communication disability (severe speech and
        hearing impairment, severe dementia, or mental health condition resulting in a
        non-communicative patient) and are considered mentally competent to provide informed
        written consent will not be eligible to participate.
