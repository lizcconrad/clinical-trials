    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of a pharmacy-based
      intervention designed to improve adherence with antipsychotic medications among patients with
      serious mental illness.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Anti-psychotic medications are an essential component of the treatment of
      patients with schizophrenia. Unfortunately, pharmacy data indicate that 40% of VA patients
      with schizophrenia are poorly adherent with their antipsychotics. These patients are at much
      greater risk for hospitalization. Objectives: We are examining the effectiveness of a
      practical, pharmacy-based intervention for improving antipsychotic adherence among patients
      with serious mental illness (SMI). Specifically, we are examining whether this pharmacy-based
      intervention increases antipsychotic medication adherence and patient satisfaction with care
      and decreases psychiatric symptoms, and inpatient utilization. We are also examining the
      relative effectiveness of the pharmacy-based intervention among patients with varying: a)
      degrees of cognitive limitations, b) degrees of insight into their illness, and c) attitudes
      towards their medications. Methods: Using pharmacy and administrative data, we are
      identifying patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or severe bipolar disorder
      requiring antipsychotic medication who have had poor antipsychotic adherence in the previous
      year. Patients must have completed at least two outpatient psychiatric visits at one of the
      study sites. Patients are randomized to: 1) usual care; or 2) the Pharmacy Based
      intervention. The pharmacy-based intervention consists of usual care plus: 1) &quot;unit-of-use&quot;
      adherence packaging; 2) a patient education session; 3) refill reminders; and 4) clinician
      notification of missed fills. In-person patient assessments are conducted at baseline, 6
      months, and 12 months following randomization. Medical record and administrative data will be
      collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months following randomization. The
      primary outcome measure is medication adherence as measured by the medication possession
      ratio and adherence categories which combine pharmacy information with patient self-report
      and antipsychotic blood levels. Patientsï¿½ level of psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, and
      satisfaction are secondary outcome measures. In supplemental analyses, we will compare the
      effectiveness of the pharmacy-based intervention among subgroups of patients who have varying
      degrees of cognitive limitations, insight into their illness, and attitudes towards
      antipsychotic medication. Findings: One hundred and fifty patients have been enrolled in the
      study. Follow-up rates have been high, with 90% of patients completing 6 month follow up
      assessments and 80% completing 12 month assessments. In person follow up visits are now
      complete.

      Findings regarding the accuracy of administrative diagnoses of schizophrenia, the accuracy of
      pharmacy data in identifying patients with poor adherence, and patient factors associated
      with study recruitment have been presented at national meetings. Main study analyses are now
      ongoing. 6. Status: Enrollment and inperson-patient follow up are complete. Study analyses
      are now in progress. Impact: Improving adherence among SMI patients is critical to improving
      their outcomes. This study examines the effectiveness of a practical, low-cost intervention
      to for these vulnerable patients.
