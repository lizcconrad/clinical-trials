  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the drug telbivudine (LdT) for treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      in HIV infected patients. Patients will take telbivudine alone for 24 weeks, add anti-HIV
      drugs for 24 weeks, then stop taking telbivudine while continuing their anti-HIV drug
      regimen. To enroll in this study, patients must not be taking any anti-HIV drugs and cannot
      have taken more than 31 days of treatment with lamivudine (3TC), protease inhibitors (PIs),
      or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies indicate that 70% to 80% of HIV infected patients have or have had HBV infection and
      that 10% are HBV carriers. Lamivudine therapy for treatment of HBV in HIV infected patients
      has limited long-term efficacy due to the development of resistance mutations. Telbivudine is
      a thymidine analogue with excellent HBV inhibitory activity but no anti-HIV activity. The
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and anti-HBV activity of
      telbivudine alone and in combination with a lamivudine-based highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART) regimen in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV.

      Patients in this study will take telbivudine for 24 weeks. At Week 24, patients will add a
      HAART regimen containing lamivudine and efavirenz plus either didanosine or abacavir.
      Patients who are unable to add a HAART regimen at Week 24 due to lab abnormalities or other
      contraindications will be allowed to delay the initiation of HAART until Week 30. Patients
      may initiate HAART prior to Week 24 if deemed medically necessary by the primary HIV care
      provider. Patients will take both telbivudine and HAART for 24 weeks. At Week 48, patients
      will discontinue telbivudine and continue on the HAART regimen alone for an additional 12
      weeks.
