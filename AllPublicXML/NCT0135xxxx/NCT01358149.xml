    <textblock>
      Today, there is an important lack of knowledge on child metabolism and the effects of
      phytochemical-rich foods, which includes fruits and vegetables and plant-derived foods. Here,
      the investigators will monitor the metabolism of children using minimally invasive techniques
      at rest, and with physical/mental activities and assess the changes associated with the
      intake of cocoa-based food.
