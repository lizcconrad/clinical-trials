    <textblock>
      This study investigates if transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is effective in the
      recovery of postural control in stroke rehabilitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients were divided in 2 groups by a randomisation procedure. All patients participated
      for 2 months in the study. Group 1 received true tDCS in the first month followed by SHAM
      stimulation in the second month. Group 2 received SHAM in the first month and true
      stimulation in the following month. Four stimulations of 20minutes were provided during 4
      weeks before before changing stimulation intensity.

    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale (reporting a change on trunk performance at baseline, after 1 month and after two months)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after 1 month, After 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The static sitting balance subscale assesses whether a subject can sit independently and remain seated when the legs are either passively or actively crossed. The dynamic sitting balance subscale evaluates the ability to actively shorten each side of the trunk, first initiated from the shoulder and subsequently initiated from the pelvic girdle. Trunk coordination is evaluated by the possibility to independently rotate the upper and lower part of the trunk. The scoring range for the static and dynamic sitting balance and coordination subscales are 7, 10 and 6 points respectively.</description>

    <measure>Rivermead Motor Assessment Battery (RMAB) (reporting a change on motricity of gross function, arm, leg and trunk at baseline, after 1 month and after two months)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after 1 month, After 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RMAB assesses the motor performance of patients with stroke.32 It consists of test items clustered in three sections that are ordered hierarchically. The gross function subscale (13 items), the Leg and Trunk subscale (10 items) and the arm subscale (15 items)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinetti Test (reporting a change on balance and gait tasks at baseline, after 1 month and after two months)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after 1 month, After 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinetti Test is an easily performed test that measures a patients' gait and balance. The individual scores are combined to form three measures; a gait score, a standing balance score and a total score.
The maximum score for the gait component and the balance component are 12 and 16 points respectively, resulting in a maximum of 28 points for the total score.</description>
