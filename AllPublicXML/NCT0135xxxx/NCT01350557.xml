  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture in the elderly is associated with excess mortality of 5 to 20%, and mobility
      problems that usually results in costly hospital stays and lengthy rehabilitation procedures.
      The purpose of this study is to compare the costs and effectiveness of three care models-
      acute/sub-acute, comprehensive, and routine care models for hip fractured elders in Taiwan.

      Hip fracture in the elderly is associated with excess mortality of 5 to 20%, and mobility
      problems that usually results in costly hospital stays and lengthy rehabilitation procedures.
      With this increase in the aging population, hip fracture represents a major and a fast
      growing health care problem in Taiwan. Currently, the incidence rate of hip fractures is 10
      times of the incidence rate for the general population. Despite the use of advanced
      treatment, the one-year mortality rate (15.4%) remains significant, and many of the patients
      never recover completely in terms of activities of daily living functions. Many studies in
      the United States have proved that elderly patients with hip fracture can benefit from
      post-operative rehabilitation, early discharge planning programs, or transitional care
      programs. However, little is known about what intervention should be attempted for these
      patients and their families in Taiwan.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the costs and effectiveness of three care models-
      acute/sub-acute, comprehensive, and routine care models for hip fractured elders in Taiwan.

    <description>Measured by the Chinese Barthel Index (CBI) as ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), with scores ranging from 0 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 months after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale, short form (GDS-s). Patients with a score ≥ 5 were categorized as at risk for clinical depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nutritional status</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 12 months after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional status was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). MNA scores categorize each person as well-nourished (≥24 points), at risk of malnutrition (17-23.5 points), and malnourished (&lt;17 points).</description>
