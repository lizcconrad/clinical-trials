    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the following: 1. Find the maximum tolerated dose
      of E7050 when given in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine in patients with advance
      or metastatic solid tumors, and 2) Whether E7050 in combination with cisplatin and
      capecitabine is more effective in patients with previously untreated gastric cancer versus
      cisplatin and capecitabine alone.

      This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of 2 phases:

      Phase Ib: a safety run-in period with 3 ascending doses of E7050 in combination with fixed
      doses of Cisplatin and Capecitabine. This phase will enroll approximately 10 to 15 patients.

        -  Phase II: a randomized 2-arm design which will enroll 80 patients.

      In the phase II portion, Patients will receive study treatment , E7050 in combination with
      Cisplatin and Capecitabine versus Cisplatin and Capecitabine Alone) for approximately six
      21-day cycles (18 weeks). Beyond 18 weeks, patients who are experiencing clinical benefit may
      continue E7050, with or without Capecitabine (Arm 1), or may continue Capecitabine alone (Arm
      2), depending on the original randomization treatment arm. Patients will continue treatment
      for as long as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated, until the
      occurrence of progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or
      withdrawal by investigator, whichever occurs first. Patients will participate in either phase
      Ib or phase II.

    <measure>Area Under The Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) From 0 to 24 Hours of Golvatinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Day -2); predose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 (if feasible), 24, and 48 hours after study treatment. Cycle 2 (Day 1); predose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 (if feasible), and 24 hours after study treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>On days when pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were to be drawn, a predose blood sample was obtained prior to administration of golvatinib and capecitabine. After administration of study drugs, a second postdose blood sample was taken. The amount of golvatinib in the participant's blood was analyzed and the AUC was calculated. The AUC reflects the actual body exposure to drug after administration of a dose of the drug and is dependent on the rate of elimination of the drug from the body and the dose administered. Predose samples that were below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) or missing were assigned a numerical value of zero for the calculation of AUC. Any other BLQ concentrations were assigned a value of zero. Results were expressed in nanograms·hour/milliter (ng·h/mL).</description>

    <measure>Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Golvatinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Day -2); predose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 (if feasible), 24, and 48 hours after study treatment. Cycle 2 (Day 1); predose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 (if feasible), and 24 hours after study treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were drawn to analyze the amount of golvatinib in the participant's serum. Maximum concentration refers to the maximum (or peak) serum concentration of study drug in the participant's system after administration of the study drug and prior to the administration of a second dose of the study drug. Results were expressed in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, up to approximately 1 year 1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs; regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); and performance of physical examinations. A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) that had an onset date, or a worsening in severity from Baseline (pretreatment), on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the date of last study treatment.</description>

Oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m^2 tablet) was taken twice a day (2000 mg/m^2 total daily) with food at about the same time (after golvatinib), on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-day cycle. At least 2 hours after capecitabine was taken, cisplatin (80 mg/m^2) was administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 minutes (after appropriate hydration or according to the institutional guidelines), on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Pretreatment hydration included 1 liter of normal saline by IV infusion over 120 minutes. Posttreatment hydration included 500 mL normal saline over 60 minutes. The dose level of golvatinib was to be escalated (to 300 and 400 mg) for additional cohorts after 3 participants enrolled into a given cohort unless there was a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 3 participants.</description>

        <title>Area Under The Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) From 0 to 24 Hours of Golvatinib</title>
        <description>On days when pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were to be drawn, a predose blood sample was obtained prior to administration of golvatinib and capecitabine. After administration of study drugs, a second postdose blood sample was taken. The amount of golvatinib in the participant's blood was analyzed and the AUC was calculated. The AUC reflects the actual body exposure to drug after administration of a dose of the drug and is dependent on the rate of elimination of the drug from the body and the dose administered. Predose samples that were below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) or missing were assigned a numerical value of zero for the calculation of AUC. Any other BLQ concentrations were assigned a value of zero. Results were expressed in nanograms·hour/milliter (ng·h/mL).</description>

          <description>Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs; regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); and performance of physical examinations. A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) that had an onset date, or a worsening in severity from Baseline (pretreatment), on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the date of last study treatment.</description>
          <population>Safety Population included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug and who had at least one safety assessment after the first dose of study drug.</population>

Oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m^2 tablet) was taken twice a day (2000 mg/m^2 total daily) with food at about the same time (after golvatinib), on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-day cycle. At least 2 hours after capecitabine was taken, cisplatin (80 mg/m^2) was administered by IV infusion over 60 minutes (after appropriate hydration or according to the institutional guidelines), on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Pretreatment hydration included 1 liter of normal saline by IV infusion over 120 minutes. Posttreatment hydration included 500 mL normal saline over 60 minutes. The dose level of golvatinib was to be escalated (to 300 and 400 mg) for additional cohorts after 3 participants enrolled into a given cohort unless there was a DLT in the first 3 participants.</description>
