    <textblock>
      The primary aim of study is to gain an initial assessment of safety and tolerability of
      AZD3514 in Japanese patients together with assessing Pharmacokinetics (PK) and gaining a
      preliminary assessment of anti-tumour action. In this study, AZD3514 will be administered to
      Japanese patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.
