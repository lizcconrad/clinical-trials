  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged fasting may increase the organic response to trauma. Carbohydrate-based drinks have
      been tested and they may reduce insulin resistance. No study so far has aimed to examine the
      possible benefits of whey protein drink in the composition of preoperative drinks.

      The patients will be randomized into two groups: the carbohydrate-protein group (CHO-P) and
      the control group (CO). The patients will reeive a specific drink to their group on the
      evening prior to surgery and three hours before the operation. The CHO-P group will receive
      474 ml (evening drink) or 237 ml (3h prior to operation drink) of a solution containing 14%
      whey protein (100% lactoalbumin), 86% carbohydrates (45% hydrolyzed corn starch and 55%
      sucrose) and 0% lipids (Resource® Breeze - Nestlé, São Paulo, Brasil) and the CO group will
      receive the same volume of water.

      Outcome measures On the day of the surgery and on the first postoperative day blood samples
      will be collected for glucose, insulin, triglycerides, albumin, pre-albumin, CRP, and
      α-1-acid glycoprotein (α-1-GA) assays. HOMA-IR will be calculated
