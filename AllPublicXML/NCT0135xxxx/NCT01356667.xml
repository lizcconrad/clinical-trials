    <textblock>
      Drum-Assisted Recovery Therapy for Native Americans (DARTNA) is an R-21 NIH/NCCAM-funded
      study aimed to complete the development and pilot a new substance abuse treatment protocol
      utilizing drumming for American Indians/Alaska Natives with substance use disorders. The
      study includes activities to complete the protocol, followed by a randomized-controlled
      clinical trial.

      During year 1, this study consists of a series of focus groups conducted among American
      Indians/Alaska Natives with substance use disorders, providers serving AI/ANs with substance
      use disorders, and a Community Advisory Board. These focus groups are conducted in order to
      obtain feedback with regard to the initial DARTNA treatment protocol. These focus groups are
      then followed by a pretest of DARTNA among 10 AI/ANs with substance use disorders followed by
      a series of focus groups to finalize the development of DARTNA. During year 2, a randomized
      controlled will be conducted among 30 AI/ANs receiving the DARTNA treatment protocol vs. 30
      AI/ANs receiving treatment-as-usual at United American Indian Involvement, Inc. in Los
      Angeles.
