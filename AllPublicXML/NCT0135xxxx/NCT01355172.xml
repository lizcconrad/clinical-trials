  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to each of the three influenza
      vaccine strains included in the seasonal flu vaccine(AdimFlu-S), as measured by
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) at 4 weeks after two doses of study vaccine, 4 weeks apart,
      in infants between 6 and 12 months of age.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HA antibody titers will be determined using the WHO HAI reference technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>Serum samples will be obtained prior to vaccination (baseline), and 4 weeks after each vaccination.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles including the presence or absence of the pre-specified reactogenicity events and other serious/non-serious adverse events of the AdimFlu-S manufactured by Adimmune Corporation.</measure>
    <time_frame>(4 weeks after two doses of study vaccine, 4 weeks apart), Physical examination will be performed at each visit. Reactogenicity will be recorded for 7 days after each vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety data will consist of reactogenicity, serious and non-serious adverse events. Reactogenicity events are pre-specified adverse events systematically recorded for 7 days after each vaccination.
The events included fever (≥38.0°C), runny nose or nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, vomiting, nausea and malaise. Furthermore, the local (injection site) reactions were also evaluated, including soreness/pain, swelling, redness, ecchymosis and limitation of arm motion.</description>
