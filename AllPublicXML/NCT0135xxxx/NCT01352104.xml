      Investigating effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral based teacher training under routine
      care conditions by comparison of a baseline-interval with no special intervention to a
      following interval of PEP for the kindergarten teachers only each focussing on one child (3-6
      years old) that the teacher herself indicated as &quot;needing special attention for externalising
      behaviour&quot;. Effects on child symptoms and teachers behavior and burden within
      intervention-period are expected to be stronger than those during waiting-period.

      Findings of the PEP-efficacy-study based on a randomised controlled sampling ((ISRCTN
      CCT-NAPN-18918) using combined training-modules for parents and teachers showed positive
      effects on children's behaviour in the intervention-group. These effects in teacher's view
      were stronger than in the control-group but could not be proved to be statistically
      significant. Moreover after this first step of evaluation there remain unanswered questions
      concerning the stability of effects after transferring the program in routine care. Therefore
      the study is continued by an effectiveness-study.

    <description>PEP-TE for kindergarten teachers of children with externalizing behaviour problems aged 3 to 6 years leads to use classical strategies of changing behaviour (defining rules, appropriate commands, positive and negative consequences) based on the &quot;coercive interaction process&quot; (cf. Patterson, 1982) as explanatory model for target situations. In 10 units (90-120 minutes) four to six teachers in one group develop individually tailored solutions to specified externalizing behavior problems of the target child. General strategies of improving positive interactions as well as resources and strategies for reducing stress and gaining new energy are discussed. Summary and reflection of the teacher' experiences and ideas of changes in routines prevents relapses.</description>
