  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to compare the accuracy of the existing colonoscope model to determine
      the magnitude of the improvement the investigators can expect in polyp discrimination as
      neoplastic or non-neoplastic.

    <measure>Accuracy of In Vivo determination of colorectal polyps histopathology</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Compare accuracy of current colonoscope to improved colonoscope for discrimination of polyps as neoplastic versus non-neoplastic. The accuracies of the two approaches will be compared via logistic regression model with the significance of the difference in the accuracies assessed via generalized estimating equation approach to take account of the possible dependence introduced by inclusion of mulitple polyps per patient.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity and specificity of In Vivo discrimination of colorectal polyp histopathology in white light and narrow band imaging modes.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Estimate the sensitivity and specificity in high definition mode for distinguishing neoplastic from none neoplastic lesions. Sensitivity and specificity will be estimated using the logistic regression approach as above; 95% confidence intervals will be obtained by transforming confidence intervals on the logs odds scale.</description>
