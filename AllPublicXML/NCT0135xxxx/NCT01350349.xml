  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among older adults the combination of depression, cognitive impairment (memory problems), and
      disability contribute to a worsening of physical and mental health and to poor treatment
      outcomes. Antidepressants help fewer than 40% of depressed elders with memory problems
      achieve remission from their depression. Interventions involving talking therapy are
      underdeveloped and understudied. Therefore, this research study will test the efficacy of
      Problem Adaptation Therapy (PATH), a new home-delivered psychosocial intervention for elders
      with major depression, memory problems, and disability. PATH focuses on the subject's
      &quot;ecosystem&quot; (the patient, the caregiver, and the home-environment) and targets behavioral
      problems related to both depression and disability.

      PATH is delivered in a subject's home, where cognitively impaired, disabled elders face most
      of their difficulties. Local Home Delivered Meals programs will refer clients who have
      symptoms of depression and are interested in research. All participants will have an
      available caregiver (family, significant other, or professional) and will be randomized to 12
      weekly sessions of PATH or Supportive Therapy, the current standard of care for talking
      therapy. The study will test whether home-delivered PATH is more effective than
      home-delivered Supportive Therapy in reducing the subjects' depression and disability and in
      increasing self-efficacy over the 12-week treatment period.

      Depression, cognitive impairment and disability often coexist in older adults and contribute
      to medical and psychiatric morbidity and mortality. We developed and propose to test the
      efficacy of a new psychosocial intervention, Problem Adaptation Therapy (PATH), for patients
      with major depression, cognitive impairment (up to the level of mild to moderate dementia)
      and disability. The proposed R01 study meets a critical need of this population, i.e. a
      treatment alternative for patients in whom antidepressants may have limited efficacy and for
      whom psychosocial interventions are underdeveloped and understudied.

      The principal innovation of PATH is its personalized approach focusing on the patient's
      ecosystem (i.e. the patient, the caregiver, and the home-environment) and targeting
      behavioral problems related to both depression and disability. PATH is delivered at the
      patients' home, teaches the patient-caregiver dyad problem-solving skills, and incorporates
      environmental adaptations (including notes, signs, reminders, calendars, voice alarms) to
      improve the patient's functioning.
