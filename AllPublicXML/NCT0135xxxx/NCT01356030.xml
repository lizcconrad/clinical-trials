    <textblock>
      The two most commonly used methods to biopsy suspected pancreaticobiliary masses are (1)
      endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and (2) cytology brush biopsies
      obtained during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). At most centers, the
      specific method used depends on the availability of the technology and local expertise.
      Although it is believed that EUS-FNA is more accurate than ERCP brushings, there have been no
      head-to-head comparisons. The investigators' hypothesis is that EUS-FNA is superior to ERCP
      in obtaining tissue biopsies of pancreaticobiliary tumors, and the investigators aim to
      directly compare the two techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreaticobiliary tumors usually present with painless jaundice due to bile
      duct obstruction. The standard clinical evaluation may include EUS and/or ERCP. At centers
      where EUS is available (like CPMC), it is usually used first as it is generally considered a
      better tool for tumor detection, staging, and performing biopsies (FNA). ERCP is then
      performed, if needed, to place a stent and relieve jaundice. As EUS is a relatively newer
      technology that has not widely disseminated, other centers use ERCP as the 1st modality to
      evaluate suspected malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction. The role of ERCP in this setting
      is to not only place a stent to relieve jaundice, but to additionally obtain cytology
      brushings for tissue diagnosis.

      Several studies have reported high sensitivity of EUS-FNA for detecting pancreaticobiliary
      cancers that are causing bile duct obstruction and jaundice (80-90%). The sensitivity for
      ERCP brushings and biopsies to detect the same types of tumors is reportedly lower (30-80%),
      but there have been no direct comparisons of these techniques.

      Few centers use both technologies (EUS and ERCP) for patient care, or often perform EUS and
      ERCP at separate sessions. At CPMC, the investigators routinely perform EUS and ERCP together
      for patients needing these procedures. Thus the investigators are in a unique position to
      directly compare EUS-FNA to ERCP brushings for tissue diagnosis of suspected
      pancreaticobiliary tumors.

      The proposed study will be the 1st direct comparison of EUS-FNA to ERCP tissue sampling for
      patients with suspected pancreaticobiliary cancers. Study results will highlight the best
      approach to obtain a biopsy diagnosis of pancreatic and biliary tract cancers.

    <description>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is usually clinically indicated to place a stent (a plastic or metal tube) in the bile duct. The ERCP procedure is an endoscopic exam during which a small catheter or wire is placed into the bile duct from the point at which it connects to the small intestine. During such a procedure a stent can then be placed to help drain the bile across the site of blockage, and thereby treat your jaundice.</description>

    <description>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a procedure in which a flexible tube with a tiny camera and ultrasound probe at the tip is placed through the mouth, down the esophagus, and into the stomach and duodenum (first part of the small intestine where bile flows from the bile duct into the intestine). This allows the doctor performing the EUS to get a much closer view of your pancreas and bile duct. If a suspicious mass is seen, a small sample of the mass (biopsy) is taken using fine needle aspiration (FNA). FNA involves the use of a thin hollow needle to extract cells for diagnostic purposes and is considered safer and less invasive than surgical biopsies.</description>
