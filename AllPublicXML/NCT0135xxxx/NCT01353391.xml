    <textblock>
      Insulin is the standard treatment for the management of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy, however
      despite treatment with insulin, these women continue to face increased rates of adverse
      maternal and fetal outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that metformin use, in addition to
      treatment with insulin, will help with blood sugar control, lower the dose of insulin needed,
      lower weight gain, and improve baby outcomes.

      Type 2 diabetes in pregnancy is increasing in prevalence and these women continue to face
      increased rates of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that
      metformin use, as an adjunct to insulin, will decrease these adverse outcomes by reducing
      maternal hyperglycemia, high maternal insulin doses, excessive maternal weight gain and
      gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia, all of which should reduce perinatal and neonatal
      mortality and morbidity. In addition, since metformin crosses the placenta, metformin
      treatment of the fetus may have a direct beneficial effect on neonatal outcomes. This study
      is an randomized controlled trial (RCT) that adds metformin to insulin, and is a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT. The investigators believe that neither metformin alone
      nor insulin alone will effectively treat this population, and therefore our design, which
      includes the addition of metformin to insulin, will be the most relevant to our patients.

               -  1 fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L and 1 HbA1c ≥ 0.065 (6.5%) performed in a

               -  1 fasting glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L and 1 two hour (2 hr) ≥ 11.1 on a 75 g Oral
                  Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), or

               -  1 HbA1C ≥0.065 (6.5%) performed in a laboratory using a method that is
                  standardized to the DCCT assay and 1 two hour (2 hr) ≥ 11.1 on a 75 g OGTT.

          3. Pregnancy gestation between 6+0-22+6 weeks.

          4. Live singleton fetus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are not on insulin. Women who are on oral hypoglycemic agents will be taken
             off at the start of the trial and started on insulin prior to randomization.

          2. Diabetes diagnosed after 20 weeks gestation.

          3. Type 1 diabetes.

          4. Known intolerance to metformin.

          5. Contraindications to metformin use which include:

        (i). Renal insufficiency (defined as serum creatinine of greater than 130 µmol/L or
        creatinine clearance &lt;60 ml/min) , (ii). Moderate to severe liver dysfunction (defined as
        liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) greater
        than 3 times the upper limit of normal), (iii). Shock or sepsis, and (iv.) Previous
        hypersensitivity to metformin.

        f. Women with significant gastrointestinal problems such as severe vomiting requiring IV
        fluids or hospitalization, or active Crohn's or colitis.

        g. Previous participation in the trial. h. Women who have a fetus with a known potentially
        lethal anomaly will be excluded. Information regarding congenital anomalies diagnosed after
        randomization will be recorded.

        i. Known higher order pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc). These women will be excluded as
        they have a higher rate of adverse outcomes and we want to avoid any inequalities if they
        are unequally distributed between the groups.

        j. Presence of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis.

        k. History of diabetic ketoacidosis or history of lactic acidosis. l. Presence of excessive
        alcohol intake, acute or chronic. m. Presence of congestive heart failure or history of
        congestive heart failure.
