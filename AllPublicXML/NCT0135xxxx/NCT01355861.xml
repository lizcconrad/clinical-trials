      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits of negative work progressive
      resistance exercise (PRE) for the conservative management of sarcopenia in older male
      Veterans at the DC VAMC. Efficacy will be assessed by examining post-exercise changes in
      metabolic and inflammatory markers, muscle morphology, strength, and functional status.

      The chief aim of this protocol is to determine the efficacy of negative work progressive
      resistance exercise (PRE) in the management of sarcopenia in older male Veterans at the DC
      VAMC. This proposed study is a randomized clinical trial using a single-arm, delayed
      cross-over design with repeated measures. This method is a patient-first approach to clinical
      research that permits all participants to receive the intervention while allowing the
      investigators to conduct both within subjects and between subjects comparisons with a modest
      study enrollment. During the &quot;pre-treatment period&quot; we will recruit, screen, and consent 30
      older men with sarcopenia. The participants will be randomized into two groups: active
      treatment and delayed treatment. The initial &quot;active treatment&quot; and &quot;delayed treatment&quot;
      periods will last 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the participants in the delayed treatment group
      will crossover (without a washout period) and start 12 weeks of intervention. All
      participants will detrain and be monitored for follow up during their respective 12-week
      &quot;post treatment&quot; period. Outcome measures include post-exercise changes in metabolic and
      inflammatory markers, muscle morphology, strength, and functional status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adult, ambulatory males &gt; 60 years old (n=30) will be recruited for this proposed study.
        Participant inclusion criteria also includes having clinically significant sarcopenia based
        on the body composition assessment showing an aLM that is &lt; 2 SD below the mean values of a
        young adult reference group using DEXA scanning.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria include BMI scores &gt; 30 or a Mini-Mental Status exam score of &lt; 22. The
        second tier of screening will include the following blood tests, obtained between 8-9 AM,
        following a 12-hour overnight fast: CBC, routine chemistry profile (e.g., glucose, kidney
        and liver function tests). Veterans with an elevated fasting blood glucose by WHO criteria
        (FBG &gt;110 mg/dl), triglyceride levels &gt; 200 mg/dL, and/or known DM, or abnormalities of
        other routine blood tests (i.e., &gt; 2 SD beyond normal) will be excluded from the study.
        Uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, non-ambulatory status, evidence of a major disease
        exacerbation over the last six months, and current participation in a supervised exercise
        program (minimum of three months, twice per week) would also preclude participation in this
        study.
