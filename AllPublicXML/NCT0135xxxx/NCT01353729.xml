  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 healthy subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will participate in the
      study for approximately 9 weeks. There will be four treatment sequences with a 5-7 day
      washout between treatments. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day-1 of each
      dosing period and will remain in the unit until Day 2. Each subject will receive a single
      dose of each of the four treatments on Day 1 of each treatment period in a randomized
      fashion. Subjects will be discharged from the clinical research unit after the completion of
      all assessments on Day 2 of each period and return approximately 5-7 days later for the next
      dose period. Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected for up to 24 hours following
      each treatment.

             of cholecystectomy, inflammatory bowel disease or pancreatitis should be excluded.
             Subjects with active peptic ulcer disease or a history of upper gastrointestinal
             bleeding
