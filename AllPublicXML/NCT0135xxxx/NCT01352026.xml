  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of PAH includes exercise limitation, non specific agents (anticoagulants, diuretics
      and supplemental oxygen), pulmonary specific vasodilators and antiproliferative agents.

      Recent data obtained by our group, within rat PAH models, showed that the antihyperglycemic
      drug metformin, used in France since 1959 in diabetic type II patients, significantly acts at
      the pulmonary arteries level.

      According to these results, and knowing that metformin is a widely used drug, with a
      favorable safety profile, the investigators decided to set up a pilot study, in order to
      evaluate the activity of metformin in PAH treatment. In parallel, the investigators will
      focus on metformin mechanism of action.
