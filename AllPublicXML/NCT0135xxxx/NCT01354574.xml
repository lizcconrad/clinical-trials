  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if consumption of meals containing carbohydrates
      with different glycemic index (a high glycemic index meal and a low glycemic index meal)have
      different effects on energy expenditure, type of metabolic fuels used for energy, blood
      lipids and lipoproteins, and sensations of hunger, fullness, and the hormones related to
      satiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the metabolic effects of chronic dieting and weight cycling in humans,
      but limited evidence suggests that fatty acid oxidation may be depressed leading to periodic
      elevation of circulating lipids associated with meal ingestion and preferential storage of
      fat in adipose tissue. With the traditional approach of restrictive dieting failing to result
      in permanent weight loss and, possibly producing abnormalities in lipid metabolism, it is
      important to evaluate alternative approaches to achieve a healthy body weight through
      improved metabolism. In this study the investigators will test the postprandial metabolic
      effects of standard mixed meals containing carbohydrates with high glycemic index and compare
      these effects to responses obtained with standard mixed meals, matched for protein and fat
      content but containing carbohydrates with low glycemic index.
