  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aortic valve is the main outlet valve from the heart. This valve can become diseased and
      narrowed when it needs to be replaced with an artificial valve. Currently, this is the
      commonest reason for someone to undergo a heart valve operation in the UK. Unfortunately,
      there are no medical treatments that can prevent or delay the progression of this disease
      process. Here, the investigators propose to use new state-of-the-art imaging techniques to
      better understand the disease process so that the investigators can effectively design and
      assess potential new treatments. The ultimate aim is to stop this disease before patients
      need to have surgery. In addition the investigators believe this technique will allow us to
      predict the rate of progression of the disease

      Aortic stenosis is the commonest valvular heart disease in the western world and is the
      leading indication for valve surgery. Histological studies have suggested similarities with
      atherosclerosis including inflammation, lipid deposition, increased macrophage activity and
      calcification. However, recent randomised controlled trials have failed to demonstrate a
      reduction in the rate of disease progression with statin therapy and the investigators
      believe there is now a need to re-evaluate the underlying factors involved in the initiation
      and progression of aortic stenosis. The investigators propose to assess the role of
      inflammation and calcification in the pathogenesis and progression of aortic stenosis by
      using positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose and [18F-]-fluoride in
      patients with a range of aortic valve disease. The investigators hypothesise that increasing
      severity of valvular inflammation and calcification will correlate with disease severity and
      rate of disease progression. This work will lay the foundation for the subsequent application
      of interventions targeted at inflammation and calcification.
