  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the REACT project is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
      implications of interventions designed to improve health worker practice in providing
      treatment for uncomplicated malaria to febrile patients attending health facilities in
      Cameroon and Nigeria.

      Two interventions will be evaluated: (i) provider intervention including introducing RDTs
      with detailed instructions, one-off training, job aides and on-the-site supportive
      supervisory visits and (ii) combined provider intervention [as under (i)]and community-based
      intervention (using primary and secondary schools as focal points)including school malaria
      events with drama, peer-health education, distribution of health education materials. Types
      of facilities include: public primary health facilities, private pharmacies and private
      Patent Medicine Dealers (PMDs)in Enugu State. The two sites in Enugu State are: Enugu urban
      (comprising of Enugu East, Enugu South and Enugu North Local government areas (LGA) and Udi
      LGA. The impact of the interventions will be evaluated using a 3-arm stratified, cluster
      randomized trial with a cluster defined as a geographical community and the two study sites
      as the strata. The three arms of the trial are:

        -  Intervention - Provider intervention

        -  Intervention - Provider plus school-based malaria activities

        -  Control - Expected practice (once RDTs have been introduced)

      CAMEROON

      Two interventions will be evaluated: (i) the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
      with basic provider training on malaria diagnosis and treatment; and (ii) the basic provider
      training [as under (i)] plus enhanced provider training to improve the quality of care that
      includes aspects of interactive self awareness, communication modules between health workers
      and also between health workers and patients. Types of facilities include: public district
      hospitals, public health centres (including integrated health centres), mission hospitals and
      mission health centres (including integrated health centres)in Yaound√© and Bamenda Health
      Districts. A stratified, cluster randomized trial will be used in which health facilities are
      the cluster and the two study sites are the strata. The three arms of the trial are:

        -  Intervention - RDTs with basic provider training;

        -  Intervention - RDTs with basic plus enhanced provider training;

        -  Control - which represents current practice and neither intervention will be
           implemented.

    <description>Cameroon: Introduce malaria RDTs with basic provider training and job aids on malaria diagnosis and treatment. This involved 1-day training on: 1) Malaria Diagnosis; 2) Rapid Diagnostic Testing; 3) Malaria Treatment. These modules explain that all febrile patients should be tested for malaria; procedures for using an RDT; that confirmed cases of uncomplicated malaria should be treated with an ACT; and test-negative patients should not be given an antimalarial.
Nigeria: Introduce malaria RDTs with provider training and job aids on malaria diagnosis and treatment. This involved a 2-day training workshop and support visits. The training covered the following topics: causes and symptoms of malaria; demonstration on how to use an RDT; updated malaria guidelines; and communications skills. The training used a combination of seminars and facilitated small-group work, such as a treatment algorithm game, problem-solving exercises, self-developed participatory drama and role-playing.</description>

    <description>Cameroon: Introduce malaria RDTs with basic provider training and job aids on malaria diagnosis and treatment AND enhanced provider training on improving quality of care. Clinicians received 3-days of training: the first day was identical to the basic intervention, while the remainder of the course covered three additional modules targeting improvements in quality of care: 4) Adapting to Change; 5) Professionalism; 6) Communicating Effectively.
Nigeria: Introduce malaria RDTs with provider training and job aids on malaria diagnosis and treatment AND School-based malaria education intervention (with drama, peer-health education and distribution of health education materials). In addition, teachers and Peer Health Educators were offered support to hold malaria events in which parents, guardians, and other community members could participate in the same types of activities.</description>
