    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of hemoglobin A1c in diabetic
      wound healing. Additionally, a comparison of two wound dressings, AmeriGel® (Amerx Health
      Care Corp., Clearwater, FL) and Bacitracin, with and without vitamin C supplementation, will
      be done to evaluate impact on time to wound closure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study evaluating the relationship of hemoglobin
      A1c in diabetic wound healing. Length of time for wound closure will be compared using four
      treatment options.
