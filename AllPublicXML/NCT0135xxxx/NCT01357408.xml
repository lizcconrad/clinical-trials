      The purpose of the Heart Failure and Risk of re-Admissions Determined by Abnormal REVEAL
      Parameters (HF RADAR) study is to evaluate the ability of cardiac rhythm (Cardiac Compass)
      data to predict future cardiac events in heart failure (HF) patients recently discharged
      after a hospitalization for heart failure who have or plan to have a implanted loop recorder
      (ILR), specifically, the Reveal XT device. The study will enroll 40 HF patients (with LV
      function ≥ 40%) admitted to an acute care facility (observation status or hospital stay) for
      heart failure who either have a Reveal XT device in place or plan to have the ILR device
      inserted for clinical indication within 14 days of discharge from the hospitalization. HF
      patients will be followed for 6 months. Device date will be captured during normal clinic
      visits and at 6 months.
