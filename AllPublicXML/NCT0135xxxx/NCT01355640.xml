      1. The purpose of this study is to research and compare two sucking modes'
           effect(breast-feeding and non-nutritive sucking) and difference,hypothesis is that these
           two kinds of methods can decrease pain for Chinese term infants receiving heel stick.

        2. A convenient sample of 90 neonates from a hospital in Beijing undergoing heel stick for
           Newborn Screening Program Blood Test were enrolled. They were randomized into three
           groups:

             -  breast-feeding group

             -  non-nutritive sucking group

             -  control group

        3. The results showed that:

             -  Breast-feeding can reduce crying and grimace time, increase oxygen saturation.

             -  Non-nutritive sucking can delay grimace's starting time, increase oxygen
                saturation.

      Untreated pain will also cause long term impact on newborns,Some scientists in foreign
      countries have done some research on rats, they found that if rats were exposed to pain for a
      long time, its nociception neural circuit's development will be harmed, and the pain
      threshold will be lowered. For newborns, untreated pain will cause hypalgesia when they are
      in puberty and hyperalgesia after adulthood. The experience of pain in infancy also affects
      the babies' later life after they grow up, it may cause emotional problems, minimal brain
      dysfunction, social intercourse defect and so on. So it is very important to find out useful
      interventions to decrease pain in newborns, considering the long term impact and side effect
      of medicine, it is seldom to use medical interventions to decrease pain. Non-pharmacological
      interventions become quite important. In foreign countries, there have been kinds of useful
      non-pharmacological interventions such as kangaroo care, breast-feeding, sucrose and
      non-nutritive sucking. While in China, there are massage, positioning, sucrose, music and
      kangaroo care that proved to be effective to decrease pain in newborns. The investigators
      find few reports about breastfeeding or non-nutritive sucking's effect of decreasing pain in
      term newborns. For breast-feeding, it includes the nursing mother who has consoling impact,
      hugging, attention transferring, taste, the breast milk contains tryptophane, which is the
      precursor of N-acetyl-5-O-T that can raise up the density of β-endorphin, β-endorphin has
      analgesic effect. For non-nutritive sucking, it also contains attention transferring. It is
      said that non-nutritive sucking can raise up the pain threshold through stimulating the oral
      tactile recipient, or promote the releasing of 5-HT that modulates pain. Non-nutritive
      sucking can also lower the sensitivity of peripheral nerves.

    <description>Mothers lay on the side of the bed comfortably with their infants in their arms after the infants' soiled diapers were changed. Mothers breast-fed their babies. The study was initiated when the infants were observed to have a large amount of areola in their mouth, with flanged lips and active jaw movements. Then two minutes after the breast-feeding, an experienced technician began to do heel lance, heel lance was given by the same experienced technician.Mothers breast-fed their babies two minutes before, during and eight minutes after the heel lance. Throughout the whole procedure, mothers were encouraged to continue breast-feeding when the babies stopped sucking and/or began to cry.</description>

    <description>Mothers lay on the side of the bed comfortably with their infants in their arms after the infants' soiled diapers were changed. Each mother in this group was given a vacuum pacifier( the brand is &quot;Goodbaby&quot;) to console her baby. Heel lance was given by the same experienced technician. The study was initiated when the infants can suck the pacifier and hold it by himself without others' help. This generally requires half or one minute. Then two minutes after non-nutritive sucking, an experienced technician began to do heel lance. Babies sucked the pacifier two minutes before, during and eight minutes after heel lance. Throughout the whole procedure, mothers were encouraged to continue non-nutritive sucking when the babies stopped sucking and/or began to cry.</description>
