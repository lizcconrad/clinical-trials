  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has three parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of ASP9521. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and tolerability and initial
      anti-tumor activity of ASP9521. Part 3 of the study will be a Food Effect study.

      The purpose of the first study part is to investigate the safety and tolerability of ASP9521
      in patients with Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer. This will be done at different doses,
      starting at the lowest dose up to higher doses to find the maximum dose that is tolerated.

      The second part will investigate the safety and tolerability and evaluate initial anti-tumor
      activity of ASP9521. This will be done at multiple doses which are identified in part 1 to
      potentially be effective. The number of patients in part 2 will be higher number compared to
      part I.

      The third part of the study will investigate the effect of food on the drug in patients; this
      will be a crossover design fed to fasted and vice versa.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine
             differentiation or small cell features

          -  Metastatic disease documented by 2 or more bone lesions on bone scan or by soft tissue
             disease observed by Computed tomography/Magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI)

          -  Ongoing androgen deprivation with Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)
             agonist/antagonist therapy or bilateral orchiectomy. For patients who have not had an
             orchiectomy, there must be a plan to maintain effective LHRH agonist/antagonist
             therapy for the duration of the study

          -  Serum testosterone &lt;1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) at screening

          -  Patients receiving bisphosphonates or other approved bone targeting therapy must have
             been on stable doses for at least 4 weeks prior to screening

          -  Progressive disease at study entry defined as one or more of the following 3 criteria
             occurring in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone:

               -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression defined by a minimum of 2 rising PSA
                  levels with an interval of &gt;1 week between each determination. The PSA value at
                  screening should be &gt;2 ng/mL

               -  Soft tissue disease progression defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
                  Tumors (RECIST). Measurable disease is not required for entry. Lymph nodes &gt;20 mm
                  are considered measurable disease

               -  Bone disease progression defined by at least 2 new lesions on bone scan

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;6 months according to the investigator's judgment

          -  Chemotherapy-Naïve patients should be asymptomatic or controlled symptomatic patients
             with metastatic CRPC who have failed one or more lines of hormonal treatment/androgen
             deprivation therapy but have not received chemotherapy or have refused chemotherapy.
             Post chemotherapy patients should have received not more than two prior regimens of
             chemotherapy for prostate cancer, of which one is docetaxel-based

                  inhibitors, androgens (e.g., testosterone), cytoproterone acetate and all other
                  progestational agents, estrogens, and flutamide within 4 weeks prior to screening

               -  Bicalutamide or nilutamide within 6 weeks prior to screening

               -  Treatment with estramustine

               -  Treatment with abiraterone

          -  Radiation therapy for treatment of the prostate within 3 months prior to screening

          -  Radiation therapy for the treatment of metastases within 3 weeks (if single fraction
             of radiotherapy then within 2 weeks) and radionuclide therapy for the treatment of
             metastases within 4 weeks prior to screening

          -  Major surgery within 2 months prior to screening
