      Hypothesis: Primary long full coverage stenting is superior to primary short spot stenting in
      the treatment of long (≥80 mm) femoropopliteal artery lesions.

      Study design :

        -  Prospective, randomized, multi-center study

        -  A total of 220 subjects with symptomatic peripheral artery disease of lower limbs who
           meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included.

        -  Patients will be randomized in a two by two factorial manner according to the strategy
           of stenting (long versus short stenting) and the additional use of cilostazol. Each
           randomization of the enrolled subjects will be done 1:1.

        -  Patients will be followed clinically for 1 year after the procedure.

        -  Angiographic or CT follow-up will be performed at 1 year.
