      This is a Phase 1C randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded, in-patient trial of a
      single oral dose of 300 mg of SQ109 given daily for 14 consecutive days to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SQ109 in normal healthy male and female subjects
      18-45 years of age.

      Each subject will receive 300 mg of SQ109 or placebo.

             related procedure is performed.

          -  If female, has no childbearing potential or agrees to avoid becoming pregnant from the
             day of screening through their entire participation in the trial (Day 28) by using one
             of the following acceptable methods of birth control plus recommended use of a barrier
             method (condom) by the male partner (even if vasectomized):

               1. intrauterine contraceptive device; or

               2. diaphragm in combination with contraceptive jelly, cream, or foam; or

               3. spermicide; or

               4. abstinence. Non-childbearing potential is defined as being post-menopausal for at
                  least 2 years, status after bilateral tubal ligation for at least 1 year, status
                  after bilateral oophorectomy or status after hysterectomy.

        Hormonal contraceptives of any type or form (including oral, transdermal, vaginal or depot
        preparations) will not be allowed during the study.

          -  All female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test at screening and within 24 hours of the first dose of study product.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use an acceptable barrier method for birth control
             (abstinence or use of a condom with spermicide) from screening through Study Day 28
             and advice and recommend use of additional birth control (as in criterion 6 above) to
             female sex partners throughout the study.

          -  Subject agrees not to donate blood during the study and up to 30 days after Study Day
             28.

          -  Subject agrees to comply with all study requirements, including clinic house rules.

             Investigator (PI), would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity
             of the study results.

          -  Subject has been on an abnormal diet during the 4 weeks preceding the study. Abnormal
             diet is defined as a diet in which the subject has a significant change in eating

          -  Subject has used any prescription medication within 14 days prior to Day 1 of the
             study, or the use of hormonal preparations containing sex hormones within 30 days

             death.

             current optic neuritis or known retinal disease.

          -  Subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness (i.e., active infection) or fever
             (oral temperature &gt;/=100 degrees F or &gt;/= 37.7 degrees C).
