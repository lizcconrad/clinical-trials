    <description>The recombinant Phleum (rPhleum) allergen cocktail is prepared by mixing equivalent volumes of each single allergen adsorbate. The recombinant Phleum (rPhleum) allergen cocktail contains Phleum pratense (Phl p) allergens: Type 1, 2, 5 and 6 at equimolar quatities. The total protein concentration in the highest strength is 200μg protein per 1mL aluminium hydroxide suspension.</description>

The subcutaneous injections will be administered at intervals of 7 (+ 7 days)during up-titration. For maintenance the injection intervals are prolonged to 4 weeks (+2). The double blind treatment period is 2 years, followed by 1 year open-label treatment for patients previously treated with verum and 3 years open-label treatment for patients previously recieved placebo.</description>
