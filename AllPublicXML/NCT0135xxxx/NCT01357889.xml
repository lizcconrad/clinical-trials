    <textblock>
      The first part of the study includes a single dose treatment period to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of a subcutaneous injection of albiglutide from process 2 drug
      substance compared with process 3 drug substance. The second part of the treatment period
      will evaluate additional pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and safety and
      tolerability of repeat doses of albiglutide given weekly for 12 weeks from process 2 drug
      substance compared with process 3 drug substance. Subjects with type 2 diabetes whose
      glycemia is inadequately controlled on their current regimen of diet and exercise or stable
      dose of metformin will be recruited into the study.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 2 parallel group study. The first part of
      the treatment period will evaluate the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of a single dose of a
      subcutaneous injection of 30mg of albiglutide from process 2 drug substance compared with
      process 3 drug substance. The second part of the treatment period will evaluate additional
      pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic parameters, immunogenicity, effects on
      glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose, and safety and tolerability of repeat
      doses of subcutaneous injections of 30mg of albiglutide given weekly for 12 weeks from
      process 2 drug substance compared with process 3 drug substance. Subjects with type 2
      diabetes whose glycemia is inadequately controlled on their current regimen of diet and
      exercise or stable dose of metformin will be recruited into the study.

    <time_frame>Pre-dose at Baseline; 24 hours (hr), 48 hr, 96 hr, 216 hr, 312 hr, 480 hr, and 672 hr post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the bioequivalence of the two formulations of albiglutide, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect was applied to the natural-log-transformed parameter AUC(0-inf) estimated from the BE Phase. AUC is a measure of how much albiglutide is in the blood at certain time points. The Process 2 treatment group (albiglutide derived from process 2) was the reference group and was compared with the Process 3 treatment group (albiglutide derived from process 3) as the test group (i.e., treatment comparisons based on the ratio of Process 3:Process 2). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected prior to dosing at Baseline and 24 hours (hr), 48 hr, 96 hr, 120 hr, 216 hr, 312 hr, 480 hr, and 672 hr after administration of the Baseline study medication.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 17</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 17</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. This analysis used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for missing post-Baseline HbA1c values. HbA1c values obtained after hyperglycemic rescue were treated as missing and replaced with pre-rescue values. Baseline is defined as the last available assessment on or prior to the day on which the first dose of study drug was received. Based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA): Change = treatment + Baseline HbA1c + age category + weight category + background antidiabetic therapy category.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The enrollment number reflects the 283 participants starting the Multiple-dose Phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was comprised of a Screening Period (up to 2 weeks), a Run-in Period (4 weeks), a Treatment Period (TP: 17 weeks), and a Follow-up (8 weeks) Period. The TP had a Single-dose Phase (Bioequivalence [BE] Phase: 28 days) and a 12-week Multiple-dose Phase. In the BE Phase, 186 participants were randomized; 167 received &gt;=1 treatment dose.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Albiglutide Process 2</title>
          <description>During the BE Phase, participants received a single dose of albiglutide 30 milligrams (mg) from the Process 2 drug product, injected subcutaneously into the abdomen using a fixed-dose, prefilled, single-use injector pen. After completing the BE phase, participants progressed into the Multiple-dose Phase of the study, beginning at Week 5, during which participants received 12 weekly injections of albiglutide 30 mg from the Process 2 drug product, injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, alternating between the right and left sides of the body, using a fixed-dose, prefilled, single-use injector pen. Additional participants (other than those completing the BE Phase and progressing to the Multiple-dose Phase) were randomized into the Multiple-dose Phase of the study. All participants returned for the 8-week post-treatment follow-up visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 17</title>
        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. This analysis used the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method for missing post-Baseline HbA1c values. HbA1c values obtained after hyperglycemic rescue were treated as missing and replaced with pre-rescue values. Baseline is defined as the last available assessment on or prior to the day on which the first dose of study drug was received. Based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA): Change = treatment + Baseline HbA1c + age category + weight category + background antidiabetic therapy category.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From the Screening Assessment in Physical Examination at Week 17</title>
        <description>A complete physical examination was performed at Screening and at Week 17 and included evaluation of the following organ or body systems: skin (including injection site); head; eyes; ears, sose, and throat (ENT); thyroid; respiratory system; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver, spleen); lymph nodes; central nervous system (CNT); and extremities. The assessment was categorized as improved, no change, worsened, and not done.</description>

            <description>During the BE Phase, participants received a single dose of albiglutide 30 mg from the Process 2 drug product, injected subcutaneously into the abdomen using a fixed-dose, prefilled, single-use injector pen. After completing the BE phase, participants progressed into the Multiple-dose Phase of the study, beginning at Week 5, during which participants received 12 weekly injections of albiglutide 30 mg from the Process 2 drug product, injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, alternating between the right and left sides of the body, using a fixed-dose, prefilled, single-use injector pen. Additional participants (other than those completing the BE Phase and progressing to the Multiple-dose Phase) were randomized into the Multiple-dose Phase of the study. All participants returned for the 8-week post-treatment follow-up visit.</description>

        <description>ECG parameters include heart rate, QRS interval, QTinterval, QT interval – Bazett correction (QTcB), QT interval – Fridericia correction (QTcF), RR interval, and PR interval. Criteria for values of potential concern were determined by the medical monitors. For the QRS interval, an increase of &gt;25% when Baseline QRS &gt;100 milliseconds (msec) and an increase of &gt;50% when Baseline QRS &lt;=100 msec was considered to be of clinical concern. For QTcF, a &gt;=60 msec change from Baseline was considered to be of clinical concern. For the PR interval, an increase of &gt;25% when Baseline PR &gt;200 msec and an increase of &gt;50% when Baseline PR &lt;=200 msec was considered to be of clinical concern.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to Infinity (0-inf) of Albiglutide in the Bioequivalence (BE) Phase</title>
        <description>To assess the bioequivalence of the two formulations of albiglutide, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect was applied to the natural-log-transformed parameter AUC(0-inf) estimated from the BE Phase. AUC is a measure of how much albiglutide is in the blood at certain time points. The Process 2 treatment group (albiglutide derived from process 2) was the reference group and was compared with the Process 3 treatment group (albiglutide derived from process 3) as the test group (i.e., treatment comparisons based on the ratio of Process 3:Process 2). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected prior to dosing at Baseline and 24 hours (hr), 48 hr, 96 hr, 120 hr, 216 hr, 312 hr, 480 hr, and 672 hr after administration of the Baseline study medication.</description>

          <title>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Albiglutide in the BE Phase</title>
          <description>To assess the bioequivalence of the two formulations of study drug, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect was applied to the natural-log-transformed parameter Cmax estimated from the BE phase. The Process 2 treatment group (albiglutide derived from process 2) was the reference group and was compared with the Process 3 treatment group (albiglutide derived from process 3) as the test group (i.e., treatment comparisons based on the ratio of Process 3:Process 2). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected prior to dosing at Baseline and 24 hours (hr), 48 hr, 96 hr, 120 hr, 216 hr, 312 hr, 480 hr, and 672 hr after administration of the Baseline study medication.</description>
