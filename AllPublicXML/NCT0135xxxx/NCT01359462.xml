    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions and
      safety of Tolvaptan tablets administered orally (15 mg daily) for consecutively 7 days in
      Chinese adult patients with confirmed Child-Pugh Class B（score 7-9） hepatocirrhosis
      (accompanied by ascites).

      Trial Design:

        1. Open, single-center, multi-dose pharmacokinetics study

        2. Study population:

           Chinese adult patients with confirmed Child-Pugh Class B (score 7-9) hepatocirrhosis
           (accompanied by ascites)

        3. Dosage and mode of administration of investigational product:

           Oral administration of 1 tablet (15mg) once daily, for consecutive 7 days starting from
           day 1 of treatment.

        4. Study duration:

      Screening: 14 days in maximum; Treatment(s): 7 days; Observation: 1 day
