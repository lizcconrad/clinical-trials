    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate effectiveness and safety of everolimus-eluting
      stents (XIENCE, Abbott) in the &quot;real world&quot; daily practice as compared with first-generation
      drug-eluting stents (sirolimus-eluting stents).

    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, open-label registry to compare the efficacy and safety of
      everolimus-eluting stents versus sirolimus-eluting stents in patients with coronary artery
      disease.
