      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of rintatolimod when
      given together with vaccine therapy and sargramostim (GM-CSF) to see how well it works in
      treating patients with stage II-IV human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive
      breast cancer. Vaccines made from synthetic HER2/neu peptides may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express HER-2/neu. Adjuvant therapies,
      such as GM-CSF and rintatolimod, are additional cancer treatments given after the primary
      treatment to lower the risk that the cancer will come back and are one way to help vaccines
      produce stronger immune responses. Giving vaccine therapy together with rintatolimod and/or
      GM-CSF may be a safe and effective treatment for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To choose the most promising (maximum biologic dose [MBD]) of five different doses (4, 20,
      79, 495 and 2000 mcg) of Ampligen (rintatolimod) administered intradermally (i.d.) as an
      adjuvant with HER2 vaccination, with respect to toxicity and incidence and magnitude of
      immune response.

      II. To determine, using MBD of Ampligen (defined in first primary aim), whether Ampligen when
      given with GM-CSF as a combined adjuvant strategy with HER2 vaccination increases both the
      incidence and magnitude of HER2 Th1 immunity as compared to the standard GM-CSF adjuvant
      strategy.

      OUTLINE: This will be a phase I-II randomized two-stage HER2 vaccine study in breast cancer
      patients.

      STUDY STAGE I: There are five groups of patients randomized to 1 of 5 arms with each arm
      receiving the synthetic HER-2/neu peptide vaccine admixed with rintatolimod (different doses)
      given i.d.

      STUDY STAGE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive the synthetic HER-2/neu peptide vaccine admixed with rintatolimod
      given i.d.

      ARM II: 24 patients will receive the HER-2/neu peptide vaccine admixed with GM-CSF and the
      other 24 patients will receive the HER-2/neu peptide vaccine admixed with GM-CSF in addition
      to rintatolimod (dose set by Stage I group that had the most active response) given i.d.

      In both study stages, treatment repeats every month for up to 3 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of last vaccine, patients are followed up at 1 and 12 months.
