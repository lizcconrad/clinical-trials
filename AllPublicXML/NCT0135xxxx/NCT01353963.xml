    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug with regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; lifethreatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between Week 4 and up to Week 8 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
