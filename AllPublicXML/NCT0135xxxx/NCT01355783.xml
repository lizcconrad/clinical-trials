  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment of E7777 in combination with CHOP
      has superior efficacy compared with CHOP alone in improving complete response rate (CRR) in
      first line treatment of subjects with Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study:

          1. Local pathologic diagnosis of PTCL with the following histology types: PTCL, not
             otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), and
             anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (ALK-negative or ALKpositive with IPI ≥ 2).

          2. Stage II, III or IV disease.

          3. Tumor lesion(s) measurable in 2 dimensions by computed tomography (CT) and is at least
             20 mm in the longest transverse dimension for non-lymph node masses and at least 20 mm
             in longest transverse dimension for lymph nodes. Subcutaneous masses can be used as
             indicator lesions. If the lesion was previously irradiated, it must have progressed
             prior to randomization (by investigator assessment) to be used as a measurable lesion.

          4. Tumor biopsy available for central pathologic review; may be archived sample from
             prior biopsy within 6 months of study enrollment, or sample to be obtained on study
             during screening.

          5. Age ≥ 18 years.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          7. Adequate bone marrow reserve as evidenced by:

               -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm3 (1.0x109/L)

               -  platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 (50x109/L); (≥ 25,000/mm3 [25x109/L] allowed if
                  thrombocytopenia secondary to bone marrow involvement by lymphoma)

               -  hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (80 g/L)

          8. Adequate liver function as evidenced by:

               -  bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT])
                  ≤ 3 times the ULN (≤ 5 times the ULN if hepatic involvement)

               -  albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL (30 g/L)

          9. Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (176 μmol/L) or
             calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min per the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

         10. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

         11. Written informed consent prior to any study-specific screening procedures.

         12. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum betahuman
             chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) pregnancy test at Screening and a negative serum or
             urine β-hCG pregnancy test result at Baseline, and must agree to use a highly
             effective method of contraception (see protocol for list) throughout the entire study
             period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

         13. Male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use or their
             partners must use a highly effective method of contraception (see protocol for list)
             beginning at least 1 menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug(s),throughout the
             entire study period, and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation, unless they are
             sexually abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy. Those with partners using
             hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of
             contraception, as described previously.

        Exclusion:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

             therapy) is allowed if the last dose of CHOP (or CHOP-based therapy) was administered
             ≤ 28 days before study enrollment (Lead-In) or randomization (Main Study).

          4. Prior radiotherapy for this lymphoma, with the following exception: prior radiation
             therapy for localized disease ≥ 4 weeks before randomization is allowed as long as the
             irradiated area is not at the mediastinal area or at the site of the only potentially
             measurable disease.

          5. Prior malignancy within past 5 years (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix).

             cardiac arrhythmia, unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction (MI) (within 6
             months of study enrollment).

          8. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than institutional lower limit of
             normal, as determined by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram.
