    <textblock>
      One of the main points in the biological trends is, the circadian rhythm and disturbance in
      this cycle, which cause mood disorders and irregularity in this bio clock, to get depression.
      The pineal gland with the precise regulation of circadian rhythm of melatonin regulates the
      brain haemostasis. The abnormal function of this gland gives rise to psychiatric disorders.

      In the period of youth and early of middle-age cause biochemical changes and disturbance in
      biorhythm including melatonin secretion.

      This process can change the peak of melatonin phase. In addition, a decrease in the level of
      serum melatonin, can change the function of immune system of depressed patients. This
      function facilitates the process of cancerous cell formation and tumor growth.

      With respect to the conflicting results and that the positive and negative roles of melatonin
      in the creation of depression is unknown, the aim of this study was to compare the morning
      and nocturnal serum melatonin rhythm levels in the patients with Major Depressive Disorder.
      The second purpose was to measure the morning and nocturnal serum melatonin levels in the
      depressed and healthy men and women.

    <description>This study is analytical cross-sectional and randomized. Two groups of depressed patients and healthy subjects were selected.The individual were submitted to a medical examination, and responded to the Beck depression inventory (BDII-II). Those, who got a score above 20, were included in the depressed group. Among this group, 50 patients were chosen randomly. those who obtained a depressive score below 9, 50 of them were chosen and they were included in the healthy group. The control group was chosen to match to the depressed patients for education, social occasion, occupational and economical situation. All of the subjects were interviewed psychiatrically, and the depression disorder was confirmed on the basis of the DSM criteria. eight out of 50 depressed patients were excluded from the study due to suffering from other psychiatric disorders .</description>
