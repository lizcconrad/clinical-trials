  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a cost effective and safe form of renal replacement therapy in
      patients suffering from end stage renal disease.

      However currently available PDF (peritoneal dialysis fluids) are not biocompatible for the
      peritoneal cavity and its cells. Acute cytotoxic effects of the majority of the current
      glucose-based PDF are caused by low pH, lactate, high glucose and its degradation products
      (GDP).

      Toxic effects of PDF can thus be extended to suppression of mesothelial HSR (heat shock
      reactions) following PDF exposure resulting in increased susceptibility of mesothelial cells
      against PDF exposure: PDF inherent stress factors fail to adequately induce HSP as effectors
      of the cellular stress response - the adequate HRS rather seems to be blocked.

      Hence, therapeutic approaches to activate and enhance the HSR will reduce peritoneal damage
      and organ failure and improve the survival of organisms.

      Preclinical results demonstrated that supplementation of PDF with pharmacological doses of
      alanyl-glutamine restored HSP expression and increased the resistance of mesothelial cells in
      in-vitro models of PD and preserved peritoneal integrity in in-vivo models of PD.

      After these positive preclinical results, this study shall now clarify, whether the addition
      of alanyl-glutamine to the most commonly used glucose-based PDF is safe and tolerable.
      Therefore PDFs will be drained in a randomized cross-over study. Main outcomes measures will
      be total HSP expression in peritoneal cells and changes of the peritoneal transport kinetics
      and the presence/absence/severity of side effects.

    <description>Two arms (A and B) and two treatment periods (1 and 2) are scheduled for this study. Each arm includes 14 patients. Schedule arm A: Treatment period 1 with one single peritoneal dialysis exchange (standard PD solution) with Alanyl-Glutamine-Dipeptide as add-on. 17,4 ml Dipeptiven (=3,48g N(2)-L Alanyl-L-Glutamin) will be dissolved at a final concentration of 0,174 %(= 8 mmol/l) in 2 liters of Dianeal®PD4 (at PH:5,5; Glucose-Concentration 3,86 %). After a wash out period (28 days + max 7 days), arm A undergoes treatment period 2, that is one single peritoneal dialysis exchange with standard PD solution without Alanyl-Glutamine-Dipeptide. Schedule Arm B: Treatment period 1 with one single peritoneal dialysis exchange with standard PD solution without Alanyl-Glutamine-Dipeptide followed by wash-out. Treatment period 2 for arm B includes one single peritoneal dialysis exchange with standard PD solution with Alanyl-Glutamine-Dipeptide as add-on. Dosages remain exactly the same.</description>
