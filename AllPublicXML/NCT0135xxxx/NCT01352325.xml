  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of system constellations in a
      monocentric, single-masked randomized controlled trial.

      The method of system constellations refers to an approach which integrates ideas from family
      systems therapy with elements from psychodrama. The constellations are conducted in a group
      based seminar-setting, each seminar lasting three days.

      Based on the model of a general psychotherapy and the consistency theory, the effects of
      system constellations on psychological functioning are explored.

      It is predicted that participation in a system constellation seminar changes the level of
      psychological functioning at 4 months.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in psychological well-being at 2 weeks and four months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day of treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, 4 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological well-being will be assessed using the 'Outcome Questionnaire' in its German version (EB-45). The EB-45 is a brief 45-item self report outcome/tracking instrument designed for repeated measurement of client progress through the course of psychotherapy and following termination. The scales of the EB-45 measure symptom distress, interpersonal functioning, and social role.</description>

    <description>The FEP-2, 40-item self report questionnaire, measures psychological distress according to the phase model of therapeutic change as well as the interpersonal model of psychological distress.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Incongruence at 2 weeks and 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day of treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, 4 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Motivational incongruence is defined as the unsatisfactory realization of motivational goals and is based on the concept of General Psychotherapy by Klaus Grawe. The Incongruence Questionnaire (INK) is an instrument that assesses motivational incongruence, defined as the discrepancy between a person's motivational goals and his/her perception of reality. The short version of this questionnaire that will be used in our study (K-INK) comprises 23 items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal achievement at 2 weeks and 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>day of treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, 4 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Goal achievement will be assessed using Goal Attainment Scaling as a method for the assimilation of achievement in a number of individually set goals into a single aggregated 'goal attainment score', providing a person-centred outcome, focused on that individual's priorities. Goal attainment scaling is operationalized by an open-ended question, in which study participants descriobe their individual goals. In a second step these goals will be coded according to the Bern inventory of psychotherapy goals (BIT-C).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in 'Experiences in family and organisational systems' at 2 weeks and 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>day of treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, 4 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective quality of family and organizational systems will be assessed by the HFES (Heidelberger Fragebogen zum Erleben in Systemen: Heidelberg Questionnaire on experiences in systems), a self-constructed questionnaire comprising 24 items.</description>
