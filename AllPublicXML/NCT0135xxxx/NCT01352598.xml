    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the local control rate as well as acute and late toxicity rates of
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of organ confined prostate cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV trial of patients with
      organ-confined prostate cancer. Data collected will include patient demographics, pathology
      data, tumor stage, SBRT dose fractionation scheme, dose received by adjacent critical normal
      tissues,tumor recurrence data, and acute and late toxicities. Follow up data will be
      collected during the patient's standard office visits. The anticipated duration of this study
      is 5 years.
