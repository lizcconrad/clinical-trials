      The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of Klaricid XL (clarithromycin modified
      release) in the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) and its impact
      on improving the quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this observational study had a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and signs and
      symptoms of an acute exacerbation, clinically diagnosed by the sudden worsening of symptoms
      characterized by extreme breathlessness and increased chest tightness, wheezing, cough, or
      sputum changes. A sequential non-systematic sample of patients with AECB from May 2011 until
      January 04, 2012 is included in this observational study.

      The observation period for each individual patient started with the diagnosis of the acute
      exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and prescription of antimicrobial medication per routine
      clinical care. This observational period continued during the treatment period and ended on
      at least one follow-up visit at the end of the treatment. Duration of treatment was based on
      physician's judgment of severity of the patient's condition. The usual treatment period
      ranges from 5 to 14 days.

    <measure>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Scores at Baseline and End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment (maximum treatment duration of 10 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire with 76 weighted responses. It provides a Total score and three component scores: Symptoms (distress caused by respiratory symptoms), Activity (physical activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness), and Impacts (social and psychological effects of the disease). The Total score and each of the SGRQ subscores are scored from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates best and 100 indicates worst health. An increase in score indicates worsening health. A change in the Total score of 4 units is consistent with a clinically significant change in the participant.</description>

The change from Baseline of 4 or more units lower, consistent with a clinically significant change in the participant, was considered in this study to be the 'minimal clinically important difference' (MCID).</description>

    <description>AE=any untoward medical occurrence in a patient, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with their treatment. SAE=an event meeting any of the following criteria: results in death, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, is life-threatening, congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention, spontaneous or elective abortion. AEs and SAEs were collected during the course of the study. See the Reported Adverse Event section for details.</description>

        <title>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Scores at Baseline and End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire with 76 weighted responses. It provides a Total score and three component scores: Symptoms (distress caused by respiratory symptoms), Activity (physical activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness), and Impacts (social and psychological effects of the disease). The Total score and each of the SGRQ subscores are scored from 0 to 100 where 0 indicates best and 100 indicates worst health. An increase in score indicates worsening health. A change in the Total score of 4 units is consistent with a clinically significant change in the participant.</description>
