  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fasting during the Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and is a mandatory duty for
      all healthy adult Muslims. Fasting is considered safe in young healthy subjects but it can
      induce harmful effects and complications in patients with diabetes. Several studies have
      demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes are prone to hypo and hyper glycemia during
      fasting. When treating diabetic patients with a treatment guideline the rate of these
      complications can be reduced. Little data is available on patients with type 2 diabetes
      treated with insulin. The investigators therefore propose to assess the effect of a protocol
      containing detemir (levemir) and a premix of insulin aspart (NovoMix70) on glucose control in
      patients with type 2 diabetes during the Ramadan and to compare this regimen to the standard
      care patients receive during this period. The investigators assume that patients receiving
      the intervention will have better glucose control during the Ramadan compared to patients
      receiving the standard care. As approximately 45 million Muslims suffer from type 2 diabetes
      and most of them fast during the Ramadan the results of this intervention may be significant
      and may improve the care of these patients allowing Muslims to respect their religious
      obligations without compromising their health.

The daily insulin dose will be calculated as follows: Sixty percent of the total daily dose will be used as the beginning daily dose at the first day of fasting. Sixty percent of the daily dose will be given as NovoMix70 before the Eftar (the main meal in the evening that breaks the fast). Forty percent of the amount will be given as Levemir (Early in the morning before the beginning of fasting.</description>
