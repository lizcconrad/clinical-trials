    <measure>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Ratings of Pain Intensity (PI) were made using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on which 0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain possible. The PI values were obtained at 20 and 40 minutes, and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours following the first dose of study medication on Day 1. Pain intensity difference (PID) was calculated by subtracting the posttreatment score from the baseline score, where the baseline score was the PI rating made prior to the first dose of study medication. A summed PID (SPID) on the first postoperative day was calculated at 8 hours.</description>

    <description>Ratings of Pain Intensity (PI) were made using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on which 0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain possible. The PI values were obtained at 20 and 40 minutes, and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours following the first dose of study medication on Day 1.

    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 6, and 8 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Scores were obtained from the pain relief evaluations by taking a weighted sum of pain relief scores. Pain relief was measured at 20 and 40 minutes, and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours on a 5-point categorical scale where 0 = no pain relief, 1 = a little pain relief, 2 = some pain relief, 3 = a lot of pain relief, and 4 = complete pain relief.</description>
