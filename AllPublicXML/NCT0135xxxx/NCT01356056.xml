  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to design, implement, and clinically assess a portable,
      user worn system for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) motor symptoms. The current standard
      in evaluating symptoms is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a subjective,
      qualitative ranking system. The main goal of this research is to develop a quantitative
      system, Kinesia HomeView, to assess tremor as well as different features of bradykinesia in a
      home based system which can capture those symptom changes over the course of a day and aid in
      evaluating treatment protocol efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to follow the required clinical instruction

          -  Subjects with cognitive impairments that would prohibit them from properly using the
             Kinesia HomeView system

          -  Subjects without the cognitive ability to respond to researchers and let them know
             when any parameters of the study may become uncomfortable

          -  Subjects found on examination by our clinicians to have any physical limitations which
             would be counter productive to participation in this study.
