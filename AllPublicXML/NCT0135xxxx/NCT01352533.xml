  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess whether wound closure with skin adhesive or running
      stitches combined with skin adhesive will be superior to standard wound sutures. This is a
      split-wound study that will compare two methods of skin closure within one standard closure
      technique, thereby providing an internal control of running stitches within each wound. The
      investigators plan to measure outcomes by assessing for scar appearance, the incidence of
      wound opening, scar elasticity and subject satisfaction.

    <measure>Wound Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>10 day/3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure of this study will be wound healing. This outcome will be assessed by the blinded observers, subject ratings and Cutometer measurements of scar elasticity. Two double-blinded dermatologists will be asked to rate the scars according to the objective scar scales at the 10 day/ 3 week and 3 month follow-up exams.</description>

    <measure>Subject Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days/3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will fill out the VAS to evaluate their overall assessment of their scar, any associated pruritus and pain. The subjects will also fill out a Subject Satisfaction Survey to evaluate subject preference for closure.</description>

    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days/3 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The treating physicians will note occurrence and extent of any adverse events associated with either type of epidermal closure.</description>
