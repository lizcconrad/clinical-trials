  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the range of single inhaled doses of a new dry
      powder product, MDT-637, that are safe and well-tolerated. This includes monitoring effects
      on pulmonary function and determination of blood levels of MDT-637 following inhalation.
