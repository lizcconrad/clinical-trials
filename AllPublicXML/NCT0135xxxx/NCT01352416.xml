  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to show that ranolazine is a safe, viable and potent
      alternative for post-operative atrial fibrillation suppression in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single center, double blind, prospective, randomized study for patients who are scheduled
      for elective cardiac surgery (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft [CABG], or valve or CABG and
      valve). All patients who meet criteria will be prospectively enrolled in a randomized
      fashion. Patients enrolled will be assigned to receive twice daily identical capsules
      containing either placebo or ranolazine. Study drug will be initiated 2 days before surgery.
      Patients will receive study drug throughout their hospitalization and be kept on it for a
      full 2 weeks post operatively. Patients will be seen in 2 weeks and receive a 30 day follow
      up contact visit.
