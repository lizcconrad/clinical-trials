  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a noninvasive circulatory assist device that has
      been as a treatment option for refractory angina in left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.
      Recently, its potential role in heart failure management has been shown. However, although
      the concept of EECP was introduced almost four decades ago, and despite growing evidence
      supporting the clinical benefit and safety of this therapeutic modality, little is firmly
      established regarding the mechanisms responsible for the benefit of EECP include improvement
      in endothelial function, promotion of coronary collateralization, enhancement of ventricular
      function, and peripheral effects. Therefore, the major aim of this study is to provide an
      alternative treatment, EECP, for those unsuitable for standard procedures, especially for
      patients whose heart failure was caused by repeated myocardial infarction, called ischemic
      cardiomyopathy (ICMP), and to evaluate the clinical outcome and the endothelial function
      before and after 35 hours of EECP treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% by
             means of left ventricular angiography and symptomatic mild-to-moderate heart failure
             (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II-III). The patient was included
             if there is no suitable target for either percutaneous coronary intervention or
             surgical bypass grafting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  IF he/she has moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (AR), history of deep vein
             thrombosis, or significant arrhythmia.
