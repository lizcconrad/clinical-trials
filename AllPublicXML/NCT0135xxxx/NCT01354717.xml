      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three treatment parallel study in
      which normal, healthy men and women (age 45-85) with actinic keratosis will be treated on the
      face once daily for two weeks with 5-Fluorouracil Cream 0.5%, Spear Pharmaceuticals
      (Generic), Carac® Cream 0.5% (Brand), or Cream Vehicle (Placebo). Actinic keratoses will be
