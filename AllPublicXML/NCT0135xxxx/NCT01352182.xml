  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone and to
      determine the effect on inflammatory biomarkers for pioglitazone in patients with severe
      sepsis and septic shock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among adults and children. Few
      clinical trials have demonstrated clinical benefit in sepsis. Severe sepsis is a systemic
      inflammatory syndrome in response to infection that is associated with acute organ
      dysfunction. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) is
      involved in the regulation of the sepsis-induced inflammatory response. The central
      hypothesis is that pioglitazone reduces the inflammatory responses in children with severe
      sepsis and septic shock.

    <time_frame>Pharmacokinetic (PK) data (clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate) on day 1 (time 0.5, 2, 6 and 21h after drug dosing)</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic data will be assessed approximately as follows: Day 1 - time 0, 0.5, 2, 6, and 21hr after drug dosing; Day 2 - prior to dosing; Day 3 - prior to dosing and at 0.5, 2, 6, and 21h after drug dosing; Days 4-5 - prior to dosing. The primary PK parameters are clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate. Safety data will be assessed throughout the days of drug dosing and the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) stay, an expected average of about 2 weeks. Primary safety laboratory studies include glucose (measured every 6 hours), liver enzymes (daily), creatinine (daily), and blood urea nitrogen (daily).</description>
