  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVL-292 as
      monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL),
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is non-receptor tyrosine kinase with restricted cellular
      expression largely limited to B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and mast cells or basophils. Btk is a
      critical component of the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling network and is crucial for B cell
      development. Investigation has revealed that some B cell lymphomas and CLL depend on BCR
      signaling, suggesting that interruption of such signaling could be a promising therapeutic
      opportunity in B-NHL, CLL and WM.
