  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the drug interaction between fostamatinib and
      digoxin by comparing the safety, tolerability and plasma concentration of digoxin when
      administered alone and with fostamatinib in healthy subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate whether the plasma concentration-time profiles and resulting PK parameters of digoxin are altered during steady-state fostamatinib administration. Digoxin AUCss and Cmaxss will be measured</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 and Day 15</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine the safety + tolerability of fostamatinib in combination with digoxin. Assessments: Adverse events, lab assessments, vital signs, phys exam,12-lead ECG. Absolute values and change in baseline for any of these parameters will be reported</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening, Day 1 - Day 17, through to Follow up visit</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine the steady-state PK of R406 during co-administration of fostamatinib with digoxin at steady-state. R406 AUCss, tmaxss and Cmaxss will be measured</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To examine the urinary steady-state PK of digoxin in healthy subjects when administered alone and in combination with fostamatinib at steady-state. Digoxin Ae(0-t), Fe, and CLr will be measured</measure>
