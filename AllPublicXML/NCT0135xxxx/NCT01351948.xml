  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the safety and immunogenicity of AdCh63 AMA1 and MVA AMA1vaccine
      candidates administered alone and with adjuvants in various schedules. These vaccines consist
      of inactivated viruses which have been modified, so they cannot reproduce in humans, and also
      to include genetic material for malaria protein AMA1 which is expressed by the malaria
      parasite during blood stage infection. The vaccines are designed to stimulate an immune
      response to this malaria protein and thus provide protection against malaria infection.
      Adjuvants are a crucial component of modern vaccine regimens, increasing the immunogenicity
      and potency of protein vaccines. In this study we will assess whether virus vectored vaccines
      combined with protein in adjuvant AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® and CPG 7909 adjuvant (emulsion
      containing TLR agonist) can induce stronger and more durable immune response.
