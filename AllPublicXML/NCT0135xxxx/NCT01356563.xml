      Introduction:

      End stage renal disease (ESRD) incidence in Taiwan ranked first and prevalence ranked second
      in the world from 2002 to 2005. Several foreign researches had reported that hemodialysis
      (HD) patients often require 12 medications to treat 5 to 6 comorbid conditions. Besides, ESRD
      is a lifelong disease and rates of compliance may diminish overtime. Thus, HD patients may be
      at particular risk for drug related problems, durg-drug interactions and noncompliance. Our
      aim is to analysis the effect of pharmacist in medication-related problems in ambulatory
      hemodialysis patients.

      Methods:

      This study is a randomized double-blind, active controlled trial. The investigators will
      invite and communicate with HD patients to find medication -related problems. After
      pharmacist evaluation, pharmacist will do pharmaceutical interventions to resolve
      medication-related problems, drug-drug interactions etc. in experimental group. In the active
      control group, pharmacist in this study will not do pharmaceutical interventions. The
      investigators will monitor each patient in a two-week period for medication-related problems.

      Our primary outcome is the amount of unresolved medication-related problems in each group
      after two weeks. Blind outcome assessor will evaluate the amount of unresolved
      medication-related problems in each case as well as compliance in these patients after two
      weeks.

      The investigators suppose that clinical pharmaceutical intervention will reduce the amount of
      unresolved medication-related problem in experimental group. On the other hand, patients
      without clinical pharmaceutical intervention will have more unresolved medication-related
      problems.

    <time_frame>14 days after recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>From 1 score to 5 scores, 1 score means that patient is very unsatisfied with pharmaceutical care in the past 14 days. 5 scores means that patient is very satisfied with pharmaceutical care in the past 14 days.</description>
