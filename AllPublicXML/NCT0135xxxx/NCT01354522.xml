  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some sub-analysis has shown anthracycline-based regimens are not effective in Her-2 negative
      breast cancer, while capecitabine is more effective in this group of patients.

      This is a prospective, randomised phase III trial, to compare the efficacy and safety
      profiles of two types of adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for HER2 negative, node positive
      breast cancer patients.

      Control Arm: This includes 6 cycles of TAC 75/50/500 mg/m2 day 1 every 3 weeks. Experimental
      Arm: This includes 6 cycles of TC 75/500 mg/m2, day 1 every 3 weeks, concurrently with
      capecitabine 950 mg/m2, twice a day, via oral intake, for 14 days, and then a one-week rest
      period.

      Women with hormone receptor positive tumours must receive 5 years endocrine after the end of
      chemotherapy.

      Patients may receive radiotherapy when clinically indicated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Histological diagnosis of operable invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast (T1-T3).
             Tumours must be HER2 negative. Time window between surgery and study randomization
             must be less than 60 days.

          -  Surgery must consist of mastectomy or conservative surgery with axillary lymph node
             dissection. Margins free of disease and ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are required.
             Lobular carcinoma is not considered a positive margin.

          -  Positive axillary lymph nodes defined as at least 1 out of 10 nodes with presence of

             affected.

          -  Status of hormone receptors in primary tumour. Results must be available before the
             end of adjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must not present evidence of metastatic disease. Status of HER2 in primary
             tumour, known before randomization. Patients with immune histochemistry (IHC) 0 or +1
             are eligible. For patients with ICH 2+, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is
             mandatory and result must be negative.
