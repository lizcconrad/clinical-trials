    <textblock>
      This is a two-year double blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized clinical trial, which is
      aimed to evaluate the effects of Chinese medical treatment on leucopenia after chemotherapy
      in breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in the Department of Breast Surgery in China Medical University
      Hospital, Taichung. One hundred newly diagnosed breast cancer patient (age ≧18, Stage I, II,
      IIIa) will be included. After the diagnosis, the patients will undergo operation. Then, each
      patient will receive one of the following protocol of chemotherapy according to her pathology
      report and overall evaluation: &quot;FEC*6&quot;, &quot;FEC*4+Taxotere*4&quot;, and &quot;FEC*3+Taxotere*3&quot;.

      Every participator will start to take the powder of Chinese herb-LCH1 after her receiving
      first time of chemotherapy until she receives the next cycle.(While receiving &quot;FEC&quot;, it will
      be 3 weeks. While receiving &quot;Taxotere&quot;, it will be 4 weeks).

      Just before receiving the next cycle of chemotherapy, the blood of the participator will be
      sampled to check her CBC, GOT/GPT, BUN/Cr and tumor maker.

      The investigators also adopt the body constitution questionnaire (BCQ) to evaluate the
      Chinese medical constitutional status, the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23, and Karnofsky score
      to evaluate the quality of life, and to evaluate the adverse effects of the adjuvant
      chemotherapy with the NCI-CTCAE Version 3.0.

      Each participator will take the powder of Chinese herb-LCH1 from her first chemotherapy till
      3 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy. Over all, it will take about 18 weeks (FEC*6)
      to 28 weeks (FEC*4+Taxotere*4) to complete the treatment.

      This study will also investigate the influence of the chemotherapy on the Chinese medical
      constitutional status, and in order to provide the basis for the complementary treatment for
      the breast cancer by adjusting and balancing the constitutional status of the patients.

The WBC will be checked before receiving each cycle of chemotherapy and at the follow up 3 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy.
If the participator receives the protocol &quot;FEC*6&quot;, her WBC will be checked every 3 weeks for 7 times. It will takes 21 weeks to get the values of WBC at 7 different time point. And it will takes 31 weeks and 24 weeks for participators receive the protocol &quot;FEC*4+Taxotere*4&quot; and &quot;FEC*3+Taxotere*3&quot;, respectively.</description>
