  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical study of the novel recombinant HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine
      expressed in E. coli.

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate which dosage of the HPV vaccine can induce
      higher antibody and at the same time caused less adverse events.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to to evaluate the safety and immunopersistence of the
      study vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Totally 1600 healthy women of 18-25 years of age were enrolled. The participants were
      randomly stratified into 4 groups and receive different dosage of human papillomavirus (HPV)
      vaccine or placebo administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month schedule. The
      women were actively monitored for adverse events for 1 month after each injection. Severe
      adverse events during the trial were followed up. Serum samples from all the subjects would
      be collected on day 0, 7m, 24m, 48m and 72m to evaluate the immunogenicity and
      immuno-persistency.
