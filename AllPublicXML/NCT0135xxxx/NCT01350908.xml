      Circulating tumor DNA detection and quantification in patients with ovarian cancer.

      Technique development:

      In a first step, the different available techniques will be evaluated for specificity and
      sensibility using serial dilutions of cell lines with or without TP53 mutation.

      Validation:

      The tumor DNA detection rate will be estimated from patient's blood with ovarian cancer.

      The investigators will study 25 patients to obtain at least 15 patients bearing a TP53
      mutation that could be characterized in the primitive tumor or metastasis. With those 15
      patients, the investigators will determine the most sensitive technique and the best
      cost/efficiency ratio.

    <measure>Comparison of the detection techniques (PAP (pyrophosphorolysis activated polymerisation), BEAMing, NGS(Next sequencing generation) with regards to feasibility, robustness, sensitivity and cost.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The methods of detection which will be used such as the BEAMing, the PAP(pyrophosphorolysis activated polymerization) and the NGS(next sequencing generation is techniques of a big specificity capable of detecting a mutant copy among 1.104 wild copies for the BEAMing, 2.109 for the PAP and 1.105 for the NGS. The sensibility of these techniques is limited by the quantity of genomic DNA which we can extract from the sample of blood.</description>
