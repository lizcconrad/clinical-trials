  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Professional therapeutic boundaries are defined as the limits that protect the space between
      a professional's power and patient's vulnerability. It is important to develop therapeutic
      alliances while maintaining boundaries, thus ensuring nurses develop safe connections with
      patients and their families based on therapeutic needs. Due to the professional nature of
      nursing, boundary violations are common. For example, closeness and familiarity develops
      between the healthcare provider, patient, and caregiver that encompass the physical,
      emotional, and spiritual realms. This provides an opportunity for intense bonds with patients
      and families. Furthermore in oncology healthcare, providers deliver compassionate care and
      empathize with patients and families while sharing in the patient's illness journey. As a
      result of these bonds and relationships the nurse may over disclose personal information,
      provide excessive patient attention, meeting their own personal needs instead of the patient
      and family. In addition, continuity of care contributes to boundary crossings because there
      is frequent repeated contact with the same patients and families which allows blurring of
      boundary lines. When staff spend weeks, months, or even years with the same patient the
      opportunity to connect and talk about personal life details exist. At the national level, the
      National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) has created materials for educating
      nurses in maintenance of therapeutic boundaries. Adherence to therapeutic boundaries has now
      become an education objective, with the development of educational interventions within many
      health care settings. Likewise, St. Jude nurses are at an increased risk of crossing
      therapeutic boundaries due to long term care relationships and vulnerable family members.
      However, nursing administration has not formally assessed the attributes or behaviors of the
      nursing staff. This proposal will describe the attributes and behaviors of the St. Jude staff
      nurse towards nurse-patient/family boundaries, providing knowledge to nursing leadership that
      will facilitate therapeutic boundaries focus groups with direct care nurses.

      Participants will take a onetime researcher generated therapeutic boundaries questionnaire
      which will describe behaviors and attitudes regarding therapeutic boundaries.

      The main objective of the study is to :

      To describe behaviors and attitudes towards nurse-patient/family boundaries of direct patient

    <description>Each question will be analyzed and interpreted individually. More importantly, for each question, the percentage of nurses reporting &quot;sometimes&quot; or &quot;often&quot; will be reported because the questions where nurses more likely to score high are good references for planning the future nursing education series.</description>
