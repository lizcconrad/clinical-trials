  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of sub-cutaneous (SC) abatacept provides
      any structural benefit in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have failed prior use of TNF
      therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results in the literature suggest the structural benefits of intravenous (IV) abatacept as
      measured by high and low field MRI and X-ray in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have
      previously failed clinical treatment with TNF agents. This study attempts to measure the
      structural benefits of SC abatacept in a similar cohort of patients while at the same time
      comparing the structural findings with clinical outcome measurements as collected at
      corresponding time points with an automated patient and physician disease activity scoring
      system of 28 joints (DAS28).
