  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study of a new self-expanding stent (FlexStent®) designed specifically to
      cope with the extreme demands of the superficial femoral artery (SFA)/proximal popliteal
      artery. The arteries are often abbreviated as femoropopliteal.

      The intent of this study is to demonstrate that the FlexStent® Femoropopliteal Self-Expanding
      Stent System is safe and effective for the treatment of patients with peripheral arterial
      disease. Specifically, the FlexStent® shall meet or exceed the proposed safety and efficacy
      performance goals established for Femoropopliteal bare nitinol stents in patients with
      symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.

    <description>The primary safety endpoint is defined as freedom from all cause death, index limb amputation and target lesion revascularization (TLR) through 30 days. The proportion of patients remaining free from this composite endpoint will be compared to a safety performance goal for bare nitinol stents.</description>

    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is vessel patency at 12 months. Vessel patency is defined as freedom from a greater than 50% restenosis in the stented segment as determined by the DUS peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) comparing data within the treated segment to the proximal normal arterial segment and freedom from clinically-driven TLR within the stented segment within 1 year of the procedure.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective single-arm multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Flexible Stenting Solutions Flext Stent® Femoropopliteal stenting system in subjects with lower limb peripheral arterial desease (PAD). Subjects targeted for enrollment must have a single de-novo lesion located in the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery with at &gt; 70% stenosis. Subjects must meet all enrollment criteria and provide written informed consent prior to participation in the study.</description>
