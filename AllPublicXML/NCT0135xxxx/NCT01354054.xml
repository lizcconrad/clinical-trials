  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TENS is a non pharmacological intervention to control pain. Both high (&gt;50 Hz) and low (&lt;10
      Hz) frequency TENS are used in the clinic and it is thought that each type works through
      different mechanisms (see for review Sluka and Walsh, 2003). Hyperalgesia, an increased
      response to a noxious stimuli, is one component of pain and occurs both at the site of
      injury, primary hyperalgesia, and outside the site of injury, secondary hyperalgesia. Recent
      studies in animals with arthritis of the knee show that low and high frequency TENS
      differentially modulate primary and secondary hyperalgesia.

      Therefore the investigators hypothesize that TENS will reduce hyperalgesia and pain with
      movement resulting in increased function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following specific aims will address this hypothesis:

      Specific Aim 1 will compare the effect of high frequency TENS, low frequency TENS, and
      placebo TENS in patients with osteoarthritis on a variety of outcome measures: primary and
      secondary hyperalgesia, subjective pain scores, and function.

      Specific Aim 2 will determine the relationships among these multiple pain measures in people
      with osteoarthritis, and compare to age matched controls.

      Specific Aim 3 will determine the genetic variability as it relates to osteoarthritis pain
      and response to TENS treatment

      Specific Aim 4 will determine how body composition (BMI, fat mass, percent fat, lean mass,
      and bone mass) impacts the effectiveness of TENS

      One of the long-term goals of the investigators is to determine the clinical effectiveness of
      non-pharmacological treatments for pain, like TENS. These studies will begin to address this
      issue by examining effects of TENS on a variety of outcome measures in patients with a
      specific controlled condition (i.e., knee osteoarthritis). This research is innovative
      because it will be the first to systematically examine the effects of TENS on a variety of
      physiological parameters (primary and secondary hyperalgesia) and clinical outcome measures
      (resting pain, movement-evoked pain, function) in a common, painful and limiting condition
      that is frequently seen in physical therapy clinics. These studies will further allow us to
      translate basic science experiments previously performed in animal models of arthritis to the
      clinic. This information is expected to assist the clinician in the treatment choice for a
      particular patient and guide future clinical research.

    <measure>Pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A handheld digital pressure algometer (Somedic AB, Farsta, Sweden), was used to assess PPT with the 1 cm2 circular probe. Pressure was applied at 40 kPa/s and patients were instructed to press the hand held response switch when the sensation first became painful. Familiarization with the proceedure was accomplished with testing on the non-dominant forearm of each subject. Following this familiarization procedure, PPTs were assessed at the knee and anterior tibialis muscle bilaterally. An average of the three trials at each test site was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG is a standardized test where on command subjects arise from a chair with no arm rest, ambulate 9.8 feet as quickly and safely as possible, turn, ambulate back, turn and return to sitting in the chair. The walking distance was measured in advance and marked on the floor with tape marks well visualized by subjects. Subjects were timed in a standardized fashion from the moment the upper back left the chair until return to full sitting position with back in contact with the chair.</description>

    <measure>Pain Intensity measures</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to rate their pain intensity on a horizontal 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The anchors utilized were &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. VAS measures were taken at rest, during the TUG, during the HTS, and cutaneous mechanical pain testing.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Thermal Pain threshold (HPT) and Temporal summation (HTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The TSA II NeuroSensory Analyzer was used to assess (HPT)and (HTS). For both measures, the 5 cm2 probe was placed and initial temperature was set at 37oC, and increased at 1 Â°C/s to a maximum of 52 oC. Subjects indicated when they first felt pain by using the remote patient switch which recorded the temperature . For temporal summation (HTS), a tonic heat stimulus of 45.5 oC was applied for 20 s. After building to the 45.5 oC in the first 5 s, subjects rated pain caused by this stimulus on a 10 cm visual analog scale every 5s for 15s.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cutaneous Mechanical Pain testing</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Cutaneous mechanical pain thresholds were assessed with a series of von Frey filaments (North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA) applied in ascending order from 0.008 to 300 g (0.008, 0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.4, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 26, 60, 100, 180, 300 g). In addition, the subjects rated their pain on a 100 mm VAS in response to application of a 6 g von Frey filament at the six sites bilaterally.</description>
