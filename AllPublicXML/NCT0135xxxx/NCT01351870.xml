  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international prospective randomised trial, which will compare two radiotherapy
      regimens in children and adolescents (aged 4 or 5 years to 21 years inclusive) with carefully
      staged 'standard risk' medulloblastoma.

      Patients eligible for the study will be those with non-metastatic medulloblastoma (by imaging
      and CSF cytology) at diagnosis. Patients randomised to the standard arm will receive
      conventionally fractionated (once a day) radiotherapy with a dose of 54 Gy to the posterior
      fossa and 23.4 Gy to the craniospinal axis. The experimental arm will be hyperfractionated
      (twice a day) radiotherapy (1 Gy b.d.) with a dose of 60 Gy to the posterior fossa with an
      additional 8 Gy to the tumour bed and 36 Gy to the craniospinal axis. Both groups will
      receive identical chemotherapy consisting of eight weekly doses of Vincristine given with
      radiotherapy and 8 courses of CCNU, cisplatin and vincristine following radiotherapy.
