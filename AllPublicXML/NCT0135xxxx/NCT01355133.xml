  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot clinical study is to determine if intrasphincteric autologous
      myoblast injections in combination with electrical stimulation are safe and effective in
      treating stress urinary incontinence, confirming the optimal dose and assessing tolerability
      of the procedure.

    <intervention_name>Transurethral intrasphincteric autologous myoblast implantation</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients undergo upper arm muscle biopsy to isolate and cultivate autologous myoblasts. Using the ultrasound-directed transurethral medical device, 15-18 aliquots (50 - 100 µl per depot) of the 2 ml myoblasts/media suspension are directly injected into the urethral rhabdosphincter at two different levels. The procedure is a single-dose injection of a cell count in range of 1x106 -5x107 cells, depending of the size/quality of the biopsy and quality of outgrowing cells in order to identify possible dose related effects. To possibly enhance cell integration following implantation, a course of transvaginal electrical stimulation is undertaken.</description>
