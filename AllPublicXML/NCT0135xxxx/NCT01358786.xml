      Patient undergoing breast reconstruction with lower abdominal flap, benefit when points are
      used for membership (between the aponeurosis of the abdominal flap and underlying muscles)
      for closing the donor area, where there is reduced incidence of complications.

      This study evaluated seroma formation at the donor site of the TRAM patients who underwent
      breast reconstruction. Forty-eight breast reconstructions were performed using the bipedicled
      TRAM flap. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups of 16 participants each: DN
      group, use of suction drains but no quilting sutures between the remaining abdominal flap and
      musculoaponeurotic layer of the anterior abdominal wall; QS+DN group, use of quilting sutures
      and suction drains; and QS group, use of quilting sutures but no suction drains. In order to
      determine seroma formation, ultrasound examinations were performed on postoperative days 7
      and 14 in 5 regions of the abdominal wall: epigastric, umbilical, hypogastric, right iliac,
      and left iliac regions.

    <description>Seroma formation was identified clinically and confirmed by ultrasound examination. Clinical examination consisted of evaluation of early symptoms (bulging and distension of the skin, signs of fluid accumulation), palpation, and percussion. Ultrasound examination was performed on postoperative days 7 and 14 to detect the presence of seroma at the TRAM flap donor site. The patients were placed in the supine position during the examination. Upon detection of seroma, ultrasound-guided puncture was performed, and the number of punctures and volume of seroma aspirated were recorded.</description>
