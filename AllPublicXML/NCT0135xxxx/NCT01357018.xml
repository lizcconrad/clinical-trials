  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic joint complaints are prevalent in clinical practice. If chronic arthritis such as
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is not adequately controlled, it can
      not only affect patient's working ability but also produce indirect cost in patient's family.
      Quality of life will also be affected. Health-related quality of life issues are assuming
      increasing importance in chronic rheumatic diseases. However, studies on quality of life in
      rheumatic patients are limited. Factors related to quality of life are not clear. Application
      of quality of life measurement for improving clinical care of RA and AS patients is still
      difficult. The objective of this study was to evaluation the validity of EQ-5D life quality
      measurement in chronic arthritis patients in Taiwan. Factors associated with life quality
      will be addressed. This will also provide useful information for public health policy making.
