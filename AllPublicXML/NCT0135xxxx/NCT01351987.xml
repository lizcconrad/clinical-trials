      This is a non-interventional, observational and multicenter study. When subjects will be
      allowed the dutasteride and α-blocker orally once daily for two years by investigator's
      prescription. They will be invited to this observational study. All eligible subjects can be
      allowed the prior alpha blockers therapy. Details of acute urinary retention (AUR) and
      BPH-related prostatic surgery episodes will be recorded at every visit. Subjects will return
      to the clinic for assessment every 3 months until week 96. The efficacy and safety of
      combining the 5α-reductase inhibitor (5ARI), dutasteride, and the α-blocker will be assessed.
