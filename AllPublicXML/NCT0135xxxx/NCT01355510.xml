  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation of carotid baroreceptors (baropacing) acutely decreases arterial
      pressure in patients with refractory hypertension. The reduction in blood pressure seems to
      be mediated through sympathetic inhibition with concomitant reduction in the activity of the
      renin-angiotensin system. Indeed, switching on and off the stimulation is accompanied by
      decreases and increases in central sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow, respectively. Plasma
      renin concentration also decreases with acute electrical baroreflex stimulation.

      In some patients chronic baropacing is associated with long-term blood pressure reduction.

      However, there is sparse information as to the relative contribution of blood pressure
      regulating systems to account for the acute and chronic effects of baropacing. Sympathetic,
      renal, and vascular mechanisms are of special interest. Furthermore, technical aspects of
      electrical baroreflex stimulation may play a role, e.g. worsening of the electrical contact
      between the stimulating electrodes and the baroreceptor afferents.

      This study is designed to answer the following primary questions:

        1. Does chronic electrical stimulation of carotid baroreceptors inhibit sympathetic
           vasoconstrictor tone also in the long-term?

        2. Does sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone increase on switching off chronic baropacing? Such
           an increase would confirm electrical integrity of the system and proper contact to the
           baroreceptor afferents.

        3. Does acute electrical baroreflex stimulation decrease renal vascular resistance?

        4. Does acute electrical baroreflex stimulation influence glucose delivery to skeletal
           muscle and change insulin sensitivity? The study follows an open-label observational
           design and it is planned to recruit up to 30 patients over 3 years.

        Patients with implanted devices for electrical baroreflex stimulation are recruited
        according to inclusion and exclusion criteria until good quality recordings have been
        obtained in 20 patients during both stimulator settings (ON and OFF) in the corresponding
        study arm. After obtaining written informed consent patients will be investigated in the
        laboratory.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment in the
        study:

          -  Adult patients having an implanted device for electrical baroreflex stimulation.

          -  Signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

        ReSy Study - Protocol version: December 20, 2010 8

          -  Subject is the investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of
             the protocol.

          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of the study.

          -  Subject unlikely to comply with protocol, e. g. uncooperative attitude, inability to
             return for follow-up visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study.

          -  Pregnancy. Breast-feeding.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to inulin or paraaminohippurate or to drugs with a similar
             chemical structure have to be excluded from the constant-infusion procedure.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Blood donation of more than 500 mL during the previous 3 months (men) or 6 months
             (women).
