  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this research, the investigators hope to learn if cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) works in people who have both PTSD and problems with
      drugs or alcohol. In the past, people who had problems with drugs and alcohol were not given
      treatment for their PTSD. It was believed that PTSD treatment would get in the way of their
      drug and alcohol treatment. Now the investigators believe that the PTSD symptoms may make it
      harder to avoid using drugs and alcohol, so the investigators want to see if people can get
      treatment for both problems at the same time.

      One hundred-sixty Veterans from 3 sites who have both PTSD and substance use disorders will
      be in the study. In order to know if the PTSD treatment is helpful, half of the Veterans in
      this study will receive PTSD treatment and half will continue to get their usual mental
      health and/or substance abuse treatment. Who gets which treatment will be decided by a random
      process. The investigators will then compare the 2 groups to see if there are differences in
      their PTSD symptoms.

      A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a relatively simple,
      manual-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD in patients with substance use
      disorders (SUDs). One hundred sixty outpatients with comorbid PTSD and SUDs from three VA
      facilities will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT for PTSD in conjunction with
      standard treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 80) or TAU only (n = 80).

    <description>The CBT for PTSD model is based on modern theories of posttraumatic reactions that place a premium on the importance of individuals' appraisals of traumatic events, their own reactions and those of others, and the meaning of the experience in terms of oneself and one's place in the world. In addition, the model employs cognitive restructuring to teach individuals how to examine and challenge their trauma-related appraisals.</description>
