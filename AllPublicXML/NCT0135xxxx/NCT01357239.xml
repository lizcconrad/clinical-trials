    <measure>Change From Baseline in Behavioral Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-CFX) Total Score in Stratum I Patients Exposed to AFQ056 100 mg Bid</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community edition (ABC-C) is a 58-item, caregiver-rated symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors of children and adults with mental retardation at home, in residential facilities, and work training centers. The assessment was done by attributing to each item a score from 0 (&quot;not at all a problem&quot;) to 3 (&quot;problem is severe in degree&quot;) and the total score ranks from 0 to 174. The data collected from the full, 58-item ABC-C were analyzed according to the modified FXS ABC-C algorithm (ABC-CFX) for which 55 items and six subscales (irritability, lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech and social avoidance) plus the total score were considered, and for which the total score ranks from 0 to 165. Stratum I included patients whose Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene was fully methylated</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Repetitive Behaviors Assessed Using the Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) Total and Subscale Scores in Stratum I</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) is a rating tool that captures the breadth of repetitive behavior. It is a 43-item questionnaire filled by the caregivers. Each behavior assessed is rated from 0 (behavior does not occur) to 3 (behavior occurs and it is a severe problem). The total score ranks from 0 to 129. The behaviors are grouped into six domains: ritualistic behavior (range 0 to 18); sameness behavior (range 0 to 33); stereotypic behavior (range 0 to 18); self-injurious behavior (range 0 to 24); compulsive behavior (range 0 to 24); and restricted interests (range 0 to 12).

        <title>Change From Baseline in Behavioral Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist–Community Edition (ABC-CFX) Total Score in Stratum I Patients Exposed to AFQ056 100 mg Bid</title>
        <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community edition (ABC-C) is a 58-item, caregiver-rated symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors of children and adults with mental retardation at home, in residential facilities, and work training centers. The assessment was done by attributing to each item a score from 0 (“not at all a problem”) to 3 (“problem is severe in degree”) and the total score ranks from 0 to 174. The data collected from the full, 58-item ABC-C were analyzed according to the modified FXS ABC-C algorithm (ABC-CFX) for which 55 items and six subscales (irritability, lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech and social avoidance) plus the total score were considered, and for which the total score ranks from 0 to 165. Stratum I included patients whose Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene was fully methylated</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS):all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment for the primary efficacy parameter.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Irritability, Lethargy/Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity, Inappropriate Speech and Social Avoidance Assessed by the Individual Subscales of the ABC-CFX Scale in Stratum I</title>
        <description>The ABC-C is a 58-item, caregiver-rated symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors of children and adults with mental retardation at home, in residential facilities, and work training centers. The assessment was done by attributing to each item a score from 0 (&quot;not at all a problem&quot;) to 3 (&quot;problem is severe in degree&quot;) and the total score ranks from 0 to 174. The data collected from the full, 58-item ABC-C were analyzed according to the modified FXS ABC-C algorithm (ABC-CFX) for which 55 items and six subscales: irritability (range 0 to 54); lethargy/withdrawal (range 0 to 39); stereotypic behavior (range 0 to 18); hyperactivity (range 0 to 30); inappropriate speech (range 0 to 12); and social avoidance (range 0 to 12) plus the total score (range 0 to 165) were considered. A negative change represents improvement. Stratum I included patients whose FMR1 gene was fully methylated</description>

        <title>Proportion of Patients With Clinical Response, Where Response is Defined as a Reduction of at Least 25% From Baseline in the ABC-CFX Total Score and a Score of 1 (Very Much Improved) or 2 (Much Improved) on the CGI-I Scale, Stratum I</title>
        <description>The ABC-C is a 58-item, caregiver-rated symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors of children and adults with mental retardation at home, in residential facilities, and work training centers. The assessment was done by attributing to each item a score from 0 (“not at all a problem”) to 3 (“problem is severe in degree”) and the total score ranks from 0 to 174. The data collected from the full, 58-item ABC-C were analyzed according to ABC-CFX algorithm, for which 55 items and six subscales plus the total score were considered, and for which the total score ranks from 0 to 165. The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale is a clinician rated scale used to assess treatment response in psychiatric patients, and the score ranges from 1 to 7 (with 1 being “very much improved”, 4 being “no change” to 7 being “very much worse”). Stratum I included patients whose FMR1 gene was fully methylated; Stratum II included patients whose FMR1 gene was partially methylated.</description>

          <description>The ABC-C is a 58-item, caregiver-rated symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors of children and adults with mental retardation at home, in residential facilities, and work training centers. The assessment was done by attributing to each item a score from 0 (“not at all a problem”) to 3 (“problem is severe in degree”) and the total score ranks from 0 to 174. The data collected from the full, 58-item ABC-C were analyzed according to ABC-CFX algorithm, for which 55 items and six subscales plus the total score were considered, and for which the total score ranks from 0 to 165. The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale is a clinician rated scale used to assess treatment response in psychiatric patients, and the score ranges from 1 to 7 (with 1 being “very much improved”, 4 being “no change” to 7 being “very much worse”). Stratum I included patients whose FMR1 gene was fully methylated; Stratum II included patients whose FMR1 gene was partially methylated.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Repetitive Behaviors Assessed Using the Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) Total and Subscale Scores in Stratum I</title>
        <description>The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) is a rating tool that captures the breadth of repetitive behavior. It is a 43-item questionnaire filled by the caregivers. Each behavior assessed is rated from 0 (behavior does not occur) to 3 (behavior occurs and it is a severe problem). The total score ranks from 0 to 129. The behaviors are grouped into six domains: ritualistic behavior (range 0 to 18); sameness behavior (range 0 to 33); stereotypic behavior (range 0 to 18); self-injurious behavior (range 0 to 24); compulsive behavior (range 0 to 24); and restricted interests (range 0 to 12). A negative change represents improvement. Stratum I included patients whose FMR1 gene was fully methylated</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Repetitive Behaviors Assessed Using the Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) Total and Subscale Scores in Stratum II</title>
          <description>The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) is a rating tool that captures the breadth of repetitive behavior. It is a 43-item questionnaire filled by the caregivers. Each behavior assessed is rated from 0 (behavior does not occur) to 3 (behavior occurs and it is a severe problem). The total score ranks from 0 to 129. The behaviors are grouped into six domains: ritualistic behavior (range 0 to 18); sameness behavior (range 0 to 33); stereotypic behavior (range 0 to 18); self-injurious behavior (range 0 to 24); compulsive behavior (range 0 to 24); and restricted interests (range 0 to 12). A negative change represents improvement. Stratum II included patients whose FMR1 gene was partially methylated</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS):all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment for the primary efficacy parameter. Only participants who had a value at the given time and the assessment was within the window for analysis were included</population>
