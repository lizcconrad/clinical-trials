      The purpose of this study is to better comprehend the benefits and efficacy of portal triad
      clamping with infrahepatic IVC clamping during complex hepatectomy. A randomized comparative
      trial was performed to compare PTC(pringle triad clamping) with either infrahepatic IVC
      clamping or low central venous pressure in complex liver resections.

      To better comprehend the benefits and efficacy of portal triad clamping with infrahepatic IVC
      clamping during complex hepatectomy. A randomized comparative trial was performed to compare
      PTC with either infrahepatic IVC clamping or low central venous pressure in complex liver
      resections. 192 consecutive patients were involved in this study and allocated equally to two
      groups. Preoperative demographic and clinical data, details of surgical procedure, pathologic
      diagnosis, postoperative course and complications were collected prospectively.

        During the study period, all patients who received liver resections were considered to be
        included into this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. patients who were assessed by preoperative medical imagings to have a high risk of
             backflow bleeding from the major hepatic veins and the IVC, based on the size and
             location of the tumor. The tumors were ≥5 cm in diameter and they involved the liver
             segments 7, 8 and/or the cranial portion of segment 4. These tumors were in close
             proximity or were compressing, but had not actually invaded, the major hepatic veins
             or IVC

          2. Pugh-Child Grade A

          3. Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes (ICGR15) &lt; 10%;

          4. acceptable clotting profile (platelet count ≥ 50 ×109/L and prothrombin activity ≥
             60%)

          5. no previous liver resection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. extrahepatic metastases in patients with malignancy;

          2. patients who refused to take part in this study.
