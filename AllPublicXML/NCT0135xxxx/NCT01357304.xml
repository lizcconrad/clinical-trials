  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of group treatment including physical
      activity referral (PAR) on level of physical activity and quality of life in patients
      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension in a primary health care setting
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sedentary lifestyle and low levels of physical activity in populations are major health
      problems today and contribute substantially to poor health and diseases such as type 2
      diabetes and hypertension. An increased and systematic effort to increase physical activity
      in the Swedish population in general, and in patients with type 2 diabetes/hypertension in
      particular, is important. Written prescriptions of physical activity with follow-up (i.e.,
      PAR), is a cost-efficient way to increase physical activity in individuals.

      The aim of this trial is to study whether physical activity is increased by a group method
      involving PARs in patients with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes compared with a control
      group that receives usual care in the same primary care setting. Follow-up will be performed
      at 6 and 12 months.

      This trial is being conducted to determine whether it is possible to offer PARs to more
      patients in a way that requires less effort and resources. The intervention in this study
      requires 10 minutes of a health care worker's time per patient during a 6-month period. Each
      patient requires 100 minutes with an instructor who oversees the group intervention.

      Group treatment is given 3 weeks after baseline and at 6 months. Follow-up at 12 months
      involves data collection, but no intervention.

      An empowerment process, with the 5-A-model as framework, will be used in the clinical
      intervention.

      All participants will be required to fill in questionnaires and wear an ActiGraph GTM1/GTM3
      for 7 days at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.

    <description>Physical activity level is measured with an Actigraph GTM1/3. Overall physical activity, and total accumulated time and bouts of time in different categories of physical activity, will be determined according to count thresholds. Additonally subjective measurements of physical acidity are made using a questionnaire were questions about self-reported physical activity are reported (the International Physical Activity Questionnaire; IPAQ). Subjectively measured physical activity will be expressed as MET-minutes/week.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life, measured using the EQ-5D questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D, a validated instrument that classifies health according to five items (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), each of which has three alternatives (&quot;no problem&quot;, &quot;moderate problem&quot; and &quot;severe problem&quot;). Combining the answers gives an index with a score of between 0.59 and 1.0.</description>
