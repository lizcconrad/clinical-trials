    <textblock>
      This primary purpose of this study is to find the recommended dose of LGK974 as a single
      agent and in combination with PDR001 that can be safely given to adult patients with selected
      solid malignancies for whom no effective standard treatment is available.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic cancer that has progressed despite standard
        therapy or for which no effective standard therapy exists and histological confirmation of
        one of the following diseases indicated below:

        Single Agent Dose escalation part:documented B-RAF mutant colorectal cancer or pancreatic
        adenocarcinoma. In addition, tumors of any histological origin with documented genetic
        alterations upstream in the Wnt signaling pathway are eligible with prior agreement with
        Novartis.

        Single Agent Dose expansion part: documented B-RAF mutant colorectal cancer with documented
        RNF43 mutation and/or RSPO fusion or pancreatic adenocarcinoma with documented RNF43
        mutation. In addition, patients with tumors of any histological origin with documented
        genetic alterations upstream in the Wnt signaling pathway (e.g. RNF43 or RSPO fusion) are
        eligible with prior agreement with Novartis

        LGK974 with PDR001: Dose escalation: patients with the following cancers that were
        previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy and whose best response on that therapy was
        progressive disease (i.e. primary refractory): melanoma, lung SCC, HNSCC. Patients with
        esophageal SCC, cervical SCC or TNBC who are either na√Øve or primary refractory to prior
        anti-PD-1 therapy.

        LGK974 with PDR001: Dose expansion: patients with pancreatic cancer, or TNBC, or melanoma,
        or head and neck cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Impaired cardiac function

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of oral LGK974 (e.g., ulcerative diseases,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel
             resection)

          -  Brain metastases that have not been adequately treated

          -  Malignant disease other than that being treated in this study

          -  Laboratory abnormalities as specified in the protocol
