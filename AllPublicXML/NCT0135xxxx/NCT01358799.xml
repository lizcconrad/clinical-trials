  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this multi-center clinical study is to demonstrate that the APTIMA(R) Assay
      for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT; &quot;ACT Assay&quot;), which is cleared for use on the TIGRIS DTS
      (Direct Transfer) System (&quot;TIGRIS System&quot;), can be tested on the PANTHER System. The intended
      use of the ACT Assay will be unchanged except for the inclusion of its use with the PANTHER
      System. ACT Assay performance on the PANTHER System is comparable to performance on the
      TIGRIS System.

      This protocol was withdrawn from clinical trials.gov because samples collected under this
      protocol were not tested per protocol using the Gen-Probe APTIMA(R) CT (Chlamydia
      trachomatis) Assay. Instead, testing was conducted and results were generated with the
      Gen-Probe APTIMA(R) Combo 2 Assay (for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae). See
      Protocol Identification AC2PS-US11-001 (NCT01733069) for results. This action was recommended
      by the RRS team per their email to me on 8 February 2013.

      4 specimens will be collected from each female subject in the following order: 1 first-catch
      urine specimen, 1 vaginal swab specimen (patient or clinician-collected), 1 cervical specimen
      (using a broomlike collection device or a brush/spatula combination), and 1 endocervical swab
      specimen. An additional cervical specimen may be collected from female subjects for other
      clinical trial purposes or research studies. Up to 2 specimens will be collected from each
      male subject in the following order: 1 urethral swab specimen and 1 first-catch urine
      specimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is at least 14 years of age at the time of informed consent and is
             sexually active

               -  The subject reports symptoms consistent with a suspected STD such as abnormal
                  discharge, genital itching, pain/discomfort during sexual intercourse or
                  urination, and/or lower abdominal discomfort.

               -  If the subject is asymptomatic, the subject is known to be partners with, or a
                  contact of, a person with a confirmed or suspected STD(s), is undergoing
                  screening evaluation for a possible STD(s), and/or is scheduled for a routine
                  exam that may include a pelvic exam

               -  The subject and/or legally authorized representative is willing to undergo the
                  informed consent process prior to study participation (a minor will need the
                  documented consent of his/her parent or legal guardian, unless the site has an
                  IRBapproved waiver for parental consent for minors)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A potential subject will be ineligible for clinical trial enrollment if the subject,
             clinician, or medical record reports any of the following:

               -  The subject took antibiotic medications within the last 21 days

               -  The subject is underage (as defined by the IRB or state law), without the
                  documented consent of her/his parent or legal guardian (exception: sites that
                  have an IRBapproved waiver for parental consent for minors)

               -  The subject is determined by the investigator to be medically unsuitable for
                  participation in this study (eg, medical history of concurrent illness that could
                  result in an unacceptable risk to the subject) Concurrent participation in other
                  clinical study(ies) may be acceptable, with approval by the investigator and
                  sponsor.
