    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and immune response of a new intranasal
      vaccine against influenza, called NB-1008. The vaccine is composed of a licensed vaccine that
      is normally given as an injection, called Fluzone, and an adjuvant (additive that helps a
      vaccine work better), called W805EC. In a prior clinical study this vaccine showed promising
      results in terms of being well tolerated and eliciting mucosal and systemic immune responses
      after administration by a dropper. In this study NB-1008 is being administered by dropper as
      well as a nasal sprayer to determine if the sprayer further enhances the immune response.

             moderate or severe illness (as determined by the investigator through medical history
             and physical examination) with or without fever. For subjects with a minor illness,
             such as diarrhea, or mild upper respiratory tract infection with or without low-grade
             febrile illness, the subject can be re-screened once they have complexly recovered.
