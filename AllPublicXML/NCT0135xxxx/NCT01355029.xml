      The study will be evaluating to a 4 week education and support program for stroke caregivers.
      The 4 week program will provide education, information, and strategies for dealing with areas
      that caregivers may find challenging in their caregiving role. The study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of the program to decrease the caregiver's stress, strain and burden, increase
      the caregiver's knowledge of strategies and community services and increase their role
      satisfaction as a stroke caregiver and quality of life two weeks after the program and 6
      months after the program.
