    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common inflammatory disease of the skin and joints with a prevalence of 1-3%
      in the caucasian population of Northern Europe and the US. Similarly to other inflammatory
      diseases there is now substantial and accumulating evidence that psoriasis has a systemic
      inflammatory component.

      It is known that patients suffering from psoriasis have increased prevalence of traditional
      cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, tobacco use and
      diabetes mellitus. This would logically explain an increased rate of cardiovascular events,
      but even when adjusting for theses risk factors, psoriasis carry an independent risk for
      developing cardiovascular disease.

      Recent large epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between psoriasis and
      myocardial infarction.

      Atopic dermatitis has been linked to ischemic stroke in one study, but besides this, the
      disease has not been associated with cardiovascular disease.

      In conclusion, convincing and increasing evidence is supporting that psoriasis induce
      accelerated atherosclerosis and hence cardiovascular disease and mortality. In particular,
      this is seen in young patients with early disease onset.

      Psoriasis is believed to be driven by cytokines produced by Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes. A
      number of these cytokines are suggested to be atherogenic. In contrast, another chronic
      inflammatory disease, atopic dermatitis, is predominantly driven by Th2 lymphocyte derived
      cytokines, some of which may inhibit atherosclerotic processes. It is therefore, of interest
      to compare the presence of cardiovascular disease in these two inflammatory skin diseases.

      Hypothesis: That the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and especially coronary artery
      disease is increased in psoriasis patients and that this process can be influenced by
      treatment of psoriasis with biological treatment.
