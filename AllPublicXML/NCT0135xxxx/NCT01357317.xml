  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To examine the effects of three commonly applied treatments of disordered
      phosphorus homeostasis on biochemical markers and vascular characteristics in patients with
      moderate and advanced non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 120 qualified patients from our medical center, who have been diagnosed with
      mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR 15-60 ml/min), will be enrolled. After
      informed consent, qualified subjects will be randomized into 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio:
      lanthanum carbonate, calcium acetate, and dietary modification. The maximum length of
      treatment is 12 months. Dose of intervention will be adjusted based on changes in biochemical
      parameters. Primary end points are changes in serum phosphorus, urine phosphorus, serum
      parathyroid hormone, coronary artery calcification, aortic pulse velocity and flow mediated
      vasodilation.

    <description>Lanthanum Carbonate: initial dose 500 mg TID with meals, titrated at monthly intervals in 500 mg increments or decrements, with goal of returning to normal the level of the abnormal baseline marker(s) of phosphorus homeostasis (serum phosphorus, PTH or TRP). Normality for this marker will be defined as serum phosphorus of 2.6-4.6 mg/dl, PTH of 10-65pg/ml and TRP&gt;=80%.</description>

    <description>Calcium Acetate: initial dose 667 mg TID with meals, titrated at monthly intervals in 667 mg increments or decrements, with goal of returning to normal the level of the abnormal baseline marker(s) of phosphorus homeostasis. The maximum daily intake of elemental calcium should not exceed 1500 mg in order to comply w/recommendations from K-DOQI [5](this is approximately equal to three 667mg tablets of calcium acetate TID).</description>

    <description>Dietary instructions consisting of pamphlets describing foods high in phosphorus and consultation with a renal dietitian if necessary, with the goal of return to normal the level of the abnormal marker of phosphorus homeostasis. Rescue therapy with a phosphorus binder of the treating physician's choice will be allowed in patients who fail to normalize elevated baseline serum phosphorus levels after 3 months following dietary instructions.</description>
