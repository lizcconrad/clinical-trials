    <textblock>
      As part of a system wide reagent verification plan Haemoscope Corporation will be running a
      study to verify the reference intervals of many of the reagents. Reference intervals will be
      constructed following the guidelines set out in CLSI document C28-A3c. This guideline calls
      for a reference interval to be constructed from at least 120 donors. Some reagents currently
      have ranges in place based on fewer donors than that stated in the guideline. This procedure
      will provide additional testing results to meet the requirements outlined in the CLSI
      guideline. Reagents that currently have no reference intervals will be tested and will
      include a minimum of 146 donors.
