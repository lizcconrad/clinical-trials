      To compare effects of sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol and
      midazolam on psychometric tests and critical flicker frequency (CFF) in cirrhotics

      Upper GI Endoscopy is routinely performed in patients with chronic liver disease to screen
      for complications related to portal hypertension such as esophageal and gastric varices and
      portal gastropathy. Sedation is frequently administered to facilitate patient
      tolerance.Patients with hepatic dysfunction who undergo endoscopy are at increased risk for
      complications related to sedation.Propofol has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in
      comparison with benzodiazepines and opioids, which makes it especially appropriate for
      sedation in endoscopy.In previous studies cognitive functions were assessed by various paper
      and pencil tests. However learning affects the paper and pencil tests if repeated at short
      interval of time.CFF analysis was found to be sensitive and objective in the quantification
      of low-grade HE, and there is a significant correlation between CFF and the portosystemic
      encephalopathy syndrome (PHES) battery.Considering this, we designed a prospective randomized
      controlled study with cirrhotic outpatients to compare effects of sedation for upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol versus midazolam on psychometric tests and critical
      flicker frequency in cirrhotics

             endoscopy for routine variceal screening.

          -  The diagnosis of liver disease will be based on available past history, serological
             testing, radiological imaging, and liver histology when available.
