  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each potential subject will be screened before the start of the study to determine their
      eligibility for participation. Just prior to vaccination, a 10 mL venous blood sample will be
      taken from each eligible subject, for baseline titration of circulating anti-HA antibodies.
      Immediately thereafter, each subject received one dose of vaccine (0.5 mL) by intramuscular
      injection into the upper arm. Subjects will be asked to stay at the site for 30 minutes
      post-vaccination to observe for immediate reaction. Subjects will be monitored for adverse
      events during the study. At three weeks (±3 days) after the vaccination, subjects will be
      asked to return to the site for final collection of blood samples.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity profiles for influenza virus vaccine strains (2010-2011 season) of the AdimFlu-S manufactured by Adimmune Corporation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline for anti-hemaglutinin (HA) antibodies by hemagglutinaton inhibition (HAI) at 21 days post immunization</time_frame>
    <description>Twenty-one days after vaccination, serum samples will be taken and tested for anti-hemaglutinin (HA) antibodies by hemagglutinaton inhibition (HAI), and assays will be performed at Adimmune Corporation designated central laboratory. Subjects will be considered to be seronegative if serum HAI titer&lt;1:10. The seroconversion is defined as the post-vaccination serum at least 40 for whom had negative pre-vaccination or a fourfold or greater increase in HAI titers in subjects who had positive pre-vaccination serum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles including the presence or absence of the pre-specified reactogenicity events and other serious/non-serious adverse events of the AdimFlu-S manufactured by Adimmune Corporation.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Reactogenicity events are pre-specified adverse events systematically recorded on diary cards(a grid of check boxes for each event and each day) during the immediate post-vaccination period by all participants. In general, reactogenicity events will be recorded for 7 days after vaccination. The selection of the events to be collected systematically is based on events expected to occur with wild-type influenza infection.
In regard to the long term safety of the study vaccine, the significant and/or serious adverse event(s) will be recorded during the 6 months follow up after vaccination.</description>
