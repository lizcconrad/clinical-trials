  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy was reported in the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment of resistant psoriasis
      may be difficult and cyclosporine can induce some remission.

      The investigators hypothesized that the combined use of live attenuated varicella vaccine as
      an adjuvant therapy to low dose cyclosporine in the treatment of severe resistant psoriasis
      can give positive responses.

    <description>the clinical evaluation of our patients through the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score calculation at each visit.
The final patient's response was rated according to the physician global assessment (PGA) based on the final improvement of the PASI score as worse, poor (0-24% improvement in PASI), fair (25-50% improvement in PASI), good (50-74% improvement in PASI), excellent (75-99% improvement in PASI), or cleared (100% improvement in PASI).</description>
