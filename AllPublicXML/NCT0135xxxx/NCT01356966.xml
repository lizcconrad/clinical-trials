  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease have profound exercise intolerance which contributes to
      an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The investigators have found that chronic kidney
      disease patients have an exaggerated increase in blood pressure during certain forms of
      exercise that could certainly contribute to exercise dysfunction as well as cardiovascular
      risk. The investigators will test the mechanisms underlying this exaggerated blood pressure
      response, as well as the potential benefits of short-term tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) with
      folic acid on both exercise dysfunction and cardiovascular risk factors in chronic kidney
      disease. The investigators will test whether short-term treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin
      (BH4), a cofactor for nitric oxide, together with folic acid improves inflammation, vascular
      health, and adrenaline levels, both at rest and during exercise in chronic kidney disease.

    <description>The augmentation index (AIx) is a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, and is defined as the ratio of augmentation (Δ P) to central pulse pressure and expressed as percent. AIx = (ΔP/PP) x 100, where P = pressure and PP = Pulse Pressure. The mean AIx for each group was estimated as an average and expressed as a change from baseline to 12 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change in Heart-rate-corrected Augmentation Index (AIx)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The augmentation index (AIx) is a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, and is defined as the ratio of augmented aortic pressure (Δ P) to central pulse pressure expressed as a percent. AIx = (ΔP/PP) x 100, where P = pressure and PP = Pulse Pressure. Because heart rate (HR) affects AIx, AIx was corrected to a HR of 75 beats per minute (bpm) as follows: HR-corrected AIx = -0.39 x (75 - HR) + AIx. The mean AIx for each group was estimated as an average and expressed as a change from baseline to 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Central Augmentation Index (AIx)</title>
        <description>The augmentation index (AIx) is a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, and is defined as the ratio of augmentation (Δ P) to central pulse pressure and expressed as percent. AIx = (ΔP/PP) x 100, where P = pressure and PP = Pulse Pressure. The mean AIx for each group was estimated as an average and expressed as a change from baseline to 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change in Heart-rate-corrected Augmentation Index (AIx)</title>
        <description>The augmentation index (AIx) is a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, and is defined as the ratio of augmented aortic pressure (Δ P) to central pulse pressure expressed as a percent. AIx = (ΔP/PP) x 100, where P = pressure and PP = Pulse Pressure. Because heart rate (HR) affects AIx, AIx was corrected to a HR of 75 beats per minute (bpm) as follows: HR-corrected AIx = -0.39 x (75 - HR) + AIx. The mean AIx for each group was estimated as an average and expressed as a change from baseline to 12 weeks.</description>
