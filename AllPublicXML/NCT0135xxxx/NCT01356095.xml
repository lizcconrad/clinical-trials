  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increased emphasis on evidence based practice in recent years a gap remains between
      evidence and practice, particularly in resource poor countries. Few studies to date have
      examined the use of knowledge translation strategies to improve health care outcomes in low
      income countries. However, given that the majority of health care in these settings is
      provided by workers with less training and limited resources, the theoretical potential for
      knowledge translation strategies to improve health care delivery and outcomes by integrating
      best evidence into routine practice may be greatest in these settings.

      Knowledge translation (KT) is an approach to changing health care provider behavior to reduce
      the gap between evidence and practice in health care delivery. There has been a tendency for
      knowledge translation interventions to employ generic, &quot;off the shelf&quot;, strategies, and apply
      them to deal with specific issues. This generic approach, fails to recognize the variability
      in the specific characteristics of health care settings, in terms of their patient
      populations, health care systems, and health care providers. These characteristics, whether
      they function as barriers or facilitators to change, make a generalized approach to KT
      ineffective, where a tailored strategy, which specifically adjusts its approach to measured
      local barriers and facilitators may achieve better alignment of practice to evidence. This is
      likely to be particularly true in low income countries where the majority of health care is
      provided by non-physician health care workers, working within a wider range of health care
      systems, with variable and unique patient populations and resource constraints. Given the
      potential to significantly impact health care outcomes at relatively low cost, further
      research is needed both to develop methods for identifying potential barriers and
      facilitators to KT strategies in specific resource poor settings, and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of KT strategies tailored to address the identified barriers.

      This study will assess the effectiveness of a two part knowledge translation intervention
      tailored to address factors identified in a previous study as functioning as barriers and
      facilitators to treatment adherence among patients on treatment for tuberculosis or combined
      tuberculosis and antiretroviral treatment, targeting improved patient adherence and health
      outcomes, in a specific low income country.
