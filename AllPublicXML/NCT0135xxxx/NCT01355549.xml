  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is common in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). It is most often caused by
      overuse injuries to the muscles and tendons that can occur during wheelchair propulsion,
      transfers, and other activities of daily living. Normally, shoulder pain resolves with
      conservative treatments such non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen,
      naproxen, etc.) and physical therapy. However, when these treatments fail, shoulder surgery
      may be the only option.

      Platelet Rich Plasma therapy, or PRP, is a treatment option for non-healing muscle and tendon
      injuries such as those that cause shoulder pain in persons with SCI. Using one's own blood,
      cells within the blood called &quot;platelets&quot; are concentrated and then re-injected into the
      muscle and tendon of the shoulder. These platelets release substances known as &quot;growth
      factors&quot; that lead to tissue healing. By concentrating the platelets we increase the growth
      factors up to eight times which will promote the healing of tendons. PRP therapy has shown
      promise in treating tendon and muscle injuries in able-bodied persons; however, its
      effectiveness in persons with SCI is unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the
      feasibility, safety, and efficacy of PRP therapy for chronic shoulder pain in persons with
      SCI. The human body has a remarkable ability to heal itself and we hypothesize that
      re-injecting concentrated platelets will facilitate the natural healing process and will
      reduce shoulder pain in persons with SCI.

    <description>Shoulder pain intensity will also be assessed weekly using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Subjects will be asked to rate their average pain, most severe pain, and least severe pain during the past week using an 11-point scale (i.e. 0-10) anchored at the ends by &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain ever experienced.&quot; An 11-point NRS measure of pain intensity allows for comparison across clinical trials of chronic pain treatment and is recommended as a core outcome measure for chronic pain clinical trials.</description>

    <measure>Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the PRP treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The WUSPI is a 15-item self-report instrument that measures shoulder pain intensity in wheelchair users during various ADLs, such as transfers, loading a wheelchair into a car, wheelchair mobility, dressing, bathing, overhead lifting, driving, performing household chores, and sleeping. Each item is scored using a 10cm visual analog scale (VAS) which is anchored at the ends with &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain ever experienced.&quot; Individual item scores are summed to arrive at a total index score, which ranges from 0 to 150.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the PRP treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to rate on a 7-point scale overall impression following treatment as compared to the previous measurement interval. The 7-point PGIC scale (anchored by &quot;very much improved&quot; and &quot;very much worse&quot;) is used to measure global treatment effect.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory interference items (BPI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the PRP treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was developed by Cleeland, and has been used in a number of investigations of chronic pain. Its pain interference subscale has been used in several investigations of pain in SCI. In its original version the subscale (BPI-I7) consisted of 7 items measuring interference with general activity, sleep, mood, relationships, etc.). For uses with an SCI sample, in item 3 of BPI-I7, ''walking ability'' is replaced by &quot;ability to get around.&quot;</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female, 18 to 60 years of age, inclusive.

          -  The subject has neurological impairment secondary to a spinal cord injury that
             occurred at least twelve (12) months prior to the Screening Visit and the level of the
             injury is between C6 and L5, inclusive.

          -  The subject is non-ambulatory except for exercise purposes and uses a manual or power
             wheelchair as his/her primary means of mobility (&gt; 40 hours/week).

          -  The subject currently has chronic shoulder pain due to rotator cuff disease in spite

             11-point numerical rating scale (NRS; 0, no pain; 10, maximum pain imaginable), in
             spite of a past history of completing 6 months of conservative treatment. Rotator cuff
             disease will be defined as pain over the anterior shoulder, with direct palpation and
             pain at the shoulder with provocative tests for rotator cuff disease that is confirmed
             by tendinopathic changes on ultrasound imaging.

          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with the protocol.

          -  The subject is able to and has voluntarily given informed consent prior to the
             performance of any study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject reports a history of systemic disorders, such as diabetes or rheumatoid
             arthritis;

          -  The subject has contra-indications to the procedure, such as infection, coagulopathy,
             or is currently taking anti-coagulants;
