  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The only disease-modifying treatment for allergic disorders nowadays is allergen-specific
      immunotherapy (SIT). To induce hyporesponsiveness increasing doses of the disease-eliciting
      allergens are applied. One major problem of this treatment is, that it has to combat with an
      already established immune response against the disease-eliciting allergen. To circumvent
      this problem the investigators want to perform the proof of principle study towards
      prophylactic treatment. Prophylactic vaccination is used since many years for many infectious
      diseases. The investigators want to adopt this successful principle for the treatment of type
      I allergies.

      For this purpose non-allergic healthy individuals will be immunized with adjuvant-bound
      hypoallergenic derivatives of the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. As usual for
      allergen-specific immunotherapy, injections will be applied subcutaneously. Three injections
      in one-monthly intervals will be given to establish the immune response and a further
      injection after one year will determine how the vaccine-induced immune response can be
      boosted.

      The vaccine will be composed of an equimolar mixture of two adjuvant-bound hypoallergenic
      derivatives of the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1. The first investigational product
      (IP) designated as Bet v 1aF1 is a protein of 73 amino acid residues and represents the first
      half (1-73aa) of the Bet v 1 molecule. The second IP, Bet v 1aF2, is a protein of 86 amino
      acid residues and represents the second half (74-160aa) of Bet v 1. Both proteins are
      expressed in Escherichia coli. The hypoallergenic derivatives lost their IgE binding
      capacities by the disruption of the conformational IgE epitopes of the Bet v 1 molecule.

      In several preclinical and clinical studies it has been shown that the two hypoallergenic
      fragments, Bet v 1aF1 and Bet v 1aF2 have a strongly reduced allergenic reactivity and almost
      no sensitization potential, requisite for a prophylactic treatment. In a multi-centre
      placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial including 124 allergic patients no relevant
      sensitization against new epitopes could be observed after vaccination of the Alum-bound Bet
      v 1 derivatives.

      In contrast, the vaccine induced a strong IgG response in animals as well as in clinical
      studies. Vaccine-induced antibodies showed protective properties as they could inhibit the
      binding of allergic patients' IgE. An improvement of clinical symptoms and a reduction of the
      skin reactivity was correlated with an increase of IgG antibodies and could be shown only in
      actively treated patients in a multi-centre placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial.

      The investigational products will be tested in a Phase I clinical trial for prophylactic
      allergy vaccination in healthy non-allergic subjects. The two IPs will be coupled either to
      Alum and an equimolar mixture will be injected subcutaneously. The immune responses will be
      compared to placebo. In total 20 non-allergic healthy male subjects (10 per group) will be
      included in this clinical trial. For safety precautions the subjects will be monitored by
      skin prick testing using the two uncoupled IPs and commercial birch pollen extract in short
      intervals to recognize possible vaccine-induced sensitizations. The primary endpoint of phase
      I clinical trial is the evolution of Bet v 1-specific and Bet v 1 fragment-specific IgG1-4,
      IgE and IgM antibody levels in serum and in nasal fluids after vaccination of rBet v 1
      derivatives.
