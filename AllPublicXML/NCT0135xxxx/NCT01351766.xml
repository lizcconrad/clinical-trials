  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests a significant percentage of adolescent regular smokers are interested in
      trying to quit smoking and frequently make attempts to quit, yet are unsuccessful in
      maintaining abstinence on their own. Despite a genuine desire to quit on the part of many
      adolescents, there is an increasing incidence of smoking among older adolescents that runs
      counter to the overall trends of smoking reduction seen in the general population.
      Unfortunately, psychosocial and pharmacological smoking interventions have yet to indicate
      clear effectiveness with youth. Moreover, depression-related vulnerabilities, particularly
      currently elevated depressive symptoms, are highly comorbid with smoking behavior and
      dramatically reduce cessation rates. As a result, new approaches to smoking cessation are
      needed for adolescent smokers with currently elevated depressive symptoms. Thus the objective
      of the present study is to develop a specialized behavioral activation treatment for smoking
      in youths ages 18-21 with elevated depressive symptoms. In the first phase we utilize focus
      groups and pilot testing with 15 youths to develop the behavioral activation smoking
      treatment for youth (BATSY). In Phase II, we will conduct an open-label trial of BATSY plus
      nicotine replacement therapy with 30 youths who will also take part in a neuroimaging
      protocol examining reward sensitivity. Participants will be followed over 26 weeks post-quit
      date.

      This will be a Open-label trial to examine the efficacy of behavioral activation treatment
      for smoking-youths (BATSY). After completing a focus group phase and pilot study phase of
      BATSY with 15 youths, we will recruit 30 adolescent smokers with elevated depressive symptoms
      between the ages of 18-21 into the open-label trial of the the BATSY treatment. All
      participants in the open-label trial will receive 8 weeks of transdermal nicotine patch in
      addition to the BATSY intervention. Participants will also undergo an fMRI session including
      a behavioral task assessing reward sensitivity prior to commencement of the BATSY
      intervention. We intend to examine both abstinence and relapse outcomes. In addition we will
      examine to what extent depressive symptoms and reward sensitivity prior to quit date will
      correspond with improved smoking cessation outcomes over time.
