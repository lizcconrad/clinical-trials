    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-dose, parallel group study will assess the pharmacokinetics and
      safety of RO4917838 in healthy volunteers and patients with mild, moderate or severe chronic
      hepatic impairment. Patients and healthy volunteers will receive a single oral dose of
      RO4917838.

             function, or condition or disease which could interfere with the study or relapse
             during or immediately after the study

          -  Episode of acute depression within the last 6 months or current or previous (within
