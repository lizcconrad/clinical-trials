  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      12 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and refractory gait disturbances under best
      individual subthalamic nucleus stimulation and dopaminergic medication will be included into
      this randomised double-blind cross-over two-armed clinical trial. The treatment consists of
      two different stimulation settings using (i) conventional stimulation of the subthalamic
      nucleus [STNmono] and (ii) combined stimulation of distant electrode contacts located in the
      subthalamic nucleus and caudal border zone of STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata
      [STN+SNr].

      A composite 'axial score' including the major clinical and anamnestic items on gait, posture
      and balance function from UPDRSII (items 13-15) and UPDRS III (items 27-31) constitutes the
      primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include specified clinical and anamnestic
      assessments on freezing of gait, balance, quality of life, non-motor symptoms, impulsivity,
      impulse control and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The aim of the present trial is to investigate
      the efficacy and safety of combined stimulation on subthalamic and nigral electrode contacts
      [STN+SNr] in refractory hypokinetic gait disturbances compared with [STNmono] (active
      comparator). The results will clarify, whether the combined [STN+SNr] stimulation improves
      otherwise refractory gait disturbances in PD.

    <description>The composite 'axial score' is built by 8 items from the UPDRS II and III, all 5-point rated (0 to 4) representing increasing levels of pathology. The 'axial score' will be scored by the sum of the ratings across the 8 items (Range 0 to 32). As change in UPDRS scores is a common primary efficacy outcome measure in Parkinson's disease and only items of the original UPDRS are required for the definition of the primary endpoint, the statistical evaluation methods should be based on the psychometric validation of the UPDRS and no own validation studies are necessary.
