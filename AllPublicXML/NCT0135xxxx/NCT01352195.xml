  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is smoking cessation. The investigators are conducting a
      research study to learn how well the information from the program helps participants to quit
      smoking and remain smoke-free.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized 3-arm design, with 660 smokers recruited into each
      condition. The three conditions will include: (1) Usual care (UC), which will comprise a
      single smoking cessation booklet developed by NCI; (2) Standard Repeated Mailings (Stand-RM),
      which will be the same 8 Forever Free booklets (edited for cessation) distributed over 12
      months as in our preliminary studies; and (3) Intensive Repeated Mailings (Inten-RM), which
      will add two additional booklets to extend the intervention out to 18 months, plus additional
      monthly contacts. Assessments will occur at six-month intervals, through 30 months. An
      overview of the design is depicted in Table 4, which will be referenced throughout the
      remainder of this proposal.

    <description>Time will be measured in months from the start of condition. Potential confounding variables (e.g., group differences in demographic, smoking history, or pharmacotherapy use) will be adjusted for in the model. Pair-wise condition and time interval comparisons will be tested using the generalized score statistics from generalized estimating equations (GEE) models by utilizing the contrast statements.</description>
