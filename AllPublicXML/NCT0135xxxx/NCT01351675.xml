             II receptor blocker (ARB)for at least 6 weeks prior to and during screening. Stable
             dose 2 weeks prior to and during screening. Patients not taking an ACE inhibitor
             and/or ARB because of a medical contraindication must have discontinued treatment at
             least 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit A;

          5. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) must be ≤ 160 mmHg and ≥ 105 mmHg and mean
             diastolic blood pressure (DBP) must be &lt; 90 mm Hg during screening; both mean SBP and
             mean DBP (determined as the average of three readings) must be within this range at
             two separate time points measured at least 4 days apart during the screening period
             (blood pressure may be re-evaluated once during an unscheduled visit);

          6. Willing to practice methods of birth control (both male and female patients) during
             the entire study period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of the study drug
             is ingested;

          7. Serum magnesium level must be ≥ 1.3 mEq/L (0.65 mmol/L) at Screening Visit B or during
             subsequent unscheduled visit during screening (serum magnesium level may be
             re-evaluated once during an unscheduled visit);

          8. Willing and able to cooperate with all aspects of the protocol;

          9. Willing and able to give written informed consent for study participation and provide
             consent for access to medical data according to appropriate local data protection
             legislation, allowing authorization to access medical records and describe events
             captured in the endpoints

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (juvenile onset). If a history of diabetic ketoacidosis
             exists, a C-peptide level must confirm type 2 diabetes;

          2. Known non-diabetic renal disease (e.g., polycystic kidney disease, focal segmental
             glomerulosclerosis) [nephrosclerosis superimposed on diabetic kidney disease is
             acceptable];

          3. Ongoing clinical evidence suggesting non-diabetic renal disease other than
             nephrosclerosis;

          4. History of a renal transplant or a planned transplant from a living donor during the
             study;

          5. Albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) greater than 3500 mg/g (395.5 mg/mmol);

          6. Hemoglobin A1c level &gt; 11.0% (97 mmol/mol) during screening;

          7. Acute dialysis or acute kidney injury within 12 weeks prior to screening or during
             screening;

          8. Clinical signs and/or symptoms of uremia and expected need for renal replacement
             therapy within 12 weeks following randomization, as assessed by the investigator;

             graft surgery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent within 12 weeks
             before study randomization; c. Cerebrovascular accident, including transient ischemic
             attack within 12 weeks before study randomization; d. Current diagnosis of Class III
             or IV New York Heart Association (NYHA) congestive heart failure;

         10. Clinical diagnosis of severe obstructive valvular heart disease or severe obstructive
             hypertrophic cardiomyopathy;

             greater than two times the ULN on ANY screening laboratory test result;

         15. Female patients who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant during the study, or are
             nursing;

         16. BMI &lt; 18.5 g/m2

         17. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drug;

         18. Current history of drug or alcohol abuse as assessed by the investigator;

         19. Clinically significant infection requiring intravenous administration of antibiotics
             or hospitalization within 6 weeks of screening or during screening;

         20. Hepatitis B surface antigen positive;

         21. Diagnosis or treatment of a malignancy in the past 5 years, excluding non-melanoma
             skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix or a condition highly likely to
             transform into malignancy during the course of the study;

         22. A clinical condition that in the judgment of the investigator could potentially pose a
             health risk to the patient while involved in the study;

         23. Participation in a clinical study involving any intervention within 30 days prior to
             randomization, concurrent participation in such a study, or participation in a prior
