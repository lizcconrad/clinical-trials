  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Although radiotherapy is an effective palliative treatment for patients with
      painful bone metastases with over 70% responders, pain intensity is not always sufficiently
      controlled. Recent analyses from the randomized Dutch Bone Metastasis Study on 1157 patients
      show that during weekly follow up, 35% of the patients remain above a pain intensity level of
      4 on a numeric rating scale (range 0-10) despite pain medication. According to the WHO
      criteria, a pain intensity of 5 or higher prompts treatment. As advised in the CBO guideline
      'Pijn bij Kanker' educating patients can improve patient empowerment and thereby pain
      control. However, the effect of a nurse-led education of patients undergoing palliative
      radiotherapy for painful bone metastases has not been investigated yet.

      Objective: This project investigates whether nurse-led pain education in addition to standard
      care results in better control of pain in patients referred for palliative radiotherapy.

      Study design: A national multicenter phase 3 study (n=450).

      Study population: Patients with painful bone metastases referred for short schedule
      radiotherapy.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized between standard care or standard care with the
      Pain Education Program, a nurse-led pain education. The pain Education Program will be
      provided on the same day the radiotherapeutic treatment will start. The nurse will first
      assess the knowledge of a patient based on a structured interview. Thereafter, lacunas will
      be taught using the 'Pijninstructie Programma' (Pain Education Program). In addition, nurses
      will telephone patients at regular intervals during follow-up to monitor their needs.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome of this randomized multicenter study is
      a decrement of the number of patients whose worst pain intensity remains above 4 at any time
      during the 12 weeks of follow up with regard to the control group. The secondary outcome is
      improvement of quality of life.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: All patients will fill out the Brief Pain Inventory, the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL and
      the EORTC QLQ-BM22 at baseline and, thereafter, weekly for 12 weeks after randomization.
