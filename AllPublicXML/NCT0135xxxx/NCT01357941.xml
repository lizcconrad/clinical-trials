  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women with a prior history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) are at increased risk of
      recurrent VTE. Current guidelines assessing the role of prophylaxis in pregnant women with
      prior VTE are based primarily on expert opinion and the optimal clinical management strategy
      remains unclear.

      This multicentre, prospective cohort study aims to test the following hypotheses:

        1. Antepartum prophylaxis with fixed-dose low molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is safe,
           convenient and associated with an acceptably low risk of recurrent VTE in women with a
           single prior episode of VTE that was either unprovoked or associated with a minor
           transient risk factor. (Moderate risk cohort)

        2. Withholding antepartum prophylaxis is safe (recurrence risk &lt;1%) in pregnant women with
           a single prior episode of VTE provoked by a major transient risk factor. (Low risk
           cohort)

      All study patients will receive 6 weeks of postpartum prophylaxis.
