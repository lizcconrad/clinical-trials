  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is complex and involves several immune,
      infectious and anatomic factors. When medical therapy fails, functional endoscopic sinus
      surgery (FESS) is the therapy of choice. From literature it is known that 10% of patients
      that undergo FESS, need revision surgery within the 3 years following initial surgery. Causes
      of failure are multiple and not fully understood.

      As is the case in patients suffering from occupational rhinitis (OR), a subgroup of patients
      with severe and/or therapy resistent rhinosinusitis may suffer from mucosal pathology induced
      by occupational factors as well. No data are currently available on how these factors may
      contribute to the disease manifestation, whereas negligence of these factors as potential
      causes of disease may lead to the chronicity of rhinosinusitis, aggravate the mucosal
      condition and even give rise to the induction of bronchial symptoms. There exists no
      documentation on the role of the occupational agents on chronic sinus disease.

      This prospective study aims at providing data about the exposure levels of patients that
      undergo sinus surgery and correlate them with both subjective and objective postoperative
      parameters. This will be done by providing a questionnaire that was developed at our
      department to all patients that are planned for sinus surgery at the participating centers.
      This questionnaire asks for medical history, current sinonasal symptoms, professional history
      and recreational occupation. An extensive list of occupational agents is given and patients
      are asked to indicate those that they encounter at work or during recreational activities.
      This will be followed by an extensive clinical investigation including nasal endoscopy. These
      investigations (questionnaire and clinical examination) will be repeated at 3 months and 12
      months after surgery.
