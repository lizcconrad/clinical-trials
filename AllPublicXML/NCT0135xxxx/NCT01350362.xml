  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the cognitive changes after administration of
      tideglusib versus placebo at two oral doses and two treatment regimes for 26 weeks in
      patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

      After the 26 week core treatment period, the patients may continue in the study under blinded
      conditions for an optional extension period up to a maximum of 39 additional weeks (total
      study duration up to 65 weeks), until the last patient in the study has completed the 26 week
      of treatment.

      This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group study will be conducted at
      multiple centers in the European Union. Patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease
      will undergo a screening period, and then they will be randomized to one of these four
      groups: tideglusib 1000 mg once daily (Q.D.), tideglusib 1000 mg every other day (Q.O.D.),
      tideglusib 500 mg Q.D., or matching placebo, for a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      treatment period.
