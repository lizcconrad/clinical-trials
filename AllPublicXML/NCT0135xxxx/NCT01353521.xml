  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex renal cysts are often incidentally detected on imaging. The differential diagnosis of
      the complex renal cyst includes various benign cystic lesions, which are based on the Bosniak
      classification scheme. Currently the standard of care in evaluating a complex renal cyst is
      using a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, or a contrast-enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Since both of these modalities present adverse events due to
      frequent high doses of radiation, a technique such as a contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
      can be used to obtain the same results, without having to impose high doses of radiation upon
      a patient.

      By evaluating complex renal cysts using a contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), it can be
      established as to whether or not the results are better, the same, or worse, when compared to
      CT and/or MRI scans.

    <description>Complex renal cysts will be classified using the Bosniak classification system for both the CEUS and CT and compared. If surgical removal of a complex cyst is required (Bosniak IIF, III or IV), then the pathology will be evaluated with a single CEUS and a CT (The CEUS will be conducted 14 days within the CT).</description>
