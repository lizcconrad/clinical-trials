      This trial is conducted in Asia. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the
      clinical safety profile during 26 weeks of NovoNorm® (repaglinide) and insulin analogue
      combination therapy in type 2 diabetes under normal clinical practice conditions in Korea
      while the secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy after 13 and 26 weeks of
      NovoNorm® and insulin analogue combination therapy in type 2 diabetes under normal clinical
      practice conditions in Korea.
