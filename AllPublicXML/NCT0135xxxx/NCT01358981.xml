    <textblock>
      This will be the first study in which LY2881835 is given to humans in order to evaluate the
      safety and any side effects of LY2881835 in humans as well as how long LY2881835 stays in the
      body and its effect on blood sugar levels.

      The study consists of two parts. In part A, healthy subjects will participate and in part B,
      patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) will participate.

    <description>Two cohorts of healthy subjects will receive single oral doses of LY2881835 in up to 3 of the 4 periods in Part A (dose escalation: 0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, subsequent doses determined based on review of safety, tolerability, glycaemic response and available pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the first 2 dose levels). One cohort of subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) will receive single oral doses of LY2881835 in up to 2 of the 3 periods in Part B (dose escalation: starting dose based on review of safety, tolerability, glycaemic response and available PK data from Part A).
There is a washout period of at least 5 days between doses.</description>
