  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the differences between four active treatment conditions
      for combat-related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): virtual reality exposure therapy
      (VRE) or prolonged imaginal exposure therapy (PE), both with DCS or placebo, as well as to
      examine predictors for PTSD and response to treatment in active duty military personnel,
      veterans, and civilians who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop following
      exposure to traumatic events and includes symptoms of re-experiencing the trauma, such as
      through nightmares and flashbacks, avoidance and numbing, and physical hyperarousal. PTSD has
      been estimated to affect 10-20% of returning Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring
      Freedom (OEF) veterans. The most effective intervention found for PTSD is exposure therapy,
      which can be delivered in different formats, e. g. via virtual reality (VR) and as imaginal
      exposure. The goal of this study is to test the difference between 4 study conditions:
      virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) or prolonged imaginal exposure therapy (PE), both
      combined with an antibiotic drug, DCS (active pill vs. placebo). D-Cycloserine (DCS), a drug
      that has been FDA approved for over 20 years, has been hypothesized to enhance the
      therapeutic effects of exposure therapy.). A secondary purpose of this study is to examine
      predictors for PTSD and response to PTSD intervention in active duty military personnel,
      veterans, and civilians who served in Iraq/Afghanistan. Psychophysiological factors (e.g.
      heart rate, blood pressure) and/or a genetic polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) obtained from a
      saliva sample will be examined.

    <description>CAPS (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale)is a structured clinical interview designed to assess the 17 DSM symptoms of PTSD. The CAPS provides categorical ratings of diagnostic status as well as a quantitative index of symptom severity. The CAPS total severity score is based on the subject's response to the 17 items that assess the frequency and intensity of current PTSD symptoms.</description>
