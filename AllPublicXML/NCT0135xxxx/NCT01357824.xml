  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of Sellick´s Maneuver, a firm pressure on
      the throat, just below the Adams apple, to occlude the esophagus, in order to prevent
      aspiration of gastric contents, on intubation with a flexible fiberscope. The result of this
      study will be participate in the discussion of the importance of Sellick´s Maneuver.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients included in this study has volunteered after sufficient information, and must be
      ASA-class I-II, 18 years or more, and must not have indications for a rapid sequence
      induction.

      The patient will be intubated twice, with and without Sellick´s maneuver. It is blinded to
      the intubating physician, in which order this pressure is applied.

      The outcomes measures will be time of intubation, oxygen saturation before and after
      intubation and a Cormack Scale graduation of the visibility of the vocal cords. The
      intubation will be failed, if it cannot be performed under 120 seconds, or if the patients
      desaturate to 95% or less.

    <description>The patient will be intubated with a flexible fiberscope, Olympus model, under the application of Sellick´s maneuver, with the recommended 30 Newtons pressure, and also, as control, be intubated with a sham Sellick´s maneuver, with 0 Newton. The order of the pressures is randomized, and it is blinded to the intubating physician by a cloth which of the maneuvers that is used. The pressure is measured be a pediatric cuff, which is pressed against the throat.</description>
