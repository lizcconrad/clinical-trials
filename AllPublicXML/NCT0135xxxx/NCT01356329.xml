    <textblock>
      Prophylactic treatment will start from surgery until the patients are discharged from the
      hospital(18). Then each patient will have 2 follow up visit in gyne- oncology clinic. The
      first visit will be 2 weeks from discharge &amp; the second visit will be 3 months after surgery.
      In each visit patient will be evaluated for any evidence of thrombo-embolic events clinically
      &amp; radiologically if needed ( spiral CT, V/Q scan &amp; lower limp Doppler ). Any side effect or
      adverse reaction will be reported &amp; it will be evaluated if it is related to the drug used or
      not.

      This study is a phase IIIB, randomized, open label, non-comparative controlled trial, and
      prospectively enrolling 150 females to assess the efficacy and safety of the Enoxaparin
      (Group A) and Unfractionated Heparin (Group B) for Gynecologic Oncology Patients In the
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who required surgery or admission for the prevention of VTE.

      Patients who meet the Inclusion Criteria and signed an informed consent will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (Group A or Group B). Subjects will be assigned
      consecutive study numbers according to a predetermined random code generated by the
      Biostatistician. The randomisation will be based on a 1:1 ratio.
