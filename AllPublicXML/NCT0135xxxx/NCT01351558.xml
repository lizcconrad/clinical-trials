    <textblock>
      There is ample evidence that exercise therapy is beneficial with respect to pain in patients
      with osteoarthritis of the knee. However, the pain relieving mechanisms are unknown. To
      enhance the efficacy of exercise therapy a deeper understanding of the involved mechanisms is
      needed.

      Different exercise types may affect the pain sensitivity differently. It is hypothesized that
      non-specific exercises (i.e. exercises that does not involve the knee) reduces the processing
      of pain in the central nervous system (central sensitivity) to knee joint pain in healthy
      subjects. It is also hypothesized that exercises that involve the knee (i.e. specific knee
      exercises) reduce the sensitivity of pain receptors in the knee (peripheral sensitivity) in
      healthy subjects.

      Healthy volunteers are recruited and randomised to one of four interventions: 1: Muscle
      strengthening exercises involving the thigh muscles; 2: Muscle strengthening exercises
      involving the shoulder muscles; 3: Cardio-vascular fitness exercises; or 4: Control (no
      exercises). The active interventions include exercises three times per week for 12 weeks.
      Pain sensitivity and a range of explanatory variables is measured before the interventions,
      after 4 weeks and after 12 weeks.

    <description>Muscle strengthening exercises of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles will be performed based on a standard muscle strengthening exercise paradigm: 3 sets with 6-8 repetitions (corresponding to approximately 80% repetition maximum (RM)) will be performed. The training load will be progressed by means of weekly estimates of muscle strength to ensure a constant load of 80% RM. The exercises will be supervised</description>

    <description>Cardiovascular fitness exercises encompass circuit training including exercises on (but not limited to): ergometer cycles, treadmills (running), and cross-trainers. The exercise intensity is aiming at exercises within 60-85% of maximum heart rate (defined as 220 - age). The heart rate is monitored using a standard heart rate monitor. The exercises will be supervised</description>
