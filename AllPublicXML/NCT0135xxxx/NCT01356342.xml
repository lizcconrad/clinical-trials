  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open study of the use of AdimFlu-S (2010-2011 season) vaccine in young subjects
      aged between 6 months old to 18 years old. All participants will be divided into three age
      cohorts. First, participants aged 6 through &lt; 36 months will receive 2 doses of 0.25 mL
      vaccine separated by 4 weeks. Second, participants aged 3 through &lt; 9 years will receive 2
      doses of 0.5 mL vaccine separated by 4 weeks. Third, participants aged 9 through &lt; 18 years
      will receive one dose of 0.5 mL vaccine. Safety outcomes included immediate reactions at the
      time of vaccination, solicited local and systemic reactions within 7 days after each
      vaccination, unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events. Sera prepared from blood
      samples will be collected from each subject immediately prior to, and 4 weeks after each
      vaccination. Anti-hemaglutinin (HA) antibody titers will be determined using the WHO
      haemaglutination inhibition reference technique. The analysis will be observer-blinded. All
      participants will be followed, either by clinical visit or by telephone contact, for 6 months
      after the first vaccination for safety reasons.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity profiles for influenza virus vaccine strains (2010-2011 season) of the AdimFlu-S manufactured by Adimmune Corporation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Serum samples will be obtained prior to vaccination (baseline), and 4 weeks after each vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum samples will be obtained prior to vaccination, and 4 weeks after each vaccination. Serum samples will be tested for anti-hemaglutinin (HA) antibodies by hemagglutinaton inhibition (HAI), and assays will be performed at Adimmune Corporation designated central laboratory. Subjects will be considered to be seronegative if serum HAI titer&lt;1:10. The seroconversion is defined as the post-vaccination serum at least 40 for whom had negative pre-vaccination or a fourfold or greater increase in HAI titers in subjects who had positive pre-vaccination serum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles including the presence or absence of the pre-specified reactogenicity events and other serious/non-serious adverse events of the AdimFlu-S manufactured by Adimmune Corporation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety data will consist of reactogenicity, serious and non-serious adverse events throughout the study, including 7 days after each dose of study vaccine. Vital signs and physical examination will be performed at each clinic visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Reactogenicity events are pre-specified adverse events systematically recorded on diary cards (a grid of check boxes for each event and each day) during the immediate post-vaccination period by all participants. In general, reactogenicity events will be recorded for 7 days after each vaccination. The selection of the events to be collected systematically is based on events expected to occur with wild-type influenza infection.</description>
