      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Hypothesis: Reduction in gut flora by the antibiotic Rifaximin reduces hepatic inflammation
      in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

      Objectives:

      Primary: - To assess whether the endoluminal antimicrobial properties of Rifaximin lead to
      changes in hepatocellular inflammation in NASH Secondary:- To determine whether Rifaximin's
      effect on bowel flora leads to: altered cytokine profile, decreased insulin resistance and
      reduced hepatic steatosis

      - To corroborate previously identified urinary markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      associated with bacterial choline metabolism using urinary proton nuclear magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy

      STUDY DESIGN

      A proof-of-concept open-label randomized controlled cross-over interventional cohort study.

      Twenty four patients with biopsy-proven mild to moderate NASH will be recruited prospectively
      over 9 months and assessed at four time-points after the screening visit: baseline; 6 weeks;
      12 weeks and 18 weeks. Participants will be randomized to receive either Rifaximin 400mg
      twice a day for 6 weeks then standard of care (SoC) for 6 weeks, or SoC for 6 weeks then
      Rifaximin 400mg twice a day for 6 weeks, all undergoing a 6 week observational washout period
      without additional therapy. An additional four patients will be identified as reserve
      patients to be added to the cohort in case patient from the original cohort drop-out.

      Based on existing biochemical data on patients attending the sub-specialty
      Hepatology-Diabetology NASH Clinic at St Mary's drawn from the &quot;HEP-Base&quot; database, 24
      patients will provide 90% power to detect a 25.0 IU/l change in biochemical steatohepatitis
      with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (two-tailed). This study design offers three key
      benefits: (1) all patients receive the treatment, making the design efficient; (2) a control
      group for all patients under the same study conditions (3) all patients will be observed for
      a 6-12 week washout phase following Rifaximin treatment, providing data on duration of
      effect.

      Suitable patients will be identified using the departmental HEP-Base patient database, which
      holds detailed clinical records for all patients seen in the sub-specialty NASH clinic at St
      Mary's Hospital, and assessments carried out in the Hepatology Clinical Research Facility
      (CRF) at St Mary's. Patients will not be randomized as they will all receive Rifaximin
      treatment and the same investigations. Patients will be assessed by a medical clinician at
      each assessment point and a dietary, drug and physical activity questionnaire will be
      completed and biometrics measured.

      The total duration of the study is 18 months. The duration of each patient's participation is
      18 weeks. Twenty four participants will be recruited directly into the study and up to 4 as
      reserves, all of whom will be patients with NASH.

      STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES

      The study outcome measures are chosen to support directly the study objectives as follows:

      Primary outcome measures:

      • Change in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values

      o by &gt;25 IU/l (approximately 33% of mean NASH values) after 6 weeks of therapy

      Secondary outcome measures:

        -  Change in insulin resistance

             -  assessed using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp method within the CRF

             -  serum triglyceride levels and lipoprotein profile will also be assessed during this
                procedure

        -  Change in hepatic triglyceride content

        -  Change in serum cytokine levels

        -  Change in the quantity and composition of faecal flora

        -  Urinary metabolic profiling

        -  Change in plasma levels of bacterial endotoxin

      PARTICIPANT ENTRY

      PRE-ENROLLMENT EVALUATIONS

      All patients will be assessed clinically as part of their routine clinical assessment in the
      subspecialty NASH clinic at St Mary's Hospital. This is not considered part of the clinical
      study and will have occurred prior to enrolment. This assessment will include:

        -  medical history

        -  thorough clinical examination

        -  clinical investigations to exclude coexisting liver disease, co-morbidities and
           medications that might confound the study outcomes, as specified in the exclusion
           criteria including, but not limited to:

             -  serology for viral hepatitis (B, C)

             -  serum iron studies

             -  autoimmune screening

             -  clinical serum lipid profile

             -  fasting glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin

             -  ultrasound of the liver

      If clinically indicated, patients will have been referred for a liver biopsy for the
      diagnosis of suspected NASH and the resulting histology will be evaluated according to the
      criteria of Kleiner et al.

      WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Participants may withdraw from participation in the study at any stage,
      without having to give their reasons and without jeopardizing future clinical care. They will
      be asked their reasons for withdrawal and, if the reasons are provided, these will be
      included in the study data.

      Other withdrawal criteria include:

        1. Any participant with a serious adverse event precluding further drug administration

        2. Significant deviation from the protocol

        3. Significant non-compliance with the study medication

        4. If the subject is no longer eligible

        5. If the subject is lost to follow-up

        6. If the Investigator believes that withdrawal is in the best interest

      If participants wish to withdraw consent, data pertaining to them will be managed as follows:

        1. Participants who have not attended a study visit and not taken treatment will not be
           considered to have enrolled in the study and will be excluded from all analysis

        2. Participants who have attended fewer than 3 study visits and have not started the
           Rifaximin treatment will be excluded from all analyses

        3. Participants who have attended fewer than 3 study visits and have not completed the
           course of Rifaximin treatment will be included in analysis of adverse events, but
           excluded from analysis of the study endpoints

        4. Participants who have completed 3 or more study visits and the six-week course of
           Rifaximin treatment will be included in the final analysis of study endpoints

      Reserve patients will be recruited in the event of participant withdrawals as per points 2
      and 3 above.

      Samples and data collected during the period of time that the participant has consented to
      the study will be retained for analysis as laid out in the study protocol.

      RANDOMISATION AND ENROLLMENT PROCEDURE This is an open-label, randomized, crossover,
      controlled study. At the enrollment visit, a sealed envelope containing a letter assigning
      the participant to either group A (n=12) or group B (n=12) will be given to each participant
      at random by the research nurse, who will be unaware of the assignment within the envelope.

      TREATMENT ARMS All participants will receive Rifaximin 400mg (as 2 x 200mg tablets) orally,
      twice daily for six weeks. Group A will receive Rifaximin for the first 6 weeks then SoC.
      Group B will receive SoC for 6 weeks then Rifaximin.

      DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITY There are no plans for dose modifications as the drug is
      minimally absorbed. In addition, pre-clinical animal studies. If adverse events occur,
      treatment will be stopped.

      INTERACTION WITH OTHER DRUGS Rifaximin does not cause cytochrome P450 enzyme induction and
      does not induce CYP3A4 at normal doses (in participants without severe liver dysfunction). In
      addition, as it is minimally absorbed, it is not considered to interact with other drugs.

      ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP

      The total duration of the study is 18 months. The duration of each patient's participation is
      18 weeks, of which patients will only receive active treatment for 6 weeks with the remainder
      being SoC run-in or wash-out with SoC. Twenty four participants will be recruited initially,
      with up to 4 reserves, all of whom will be patients with NASH.

      One screening visit will take place following liver biopsy in the sub-specialty NASH clinic
      at St Mary's Hospital. Enrollment and randomization will occur at the screening visit.

      Following enrolment into the study, participants will attend four assessment points:
      baseline; six weeks; 12 weeks and 18 weeks. They will be asked to attend the NASH clinic 3
      months after the end of the study for routine assessment and provision of a final urine and
      stool sample. At each visit study investigators will record compliance and any adverse
      events. Where possible, these visits will be coordinated with NASH clinic visits to minimize
      inconvenience to the patients.

      A baseline visit will take place after the screening visit and between two weeks and one year
      after liver biopsy. At this visit, a clinical assessment and external examination will be
      made, blood will be drawn for laboratory analysis, stool provided for microbial analysis and
      urine provided for metabolic profiling. Investigators will assess the participant's diet and
      lifestyle, including the use of a brief questionnaire. All patients will undergo magnetic
      resonance (MR) scanning and the patients in Group A will undergo the hyperinsulinaemic
      euglycaemic clamp study. The patients in Group A will be given a study prescription to obtain
      Rifaximin from the hospital pharmacy and start the treatment for six weeks.

      At six weeks, patients will attend their second assessment visit. At this visit, a clinical
      assessment and external examination will be made, blood will be drawn for laboratory
      analysis, stool provided for microbial analysis and urine provided for metabolic profiling.
      Investigators will assess the participant's diet and lifestyle, including the use of a brief
      questionnaire. All Ppatients will also undergo MR scanning and the hyperinsulinaemic
      euglycaemic clamp assay. The patients in Group A will have finished their course of Rifaximin
      and will continue SoC, while the patients in Group B will be given a study prescription to
      obtain Rifaximin from the hospital pharmacy and start the treatment for six weeks.

      At 12 weeks, patients will attend their third assessment visit, having finished a 6 week
      course of Rifaximin and a 6 week course of SoC. At this visit, a clinical assessment and
      external examination will be made, blood will be drawn for laboratory analysis, stool
      provided for microbial analysis and urine provided for metabolic profiling. Investigators
      will assess the participant's diet and lifestyle, including the use of a brief questionnaire.
      All patients will undergo MR scanning and the patients in Group B will undergo the
      hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp study.Patients will also undergo MR scanning and the
      hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp assay. The patients in Group B will have finished their
      course of Rifaximin and all patients will continue SoC.

      At 18 weeks, patients will attend their fourth and final assessment visit. At this visit, a
      clinical assessment and external examination will be made, blood will be drawn for laboratory
      analysis, stool provided for microbial analysis and urine provided for metabolic profiling.
      Investigators will assess the participant's diet and lifestyle, including the use of a brief
      questionnaire. The patients' participation in the study is now complete and they will return
      to the NASH clinic on a routine clinical basis as appropriate.

      All participants will be invited to return to the NASH clinic 3 months after the end of their
      participation in the study, at which point they will undergo routine clinical assessment and,
      in addition, be asked to provide a stool and urine sample with a paired lifestyle
      questionnaire.

      LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP

      Given the short duration of the study, loss to follow-up is considered to be unlikely.
      However, If participants do not attend a scheduled visit, attempts will be made to contact
      them using the contact details supplied by them at their screening visit. If contact is lost,
      data will be included in the study analysis as follows:

        1. Participants who have not attended a study visit and not taken treatment will not be
           considered to have enrolled in the study and will be excluded from all analysis

        2. Participants who have attended fewer than 3 study visits and have not started the
           Rifaximin treatment will be excluded from all analyses

        3. Participants who have attended fewer than 3 study visits and have not completed the
           course of Rifaximin treatment will be included in analysis of adverse events, but
           excluded from analysis of the study endpoints

        4. Participants who have completed 3 or more study visits and the six-week course of
           Rifaximin treatment will be included in the final analysis of study endpoints

      Reserve patients will be recruited in the event of participant loss to follow-up as per
      points 2 and 3 above.

      TRIAL CLOSURE

      The trial will be closed at the time that the 24th participant has completed the 18 week
      study period. The study will be open to recruitment until this point in case of participant
      withdrawal or loss to follow-up. The status of the trial will be updated on the
      Clinicaltrials.gov website. The clinical research unit at Imperial College London and the
      regional ethics committee will also be informed.
