  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multi-system autoimmune disease impacting the
      physical, social, psychological health and quality of life of patients. Fatigue and pain are
      aspects of SLE patients which affect their health related quality of life (HRQOL). The
      purpose of this study is to determine the effect of milnacipran on fatigue in SLE patients
      with widespread pain (WSP) or fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). A secondary objective will be to
      determine the effect of milnacipran on pain and quality of life measurements. Fifty SLE male
      and female patients, 18 years and older, will be recruited for a 15-week study, in which
      patients will be receive 14 weeks of milnacipran 50-100 mg twice a day or placebo.
      Measurements of fatigue, pain, and HRQOL will be compared between the milnacipran and placebo
      groups at the screening visit, baseline visit, week number 6, and week number 14. Milnacipran
      has been shown to be an effective treatment for pain, fatigue and physical function in FMS
      patients. To date, no clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of fatigue
      in SLE patients with concomitant WSP or FMS. The investigators hypothesize, based on FMS
      studies, that the milnacipran treated patients will have less fatigue than those in the
      placebo group. In addition, compared to control arm, those treated with the study drug will
      have less pain and improved quality of life.

    <description>Patients administered milnacipran will receive a dose escalation to 50 mg twice a day over 12 days and continued at this dose until week 6. If tolerated and a 15% improvement in fatigue from baseline is achieved by assessment on the FSS, then patients will continue taking 50 mg twice a day until the end of the study on day 98 (week 14). Otherwise, the dose of milnacipran will be titrated upward to 100 mg twice a day over 12 days and continued at this dose until day 98 (week 14).</description>
