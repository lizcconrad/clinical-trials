  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-lasting phase of precursors of invasive cancer, i.e. dysplasia or intraepithelial
      neoplasia (IEN), is particularly relevant among risk determinants. At present, about 15-20%
      of all breast cancers are diagnosed in a non-invasive phase. Despite their good prognosis,
      women with breast IEN (lobular and ductal intraepithelial neoplasia, LIN and DIN) have a
      10-15/1000 annual risk of invasive disease (8-10 times the same age general population), and
      thus represent an important target for chemoprevention. In the National Surgical Adjuvant
      Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP-P1 trial), tamoxifen use at 20 mg/day was associated with a
      86% reduction of invasive breast cancer in women with previous atypical ductal hyperplasia
      (ADH) (RR=0.14, 95% IC, 0.03-0.47) and with a 56% risk reduction in women with previous
      Lobular Carcinoma in situ (LCIS) (RR=0.44, 95% IC, 0.16-1.06). However, tamoxifen use in this
      setting is hampered by serious adverse events attributable to its partial estrogenic
      activity, such as increased risk of endometrial cancer and of venous thromboembolism, which
      have significantly limited its broad use in chemoprevention.

      To improve the risk-benefit ratio, the use of lower doses of the drug has been proposed.
      Recent trials from our group have shown that the dose can be reduced up to 1 mg/day with no
      loss of tamoxifen antiproliferative activity on breast cancer. By contrast, a dose of 5
      mg/day does not increase endometrial proliferation and is associated with a decrease of the
      estrogenic activity of tamoxifen on insulin like growth factor (IGF-I), sex hormone-binding
      globulin (SHBG) and antithrombin-III, with a potential decrease of venous thromboembolic
      events. Moreover, tamoxifen exhibits a high tissue distribution, so that a dose of 5 mg/day
      attains at the breast tissue level a concentration 10 times higher than that needed to
      inhibit cell growth in vitro. The promising clinical activity of 5 mg/day of tamoxifen is
      supported by an ongoing 2x2 phase IIb trial of low-dose tamoxifen and fenretinide in
      premenopausal women, where tamoxifen lowers breast cancer events compared with placebo. The
      cytochromeP450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme mediates oxidation of N-desmethyl tamoxifen to endoxifen,
      the most active metabolite of tamoxifen. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CYP2D6*4
      (1846G&gt;A) allele accounts for 75% of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype and poor metabolizers
      showed a trend to a higher risk to develop a breast event compared to wildtype.

    <description>The Primary endpoint of the proposed trial is to assess if tamoxifen at a low dose, 5mg/d reduces the incidence of invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DIN 1c, 2, 3) of the breast, in woman operated for lobular intraepithelial neoplasia (LIN1, 2 and 3) or ER-positive ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN 1b, DIN2, DIN3, 1a excluded) of the breast.</description>
