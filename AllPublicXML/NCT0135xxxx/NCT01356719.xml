  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheostomies are artificial airway devices inserted into the neck. They can become
      displaced and lead to patient harm. Other than external visual inspection, there is no
      currently described system for describing the position of a tracheostomy tube within the
      airway. The investigators propose to undertake endoscopic inspection of the tracheostomy tube
      with a small fibre-optic camera from above and also through the tube to visualise its
      position within the airway. The investigators will take anonymised paired images and then
      score these using 6 different scoring systems. The investigators will determine which scoring
      system provides the simplest and most reproducible scores between 6 blinded assessors. A
      clinically useful scoring system could be used in future to predict problems with
      tracheostomy positioning.

      Aims &amp; Outcomes

        1. Develop an appropriate bedside scoring method for describing the position and
           orientation of a tracheostomy tube tip when viewed endoscopically from a standardised
           position

        2. Secondary aims

             -  Correlate the endoscopic views of the tracheostomy tube with the trans-laryngeal
                views.

             -  Is it possible to predict the trans-laryngeal view from the endoscopic view.

             -  Does the position of a tracheostomy tube tip change when the patient is
                repositioned following percutaneous tracheostomy (when viewed endoscopically)

             -  Equipment training: Compare the number of supervised endoscopies required to
                consistently achieve the required standardised view

        3. Primary outcome

           - Determine the scoring system with the best inter-rater agreement as defined by
           weighted kappa and intra-class correlation coefficients.

        4. Secondary outcome

           - Assess correlation between the best scoring system (chosen by above) with the
           translaryngeal view

        5. Tertiary aim - Assessment of training: Determine the number of attempts required to
           obtain adequate standardised views. This will be a manikin based assessment to
           demonstrate competence in performing the endoscopies for the study before any procedures
           are undertaken on patients.
