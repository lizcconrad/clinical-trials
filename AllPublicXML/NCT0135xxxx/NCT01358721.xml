    <time_frame>response rate will be assessed by tumor assessments every 6 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate for BMS-936558 as measured by the number of subjects with an objective response + the number of subjects with stable disease divided by the total number of treated subjects with measurable disease at baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>disease control will be assessed by tumor assessments every 6 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of objective response for BMS-936558 as measured by the time when the criteria for an objective response are first met until the date of documented disease progression or death</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of response will be assessed by tumor assessments every 6 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of stable disease for BMS-936558 as measured in subjects whose best overall response is stable disease as the time from baseline until the date of documented disease progression or death</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of response will be assessed by tumor assessments every 6 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity of BMS-936558 as measured by the detection of human antibodies against BMS-936558</measure>
    <time_frame>Serum sample collected at baseline, 12 weeks following initiation of study treatment; and during the first 2 follow-up visits in the follow-up phase</time_frame>
