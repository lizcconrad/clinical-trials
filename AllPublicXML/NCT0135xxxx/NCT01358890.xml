      -  The primary aim of this study is to determine the adherence of low- carbohydrate among
           Chinese.

        -  Then compare the effect of low-carbohydrate and traditional Chinese but
           restricted-calories diet on weight loss and metabolic traits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a well established risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
      dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. Along with rapid nutritional and lifestyle
      transition featured as increased energy dense diet intake and reduced physical activity, the
      prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic level and affected more than 70 million Chinese
      adults nowadays. Previous studies suggested that low-carbohydrate diet was an effective and
      safe way to lose weight and had potential benefit on lipids profiles. However, it is still
      unknown whether this diet can be feasible to control the epidemic of obesity and its related
      metabolic diseases among Chinese, whose carbohydrate consumption contribute approximately 55%
      of total energy intake.

      Therefore, the aim of this pilot study is to investigate the adherence and effectiveness of
      two weight-loss diets among Chinese. This will be a randomized, controlled clinical trial. A
      total of 50 overweight or obese nurse assistants will be randomly assigned to receive a
      low-carbohydrate diet or a traditional high-carbohydrate Chinese but restricted-calories diet
      for 12 weeks. The adherence of study protocol and effects of the two diets on body weight,
      waist circumference, body fat, fasting glucose and lipid profile will be evaluated.
