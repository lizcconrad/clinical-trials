             to 75 years.

          -  Subjects with RA diagnosis per the 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria
             per American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR.)

          -  BMI less than or equal to 35 kg/m2 at Screening.

          -  Active RA characterized by DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 at Screening.

          -  Have been stabilized on their current dose (up to 25 mg/week) of methotrexate(MTX) for
             at least 4 weeks before randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)Subjects:

          -  Subjects with severe active RA and are not on a stable therapeutic regimen at
             Screening.

          -  Subjects without significant articular RA.

          -  Relevant history of significant respiratory disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, asthma
             in last 5 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, interstitial
             lung disease, such as pneumonitis and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, as well as
             significant inhalation exposure to silicon and other substances) that required
             treatment and/or follow up under the direction of a physician.

          -  Presence of GM-CSF autoantibodies above normal at Screening.

          -  Abnormal chest x-ray or PFTs as judged by the investigator at Screening as clinically
             significant.

          -  Positive Quantiferon test.

          -  History of clinically relevant hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., to gold therapy)

          -  History of medication use that might have carryover effects during the study.

          -  Previous administration of a GM-CSF modulator within 6 months of randomization, or
             previous administration of a monoclonal antibody or immunoglobulin fusion protein that
             is not (or worded as &quot;other than&quot;) a GM-CSF modulator within 3 months of
             randomization.

          -  Use of any biological therapy other than the test article during the study (informed
             consent to termination visit)

          -  Subjects who consume greater than 14 alcoholic drinks per week for males or 7

          -  Use of parenteral and/or intra-articular steroids, immunosuppressants, investigational
             drugs, and oral anticoagulant drugs within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Oral
             steroid treatment is permitted if the dosage is less than or equal to 10 mg of
             prednisone daily, is stable for a minimum of 4 weeks before the study and remains
             unchanged throughout the study.
