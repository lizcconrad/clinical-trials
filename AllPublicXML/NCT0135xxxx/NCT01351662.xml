  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linking a psychosocial stress intervention with clinical measures of stress in African
      American lupus patients will assess the utility of this method in reducing perceived stress,
      and provide the necessary preliminary steps toward future investigations of potential
      mechanisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To begin to fill this research void, a stress intervention will be piloted and both
      biological specimens and questionnaire responses collected to assess changes in stress state
      following the intervention in patients who participated in the intervention compared to those
      who did not participate in the intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Four months</time_frame>
    <description>Psychosocial stress will be assessed by five validated measures. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), The Perceptions of Racism Scale, modified version of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) health distress scale, adapted by the Stanford Patient Education Research Center, and The Beck Depression Inventory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Biological Indicators of stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Four months</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary specimens will be collected immediately preceding intervention activities, immediately following intervention activities, and four months post-intervention activities for analyses of salivary cortisol and Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Specified markers were chosen because they are easy to collect, relatively inexpensive, and reliable measures of stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Four months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using two instruments that describe a spectrum of quality of life outcomes; The LUP-QOL and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F). Stanford Patient Education Research Center Questionnaires assessing medical outcomes will also be used. These scales also assess whether key behaviors concerning communicating with health care providers and health care utilization have changed.</description>

    <description>The Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP) will be administered to 15 African American lupus patients participating in an ongoing &quot;SLE Clinic Database Project&quot; at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Fifteen other patients will serve as controls and receive usual care.</description>

    <intervention_name>Arthritis Self Management Program</intervention_name>
    <description>Intervention activities will consist of six weekly sessions of the Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP). Sessions will be administered in a group setting with the 15 African American lupus patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the study. Fifteen other patients will serve as controls and receive usual care. Patients participating in the stress intervention will receive six weeks of peer led sessions ranging in disease-specific and more general self-help content. The intervention will include homework assignments to practice and record use of session techniques and to complete worksheets regarding session-specific topics and activities. Usual care will include a brief explanation of the disease and relevant literature.</description>
