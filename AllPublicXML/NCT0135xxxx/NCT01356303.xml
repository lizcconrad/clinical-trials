    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label clinical study prospectively enrolling 40 metastatic patients
      with non small cell lung cancer. The study will enroll patients at King Abdulaziz Medical
      City, Riyadh.

      Sub-sites will be open for patient accrual in selected centers in the Kingdom.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cisplatin/docetaxel is established standard in the first line management of metastatic
      non small cell lung cancer in the United States, Europe and Asia. However, the safety and
      efficacy of this regimen was not studied systematically in Middle Eastern population. The aim
      of this study is to study the efficacy and safety of this regimen in our patient population
