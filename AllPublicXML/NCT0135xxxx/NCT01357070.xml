    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is the disease process that leads to hardening of the arteries which causes
      them to become narrowed. This occurs because fat is first deposited on the inside walls of
      the arteries, then becomes hardened by fibrous tissue and calcium deposition forming a
      semi-hardened accumulation of material known as plaque. As this plaque grows, it narrows the
      channel within the artery and causes a reduction in blood and oxygen supply to the affected
      organ - such as the heart and brain. The investigators now understand that this process is
      caused by inflammation and activation of the immune cells over a period of time. It has been
      proposed that targeting these immune cells and reducing the levels of immune activation can
      protect against cardiovascular diseases.

      Previously it has been observed that consumption of fruit and vegetables rich in
      anti-oxidants can confer a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases. The use of
      anti-oxidants experimentally has shown protective benefits against activation. The
      investigators suggest that inducing anti-oxidant enzymes indirectly may be an effective means
      of providing vascular protection.

      Sulforaphane, a naturally occurring compound found in green vegetables (including broccoli,
      brussel sprouts and cauliflower) is able to protect against cell inflammatory stress by
      inducing a number of anti-oxidant molecules. Targeted studies on the consumption of broccoli
      and related vegetables have been shown to be associated with reduced risk of coronary artery
      disease.

      In the present study the investigators want to test whether the consumption of a &quot;broccoli
      smoothie&quot; containing sulforaphane can protect white blood cells from becoming activated in
      the presence of an experimental stress and how long this protective effect lasts for. To do
      this, the investigators will be analysing inflammatory changes in blood samples taken at
      different times during the study.
