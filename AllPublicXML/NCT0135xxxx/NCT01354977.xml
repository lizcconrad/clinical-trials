  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human aging is associated with increased fat mass, insulin resistance and systemic
      inflammation. In addition to overall increases in fat mass, accumulation of lipid in such
      insulin-sensitive tissues as liver and skeletal muscle appears to contribute importantly to
      insulin resistance. Furthermore, age-related decreases in muscle mitochondrial ATP production
      rate and mitochondrial DNA copy number are likely to contribute to impaired insulin-mediated
      glucose disposal, as well as decreased muscular endurance and activity levels. Additionally,
      systemic inflammation is now believed to contribute to insulin resistance and thus ultimately
      to many age-related disorders, including diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease,
      atherosclerosis and many cancers.

      The purpose of this research is to study the effects of a medication called resveratrol on
      the body's response to insulin (a hormone to control blood sugar), on inflammation and/or on
      specific cells and processes in fat tissue, and on skeletal muscle metabolism and on brain
      function.
