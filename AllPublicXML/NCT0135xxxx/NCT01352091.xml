  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized open-label -phase III study that aims to compare the
      efficacy of Zoladex® combined with Aromidex® for 3-2 years after SERMs (tamoxifen and
      Fareston®) as an adjuvant therapy for 2-3 years with the efficacy of tamoxifen up to 5 years
      for premenopausal breast cancer women with hormone receptor positive, lymph node positive or
      tumor ≥4cm. According to St. Gallen's guideline, hormone receptor positive was defined as
      endocrine responsive and endocrine response uncertain categories (table 3-1), and only those
      with ER or PR expression undetectable were considered as HR negative. The pathological
      evaluation of axillary lymph node could be done by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) when axillary
      nodes were clinically impalpable accompanied with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or
      directly through ALND when axillary nodes appeared to be positive in clinical examination.
      Based on the operating standard of local medical institution, identifying the numbers of
      lymph nodes to do the pathological evaluation and to do the dissection of I- or II-station
      nodes accurately.

             larger than 4cm. Definition of nodes positive is according to the staging system of
             AJCC 6th edition (American Joint Cancer Commission) for breast carcinoma. The
             micrometastasis must be at least 0.2mm

               -  standard breast conservation surgery (BCS), which is lumpectomy or qaudrantectomy
                  accompany with axillary dissection, and the surgical margins of the resected
                  specimen must be negative. BCS must be followed by standardized adjuvant
                  radiotherapy to the partial conserved breast (delivered after adjuvant
                  chemotherapy completed)

                  above, loco-regional radiotherapy after lumpectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy to the
                  chest wall and/or internal mammary nodes and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes,
                  adjuvant chemotherapy

          6. adjuvant endocrine therapy of TAM or Fareston must be started within 6 weeks when
             adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy was finished

          7. The date of randomization must be processed after taking TAM or Fareston for 2 or more
             than 2 years, but not more than 3 years of time

          8. Patients taking neo-chemotherapy are eligible, and lymph node status could be
             identified during surgery before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or after neo-adjuvant
             chemotherapy. The definition of lymph node positive is:

               -  evaluation of lymph node status before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy must include
                  pathological axillary nodes, internal mammary nodes (pN2b option) or
                  supraclavicular nodes (pN3c option) involved. Micro-metastasis (i.e.≥0.2mm,
                  pN1-pN3c) can be identified by the following method: fine needle aspiration (FNA)
                  or sentinel node biopsy (SNB) or sampling/ total procedure of axillary dissection

               -  patients with no nodes positive after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, lymph node
                  positive must be evaluated during surgery. Its definition was the either of
                  following:

                    -  According the clinical practice guidelines of the local cancer center, it is
                       acceptable when positive nodes was identified by SNB or axillary dissection

                    -  There is pathological evidence in lymph nodes positive (pN1-pN3c) during
                       breast surgery after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy

          9. Patients diagnosed as occult breast cancer clinically are found to pathologically have
             primary invasive carcinoma or DCIS with micro-invasive lesion in ipsilateral breast,
             and primary lesion or axillary node metastasis express ER and/or PR positive

         10. Patients with synchronous bilateral cancers are eligible on the condition that If one
             side is IDC and the other side is DCIS, the IDC side should be of the ER and/or PR
             positive phenotype and IF two sides are both IDC, they must be ER and/or PR positive
             phenotype at the same time

         11. Hormone receptor positive (≥＋) is defined as detecting ER or PR expression at any time
             is eligible. The situation of only PR positive and ER negative is eligible, too

         12. According to the standard operation principles for clinical practice of local cancer
             center, patients must be randomized within 4 weeks after definitive physical
             examination, imaging examination and laboratory testing show no evidence of recurrence
             or metastasis

         13. Based on the study objective, all patients are required to be premenopausal as defined
             by
