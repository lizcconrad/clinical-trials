    <textblock>
      Topical Pharyngeal anesthesia (TPA) is widely used during upper endoscopy. Articaine is local
      anaesthetic that have not been previously evaluated in pharyngeal anesthesia for upper
      endoscopy. The aim of this study was to compare pharyngeal anesthesia with 4% articaine to
      placebo (Na0,9%) during gastroscopy in terms of benefit on patients` and endoscopists`
      satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical Pharyngeal anesthesia (TPA) is widely used as an adjunct to sedation during upper
      endoscopy. TPA improves patient tolerance and the ease of endoscopy.1 Methemoglobinemia and
      anaphylactic reactions are serious complications of such topical anaesthetic agents, as
      lidocaine, tetracaine, and benzocaine. Articaine is as a unique amide local anaesthetic that
      possesses both an amide and an ester linkage and this is of clinical significance in
      minimizing the risk of overdose (toxic reaction). In routine dental procedures, articaine is
      a superior anaesthetic to lidocaine. Also, in comparison to lidocaine articaine acts faster
      and its duration of action is shorter what may be an advantage in such relatively fast
      procedures as gastroscopy. Articaine have not been previously evaluated in pharyngeal
      anesthesia for upper endoscopy. The aim of this randomised double-blind placebo controlled
      study was to compare pharyngeal anesthesia with 4% articaine to placebo (Na0,9%) during
      gastroscopy in terms of benefit on patients` and endoscopists`satisfaction.

    <description>Pharyngeal anesthesia with articaine 4% or placebo should randomly and double-blindly applied in turns for every volunteer. In details: 3 ml of Articaine 4%solution or placebo (NaCl 0,9%) will be sprayed into the pharynx 5 minutes before beginning of gastroscopy. Also gastroscope will be lubricated with articaine (or placebo) gel(prepared by adding 4% articaine or 0,9%NaCl in placebo grope to Endopurin® endoscopic lubricant at the day of study).</description>

    <description>Articaine is intermediate-acting local anesthetic (amide type). Like other local anesthetic drugs, articaine causes a transient and completely reversible state of anesthesia (loss of sensation) during (dental) procedures.
In dentistry, articaine is used both for infiltration and block injections.</description>
