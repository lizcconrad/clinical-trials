    <textblock>
      In the majority of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee the disease originates in the
      medial compartment. There are two different approaches to replacing this arthritic area. Some
      surgeons feel that it is always best to replace both the knee compartments with a Total Knee
      Replacement (TKR). Others feel it is best to replace just the damaged component of the knee
      with a Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR). There is little agreement amongst knee
      surgeons. Both interventions are established and well documented procedures, yet little
      evidence exists to support either practice. Each intervention is considered standard care.
      There exists little evidence, however, to prove the clinical and cost effectiveness of either
      management option.

      The aim of the Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial (TOPKAT) will be to assess the
      clinical and cost effectiveness of Total Knee Replacements versus Unicompartmental Knee
      Replacements in patients with medial osteoarthritis. This will be examined using an
      appropriate patient base and long term assessments.

      The trial has a combined device/expertise based allocation depending on the local situation.
      Surgeons who are in equipoise and have sufficient experience to perform both TKR and UKR,
      randomisation and allocation can be based on &quot;device&quot; (UKR or TKR). The same surgeon will
      perform the operation for both arms of the study.

      For surgeons who hold a preference for one treatment over the other, an &quot;expertise&quot; based
      randomisation will then occur. UKR surgeons will work alongside TKR surgeons. Patients
      recruited to the study from these sites will be randomised to one of the treatment options
      and treated by the appropriate surgeon. In such cases the patient is internally referred to
      the other surgeon's operating list.

      Patients will be recruited by their consultant knee surgeons in collaboration with the local
      research team. TOPKAT are hoping to recruit 500 patients altogether, with 250 per arm of the
      trial.

      The design of the study is a single layer multicentre superiority type randomised controlled
      trial of unilateral knee replacement patients. The randomised controlled trial design will
      help reduce and prevent potential bias influencing the evaluation.

      Participants will be randomised to either UKR or TKR. The trial has a combined
      equipoise/expertise approach. It enables surgeons who are not in equipoise to deliver only
      one of the two operations while also allowing surgeons in equipoise to provide both
      operations. A surgeon who is in equipoise ('equipoise surgeon') and has sufficient experience
      to perform both TKR and UKR will deliver the allocated operation (UKR or TKR). The same
      surgeon will perform the operation for both arms of the study.

      Not all surgeons are able to exhibit this equipoise. They may hold a preference for one
      treatment over the other often due to experience/expertise with one type of operation.
      Interestingly, a surgeon may also believe the patient may benefit from one particular
      operation even though they may not be able to perform it themselves.

      Equipoise is difficult to investigate or establish. Self declaration has been used as the
      main approach but in order to sufficiently secure this state the following aspects are
      important:

        -  The equipoise considered must be patient- or individual-based equipoise rather than an
           overall or general category equipoise based on operation type. The surgeon must consider
           their position for each individual patient. Only if they believe that either operation
           will be suitable for an individual patient can the patient then be recruited.

        -  No surgeon will ever knowingly perform what they consider a substandard surgical
           procedure.

      In order to complete the trial by seeking to maximise surgeon participation, an
      'expertise'-based delivery of the intervention will also occur. For this approach there must
      be a surgeon with expertise in TKR and a surgeon with expertise in UKR in the same centre who
      will act together as a 'delivery unit'. Patients recruited to the study who are under the
      care of such a surgeon ('expertise surgeon') will be randomised to one of the two groups and
      treated by the appropriate surgeon. This 'expertise' approach allows for those UKR surgeons
      who work alongside TKR surgeons to team up and participate in the study. Subsequent surgery
      may be carried out by a surgeon different to that at the initial consultation. In such cases
      the patient is internally referred to the other surgeon's operating list. No restriction is
      made upon the number of delivery units within a centre. A surgeon can only be in one delivery
      unit, that is, they are either an 'equipoise surgeon' or an 'expertise surgeon'.

    <description>TOPKAT will be pragmatic in terms of implant selection for the knee replacement operation. Providing the inclusion criteria are met, surgeons will be entirely free to use an implant of their choice or will use the current implants used at their institution. Implant type used on each patient will be recorded.
A partial knee replacement or UKR involves only the diseased area of the joint being replaced. The healthy compartment of the knee is retained and artificial implants are inserted in place of the diseased area. This is done via a minimally invasive surgical procedure.</description>

Providing the inclusion criteria are met, surgeons will be entirely free to use an implant of their choice or will use the current implants used at their institution. Implant type used on each patient will be recorded.
A total knee replacement involves all surfaces of the knee being replaced. The procedure involves excising both diseased and normal femoral condyles, the tibial plateau and often the patella. This is done through a large skin incision which provides easy access to the knee joint. Each component will be replaced with an artificial implant, which may be cemented in position.</description>
