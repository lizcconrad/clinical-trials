  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Less than 10% of patients with a traumatic pain have been managed by a physician before to be
      admitted in an emergency service. 50 % of those patients have been carried by paramedics.
      Premixed nitrous oxide and oxygen is often used by paramedics, but no scientific studies have
      demonstrated its efficacy. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of premixed
      nitrous oxide and oxygen in patients with out-of-hospital moderate acute pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy of premixed nitrous oxide and oxygen (MEOPA) in patients
      with out-of-hospital moderate acute pain.

      The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with pain relief (with a numerical rating
      scale of 3/10 or lower) 15 minutes after randomisation. Secondary endpoints are treatment
      safety and adverse events, time to analgesia and duration of analgesia. This study will
      expect 60 patients assigned in two parallel groups, defined by a randomization scheme. Group
      assignments were sealed in opaque envelopes and will be open sequentially by the dispatcher
      when the paramedic is ready to include the patient. The letter contained in the envelope
      corresponds to the cylinder to use. Eligible patients with a numeric rating scale (NRS) score
      between 3 and 6/10 are randomly allocated to receive either MEOPA, or medical air. Fifteen
      minutes after the randomisation, all patients will receive MEOPA from a distinct cylinder.
      Pain score will be measured at baseline and every 5 minutes until pain relief will be
      obtained. The paramedic blinded to the analgesic treatment groups will do all assessments of
      patients. The safety evaluation will include non invasive monitoring of blood pressure, heart
      rate, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and adverse events collection.
