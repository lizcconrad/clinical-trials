  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis disables approximately 10% of people who are 60 years or older and compromises
      the quality of life of more than 20 million Americans every year. Osteoarthritis is caused by
      the breakdown of cartilage that lines the bones at your joints from daily wear and tear and
      results in pain and restricted function. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total hip
      replacement, is currently one of the most successful and cost-effective treatments used to
      eliminate pain and restore function in those suffering from osteoarthritis. There are
      multiple ways to perform a THA. The main difference between each type is the point of
      incision in relation to a muscle on the outer surface of your hip bone: gluteus medius. The
      incision performed can be anterior (in front of the muscle), anterolateral (in front and to
      the side of the muscle), or posterior (from the back). Each of these approaches has its own
      advantages and disadvantages, but there is no evidence available that makes one better than
      the other. The purpose of this study is to determine which of the three approaches to THA is
      the most effective. The main outcome that will determine the most effective approach is the
      functional ability of the patients included in this study at 52 weeks. The investigators will
      also compare whether the patient's: length of hospital stay, use of assistive devices, need
      for revision surgery, ability to return to work, ability to relieve pain, complication rate,
      and quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that the anterior approach will be the
      most effective approach in reducing the rate of post-operative complications after THA.

    <arm_group_label>Anterior Approach THA</arm_group_label>
    <description>500 Patients will be included who have received a total hip arthroplasty using the Anterior Approach. The anterior approach to total hip arthroplasty refers to an internervous approach to the hip, where the incision is made from the middle of the iliac crest, then curved distally and laterally to the anterior superior iliac spine (Kelmanovich et al., 2003). To optimize feasibility and applicability of our results, we will not standardize the use of cemented components, the implant manufacturer, or the femoral head size. Surgeons will use the manufacturer specific guides for insertion of the total hip arthroplasty.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Posterior Approach THA</arm_group_label>
    <description>100 patients will be enrolled who have received a total hip arthroplasty using the posterior approach. The posterior approach is performed by making a curved incision posteriorly on the greater trochanter (Jolles &amp; Bogoch, 2004). The fascia lata is then incised and the fibers of the gluteus maximus split using dissection (Jolles &amp; Bogoch, 2004). To ensure the feasibility and applicability of our findings, we will not standardize the use of cemented components, the implant manufacturer, or the femoral head size used in the posterior approach.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Anterolateral Approach THA</arm_group_label>
    <description>100 patients will be enrolled who have had a total hip arthroplasty using the anterolateral approach. An anterolateral approach to THA utilizes an intermuscular approach by incising the patient posteriorly and distally to the anterior superior iliac spine, extending distally to the greater trochanter along the shaft of the femur (Kelmanovich et al., 2003). To optimize the feasibility and applicability of our results, the implant manufacturer, femoral head size or the use of cemented components will not be standardized in this study.</description>
