  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed research is to identify individuals in southeastern Arizona aged
      65 years and older who have new onset seizures (or newly diagnosed epilepsy) and monitor them
      for at least two years. In doing so the investigators will be able to describe the public
      health burden of this condition and to identify factors that predict clinical outcomes and
      health care needs in this population, using quantitative, administrative, and qualitative
      data. The aims of this proposed research are 1) to determine the two-year incidence of newly
      diagnosed epilepsy in the target population, 2) describe health care resource utilization of
      the target population using Medicare data, 3) validate the use of Medicare beneficiary data
      to estimate incidence of epilepsy, and 4) describe the burden of this condition in different
      ethnic groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seniors who have had new onset seizures or newly diagnosed epilepsy will be recruited from
      emergency departments (EDs), neurology clinics, primary care clinics (including geriatric
      clinics), and other service providers from networks maintained by the Area Agencies on Aging
      that serve seniors in southeastern Arizona. Data will be collected in the form of bi-annual
      surveys,administrative data (from Medicare), in-depth interviews, and focus groups. Medicare
      data will be used to describe and evaluate the likelihood of being hospitalized or admitted
      to a long-term facility within two years of being diagnosed, medication adherence and
      persistence, and comparing the cost of care between the newly-diagnosed seniors with epilepsy
      and comparable seniors who do not have epilepsy. The feasibility and validity of using the
      Medicare claims data to estimate newly diagnosed epilepsy will also be assessed. Finally, the
      impact of epilepsy on health related quality of life, mental health, perceived stigma, and
      family and caregivers will also be evaluated through surveys and qualitative data collection
      methods, and ethnic differences will also be described.
