      The purpose of this study is to measure the changes in the Treatment Satisfaction
      Questionnaire for Medication in the areas of effectiveness, side effects, and convenience of
      administration of each medication in Primary Immunodeficiency Disorder (PIDD) subjects
      transitioning from subcutaneous Vivaglobin® to Hizentra®.

      This trial will evaluate subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency Disorder (PIDD) who are
      currently self-infusing Vivaglobin therapy for at least six months prior to changing to
      Hizentra® therapy. Following screening and enrollment, subjects will continue to self-infuse
      Vivaglobin® for seven infusions and then be converted to subcutaneous Hizentra® treatment
      which they will continue for the next 6 months. The study will determine if Hizentra®
      provides improved subject satisfaction by Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for
      Medication. Diaries related to the local site reactions, the number of infusion sites per
      subject/per dose, volume of Hizentra® per site, duration of infusions, systemic side effects
      of the new medication and dose on IgG levels and antibody titers, and local site reactions
      with Hizentra®.
