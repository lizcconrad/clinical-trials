  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following arthroscopic shoulder surgery a small but significant number of people suffer
      severe postoperative pain.

      This study aims to predict which patients are at risk of developing severe post operative
      pain so that they may be targeted with a more aggressive post operative pain regimen.

      Patients presenting for elective (day case) arthroscopic shoulder surgery for either
      Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression (ASD Group) or Rotator Cuff Repair (RCR Group) are
      recruited. Using a Cefar PainMatcher, a pain and sensory threshold assessment tool,
      consenting patients will have their preoperative pain thresholds recorded. The patients will
      then have a standard anaesthetic administered with TIVA (propofol/remifentanil) and either a
      subacromial injection (ASD Group) or interscalene block (RCR Group). Four days following
      surgery a telephone questionnaire will be completed by the patients recording their worst
      pain score since surgery.
