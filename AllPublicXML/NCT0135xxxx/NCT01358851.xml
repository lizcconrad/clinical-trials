    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LAS 41005 compared to
      cryotherapy in subjects with moderate to severe hyperkeratotic actinic keratosis (punch
      biopsies).

    <description>Histological clearance at 8 weeks after end of treatment with LAS 41005, respectively 14 weeks after first cryotherapy. Histological Status will be measured by Histological Biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis of AK and the grade.</description>

    <description>The clearance rate (complete/partial) of AK lesions (determined by clinical evaluation) in the treatment area (target areas A and B) will be measured by comparing the total AK lesion counts pre-treatment (on Day 1 before study treatment has been applied) with the lesion counts measured.</description>
