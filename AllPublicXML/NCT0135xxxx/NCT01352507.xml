  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether, after two 8-week treatment
      periods, male patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) in China prefer 20 milligram (mg)
      tadalafil or 100 mg sildenafil. This trial consists of two treatment periods of 8 weeks each
      and an extension phase of 8 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks.

        <title>Change in Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) Question 2</title>
        <description>Participant-assessed diary that assessed the mean change from baseline in the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to SEP Q2, &quot;Were you able to insert your penis into your partner's vagina?&quot;. The SEP Q2 score was determined as the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; responses to SEP Q2 out of all sexual attempts recorded during the time period. Change was defined as the percentage of “yes” responses at endpoint minus the percentage of “yes” responses at baseline. Change in percentage of “yes” responses to SEP Q2 at Week 8 and Week 18 were averaged to produce an overall change in SEP Q2.</description>

        <title>Change in Psychosocial and Interpersonal Relationship Scale (PAIRS) Sexual Self-Confidence Domain</title>
        <description>PAIRS was a self-administered, 29-item scale that assessed the broader psychological and interpersonal outcomes associated with ED and its treatment. Each question was rated on a Likert scale that ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The sexual self-confidence domain score was the average score for Items 5, 10, 15, 23, 27, and 29. Sexual self-confidence domain scores ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Change was defined as endpoint minus baseline domain score. Change in PAIRS sexual self-confidence domain scores at Week 8 and Week 18 were averaged to produce an overall change in PAIRS sexual self-confidence domain score. Higher scores were indicative of greater sexual self-confidence.</description>

        <title>Change in International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Sexual Desire Domain</title>
        <description>Self-reported sexual desire over the past 4 weeks. IIEF sexual desire was the sum of Q11 and Q12. Scores ranged from 1 (low/almost never) to 5 (very high/almost always) for each question, with the total possible score for the 2 questions ranging from 2 to 10. Change was defined as endpoint minus baseline domain score. Change in IIEF sexual desire domain at Week 8 and Week 18 were averaged to produce an overall change in IIEF sexual desire domain score. Higher scores were indicative of increased sexual desire.</description>

Each question was rated on a Likert scale that ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The spontaneity domain score was the average score for Items 3, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, and 28. Spontaneity domain scores ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Change was defined as endpoint minus baseline domain score. Change in PAIRS spontaneity domain at Week 8 and Week 18 were averaged to produce an overall change in PAIRS spontaneity domain score. Higher scores were indicative of greater spontaneity.</description>

        <title>Change in International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Erectile Function Domain</title>
        <description>Self-reported erectile function over the past 4 weeks. IIEF erectile function was the sum of Q1 through Q5 and Q15 of the IIEF. Q1 through Q5 were scored 0 (low/no erectile function) to 5 (high erectile function) and Q15 was scored 1 (no/low confidence) to 5 (high confidence). IIEF erectile function domain scores ranged from 1 to 30. Change was defined as endpoint minus baseline domain score. Change in IIEF erectile function domain at Week 8 and Week 18 were averaged to produce an overall change in IIEF EF domain score. Higher scores were indicative of better erectile function.</description>
