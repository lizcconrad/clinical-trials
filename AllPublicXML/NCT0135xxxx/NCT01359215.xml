      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pediatric anesthesia is associated with
      long-term hippocampal dysfunction
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrary to a longstanding belief, anesthesia has lasting effects on the neonatal brain. In
      rats anesthesia causes death of brain cells, ill-timed conversion of stem cells to nerve
      cells and a certain kind of brain defect up to 8 months later. This brain defect is called a
      hippocampal deficit because it resembles the type of defect that people have when a structure
      in the brain called the hippocampus has been injured, removed or is no longer functioning.
      However, to date it is unknown if anesthesia given to human infants causes a lasting
      hippocampal deficit, which might manifest itself as memory problems and academic failure
      despite normal intelligence. The investigators will test the hypothesis that anesthesia for
      more than 2h given to children of less than 2 years of age without coexisting diseases of the
      brain or the heart causes long-term impairment of hippocampal function. Using state of the
      art hippocampal and general brain function testing the investigators will compare hippocampal
      dependent and hippocampal independent memory as well as general cognitive function and
      emotional state in 10 year-old children that underwent at least a 2h anesthetic at less than
      2 years with that of a matched control group that did not undergo an anesthetic.
