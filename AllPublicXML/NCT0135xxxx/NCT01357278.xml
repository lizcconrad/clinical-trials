  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to target risk factors for falling, such as improved
      quadriceps muscle strength,balance and bone mineral density (BMD), to reduce the risk of
      osteoporotic fractures. Furthermore, to improve quality of life for patients with
      osteoporosis through an active rehabilitation program.

      Sub-goals:

        1. To assess the effect of active rehabilitation on risk factors for osteoporotic fractures
           (muscle strength, bone mineral density, balance and frequency of falling) in women with
           low bone mineral density (BMD)(t-score&lt;1.5) and radius fracture?

        2. To assess how active rehabilitation affect the quality of life of women with low bone
           mineral density(BMD) (t-score&lt;1.5) and radius fracture?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Norway has one of the worlds highest rates of fractures, and osteoporosis is a major risk
      factor. People with established osteoporosis (low bone density including fractures)
      experience a lot of pain, reduced physical function and quality of life. Treatments related
      to osteoporotic fractures cost the Norwegian society approximately five billion NOK per year.
      Over the past few years there has been an increasing focus on active rehabilitation in terms
      of physical activity as a major factor in preventing osteoporotic fractures. It is still
      unknown what type of training, as well as frequency, volume and intensity of activity that is
      necessary to achieve effect on risk factors for osteoporotic fractures. There are only
      limited organized exercise offers available for these patients, and health personals are
      quite often unsure what recommendations they should give. In addition, the patients are often
      hesitant participating in physical activities due to fear of falling and the risk of new
      fractures. The primary objective is therefore to assess if active rehabilitation can reduce
      the risk for osteoporotic fractures, as well as improving quality of life for women with
      established osteoporosis. The patients will be recruited from The Centre of Osteoporosis at
      Ulleval University Hospital and will be randomised into an intervention group (n=40) and a
      control group (n=40). The intervention consists of active rehabilitation 3 times a week for 6
      months (OsteoActive). Our model is based upon the Canadian model. The results from the
      project will be published in international recognized scientific papers, and as information
      to health personals who work with this patient group. In the long term it is desirable that
      the clinicians treating osteoporotic patients can recommend active rehabilitation based upon
      a model developed on the findings from this study.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Bone Mineral Density will be measured by means of &quot;Double X-ray Absorptiometry&quot; (DXA, Lunar, Prodigy). DXA is a measuring technique using x-rays with very low ray exposure. The method is exact, reliable, and the measuring time is briefer than for any other way to measure BMD. The scanned areas will be hip, femur neck and trochanter, arms, and lumbar spine.</description>

    <measure>Dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic balance will be evaluated with Four Square Step Test (FSST).FSST is a dynamic standing balance test used to test balance in both multiple fallers (2 or more falls within the last 6 months) and non-multiple fallers (fewer than 2 falls within the last 6 months. Two FSST are completed using the best score of the two trials</description>

    <description>The quality of life will be evaluated by means of SF-36. SF-36 measures the patient's own health related quality of life. The instrument is divided into eight sub-scales (physical function, role limitations, physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social function, role limitations, emotional, and mental health). The SF-36 is scored to a 0-100 scale for each sub-scale, the higher the score the better the health status.</description>

Following the 6 minutes walk test, the subjects will answer the following question on &quot;Borgsskala&quot; for measuring how exhausting they experienced the walking test, &quot;on a scale from 6-20, where 6 indicates very easy and 20 indicates very exhausting&quot;.</description>
