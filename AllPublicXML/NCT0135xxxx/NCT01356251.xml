  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to learn about how mesothelioma affects patients' emotional and
      physical well-being. Also, the investigators would like to learn more about what patients
      need and how they deal with this illness. This information can help us find ways to lessen
      physical and emotional strains. Part of the study tests an alternate way of giving emotional
      support through the Internet. By providing support online, patients can participate in the
      comfort of their home.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will summarize acceptability and gather pilot data on the promise of the intervention. Acceptability in this study will be assessed through the enrollment rate (percentage of eligible individuals consented and recruited into the Internet-based discussion group). The adherence rate will be the percentage of enrolled patients who complete all virtual group sessions.</description>

    <description>Part 1 surveys mesothelioma patients' psychological and physical symptom burden and quality of life by administering a set of questionnaires that covers topics including coping, interpersonal support, mood, anxiety, and overall quality of life. All mesothelioma patients who complete the questionnaires in part 1 will be offered an opportunity to participate in a trial of a therapeutic Internet-based discussion group. The groups will consist of either approximately 3-5 surgical patients or approximately 3-5 non-surgical patients. The groups will run for approximately 60 minutes once a week for six consecutive weeks.</description>
