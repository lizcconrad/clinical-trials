    <textblock>
      Collateral growth and coronary angiogenesis are chronic adaptations to myocardial ischemia.
      Collateralization helps to restore blood flow and as a result salvages myocardium in severely
      ischemic myocardial regions. Thus, good collateral development in patients with severe
      coronary artery disease (CAD) improves ventricular function and prognosis (1-3).

      However, coronary collateral development is different among patients even with similar
      degrees of coronary artery stenosis. Several factors, such as diabetes mellitus (4) and
      duration of myocardial ischemic symptoms (5) have been reported to effect coronary collateral
      development. At the cellular level, inflammatory cells, especially monocytes have an
      important role in collateralization. In a series of experimental studies with animals, it has
      been shown that monocytes are important elements for development of collateral vessels (6-7).
      In a recent study, it has been demonstrated that increased circulating monocyte count is
      related to good collateral development in patients with stable coronary artery disease (8).

      Monocytes in human blood are heterogeneous and can be classified into two subsets according
      to the presence or absence of the FcγRIII receptor CD16 (9): CD14++CD16- monocytes
      characterized by high level expression of the CD14 cell surface receptor but no expression of
      CD16 receptor, and CD14+CD16+ monocytes characterized by the co-expression of CD16 receptor
      with either high or low level expression of the CD14 receptor. These subsets differ in
      function and response to several cytokines.

      Our aim in this study was to find out any possible relationship between the levels of
      circulating monocyte subsets and coronary collateral development.
