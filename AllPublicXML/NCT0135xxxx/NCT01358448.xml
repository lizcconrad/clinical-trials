  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2007 the Expert Committee published recommendations on the prevention and treatment of
      childhood obesity. These recommendations outlined four interventions intended for advancement
      based on the child's age, body mass index (BMI), and response to treatment. The initial
      stage, Prevention Plus, is to be implemented in the primary care setting and focuses on
      primary care providers monitoring growth monthly and delivering intervention messages that
      target dietary and leisure-time behaviors that most contribute to energy imbalance in
      children. Little research has evaluated the efficacy of these recommendations. Thus the
      primary goal of the proposed pilot study is to test the feasibility of the Prevention Plus
      stage for treating childhood overweight and obesity in a primary care setting. As the cost of
      interventions is a large barrier to the translation of evidence-based research into primary
      care settings, a second goal of the project is to evaluate program cost-effectiveness.
