    <textblock>
      The rational for the study is to add a thin self-adherent dressing on critically ill
      patients. Evaluate if the dressing might protect the skin for further breakdown.Participants
      will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 5 days.

      <recruitment_details>The recruitment period was from 17 May 2011 - 29 June 2011. The study was conducted at four intensive care units in Sweden.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Window</title>
          <description>WindowTM is a protective layer that may reduce the shear and friction on the skin and may help to prevent skin breakdown. Window TM provides instant tack adhesion that minimizes the requirement of extra pressure in order to fixate well. The product does not leave residues and the adhesion level does not increase over time.
Critically ill subjects treated within intensive care have a high risk to developing pressure ulcers, this is because they are almost invariably limited in their overall physical activity changing their position in bed and it is very common with impaired circulation and/or using specific medication which also can lead to high risk of developing pressure ulcer.</description>

Window TM provides instant tack adhesion that minimizes the requirement of extra pressure in order to fixate well. The product does not leave residues and the adhesion level does not increase over time.
Critically ill subjects treated within intensive care have a high risk to developing pressure ulcers, this is because they are almost invariably limited in their overall physical activity changing their position in bed and it is very common with impaired circulation and/or using specific medication which also can lead to high risk of developing pressure ulcer.</description>
