  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if participants have changes in dopamine cells in
      their brain using DaTSCANâ„¢ brain imaging. Dopamine cell loss occurs in Parkinson's disease
      (PD) and other degenerative Parkinsonian disorders, but does not occur in most other movement
      disorders such as essential tremor or dystonia. DaTSCAN, which is also known as
      123I-Ioflupane, is a new compound that has been developed by General Electric, Inc. and has
      been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help doctors detect changes in
      dopamine. This test is performed by injecting DaTSCAN into a vein in the arm, and after a few
      hours, a large amount of DaTSCAN temporarily accumulates in an area of the brain where there
      are a lot of dopamine brain cells. Because DaTSCAN contains a small amount of radioactive
      iodine, it allows doctors to use a special machine called single photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT) scanning to detect the location and amount of radioactivity in the brain
      and help determine if there are changes in brain dopamine. It is hoped that this study will
      help doctors detect the presence of dopamine changes even before symptoms are present. This
      study will evaluate DaTSCAN in people with PD, those who are at risk for developing PD (e.g.,
      those with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep disorder (iRBD) and those who are heterozygous
      or homozygous for Gaucher's disease (GBA) mutations) and those who are healthy volunteers.
