    <textblock>
      The protein ST2 is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family. Blood concentrations of the
      soluble isoform of ST2 (sST2) are increased in inflammatory and heart diseases and are
      considered a prognostic marker in both. The Presage™ST2 assay was recently shown to meet the
      needs of quality specifications of laboratory medicine. Soluble urokinase plasminogen
      activator receptor (suPAR) levels reflect inflammation and elevated suPAR levels are found in
      several infectious diseases and cancer. Both sST2 and suPAR have recently been introduced as
      sensitive biomarkers for patients with septicemia. Both may be promising or even superior
      alternatives to currently established sepsis markers leading to an improvement of outcome in
      patients with septicemia. However, a clinical study which clarifies kinetics of values over
      time/possible correlation with causative pathogen/progress/deterioration of septic patients
      is urgently needed before these biomarkers can be established in clinical routine.

      Primary study objectives To clinically evaluate sST2 and suPAR in patients with bacteremia
      /septicemia. To correlate results with causative bacterial organisms, response to or failure
      of antiinfective treatment, severity of clinical status as well as outcome.

      To study the kinetics of the test results and to correlate the sST2/suPAR results with other
      well established infection markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, blood counts).

      Natural endpoints of the study will be patient's death or complete recovery.

      This is an explorative study. To meet the objectives both novel biomarkers will be clinically
      evaluated in a cohort of 500 in-patients with septicemia at the University Hospital Graz.
      Starting the day a patient's blood culture turned positive the investigators will collect
      samples every 12h within the first two days and then every 24h.Measurement of sST2 and suPAR
      values will be done retrospectively. To analyze clinical sensitivity/specificity of the novel
      biomarkers sST2 and suPAR as prognostic factors for development of bacteremia/septicemia, a
      second cohort consisting of 250 in-patients will be investigated in a longitudinal matter.
      Patients without a previous positive blood culture test during the current episode of disease
      for which blood cultures are ordered by a physician will be included and sST2 and suPAR
      levels will be determined from samples taken simultaneously with this first blood cultures.

      The two most common causative pathogens of septicemia (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
      aureus) as well as cases of fungemia (Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and others) will be
      included in the first study group. At our hospital the estimated yearly cases of
      bacteremia/fungemia (230 for Escherichia coli, 150 for Staphylococcus aureus, and 50 for
      fungi) will be included in the first study group. Furthermore, the two biomarkers will be
      determined in 70 cases of septicemia with other bacterial pathogens and sepsis due to viral
      pathogens or viremia for evaluation of further clinical impact of these two biomarkers.

    <description>All patients &gt;18 years admitted to the University Hospital Graz, Austria, with positive blood cultures tested in the Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University Graz, or the Institute for Hygiene, Microbiology and Environmental Medicine, Medical University Graz, are screened for study inclusion. Patients eligible for the study have to have Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae or medically relevant fungi / viral pathogens identified as causative pathogen.
The estimated total number of patients included in this first study cohort will be 500.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 2</arm_group_label>
    <description>All patients &gt;18 years admitted to the University Hospital Graz, Austria, will be screened for study inclusion if the attending emergency department physicians on the very first visit suspects bacteremia/fungemia/sepsis and consecutively orders blood cultures. Patients will be included in this second cohort if these initially taken blood culture turns positive (n=200) or stays negative (n=50) at the Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University Graz. As soon as the number of 50 is reached for the control group enrollment will be stopped for this group.
As soon as the proposed number of 250 patients is reached enrolment for this second cohort will be stopped. Patients enrolled in cohort 2 may also be consecutively enrolled in cohort 1.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Validation Cohort</arm_group_label>
    <description>To verify the employed Presage™ST2 assay established in our study laboratory for its intended use, a total number of 70 left over plasma samples obtained from septic patients which have prior been tested for sST2 with the same assay at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Barmherzige Brueder Linz, Austria, will be retested. This cohort therefore serves as a validation cohort.</description>

      Left over EDTA-whole blood samples will be used for both, the Presage™ST2 assay and the
      suPARnostic™ assay except for the additional EDTA-whole blood samples taken on day 1 and 2 of
      study enrollment being only tested for sST2.
