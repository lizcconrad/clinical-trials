      The purpose of this study is to determine if intrathecal administration of baclofen can
      reduce symptoms of severe tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum disorder.

      Some people with autism spectrum disorder do not like to be touched. This is referred to as
      tactile defensiveness. Baclofen is a drug approved for treatment of spasticity in patients
      with conditions such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury.
      Intrathecal means that baclofen is administered by injection into the spinal canal. In this
      study, each patient will undergo a trial administration of intrathecal baclofen and the
      effect of intrathecal baclofen on symptoms of tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum
      disorder will be evaluated.

      Each patient will have three visits in connection with the study. First, there will be a
      screening visit in which the investigators determine if the patient is eligible to
      participate in the study. To participate, each patient must have autism spectrum disorder,
      severe tactile defensiveness, and meet other listed criteria. At the second visit, each
      patient will undergo the intrathecal baclofen trial procedure. The procedure used is the
      standard procedure to determine if intrathecal baclofen is effective for treatment of
      spasticity. In this study however, instead of evaluating the effect of intrathecal baclofen
      on spasticity, the investigators will evaluate the effect of intrathecal baclofen on symptoms
      of tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum disorder. The trial procedure and evaluation
      will require about one day. At the third visit, the follow up visit, the investigators will
      evaluate and discuss the patient's response to the treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of autism prior to study entry

          2. Exhibits these specific symptoms of autism:

               -  Tactile Defensiveness

               -  Increased sensitivity to sensory stimulation

          3. Patients must be scored as &quot;Always&quot; for &quot;Reacts emotionally or aggressively to touch&quot;
             on a modified Short Sensory Profile Questionnaire. Additionally, patients must score
             &quot;Always&quot; or &quot;Frequently&quot; in the other categories of a modified Short Sensory Profile
             Questionnaire

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Allergy to baclofen or compounds with similar structure

          2. Unable to be evaluated by the chosen efficacy measures

          3. Any condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator will place the patient
             at increased risk of adverse events or preclude completion of the study

          4. Concomitant use of any medication that in the opinion of the principal investigator is
             contraindicated with intrathecal baclofen administration

          5. Females of child-bearing potential who have a positive urine pregnancy test at visit 2
