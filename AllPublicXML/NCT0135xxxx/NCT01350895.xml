    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most frequent endocrine disorder of reproductive
      age women, affecting an estimated 9-18% of all women in this age group. To diagnose of PCOS
      in early life is especially important because it is now thought to increase metabolic and
      cardiovascular risks. Investigating PCOS is crucial as it is now considered to increase
      metabolic and cardiovascular risk, thereby impacting the health of women to a much greater
      extent than previously thought. We are plan using retrospective analysis to evaluate the
      clinical and biochemical presentation of PCOS in different aged groups.
