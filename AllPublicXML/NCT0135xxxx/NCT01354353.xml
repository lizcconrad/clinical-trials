  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an inpatient, open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of LY2140023 given at doses expected to reflect multiples of the anticipated
      therapeutic exposure under clinical investigation. In the event of poor tolerability in part
      A of this study part B may be conducted to explore higher doses using titration. Subjects in
      both parts A and B will participate in a 9 day wash-out period of current medication (Study
      days 1-9); subjects coming into the study on aripiprazole will remain on their current
      therapy throughout.
