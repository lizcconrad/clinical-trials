  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Avastin (bevacizumab) in
      combination with interferon alpha-2a as first-line treatment in patients with advanced and/or
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Data will be collected from each patient as per routine
      clinical practice of the Investigator (maximum of 52 weeks, until disease progression
      /unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent) and/or based on the local label.
