  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the improvement of efficacy results with current immunosuppressive regimens (about
      15% of incidence of acute rejection), the security schemes used do not show the same
      results.The most worldwide used regime is tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone. Despite
      the favorable efficacy results in our population, the use of this combination is associated
      with higher incidence of viral infections such as cytomegalovirus, and gastrointestinal
      events, two common causes of hospital readmissions after renal transplantation at our
      institution.Given this, the investigators propose a study of our own initiative that attends
      our local needs: identify the best strategy among the therapeutic options available to
      maintain the result of current effectiveness and improve the safety profile for kidney
      transplant recipients.This protocol is a prospective, randomized, single center, designed to
      compare the safety and efficacy of three immunosuppressive regimens: (1) single dose of
      antithymocyte globulin, reduced exposure to tacrolimus, everolimus starting on day 2 after
      transplantation and prednisone; ( 2) basiliximab, reduced exposure to tacrolimus, everolimus
      starting on day 2 after transplantation and prednisone; (3-control group) basiliximab,
      reduced exposure to tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone.Our hypothesis is that a single
      dose of antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab induction therapy in combination with low doses
      of tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone results in comparable efficacy observed in patients
      receiving tacrolimus / mycophenolate / prednisone, but with a better safety profile.

      To ensure efficacy, the investigators added to the regimes the induction with monoclonal or
      polyclonal antibody. To improve the toxicities associated with the current scheme, the
      investigators replace the use of mycophenolate by everolimus and the investigators reduced
      the dose of tacrolimus.

      Patients will be monitored for blood levels of tacrolimus and everolimus to ensure adequate
      exposure to immunosuppressive agents.

      Primary end-point: The incidence of CMV infection or disease during the first year of
      transplantation.Secondary main end-point: the incidence of treatment failure defined as a
      composite end-point of BCAR, graft loss, death, loss to follow up.

      The investigators anticipate enrolling 300 patients within 12 months. Only low risk adult
      candidates for first renal transplants from living or deceased donors will be considered for
      enrollment. Patients will be excluded if they have been receiving immunosuppressive therapy
      before transplantation; have received an investigational medication within the past 30 days;
      have a known contraindication to the administration of antithymocyte globulin; if tested
      positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); if had had cancer (except nonmelanoma skin
      cancer) within the previous 2 years. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and women of
      childbearing potential who will be not using condoms or oral contraceptives will be excluded.
      Patients with any panel reactive antibody (PRA) equal to or above 50%, class I or class II,
      will also be excluded. Study visits will be performed at pre transplant, days 0, 1, 7, every
      week up to month 6 and month 12.
