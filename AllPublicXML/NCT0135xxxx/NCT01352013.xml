    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if omega-3 fatty acid supplements are more effective
      than an inactive placebo at reducing pain, reducing fatigue and elevating mood in patients
      with fibromyalgia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women aged 18-65.

          -  A diagnosis of FM according to the American College of Rheumatology classification
             criteria(Wolfe et al., 1990)

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test at enrolment and willingness not to become pregnant for
             the duration of the study.

          -  Pain levels of at least 4 on 10-cm VAS at the time of recruitment.

          -  Ability to communicate in English or in French.

          -  Willing to sign an informed consent.

          -  If the patient is taking medication or natural health product (excluding omega-3
             containing products) to treat fibromyalgia, she must be on a stable regimen for a
             minimum of two weeks before recruitment and be willing to keep this stable medication
             or natural health product regimen throughout the study period.

          -  If the patient is using other therapies to treat fibromyalgia such as TENS,
             acupuncture, exercise, psychotherapy, massage, physiotherapy, etc, she must be doing
             so for a minimum of two weeks before recruitment and be willing to continue those
             therapies throughout the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of anticoagulants (Coumadin® or Plavix®), having a bleeding disorder or being
             scheduled for a surgical procedure. This is because omega-3 fatty acids can prolong
             bleeding time, although doses we propose to use are safe (see Risks section)

          -  Allergy to fish, olive oil, medium chain triglycerides, lemon, green tea, vitamin E or
             tylenol

          -  Past (within the last year) or present specific dietary supplementation with omega-3
             fish oil or other natural health products containing omega-3 fatty acids (e.g. flax
             seed oil, krill oil, etc) or regularly eating more than two fatty fish meals/week
             (salmon, mackerel, sardine, flounder, herring, or any other fish considered to have a
             high level of omega-3 fatty acids).

          -  Patient enrolled in another research study involving any treatment.

          -  Patient engaged in active litigation

          -  Regular use of recreational drugs

          -  Alcohol consumption &gt; 10 units/week

          -  Morbidly obese patients

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Uncontrolled major medical conditions. Neurological problems. Current psychiatric
             condition. Chronic pain condition other than FM.
