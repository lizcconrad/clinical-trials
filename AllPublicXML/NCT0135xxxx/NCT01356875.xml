  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transfusional dependence has been associated closely and independently with low survival in
      patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), especially in patients at low risk according to
      IPSS. Treatment of patients with hydralazine + valproic acid as an alternative to treatment
      with 5-azacytidine has lower cost and possibly as effective with fewer side effects. The
      objective of this phase II study is to determine the effectiveness of combination therapy
      with hydralazine + Ac. Valproic compared with best supportive care. The investigators will
      select 42 patients per group, and after 14 weeks of treatment the investigators will study in
      both groups the hematological response (transfusion-dependent, hemoglobin, cytogenetics and
      morphology) and treatment safety (adverse reactions and vital signs) to 1 year after starting
      treatment. The concentration of hemoglobin, the number of transfusions, platelets,
      neutrophils and other continuous variables in both groups will be compared by Student t or
      Mann-Whitney, as appropriate. For comparison of cytogenetic and morphological response and
      other categorical variables between groups Chi square will be used. And within each group the
      investigators will compare each of these variables before and after treatment by t-test for
      paired data or Wilcoxon test.
