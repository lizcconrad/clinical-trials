  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A trial to improve the quality of life of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) by evaluating the symptomatic improvements in lung cancer patients receiving external
      radiation with or without high dose internal radiation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with advanced NSCLC to compare the added benefit of High Dose Rate Intraluminal
      Brachytherapy (HDRIB) with External Beam Radiation (EBR). Benefit will be assessed by
      measuring the proportion of patients who achieve symptomatic improvement in lung cancer
      symptoms.
