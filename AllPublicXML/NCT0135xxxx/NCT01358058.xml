  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the investigators are looking at a type of radiation called proton
      radiation. Proton radiation has been shown to deliver virtually no radiation beyond the area
      of the tumor, sparing surrounding normal tissue from exposure. This may reduce side effects
      that patients would normally experience with conventional radiation therapy.

      In this research study the investigators are looking to determine if proton radiation with a
      reduced field size will be as effective in controlling tumor growth as photon therapy, while
      reducing the treatment-related side effects observed in patients with brain tumors.

    <textblock>
      Proton radiation will be delivered daily for approximately 6 weeks. Subjects will be assessed
      weekly for side effects. Each visit will take about 15 minutes.

      Subjects will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 84 months after
      their last proton radiation treatment. They will receive a physical exam, MRI, have blood
      tests (about 4 teaspoons) and answer questionnaires regarding medical history, quality of
      life, and emotional well-being. Subjects will also receive a neurocognitive exam annually.
