      The aim of the proposed research is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of a portable wireless
      electroencephalography (EEG) device (Biosignal Micro-EEG) to standard EEG in identifying
      abnormal EEG patterns (mainly non-convulsive seizure and non-convulsive status epilepticus)
      in emergency department (ED) patients with altered mental status. Comparing the the accuracy
      of EEG recordings and interpretations of Micro-EEG to those of standard EEG will allow the
      investigators to assess the utility of this novel device in the ED patients with altered
      mental status. The unique qualities of Micro-EEG device could potentially facilitate easier
      access to EEG test in all ED patients.

      This study will also provide valid information regarding the prevalence of non-convulsive
      seizure in ED patients with altered mental status.The gold standard for diagnosing
      non-convulsive seizure would be standard EEG.

      All study participants will undergo electroencephalography using the two devices (standard
      EEG and micro-EEG) and a combination of standard electrodes and Electro-Cap in a randomized
      order: 1. Standard EEG with standard EEG electrodes, 2. Micro-EEG with standard EEG
      electrodes, and 3. Micro-EEG with Electro-Cap electrodes.

      Formulated Research Question:

      Population: ED patients with altered mental status (AMS) Intervention: Micro-EEG Comparison:
      Standard EEG Outcomes: 1. Sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratios of
      micro-EEG in identifying non-convulsive seizures and abnormal brain activities 2. The
      concordance of EEG interpretations between micro-EEG and standard EEGs recordings Design
      Prospective cross-sectional

      Definitions:

      Altered Mental Status: Any acute change in level of arousability or responsiveness (e.g.
      confusion, lethargy, delirium, coma, aphasia, disinhibition, labile/blunted affect or
      unexpected psychosis).

      Types of AMS (for the purpose of the study):

        1. AMS alone

        2. AMS with non-specific motor activity (subtle motor movement such as eye blinking,
           nystagmus, focal motor movements, or myoclonus)

        3. Prolonged AMS following one or more tonic-clonic seizures suggesting status epilepticus
           Non-convulsive seizure (NCZ):A seizure without clonic or tonic activity or other
           convulsive motor activity.

      Status Epilepticus (SE):SE is defined as 1. More than 30 minutes of continuous seizure
      activity or 2. Two or more sequential seizures without recovery of consciousness between
      seizures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with apparent and immediately correctable cause of AMS upon presentation
             (determined by ED attending physician during initial evaluation):

               -  Patients with finger stick or serum glucose less than 60 mg/dl

               -  Patients with hypothermia

               -  Patients with hyperthermia, heat exhaustion or heat stroke

               -  Patients with opioid overdose responding to Narcan

          2. Patients who cannot undergo EEG recordings because of severe head and injury,
             hemodynamic instability, transfer to operating room, etc.)

          3. Hemodynamically unstable patients (SBP &lt; 90 mmHg)

          4. Uncooperative or combative patients on whom the EEG simply cannot be obtained.
