  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACTG A5275 was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over design
      pilot study evaluating the effect of atorvastatin on biomarkers of inflammation,
      coagulopathy, angiogenesis, and T-lymphocyte activation in HIV-1 infected individuals with
      suppressed HIV-1 RNA on stable protease inhibitor based antiretroviral therapy with fasting
      LDL cholesterol &lt; 130 mg/dL.

      Atorvastatin is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high
      cholesterol. Atorvastatin has also been able to lower the level of inflammation blood tests
      in certain other diseases but has not been studied for this purpose in people who have HIV.
      The main goal of this experimental study is to see how taking atorvastatin affects
      inflammation blood tests in people infected with HIV who do not need to take medicine for
      high cholesterol. In addition to observing the effects of atorvastatin on the level of
      inflammation measured in the blood, this study evaluated if atorvastatin is safe for people
      with HIV who are also taking medication for HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since people started taking HIV medications, illness from AIDS has decreased, but other
      serious diseases like heart disease (heart attacks) and certain kinds of cancer have
      increased. HIV causes inflammation (irritation) inside the body that cannot be felt but can
      be measured by levels of certain inflammation blood tests. Inflammation may contribute to
      diseases (such as heart attacks) that have become some of the leading causes of death in
      people with HIV. HIV therapy can partially lower levels of inflammation measured in blood,
      however, levels of inflammation in people who have HIV who are taking certain kinds of
      anti-HIV drugs may remain high compared with those found in people not infected with HIV.

             prior to study entry. A single RNA &quot;blip&quot; of &lt; 500 copies/mL during this time period
             was permissible if RNA levels immediately before and after were below the limits of
             quantification for the assay.

          -  Laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to study entry- Absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) 750/mm3, Hemoglobin â‰¥ 9.0 g/dL for female subjects,10.0 g/dL for male

             months after the first enrollment, and subsequently the D-dimer eligibility criterion
             was completely cut off a year later.

          -  For females of reproductive potential (women who had not been post-menopausal for at

             must use at least 2 reliable methods of contraception, (condoms, without a spermicidal
             agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap without spermicide; an IUD; or hormone-based
             contraceptive), for 2 weeks before study treatment, while receiving study treatment,
             and for 6 weeks after receiving study treatment. As hormone-based contraceptives
             (oral, transdermal, or subdermal) can affect coagulopathy biomarkers, subjects who
             plan on using such a contraceptive during the study must be taking the same product
             for â‰¥ 4 weeks prior to screening and be encouraged to continue throughout the duration
             of the study if medically feasible.
