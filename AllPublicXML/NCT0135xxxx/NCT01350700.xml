  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous study (MW2004-011-02), patients with burn wounds had their damaged skin removed
      by either standard of care treatment or by Debrase Gel Dressing (DGD), which is composed of
      enzymes that dissolve the damaged skin selectively (DGD removes only the damaged skin and not
      other parts of the skin).

      The burn wound, like any other wound, heals by the formation of scar at the injured site in
      order to replace the destroyed tissues. Scarring is not a static process, but rather a
      dynamic one, changing over time, especially during the first 24 months post-injury.

      Scars and patients' quality of life from two treatment arms (DGD and SOC) will be compared in
      order to evaluate the long term influence of damaged skin removal and wound care techniques
      on scar formation and maturation.
