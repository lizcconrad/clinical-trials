      This is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm clinical phase II study to further
      characterize the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in patients with or without systemic
      pretreatment metastatic ocular melanoma.

      The DeCOG-MM-PAL11-Trial will be continued only for patients with ocular melanoma because
      sufficient numbers of cutaneous and mucosal melanoma patients have already been recruited. In
      order to allow the separate subgroup analysis as planned in the protocol for ocular melanoma
      it is mandatory to focus the recruitment to this patient population. Only this will guarantee
      a valid evaluation of all cohorts. Ocular melanoma is defined as melanomas originated from
      uvea, the choroid, the ciliary body and conjunctiva. (see McCartney ACE &quot;Pathology of ocular
      melanomas&quot; British Medical Bulltta, 1995, Vol 51, No 3 pp 678-693) The same criteria and
      treatment procedure as those used before will be applied for the patients with advanced
      ocular melanoma. Since no treatment standard in those patients does exist, also patients
      without prior systemic treatment can be included in this study. Therefore, the 5th inclusion
      criterion has been adapted in order to enrol the eligible patients.

      Treatment:

      Treatment with the anti-CTLA-4 mAb Ipilimumab monotherapy of each patient in the scope of
      this trial is defined as induction plus re-induction of eligible patients until 12 months
      after first receipt of study medication

      Induction phase:

      Ipilimumab will be applied to melanoma patients according to the protocol of the completed
      Medarex study MDX-010-20: Ipilimumab by IV infusion, 3 mg/kg, day 1 (Week 1), 22 (Week 4), 43
      (Week 7), 64 (Week 10)

      Re-induction:

      Patients who progress following stable disease of â‰¥ 3 months duration starting from diagnosis
      at week 12 tumor assessment or patients who have progressed following an initial response
      (partial or complete) assessed at week 12 may be offered additional cycles of therapy with
      the originally assigned treatment regimen until off-treatment criteria are met, provided they
      meet re-treatment eligibility requirements. No patient will be re-treated if they experience
      a Grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal or certain other immune-related adverse events (irAE)
      (refer to section 5.2 and 5.3). No patient with disease progression following the first cycle
      of study medication will be permitted to be re-treated with study medication.

      Examinations:

      The disease will be assessed at baseline, after 12 weeks and for patients with stable disease
      or better responses, thereafter every 12 weeks in the absence of PD with a maximum of one
      year. Response evaluation will be done according to immune-related response criteria (Wolchok
      et al., CCR 2009).

      All patients who prematurely discontinued treatment due to a drug-related adverse event prior
      to Week 12 (in the absence of disease progression) will return for all study visits and
      procedures including Week 12 and, if appropriate, further re-staging assessments. Any patient
      with documented progression at any scheduled re-staging visit and who will not receive any
      re-induction will undergo no further re-staging visits.

      Follow-up phase:

      Survival will be assessed every 3 months after the final dose of Ipilimumab until the end of
      the follow-up phase for the individual patient. FU phase for each subject is 1 year following
      first treatment dose. End of study will be at recruitment finished plus 1 year post start of
      treatment of last patient thus ensuring that 1 year survival rate can be estimated.

      Study duration:

      End of study is 1 year post LPFV. Recruiting period for the ocular melanoma:

      Period of recruiting 12-18 months Enrolment start date (FPI): QIII 2011 Enrolment finish date
      (LPI): QI 2013 End of study: QI 2014

        is minimized.

        WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful
        surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy)
        or is not post-menopausal.

        Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products,
        skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an
        intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent
        pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg, vasectomy)
        should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

        WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or
        equivalent units of HCG) at Baseline within 7 days before the start of ipilimumab and at

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

          1. The patient requires concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon,
             or other non-study immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive
             agents; other investigation therapies; any other systemic therapy for cancer including
             any other experimental treatment.

          2. The patient requires chronic use of systemic corticosteroids. Systemic steroids for
             management of symptoms due to brain mets should be avoided if possible or subject
             should be stable on the lowest clinically effective dose. Topical or inhalational
             steroids are permitted.

          3. Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study treatment.

          4. Active autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease,
             including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are
             patients with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune
             origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis).

          5. Symptomatic CNS metastases (Remark: Asymptomatic stable, untreated or pretreated
             central nervous system (CNS) metastasis are allowed)

          6. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          7. The patient is known to be positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or other
             chronic infections (HBV, HCV) or has another confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive
             or immunodeficient condition.

          8. The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability
             to give informed consent or to comply with the trial procedures.

          9. Lack of availability for clinical follow-up assessments.

         10. The patient has concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, that
             would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to
             unacceptable risk.

         11. Other serious illnesses, e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics or bleeding
             disorders.

         12. Patients with serious intercurrent illness, requiring hospitalization.

         13. For female patients: the patient is pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing
             potential: Refusal or inability to use effective means of contraception

         14. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

         15. Subjects with melanoma who have another active, concurrent, malignant disease are not
             eligible for this trial, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous
             cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

         16. Previous treatment with ipilimumab
