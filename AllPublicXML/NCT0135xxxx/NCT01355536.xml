  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of preterm birth is rising in most western countries. The causes of preterm
      birth is not fully understood and seem to be multifactorial. The endocrine and metabolic
      aspects are scarcely investigated.The main purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis
      that endocrine and metabolic factors associate to preterm births.

        All women in municipalities having Namsos Hospital as their local Hospital and with preterm
        births from January 1999 to Descember 2006 were identifed by searching birth protocols.
        These women were invited to participate in the preterm birth study group. As controls we
        identified the first term birth occuring in time after each preterm birth. These women were
        invited to participate in the term birth study group.
