  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that target-controlled infusion of remifentanil can reduce cough against
      endotracheal tube during emergence from general anesthesia. We hypothesized that effective
      concentration of remifentanil for preventing cough during anesthetic emergence varies
      depending on the type of main anesthetic agents which is administered with remifentanil
      during general anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effective
      concentrations of remifentanil to prevent coughing during emergence from general anesthesia
      according to main anesthetic agent (sevoflurane, desflurane, and propofol).

    <description>During the emergence from anesthesia, if the patient did not cough, the extubation was defined as smooth emergence and the predetermined effect site concentration of remifentanil for the subsequent patient was decreased by 0.5 ng/mL. Likewise, if the patient coughed anytime around extubation, it was considered a failed smooth emergence and the predetermined effect site concentration for the next patient was increased by 0.5 ng/mL. This up-and-down method was conducted independently for each of the three groups. EC50 of the remifentanil of each group was obtained using the Dixon's method.</description>
