      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Determine how well people tolerated sodium bicarbonate taken by mouth in higher doses
           than those usually given for heartburn.

        -  Determine if sodium bicarbonate can reduce cancer-related pain. Right now, the
           investigators do not know for sure if these higher doses will be well tolerated or if
           they will reduce the pain associated with cancer. The investigators are doing this study
           to see if sodium bicarbonate is well tolerated and if it can reduce the requirements for
           pain medications.

      The study is a single institution, non-randomized, single arm pilot study to evaluate the
      efficacy of adjuvant therapy with sodium bicarbonate for tumor related pain. Patients will
      receive sodium bicarbonate (0.15 g/kg/day for 1 weeks and if tolerated 0.3 g/kg/day for one
      week and if this dose is tolerated 0.6 g/kg/day) for 4 weeks. The sodium bicarbonate will be
      provided to the patient as a powder and consumed after it is mixed with about 250 cc (about 1
      cup) of water. In consultation with the PI, the patients will be permitted to mix the sodium
      bicarbonate with a commercially available drink instead of water provided the liquid has an
      acid/base balance (pH) of 7.4 or greater. Patients with a good tolerance to study therapy and
      with at least a 30% improvement in pain intensity (by VAS) compared to baseline after 3 weeks
      of therapy and who wish to continue study therapy will be allowed to continue sodium
      bicarbonate therapy under the direction of their treating physician. Patients without at
      least a 30% improvement in pain intensity at 3 weeks will discontinue study therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have metastatic or unresectable solid malignancy or hematologic
             malignancy (multiple myeloma or lymphoma) and must have moderate to severe tumor
             related pain (VAS&gt;4) on a stable opioid regimen (at least 3 days of an opiate
             regimen).

          -  No planned palliative surgery, palliative radiotherapy for at least 2 weeks. However
             prior radiotherapy, and surgery is allowed and not limited to the number of procedures
             and courses. Concomitant chemotherapy is allowed. In addition, when it is anticipated
             that chemotherapy may result in rapid pain relief (less than 2 weeks), patients will
             only be enrolled after completing their first cycle of chemotherapy and provided their
             pain level is greater than 4 on the VAS.

          -  No evidence of neurologic or psychiatric compromise which in the opinion of the
             investigator will interfere with completion of study assessments

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months

          -  Age greater than 18 years and able to understand and sign the informed consent
             document

          -  Patients must have an Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status
             less than 4.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with neuropathy and/or neuropathic pain as the only pain syndrome are not
             eligible. Patients with chronic non malignant pain are not eligible.

             initial evaluation will be excluded.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic pressure &gt;140, diastolic pressure
             &gt;90) despite maximal antihypertensive therapy.

          -  Patients unable to ingest of oral sodium bicarbonate (such as patients with dysphagia
             or severe nausea)

          -  Patients with ECOG performance status 4

          -  Patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myeloid leukemia
             are not eligible.

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients are not eligible.

          -  Patients with estimated survival less than 3 months

          -  Patients with known allergy to sodium bicarbonate or patients with preexisting renal
             or acid base disorders for which sodium bicarbonate is contraindicated (such as
             metabolic alkalosis, severe congestive heart failure, hypernatremia, and hypocalcemia
             [see above]).

          -  Patients with severe ongoing infections which places the patients at increased risks
             from therapy in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Patients who are receiving and or will receive, during their participation in study,
             an oral chemotherapeutic agent whose bioavailability could be altered by the ingestion
             of sodium bicarbonate.

    <limitations_and_caveats>This Pilot Supportive Care study ended prematurely due to slow accrual and the initiating principal investigator leaving the institution. The outcome measures were based on 25 evaluable participants and there were only 2 participants enrolled.</limitations_and_caveats>
