    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to demonstrate the higher efficacy of small particles
      Foster® 100/6 (two puffs b.i.d.) versus large particles Symbicort® 200/6 (two inhalations
      b.i.d.), in terms of residual volume reduction over a 12-week treatment period in Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an incurable, debilitating and progressive
      disease that can be fatal. The recent Global Burden of Disease Study ranks COPD as the 6th
      leading cause of mortality and the 12th leading cause of morbidity world-wide. Furthermore,
      trends in the use of medical care resources indicate that the economic cost of COPD continues
      to rise in direct relation to the ageing population, the increase in prevalence of disease
      and the cost of new and existing medical and public health interventions.

             consent obtained by legal representative.

          2. Outpatients with a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD and including:

          3. Patients with COPD exacerbation and/or symptomatic infection of the airways requiring
             antibiotic therapy (at least 5 days) in the 2 months prior to screening and during the
             study period.

          4. Patients treated with depot corticosteroids in the 2 months preceding the visit 1 and
             during the run-in period.

          5. Major surgery in the previous 3 months and during the trial which may affect patient's
