      Research questions:

        1. What is the absolute risk reduction for in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE)
           associated with the use of dual anti-platelet therapy as compared with aspirin alone in
           this population?

        2. What is the absolute risk increase for clinically significant bleeding during the same
           period associated with the use of dual anti-platelet therapy as compared with aspirin
           alone in this population?

      In brief the design of the study is as follows:

        -  We will study patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery within four years of coronary
           stenting.

        -  We will record the anti-platelet agents taken by patients before, during and after
           surgery.

        -  We will record cardiac and bleeding events that occur whilst the patient is in hospital.

        -  We will use the statistical technique of propensity scoring to match patients who have
           similar risk factors and who received different anti-platelet regimens.

        -  We will compare the incidence of cardiac events and bleeding in the matched groups.

      This study will compare the use of aspirin alone with dual antiplatelet therapy (i.e. aspirin
      and clopidogrel) in patients presenting for elective non-cardiac surgery who have undergone
      PCI with either bare metal stent or drug eluting stent placement in the four years prior to
      surgery. The absolute risk reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) with dual
      antiplatelet therapy and the absolute risk increase for clinically significant bleeding
      events with dual therapy will be determined. This will allow the number needed to treat (NNT)
      for the prevention of MACE and the number needed to harm (NNH) for bleeding to be determined
      and the optimal antiplatelet therapy in this setting to be identified.

    <description>This study will record and analyse in-hospital adverse cardiac events. Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) will be defined as a composite of:
Myocardial infarction as defined by the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction(including cardiac arrest and cardiac death as described in this definition).
PCI for a cardiac event occurring following surgery.</description>

    <time_frame>In-hospital stay up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This study will record and analyse in-hospital clinically significant bleeding.
Clinically Significant Bleeding Events will be defined as:
Reoperation for bleeding.
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage
Intracranial haemorrhage
Spinal/epidural haematoma. The transfusion of blood and blood products will also be recorded and compared between patients on dual antiplatelet therapy and aspirin alone.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients maintained on anticoagulant therapy e.g. heparin infusion before and after
             surgery will be excluded. (Patients receiving prophylactic doses of heparin for
             prevention of thromboembolic events will be eligible for inclusion.)

          -  Patients receiving bridging therapy with full anticoagulant does of heparin or other
             drugs to compensate for the withdrawal of antiplatelet drugs will be excluded.

          -  Patients who are anticoagulated with warfarin (INR&gt;1.5 at the time of surgery) will be
             excluded.

          -  Patients receiving full anticoagulation with heparin for a known recent a known
             thromboembolic event (APPT ratio &gt; 1.5) be excluded. -
