  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will enroll 110 patients from approximately 15 Canadian stroke centres.
      Patients coming to the emergency department with bleeding in the brain not due to trauma or
      other known causes who can be treated within 6 hours of onset will undergo CT angiography
      using standard CT scanners (&quot;CAT scan&quot;). Those with a &quot;spot sign&quot;, a type of marker on the CT
      scan that shows the brain is still bleeding, will be randomly assigned to a single injection
      of &quot;factor 7&quot;(a blood clotting drug used in hemophilia) or placebo (inactive saline);
      patients without a spot sign will not be treated. The researchers will look at how much
      bleeding happens after the treatments are administered, as well as clinical outcomes such as
      death and disability. The researchers think that factor 7 will cause the bleeding to stop
      faster and possibly decrease death and disability.

      This phase II double blind RCT will enroll 110 patients from approximately 15 Canadian stroke
      centres. Acute ICH patients who can be treated within 6 hours of onset will undergo CT
      angiography using standard CT procedures. Those with a spot sign will be randomly assigned in
      a 1:1 ratio to a single injection of rFVIIa 80 Âµg/kg or placebo; patients without a spot sign
      will not be treated. The primary endpoint is ICH expansion within 24 hours.

          -  Plan to provide full medical care for at least 24 hours

          -  Assent-consent from patient or LAR prior to enrolment, or a waiver of consent (where
             REB approved) if patient/LAR assent-consent is not possible prior to enrolment.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Brainstem or cerebellar hemorrhage.

          -  ICH secondary to known or suspected trauma, aneurysm, vascular malformation,
             hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, thrombolytic
             treatment, tumour, or infection; or an in-hospital ICH or ICH as a result of any
             in-hospital procedure or illness.

          -  Baseline brain imaging shows evidence of acute or subacute ischemic stroke (chronic
             infarcts are not an exclusion).

          -  Contrast administration within the previous 24 hours.

          -  Evidence of thromboembolic risk factors, defined as any of the following: known
             history within the past 6 months of any of the following: (a) myocardial infarction,
             (b) coronary artery bypass surgery, (c) angina, (d) ischemic stroke, (e) transient
             ischemic attack, (f) carotid endarterectomy, (g) cerebral bypass surgery, (h) deep
             venous thrombosis, (i) pulmonary embolism, (j) any vascular angioplasty, stenting
             (coronary, peripheral vascular or cerebrovascular) or filter (e.g. vena cava
             filter);(k) prosthetic cardiac valve; and/or (l) known history of a high-risk
             thrombophilia (e.g. antithrombin III deficiency, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome,
             protein C deficiency, etc.)

          -  Known hereditary (e.g. hemophilia) or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis or coagulation
             factor deficiency.

             rFVIIa were administered.

          -  Planned surgery for ICH within 24 hours (placement of intraventricular catheter is not
             an exclusion).

          -  Planned withdrawal of care before 24 hours post-ICH onset.

          -  Known participation in another therapeutic trial.

          -  Known allergy or other contraindication to iodinated contrast dye.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to the trial product.

          -  Known unfractionated heparin use - must check PTT and exclude if elevated above upper
             limit of local lab's reference range.

          -  Known low-molecular weight heparin, heparinoid, factor X inhibitor, or direct thrombin
             inhibitor use within previous 7 days.

          -  Known GPIIb/IIIa antagonist use in previous 2 weeks.

          -  Known warfarin (or other anticoagulant) therapy with INR &gt;1.40. Note: if the patient
             is suspected to have cirrhosis, study staff are to wait for the INR value prior to
             dosing, and ensure not to enroll the patient if the INR value is &gt;1.40. Otherwise the
             physician should use their discretion if they believe the patient is not at risk for
             elevated INR.

          -  Concurrent or planned treatment with prothrombin complex concentrate, vitamin K, fresh
             frozen plasma, or platelet transfusion.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy
             test prior to randomization.

          -  Current clinical symptoms suggestive of acute coronary ischemia (e.g. chest pain).

          -  Baseline ECG evidence of acute coronary ischemia (e.g. ST elevation in 2 contiguous
             leads, new LBBB, ST depression).

          -  Baseline platelet count &lt;50,000 or INR &gt;1.40 or elevated PTT
