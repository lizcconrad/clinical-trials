    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine 1) the safety and tolerability of multiple
      intravenous doses of anti-CXCR4 (BMS-936564) as monotherapy and as combination, and 2) the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BMS-936564 in combination with Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone or
      Bortezomib/Dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

          -  A serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection.

          -  Current or recent (within 3 months) gastrointestinal disease or condition that could
             impact the absorption of orally-administered drug.

          -  Inability to swallow oral medication.

          -  Uncontrolled or significant heart disease.

          -  Any other malignancy, excluding basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical
             carcinoma in situ, localized prostate cancer, or superficial bladder cancer stage 0,
             from which the subject has not been disease-free for at least 3 years.
