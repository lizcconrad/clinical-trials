      To determine the safety and manufacturing feasibility of IV autologous chimeric immune
      receptor (CIR) T cells transfected with anti-mesothelin messenger RNA (mRNA) expressing a
      single chain antibody variable fragment linked to the intracellular CD 3 zeta T cell receptor
      domain and the 4-1BB costimulatory domain.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of infusing the study product CIR T cells.
      These T cells are made using T cells obtained through apheresis and introducing the T cells
      to a temporary gene which will cause them to start making a new type of antibody that will
      attach mesothelin (this antibody is found on the surface of the cancer cells). In theory,
      once the modified T cells attach to mesothelin, the cells will be activated to stimulate the
      subject's own immune system to attack the mesothelin cells. This type of modified cell is
      called a T cell transduced transfected with chimeric anti-mesothelin immunoreceptor. Subjects
      will be enrolled serially with all subjects receiving 1xe8 to 1x1e9 modified CIR T cells
      every other day for 3 infusions. Each patient will be observed for 9 days for toxicity
      assessment prior to receiving a second cycle of modified CIR T cells every other day for 3
      infusions. The preceding subject must have completed the two-cycle regimen and been observed
      for toxicity through day 21 before the next subject can be enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have histologically confirmed MPM (epithelial or biphasic).

          -  Subjects must have completed standard first line therapy with a platinum-based double
             regimen and had PD or they must have chosen not to pursue primary standard of care
             therapy.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 to 1.

          -  Age greater than 18 years

          -  At least 2 weeks since prior and no other concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or
             immunotherapy (e.g., interferons, tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, or monoclonal
             antibodies). In addition, the patient must have fully recovered from any adverse
             events related to these agents.

          -  More than 4 weeks since prior and no other concurrent investigational agents.
