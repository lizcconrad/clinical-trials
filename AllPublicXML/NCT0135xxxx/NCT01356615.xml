  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) as well as Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is used as
      anticoagulation during hemodialysis (HD) therapy. In this study the investigators have
      compared clinical efficacy and safety of LMWH and UFH, and their effect on lipid profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, cross-over study the investigators compared the safety,
      clinical efficacy of Clexane (enoxaparin sodium; Sanofi-Aventis) with unfractionated heparin
      in 27 chronic HD patients. Group A received Clexane (enoxaparin sodium; Sanofi-Aventis) and
      were followed up for 3 months and then crossed over to Unfractionated heparin for a further
      3-month period. Group B received Unfractionated heparin first and then crossed over to
      Clexane, each followed up for 3 months. Heparin anticoagulation, clinical clotting and
      hemorrhage were evaluated by visual inspection after blood draining of the air trap.

    <measure>Fibrin/clot formation in the dialyzer and Hemorrhage in Dialysis by visual inspection</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency and degree of clot and fibrin formation in both the dialyzer and lines were scored on a 10-point scale, with 1 indicating no clot formation and 10 sever clotting or total occlusion. This assessment was done after the blood had been returned to the patient by flushing the dialyzer and lines with normal saline. Hemorrhage or thrombosis, during and between dialyses was also noted. Heparin anticoagulation, Clinical clotting and Hemorrhage were evaluated by visual inspection.
Hemorrhages were categorized as weak, moderate, and severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in serum Cholesterol,low and High Density Lipoprotein and Triglycerid.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>27 chronic HD patients. They were randomly assigned to either Clexane (40 mg) or standard heparin, and followed prospectively for 3 months (36 dialyses) and then crossed over to the alternate therapy for a further 3 months Fasting standard lipid profiles were determined at the end of each arm of the study. Total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) were measured.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients in end stage renal failure requiring maintenance dialysis were recruited into
             the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known bleeding disorders

          -  Subjects receiving oral or other forms of anticoagulant therapy (e.g. warfarin,
             aspirin) or drugs that could affect heparin activity (e.g. digitalis, tetracyclines,
             and antihistamines) were also excluded. Subjects continued their usual medication
             (including lipid-lowering therapy ) and were treated in the normal manner by their
             caring physicians during the study.
