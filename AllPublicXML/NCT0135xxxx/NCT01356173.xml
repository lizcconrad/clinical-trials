      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy or NHL
             without leukemic phase that has progressed or failed to respond to at least one prior
             regimen and/or are not candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit

          -  Evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 or IWG response criteria for patients
             with NHL and/or the following: prostate cancer patients with non-measurable disease
             are eligible if they have two rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels &gt;= 5 ng/mL
             measured &gt;= 2 weeks apart that meet the PSA, and Working Group criteria for
             progression prior to initiation of study treatment, and ovarian cancer patients with
             non-measurable disease are eligible if they have two rising CA-125 levels greater than
             the ULN &gt;= 2 weeks apart prior to initiation of study treatment.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at screening

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;= 12 weeks

          -  Adequate hematologic and organ function within 14 days prior to initiation of study
             treatment

          -  Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception for both men and
             women while participating in the study and for 90 days after the last dose of GDC-0349

          -  Willingness to provide archival tumor tissue

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Leptomeningeal disease as the only manifestation of the current malignancy

          -  History of Type 1 or 2 diabetes requiring daily medication

          -  Known untreated central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or treated brain metastases
             that are not radiographically stable for &gt;= 3 months prior to initiation of study
             treatment

          -  Active congestive heart failure or ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication

          -  Uncontrolled ascites requiring weekly large-volume paracentesis for 3 consecutive
             weeks prior to initiation of study treatment

          -  Active infection requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics

          -  Patients requiring any daily supplemental oxygen

          -  Uncontrolled hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia

          -  Any condition requiring anti-coagulants such as warfarin, heparin, or
             anti-thrombotics. Prophylactic anti-coagulation and/or local application of
             thrombolytic agents for catheter patency may be allowed for patients with normal INR
             and with prior approval from the Medical Monitor

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Any other diseases, active or uncontrolled pulmonary dysfunction, metabolic
             dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving
             reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an
             investigational drug, that may affect the interpretation of the results, or renders
             the patients at high risk from treatment complications

          -  Significant traumatic injury within 3 weeks prior to initiation of GDC-0349

          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to initiation of GDC-0349

          -  Treatment with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy (except GnRH agonists or antagonists for
             prostate cancer), immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiation therapy (except
             palliative radiation to bony metastases) as cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             initiation of study treatment. Kinase inhibitors, approved by national regulatory
             authorities, may be used up to 2 weeks prior to initiation of GDC-0349, provided that
             any drug-related toxicity has completely resolved and prior approval is obtained from
             the Medical Monitor.

          -  Palliative radiation to bony metastases within 2 weeks prior to initiation of GDC-0349

          -  Treatment with an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to initiation of GDC-0349

          -  Unresolved toxicity from prior therapy, except for alopecia and Grade 1 peripheral
             neuropathy

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
