  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major purpose of this study is to determine whether psychotherapeutic contacts for
      surgical patients with psychological distress are an effective treatment during the
      postoperative period to improve the rate of treatment participation in subsequent
      psychosocial treatment programs.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of psychotherapeutic
      contacts that aim at motivating and supporting surgical patients with psychiatric disorders
      in participating in subsequent psychosocial treatment options like psycho- and addiction
      therapy (RCT). The secondary objective is to investigate whether preoperatively assessed
      psychosocial factors are associated with surgical outcomes (preoperative computer-assisted
      self assessment).

      The Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology (BRIA) has been designed as a feasible treatment
      option to reach patients from all surgical fields. Implemented in the preoperative
      anesthesiological assessment clinic this therapy program comprises two major elements: (1) A
      computer assisted self assessment of social, lifestyle and psychological factors including a
      comprehensive battery of psychiatric screening tests; (2) Psychotherapeutic contacts with the
      objective to motivate patients with psychiatric disorders and support them in participating
      in subsequent psychosocial treatment programs. The self assessment will be offered to all
      adult surgical patients of the preoperative anesthesiological assessment clinic during
      inclusion period (current 5104 patients). Data on surgical outcomes will be collected
      prospectively during a 6-month-follow-up, and regression analyses will be performed to
      determine the extent of associations between psychosocial factors and outcomes. Patients with
      clinically relevant psychological distress (i.e. scoring above the cut-off of one of applied
      standardized screening questionnaires) will be offered to participate in the RCT on the
      psychotherapy part of BRIA (220 patients). Data on primary and secondary outcomes will be
      collected 6 months and 24 months, respectively, after baseline assessment.
