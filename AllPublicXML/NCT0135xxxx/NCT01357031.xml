    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a study of patients with migraine (episodic) with or without aura,
      according to the criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS) 2004. This will be a
      randomized clinical trial, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparing the
      efficacy of melatonin 3 mg and amitriptyline 25 mg for migraine prevention. The length of the
      inclusion of the study will be 24 months. This study's general objective is: to evaluate the
      effectiveness of melatonin in the preventive treatment of migraine and compare it to placebo
      and amitriptyline.
