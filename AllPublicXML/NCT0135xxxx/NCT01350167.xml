      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ultrasound or CT scanning is more effective
      at detecting early liver cancer in patients with advanced liver disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arise in patients with advanced liver disease,
      usually cirrhosis. Most patients with clinically evident HCC are not candidates for treatment
      with curative intent because of large tumor size, invasion of hepatic or portal veins, or
      metastatic disease. For this reason, screening for HCC at an asymptomatic and potentially
      curable stage in patients with advanced liver disease has been recommended by some
      authorities. Screening with various methods, of which ultrasound (US) and alpha-fetoprotein
      (AFP) have been the most extensively studied, has become accepted practice. Recently the
      technique of imaging the liver with or during both the hepatic arterial and portal venous
      phases of intravenous contrast (&quot;liver-shuttle&quot;) has shown increased sensitivity in detecting
      HCCs compared to US.

      The hypothesis of this study is that CT using a &quot;liver-shuttle&quot; protocol once a year is more
      sensitive and specific than US twice a year, both in combination with AFP for identification
      of potentially curable HCC in patients with cirrhosis. Patients will be randomized to
      &quot;routine,&quot; accepted screening with hepatic US and AFP testing every 6 months or AFP testing
      every 6 months wtih triphasic CT every 12 months.
