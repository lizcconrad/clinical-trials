  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will measure the functional brain activity of adult Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients, genotyped according to the COMT genotype,
      during a Working Memory Paradigm, before and after a placebo controlled treatment with MPH
      for 6 WEEKS. Within this design, the investigators will be able to evaluate the therapeutic
      effect of MPH treatment on cognitive functions.

    <description>Medication (methylphenidate, non-retard) will be titrated to optimal response within 6 weeks, with a maximum of 10 mg/day in week 1, 20 mg/day in week 2, 30 mg/day in week 3, 40 mg/day in week 4, 50 mg/day in week 5, and 60 mg/day in week 6, unless adverse effects emerged. After successful adjustment, medication will be maintained until week 6. Dosing will be based on at least two-weekly evaluations by a psychiatrist, including an interview with a review of symptoms and side effects, completion of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale and completion of a standardised Side Effects Rating Scale for psychostimulants (SERS). The maximal daily dosage of MPH is 60 mg. Within this double blind study the same procedure is applied for the placebo condition.</description>
