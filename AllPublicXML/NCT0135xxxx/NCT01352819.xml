      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Deep Brain Stimulation as an
      adjunctive treatment for reducing some of the symptoms of advanced, levodopa-responsive
      Parkinson's disease that are not adequately controlled with medication.

      It is the first study in Parkinson patients outside the US with a Deep Brain Stimulation
      system using constant current instead of constant voltage and using a lead with an active
      electrode tip.

      This study is designed as a prospective, observational, non-randomized, multi-centered study
      for 12 months in duration from implantation with the subjects being used as their own
      control. The primary outcome assessment will occur at three months: however, subjects will be
      followed for one year.

      A comparison of measures within the same person from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be
      performed. Also, pre-treatment and post-treatment group means and standard deviations will be
      determined.

        Libra™/LibraXP™ DBS System Eligible subjects in this study will be screened to confirm that
        they meet the strict guidelines for advanced, levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease that
        are not adequately controlled with medication followed by surgery to implant the
        Libra™/LibraXP™ deep brain simulation system.

          4. Subject is 18 to 80 years of age.

          5. Subject has a history of improvement of Parkinson's symptoms as a direct result of
