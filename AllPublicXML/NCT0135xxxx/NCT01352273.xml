  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi- center, open-label, dose finding, Phase Ib study to be conducted in two
      stages: a dose escalation part to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) safety and
      tolerability of concurrent administration of MEK162 and RAF265, followed by an expansion part
      to further assess the safety and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of this oral combination
      within two separate patient populations: i) patients with advanced solid tumors harboring
      BRAFV600E mutations or ii) patients with advanced solid tumors harboring RAS mutations.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed and non-resectable advanced solid
        tumors for which no further effective standard therapy exists.

          -  The patients' tumors must contain documented activating somatic BRAFV600E* , NRAS or
             KRAS mutations (except for pancreatic cancer)

          -  All patients enrolled MUST provide fresh or archival tumor samples at baseline to
             enable central confirmation of BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutations

          -  Measurable, or non-measurable but evaluable disease as determined by RECIST

          -  Adequate bone marrow function

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function

          -  Adequate cardiovascular function

          -  Negative serum β HCG test (female patients of childbearing potential only) within 72
             hrs prior to first dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of primary central nervous system tumors or brain metastases
             or who have signs/symptoms attributable to brain metastases and have not been assessed
             with radiologic imaging to rule out the presence of brain metastases

          -  Current evidence of retinal disease; or ophthalmopathy as assessed by ophthalmologic
             examination at baseline that would be considered a risk factor for CSR/RVO (e.g.,
             optic disc cupping, visual field defects, IOP &gt; 21 mm Hg)

          -  Impaired cardio-/vascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular diseases,
             including any of the following:

               -  History/evidence of acute coronary syndromes (including MI, unstable angina,
                  CABG, coronary angioplasty, or stenting) ≤ 6 months prior to starting study drugs

               -  Thromboembolic event (DVT, CVA, PE) ≤ 6 months prior to starting study

               -  Symptomatic CHF, history or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac
                  arrhythmia and/or conduction abnormality

               -  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension, defined as BP &gt; 140/100 mmHg (average of 3
                  consecutive readings)

          -  History of melena, hematemesis or hemoptysis within the last 3 months

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
