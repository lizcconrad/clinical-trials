    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to understand the outcomes of back pain treatment and costs
      associated with it in an academic hospital outpatient setting. The investigators will conduct
      a prospective observational cohort study to assess the clinical outcomes and utilization of
      health care services of 175 Osher Clinical Center (OCC) patients with chronic low back pain
      (CLBP) compared with a comparison group of 175 non-OCC CLBP patients treated within Brigham
      and Women's Hospital. Outcomes will include assessment of functional status, symptom relief,
      satisfaction with care, health-related quality of life, and worker productivity, and will be
      measured in person at baseline, and by phone by an interviewer blinded to cohort group at 3,
      6, and 12 months.

        The CLBP patients will be identified from two different sources at Brigham and Women's
        Hospital (BWH): those coming to be treated at the OCC, and those coming to non-OCC
        physician providers at BWH (comparison group).
