  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and hepatic surgery are major operations,
      associated with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The aim of this study is to assess
      the effectiveness of clinical scoring systems and inflammatory cytokine levels for predicting
      systemic inflammation. This correlation might identify peri-operative clinical outcomes, then
      forecast further systemic inflammation in cardiac and hepatic surgical patients.

      Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is commonly found in most major surgery. Early
      detection of SIRS will lead to early treatment. Serum cytokines levels are reliable markers
      for SIRS detection but with high cost and inconvenience. Clinical Scoring Systems are
      commonly used for assessment of patients with SIRS. If they have good correlation with
      cytokine levels, they might be used to predict peri-operative clinical outcomes.

    <description>Blood samples were collected sequentially at 0, 0.5, 4, 12, and 24 h after CPB for cytokines [Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10] investigation and leukocyte counts. Clinical scoring systems [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Multi-Organ Dysfunction (MOD)] were calculated and recorded at each time point. Correlations were assessed.</description>
