      This study aimed to assess and reassess the balance and motor skills of deaf children, passed
      six weeks of intervention and to verify whether a program of physical therapy intervention
      can match or improve motor skills. This study was quasi-experimental before and after, with
      10 children from a school in Caxias do Sul / RS. Motor skills were evaluated using pre and
      post test KTK Coordination Body, and the activities were held once a week for six weeks in
      sessions of forty minutes. It was used for statistical analysis the Student t test dependent
      and independent (p â‰¤ 0.05).
