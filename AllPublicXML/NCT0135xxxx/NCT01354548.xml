  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trismus (limited jaw mobility), can occur in patients undergoing radiotherapy to specific
      areas of the head or neck. Trismus leads to difficulty in eating, swallowing, speech and
      general mouth hygiene, which all have negative effects on quality of life. Research in the
      area of trismus is limited; it is not known exactly when trismus develops, one study suggests
      that some patients have experienced a diminished opening at as low doses as 15 Gy. Literature
      suggests benefits of a training programme, but there is a lack of evidence to support the use
      of a training programme during radiotherapy.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a training programme during
      and after radiotherapy, and report the incidence of trismus in patients who receive
      radiotherapy to the jaw muscles. The study also investigates quality of life during
      radiotherapy and up to one year after completed treatment.

      Patients who meet the criteria and give their consensus to the study are divided into two
      groups:

      Group 1: Training with TheraBite Jaw Motion Rehabilitation System, which is a portable system
      utilizing repetitive passive motion and stretching to restore mobility and flexibility of the
      jaw musculature. Individuals train five times a day.

      Group 2: Conventional treatment (jaw measurements once a week). If the individuals jaw
      mobility decreases 15% from the original start measurement, the patient is automatically
      offered a trainings program (as in group 1).

      During radiation therapy a hospital specialist dentist measures the jaw mobility once a week,
      thereafter at 3,6,12 months after completed Radiation Therapy. On 5 different occasions the
      patients are requested to complete a Quality of life questionnaire. Patient's record their
      training frequency in a log book.

      Summary of the study programme

      Background

      During Radiation therapy to the mouth, throat or trachea can fibrosis often occur in the
      chewing muscles round the jaw causing a development of trismus (a limited jaw mobility).
      Trismus can cause pain, difficulty in eating, swallowing, speech and difficulty with general
      mouth hygiene. Despite the fact that this condition has been documented in older literature,
      there is limited research in the incidence of trismus. There is need of randomised studies to
      investigate the prevention of trismus both under and during Radiation Therapy.

      Aims

      The specific aims of this study are to investigate the effectiveness of Prophylactic training
      with a muscle warm-up programme and a mechanical device (TheraBite) to prevent trismus during
      Radiation Therapy and one year after completed therapy. The study also aims to investigate
      the incidence of radiotherapy-induced trismus in patients who receive radiotherapy to the
      masseter, temporalis, pterygoid muscles. Finally the study investigates whether trismus
      affects quality of life.

      Methods

      Patients

      Sixty consecutive patients, from two different radiation clinics in Sweden, are randomised
      into the two different groups using a computer programme.

      Treatment procedures

        1. Intervention group: Daily training with a programme for TheraBite that trains passive
           movement, preceded by a warm-up programme. Mouth opening measurements are made once a
           week during treatment at the end of radiotherapy,three, six and 12 months after
           treatment.

        2. Control group: Receiving traditional radiation therapy with nursing care, measuring the
           patients mouth opening once a week during treatment, at the end of radiation
           therapy,three, six, and 12 months after treatment. The same training programme as group
           one is offered to this group as soon as evidence of trismus develops.

      This training is recorded by the patient in a log book. Weight, height, Mucositis analysis
      and quality of life are made before the commencement of radiation therapy, at the end of
      radiation therapy, three, six, and 12 months after treatment. The patient's weight is
      measured every week.

      Results

      The results of this study will give new and vital information that can give a basis to
      develop a clinical method of identifying and treating cancer patients who suffer from
      trismus. Thus giving new knowledge which can be used to formulate clinical practices.

    <description>A portable device which utilizes passive motion and stretching to improve mobility and flexibility of the jaw muscles and associated joints. Patients are given written and verbal information about TheraBite before the commencement of Radiotherapy. Investigators instruct on usage and maintenance of TheraBite. Patients are instructed to start a trainings pass by softening the jaw muscles with a simple exercise. The training programme consists of five stretches performed 5 times per day, each stretch held for 15 seconds, training continually during Radiation Therapy and up to one year after completion of Radiation Therapy.</description>
