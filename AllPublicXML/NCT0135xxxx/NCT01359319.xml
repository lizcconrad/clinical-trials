  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM) is a severe progressive metabolic myopathy caused
      by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for sialic acid (SA), a critical component of many
      muscle proteins, resulting in a deficiency in SA in the muscles of HIBM patients.

      The effective replacement of the missing SA substrate is theoretically simple, and, in animal
      models, replacement with SA showed significant restoration of sialylation biochemistry and
      excellent reduction in muscle disease. These data show that replacement can achieve
      significant clinical benefit in muscle pathology, function, and survival.

    <measure>Evaluate the safety of repeated doses of Sialic Acid - Extended Release (SA-ER) tablets in patients with HIBM</measure>
    <time_frame>Each patient may participate approximately 4-6 weeks total, including 2 single dose (fast/fed) treatment periods followed by a 7-day repeat treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated in terms of the incidence and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including clinically significant changes from baseline to scheduled timepoints in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, or physical and neurologic examination findings. Medical history and reported clinical symptoms, including increasing muscle weakness, fatigue, or pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of SA-ER after single and repeated dosing.</measure>
    <time_frame>Multiple pharmacokinetic (serum) samples will be taken during the study, at baseline, after each single dose administration, and at the final day of the 7 day repeat dose period.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of SA-ER will include Cmax, the AUC of single doses, and steady-state levels of free, soluble sialic acid in serum after repeated dosing.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be 18 years to 70 years of age.

          2. Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the nature of the
             study has been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures.

          3. Must have a documented diagnosis, confirmed by genetic testing, of hereditary
             inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), also known as distal myopathy, rimmed vacuoles (DMRV),
             or Nonaka myopathy due to demonstrated mutations in gene encoding the GNE/MNK enzyme.

          4. Willing and able to comply with all study procedures, including multiple overnight
             stays at a hospital unit or Phase 1 unit.

          5. Sexually active subjects must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception
             (i.e double barrier method)while participating in the study and for 30 days after
             receiving the last dose of SA-ER.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not
             of childbearing potential include those who have been in menopause at least 2 years,
             or had bilateral tubal ligation at least 1 year prior to screening, or who have had
             total hysterectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breastfeeding at screening or planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study.

          2. Use of any investigational product or investigational medical device within 30 days
             prior to screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion
             of all scheduled study assessments.

          3. Ingestion of ManNAc, sialic acid, or related metabolites or sialic acid donors that
             provide this substrate in either chemical or nutritional supplement form during the 30
             days prior to screening. If ManNAc or other substrate was used more than 30 days prior
             to screening, the time period of use, the compound used, and the dose and dose regimen
             should be recorded in the patient's history. If a patient has been on substrate
             replacement therapy in the past, the investigator must consider the potential
             confounding effects of this therapy before enrolling the patient.

          4. Presence of a condition the severity and acuity of which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, warrant immediate surgical intervention or other treatment.

          5. Presence or history of any hypersensitivity to SA or its excipients that, in the
             judgment of the investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse
             effects.

          6. Presence of a concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study
             participation or affect safety such as swallowing difficulties.

          7. Presence or history of any condition that, in the view of the investigator, places the
             subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study.

          8. Serum transaminase (ALT, AST, GGT) levels &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or serum
             creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL.
