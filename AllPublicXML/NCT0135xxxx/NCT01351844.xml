  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients have been asked to participate in the CEASE study because their treating oncologist
      has recommended that they start an aromatase inhibitor medication. These medications are
      associated with joint complaints. The purpose of this study is to see whether a
      computer-based educational module is a feasible intervention to help address these symptoms.
      If the patients agree to participate, a research coordinator will test their grip strength
      and give them a computer log-on code. They will be shown how to log-on to complete the
      educational module and a few simple questionnaires. Patients have the option to do this from
      home if they wish. In 3 months time, the investigators will ask patients to return to the
      clinic and have another grip strength evaluation and complete some additional questionnaires.
      The computer module and the follow up visit will each take about 30 minutes of time.

    <description>This study is designed as a pilot study to assess feasibility of this educational intervention in a small population of only 40 patients. Patients will be given the option to complete the module from home. The primary endpoint will be patient completion of the educational module and follow-up questionnaires.</description>
