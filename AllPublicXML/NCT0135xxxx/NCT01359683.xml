      The purpose of this study is to investigate non-linear heart rate variability indexes as
      predictors of the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients undergoing cardiac surgery,
      including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and valvular surgery.

    <description>This is a prospective observational study. 100 patients in one arm scheduled for cardiac surgery will be enrolled. ECG tracings will be obtained when subject is at rest, in supine position, before induction of anesthesia (within 24 hours prior to induction), after induction of general anesthesia, right before emergence from anesthesia (or before transportation to the ICU if the subject remains intubated), and within 24 hours post-operatively; additional ECG readings may be obtained during the surgery if deemed necessary.</description>
