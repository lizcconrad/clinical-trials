      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D)
      of SAR245408 and MSC1936369B when combined in adult subjects with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of SAR245408 and MSC1936369B combination
           therapy administered orally to adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid
           tumors

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR245408 and MSC1936369B when used in
           combination

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of the SAR245408/MSC1936369B combination by
           assessing target and pathway inhibition

      The duration of the study will include a period for screening of up to a maximum of 28 days,
      a pretreatment evaluation period of up to 5 days, the on-treatment period, followed by a
      minimum of 30-day follow-up after the last study drug administration.

      The patient may continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      consent withdrawal.

      The study will have 2 parts:

        -  Part one - Dose Escalation

        -  Part Two - Expansion. At the defined maximum tolerated doses (MTD(s), additional
           patients will be enrolled to collect safety, Pharmacokinetic, and Pharmacodynamic data

        Inclusion criteria:

        Patient with advanced solid tumors for which there is no approved or curative therapy:

          -  has any advanced solid tumor with diagnosed alteration in 1 or more genes of the PI3K,
             and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and/or

          -  has a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of 1 of the following solid
             tumors: pancreatic, thyroid, colorectal, non-small cell lung, endometrial, renal,
             breast, ovarian carcinoma and melanoma

        Exclusion criteria:

        The patient has previously been treated with a PI3K inhibitor or a Mitogen-activated
        protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor

        The patient has received:

          -  Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or any other
             anticancer therapy within 28 days or 5 half lives for noncytotoxics (whichever is
             shorter) of Day 1 of trial drug treatment (6 weeks for nitrosureas or mitomycin C)

          -  Any investigational agent within 28 days of Day 1 of trial drug treatment The patient
             is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with therapeutic doses of warfarin
             (low-dose warfarin ≤1 mg/day, heparin, and low-molecular weight heparins are
             permitted) History of central nervous system metastases The patient has had congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina, a myocardial infarction, cardiac conduction
             abnormality or pacemaker or a stroke within 3 months of entering the study. The
             patient has retinal degenerative disease (hereditary retinal degeneration or
             age-related macular degeneration), history of uveitis, or history of retinal vein
             occlusion, or has medically relevant abnormalities identified on screening
             ophthalmologic examination.
