    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the therapeutic utility of BOTOX in reducing the degree of
      Forward Head Posture (FHP) with associated headache and myofascial pain, decreasing the
      frequency of headache, and improving the overall quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study
      investigating the use of BOTOX in the treatment of patients with FHP and associated headache
      using a novel fixed site injection paradigm.

      Fifteen subjects will be randomized to receive BOTOX® and fifteen will receive placebo
      injections. Study subjects will receive one cycle of injections, up to a maximal total dosage
      of 250U. The study duration is approximately 4 months and is composed of a Screening Visit
      (Visit 1, Month -1), a Baseline Visit (Visit 2, Day 0), and three Follow-Up Visits 1 month
      apart (Months 1, 2 and 3).

The change in number of headache free days;
% days with headache;
Average headache severity;
Number of headache episodes (number of headaches).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatient, healthy male or female volunteers of any race, &gt;18 years of age. Females
             of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the
             Baseline Visit and practice a reliable method of contraception throughout the study;

             A female is considered of childbearing potential unless she is:

               -  postmenopausal for at least 12 months prior to study drug administration;

               -  without a uterus and/or both ovaries; or

               -  has been surgically sterile for at least 6 months prior to study drug
                  administration.

             Reliable methods of contraception are:

               -  hormonal methods must be started at least 90 days prior to study drug
                  administration

               -  intrauterine device in use &gt; 30 days prior to study drug administration; or

               -  barrier methods plus spermicide in use at least 14 days prior to study drug
                  administration.

               -  partner has had a vasectomy at least 3 months previously or a confirmatory 0
                  sperm count test.

                    -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are not sexually active are
                       not required to practice a reliable method of contraception. They may be
                       enrolled at the Investigator's discretion provided that they are counseled
                       to remain sexually inactive for the duration of the study and understand the
                       possible risks involved in getting pregnant during the study.

          2. Diagnosis of FHP with at least two-fingerbreadth head forward posture.

          3. Episodic Headache Disorder as per the following criteria:

               -  &lt; 15 headache days per month including 10-14 days/month episodic migraine (with
                  or without aura);

          3. Presence of cervical dystonia.

          4. Medical condition that may increase risk of exposure to botulinum toxin (e.g.,
             Myasthenia Gravis, Eaton-Lambert Syndrome, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or any other
             disease that might interfere with neuromuscular function).

          5. Use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, curare-like agents, or other agents that might
             interfere with neuromuscular function.

             areas of injection, skin problems or infection at any of the injection sites.

          7. Subjects with an allergy or sensitivity to any component of BOTOX® (Section 5.2).

          8. Evidence of recent alcohol/drug abuse.

         10. Uncontrolled systemic disease, condition or situation that, in the investigator's
             opinion, may put the subject at significant risk, confound study results, or
             significantly interfere with study participation, and/or life expectancy less than 12
             months

         11. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days of the
