    <textblock>
      Recently, multimodal approach for postoperative pain control has been advocated.Combinations
      of traditional and novel pharmacological agents are administered, aiming to improve
      analgesia, spare opioid consumption, minimise adverse effects, and improve postoperative
      bowel function in colorectal surgery.

      One of the novel agents suggested is dexmedetomidine. It is a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor
      agonist, which has been demonstrated to have anaesthetic, sedative and analgesic-sparing
      effects. Furthermore, a significant reduction in postoperative morphine consumption by using
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been achieved when dexmedetomidine was administered
      before operation. The drug also reduces cate-cholamine secretion, thereby reducing stress and
      leading to a modest reduction in heart rate and blood pressure, which may be particularly
      beneficial in patients with cardiovascular disease, while respiratory rate is not affected.

      In this study, the investigators would like to evaluate the analgesic effects of
      dexmedetomidine, which is administered intraoperatively with morphine, followed by
      postoperative PCA morphine infusion, for postoperative pain for open and laparoscopic
      colorectal surgery. Cyclooxy-genase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and rescue intramuscular pethidine
      will also be incorporated as part of the multimodal analgesia regimens.

      Good pain control can help to decrease cardiovascular complications. Emerging data has
      suggested a key role of soluble CD40L as inflammatory mediators of atherosclerotic lesion
      progression. The investigators would like to evaluate the effect of our analgesic regimens on
      soluble CD40L peri-operatively.

      The investigators hypothesize that intraoperative dexmedetomidine can reduce postoperative
      pain and improve recovery and outcomes.

    <textblock>
      PROCEDURES:

      Patients will be approached at the pre-admission clinic or in the general ward before
      operation. The analgesic modalities will be explained and patient will be recruited into
      study if s/he agrees. Patient will then be randomised into one of the two groups receiving
      intraoperative morphine with dexmedetomidine then postoperative PCA morphine (D), or
      intraoperative morphine only then postoperative PCA morphine (M).

      Randomisation, blinding, and preparation of dexmedetomidine and placebo Patients who undergo
      open and laparoscopic colonic and rectal surgery will be stratified in randomisation. For
      each type of operation (colonic and rectal), randomisation will be based on using blocks of 5
      patients to ensure both groups having equal sample size. A computer-generated random sequence
      will be used to select the allocation order.

      Both patients and investigators will be blinded to the allocated analgesic modalities, i.e.
      the administration of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine or normal saline (placebo) will be
      prepared by clinical staff who will not participate in observation and data analysis.

      For group D, dexmedetomidine will be prepared by adding 2ml of the drug (100μg/ml) to 48ml of
      0.9% sodium chloride injection, which make up to a total of 50ml. The final concentration for
      administration is thus 200μg in 50ml, i.e. 4μg/ml.

      For group M, a syringe of 50ml normal saline will be prepared as placebo. As both
      dexmedetomidine and placebo will look the same as 50ml clear liquid in syringe, both patient
      and investigator will be blinded to the substance administered.

      Preoperative care:

      The patients will be assessed at pre-admission clinic or at the general ward. Blood for
      soluble CD40L with other routine investigations will be taken. Bowel preparation will start
      one day before operation. Patient will fast since midnight before operation.

      Anaesthesia and intraoperative care:

      Both groups of patients will be anaesthetised according to the protocol as follow:

      Patient will receive no sedative premedication. On arrival in the operation theatre, a
      16-gauge intravenous cannula will be placed under local analgesic. Pulse, pulse oximetry and
      non-invasive blood pressure measurement will be checked every 5 minutes throughout the
      operation.

      Propofol 2mg/kg, fentanyl 1.5μg/kg and atracurium 0.5mg/kg will be used for general
      anaesthesia induction. Anaesthesia will be maintained with mixture of isoflurane, air and
      oxygen. Isoflurane concentration will be titrated to optimal heart rate and blood pressure by
      the anaesthesiologist.

      Thermal blanket and infusion fluid warmer will be used to aim at maintaining core body
      temperature at 35.5 to 37.5 degrees Celsius. A urinary catheter will be inserted to monitor
      urine output. Intermittent pneumatic compression device will be applied to the lower limbs
      for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

      At the discretion of the anaesthesiologist, hypotension will be treated with intravenous
      ephedrine or phenylephrine. Hypertension or tachycardia will be treated with isoflurane up to
      2% end-tidal concentration (~1.5 MAC). If persisted, beta-blockers such as labetalol or
      arterial vasodilators such as hydralazine may be given.

      Isoflurane will be switched off after closure of the inner layer of the wounds. Reversal will
      be achieved by intravenous neostigmine 50μg/kg and atropine 20μg/kg after operation. Patient
      will then be transferred to recovery room for monitoring for at least 1 hour.

      Analgesic modalities and pain assessment:

      Procedures for the two analgesic modalities are described below:

      Group D: intraoperative morphine with dexmedetomidine then postoperative PCA morphine.
      Patient will receive a loading dose of 1μg/kg (0.25ml/kg) intravenous dex-medetomidine over
      10 minutes before induction, and then followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.5μg/kg/h
      (0.125ml/kg/h) until wound closure. Bolus dose of 0.1mg/kg morphine sulphate will be given
      intravenously prior to incision. At the third and forth hour, morphine sulphate 0.1mg/kg may
      be given in divided dose titrated to patient's response. On arrival in the recovery room,
      boluses of 2mg intravenous morphine will be given every 5 minutes until NRS pain score is
      less than 4. A PCA machine will then be connected. The machine will be configured to give 1mg
      of morphine at a time and the lockout duration will be set to 5 minutes. No basal infusion
      will be given and the maximum dose limit will be 0.1mg/kg per hour.

      Group M: intraoperative morphine then postoperative PCA morphine. All procedures for Group D
      patients will be followed, but dexmedetomidine administration will be replaced by placebo
      (normal saline) of the same volume and rate.

      Both groups: Starting from postoperative day 1, when patient resumes fluid diet, oral
      celecoxib 200mg will be given twice daily for 3 days or until discharge, whichever earlier.
      From day 4 onwards, one tablet of dologesic (paracetamol plus dextropropoxyphene) will be
      given every 4 hours as needed until discharge.

      From postoperative day 0, rescue analgesic in the form of intramuscular pethidine 0.5mg/kg
      will be prescribed every 4 hours if necessary.

      During the administration of PCA morphine, respiratory rate, SpO2 and sedation score will be
      monitored every hour; blood pressure and pulse, numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores at
      rest and during cough, cumulative doses and tries/goods, as well as side effects will be
      recorded every 4 hours. Patient will be seen by anaesthesiologist every day to assess the
      adequacy of analgesia.

      PCA morphine will be administered for at least 2 days. On postoperative day 2, if NRS pain
      scores during cough is less than 4 on a clinically low morphine consumption, PCA will be
      stopped; if equals or greater than 4, or still on a high PCA consumption, it will be
      continued. Assessment will be repeated daily. If NRS pain score during cough remains at 4 or
      above on day 5, patient will be evaluated for complications and managed at the discretion of
      the anaesthesiologist.

      After PCA morphine has stopped, NRS pain scores at rest and during cough, dose and frequency
      of rescue analgesia used will be charted once a day until discharge.

      Postoperative care and assessment:

      Early mobilisation is encouraged after operation. On postoperative day 1, patient will be put
      on fluid diet.

      The surgical team will be responsible for postoperative assessments, such as recording daily
      gastrointestinal function (bowel sound, flatus and bowel opening), postoperative
      complications (if any) and readiness for discharging patient (good pain control with oral
      analgesics, ambulatory, resumption of bowel function, i.e. stool or flatus, have 2 to 3 feeds
      without vomiting or abdominal distension).

      Blood for soluble CD40L and other routine investigations will be taken at post-operative day
      2.

      Patient's satisfaction on analgesia will be asked using NRS from zero to 10 upon discharge.

           as development of complication, no further data will be collected.

      DATA ANALYSIS:

      The intention-to-treat principle will be used. In other words, patient will be included and
      remained in their designated groups for data analysis even if there is a change in surgical
      or anaesthetic/analgesic management, as long as they have had an open or laparoscopic
      abdominal incision during operation.

        -  Intraoperative vital signs, estimated blood loss, duration of anaesthetic/analgesic and
           surgical procedures, time to extubation, tries and goods of PCA use, cumulative morphine
           consumption, dose and frequency of rescue analgesic use, time to recovery of bowel
           functions, food intake and ambulation, time to discharge: Student's t-test

        -  NRS pain scores, patient's satisfaction: Mann-Whitney U test

        -  Side effects and postoperative complications: binary logistic regression
