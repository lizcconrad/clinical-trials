  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate, toxicity, progression
      free survival and quality of life of chemotherapy with docetaxel and oxaliplatin in recurrent
      or metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent therapeutic developments, such as the introduction of new cytotoxic agents (taxanes,
      platinum, liposomal anthracyclines, etc) have resulted in constant improvements in treatment
      efficacy and consequently in recurrent or metastatic outcome. This single arm, multicenter
      phase II study was designed to evaluate the response rate, toxicity, progression free
      survival of docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with recurrence or metastatic breast
      cancer.
