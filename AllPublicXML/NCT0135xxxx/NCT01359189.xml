  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility, exploratory, and proof-of-concept study to evaluate rectal probe
      scintigraphy device (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent
      (ProstaScint®) in patients with suspected primary prostate cancer. ProxiScanTM is a small
      cadmium zinc telluride (CST)-based compact gamma camera the size of a trans-rectal ultrasound
      (TRUS) developed by Hybridyne Imaging Technologies, Inc.To explore the adjunctive
      benefit/feasibility of PSMA distribution in the normal prostate versus prostate cancer gland
      utilizing TRUS and CT/SPECT hybrid imaging, biopsy negative patients will be considered as
      normal controls. Prostate cancer sextant biopsy histology results will be correlated with
      ProxiScanTM, TRUS, and pelvis planar and SPECT/CT. Our hypothesis is that it will be safe and
      feasible to utilize a rectal probe scintigraphy (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific
      ProstaScint® uptake in primary prostate cancer.

      This is a feasibility, exploratory, and proof-of-concept study to evaluate rectal probe
      scintigraphy device (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent
      (ProstaScint®) in patients with suspected primary prostate cancer. ProxiScanTM is a small
      cadmium zinc telluride (CST)-based compact gamma camera the size of a trans-rectal ultrasound
      (TRUS) developed by Hybridyne Imaging Technologies, Inc. Due to its inherent small size, this
      camera is capable of potentially imaging of prostate cancer specific radiopharmaceutical
      uptake distributed within the prostate gland located closely adjacent to the camera head.In
      this study the investigators will enroll patients with a clinical suspicion and high
      likelihood of prostate cancer. A scintigraphic rectal probe (ProxiScanTM) will be used to
      detect ProstaScint® uptake in the prostate gland, in comparison to TRUS and pelvis planar and
      SPECT/CT. The incidence of biopsy positive prostate cancer in patients with suspected disease
      clinically can range from 25% to 40%; therefore up to 12 patients will be enrolled on this
      study. To explore the adjunctive benefit/feasibility of PSMA distribution in the normal
      prostate versus prostate cancer gland utilizing TRUS and CT/SPECT hybrid imaging, biopsy
      negative patients will be considered as normal controls. Prostate cancer sextant biopsy
      histology results will be correlated with ProxiScanTM, TRUS, and pelvis planar and SPECT/CT.
      Our hypothesis is that it will be safe and feasible to utilize a rectal probe scintigraphy
      (ProxiScanTM) to detect PSMA specific ProstaScint® uptake in primary prostate cancer.

    <description>The proximity of the placement of the ProxiScanTM device to the prostate should result in an improvement in the sensitivity and specificity for detection of prostate cancer specific radiopharmaceutical detection. The primary objectives will be evaluated at the patient level, while secondary objectives will be analyzed based on data and outcomes measured by region of the prostate (sextant).</description>

    <description>Secondary Objectives:
Estimate the sensitivity and specificity for three methods of detection: TRUS, ProxiScan and SPECT/CT when compared to biopsy.
Estimate the sensitivity and specificity for ProxiScan and SPECT/CT when compared to PSMA IHC measurements.
If prostatectomy histology results are available, the ability to detect areas of cancer among multiple slices of prostate tissue with TRUS, SPECT/CT and ProxiScan will be evaluated.
Explore reclassification properties of the ProxiScan results compared to the SPECT/CT at the patient level.</description>

    <description>Patients with suspected prostate cancer will be evaluated for initial proof of concept and feasibility of a scintigraphic rectal probe (ProxiScanTM) utilizing a PSMA receptor radiopharmaceutical (ProstaScint®). To explore the adjunctive benefit/feasibility of PSMA distribution in the normal prostate versus prostate cancer gland utilizing TRUS and CT/SPECT hybrid imaging, biopsy negative patients will be considered as normal controls. This is an exploratory, open label trial and randomization is not required. Subject blinding is not needed and investigator blinding in not possible.</description>

    <description>ProxiScanTM is a compact, high-resolution gamma camera which has been developed for the detection of cancer and other abnormalities in the body by imaging the distribution of radionuclides in the human body using planar imaging techniques. This camera is capable of high-performance imaging of radiopharmaceuticals distributed within anatomical regions of interest located close to the camera head. The ProxiScan compact scintigraphic detector was approved by the FDA to market the device for the following indication: &quot;The ProxiScanTM is indicated for use in imaging the distribution of radionuclides in the human body using planar imaging techniques. ProxiScanTM may also be used intraoperatively, on pathological specimens and for endocavity applications if a protective sheath is used.&quot;</description>
