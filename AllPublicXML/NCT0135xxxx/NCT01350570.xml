    <description>Bristol stool scale was designed to classify the human stool into 7 categories.
The seven types of stool are:
Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass) Type 2: Sausage-shaped, but lumpy Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft Type 5: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily) Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely liquid</description>

    <measure>Assessment score of SF-36 scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4th and 8th after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) is a survey of patient health. The SF-36 is commonly used in health economics as a variable in the quality-adjusted life year calculation to determine the cost-effectiveness of a health treatment. The chinese version of SF-36 was validated and has been widely used in acupuncture studies.</description>
