  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that SLIT administered pre-and
      co-seasonally is effective in reducing rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms during the entire short
      ragweed pollen season.

    <time_frame>2011 ragweed pollen season, 8/2011 -10/2011</time_frame>
    <description>Change in baseline in avg combined daily RSS and medication scores during entire ragweed season in ITT population. Symptom score: sum of scores from 8 symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), ocular (itchiness, swelling/redness, and watery eyes/tears), nasal (sneezing, itching, runny and stuffy nose), and ears (itching). Avg daily RSS computed by: (1) summing 8 individual allergy symptoms recorded in AM and PM; (2) forming daily RSS by summing AM and PM RSS for each day of ragweed season; (3) averaging daily RSS for entire ragweed season.Total allergy relief medication score computed by summing individual medication scores. Relief medication scores: 0-no medication taken; 1-using once daily oral antihistamine; 1-using once daily ocular antihistamine; 1-treatment with albuterol. Maximum medication score dependent on cumulative rescue medication use. Lower result is more favorable. Avg daily Combined Score Range: 0 (min) - 51 (max); lower score was more favorable.</description>

    <description>Symptom score: sum of scores from 8 symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), ocular (itchiness, swelling/redness, watery eyes/tears), nasal (sneezing, itching, runny, stuffy nose), and ears (itching). Avg daily RSS computed by summing 8 individual allergy symptoms recorded in AM and PM; forming daily RSS by summing AM and PM RSS for each day; averaging daily RSS for three peak weeks. Total allergy relief medication score computed by summing individual medication scores. Relief medication scores: 0-no medication taken; 1-using once daily oral antihistamine; 1-using once daily ocular antihistamine; 1-treatment with albuterol. Max medication score dependent on cumulative rescue medication use. Lower result, more favorable. Three peak weeks of ragweed pollen counts during entire ragweed season was contiguous and calculated using a moving average of ragweed pollen counts for each week. Avg daily Combined Score Range: 0 (min) - 51 (max); lower score was more favorable.</description>

        <description>Symptom score: sum of scores from 8 symptoms rated 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe), ocular (itchiness, swelling/redness, watery eyes/tears), nasal (sneezing, itching, runny, stuffy nose), and ears (itching). Avg daily RSS computed by summing 8 individual allergy symptoms recorded in AM and PM; forming daily RSS by summing AM and PM RSS for each day; averaging daily RSS for three peak weeks. Total allergy relief medication score computed by summing individual medication scores. Relief medication scores: 0-no medication taken; 1-using once daily oral antihistamine; 1-using once daily ocular antihistamine; 1-treatment with albuterol. Max medication score dependent on cumulative rescue medication use. Lower result, more favorable. Three peak weeks of ragweed pollen counts during entire ragweed season was contiguous and calculated using a moving average of ragweed pollen counts for each week.
