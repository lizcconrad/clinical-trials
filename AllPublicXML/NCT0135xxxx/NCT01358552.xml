      This is an observational study in which patients who have been prescribed Néevo®/NéevoDHA®
      are invited to participate in surveys about their pregnancy and experiences with
      Néevo®/NéevoDHA®. The purpose of this study is to increase the understanding of the role of
      L-methylfolate among patients who are candidates for Néevo®/NéevoDHA®, provide patients with
      personalized education and support during their pregnancies, and contribute to the overall
      understanding of the needs and concerns of women facing intermediate- to high-risk
      pregnancies.

      Surveys used to conduct this study will be administered via telephone or online by
      InfoMedics, Inc., a company with a system for developing such patient-physician feedback
      programs. Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program
      after Néevo®/NéevoDHA® has been prescribed and provide them with a patient brochure
      containing an introduction to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients
      interested in participating self-enroll, take a brief survey before starting their
      Néevo®/NéevoDHA® prescription, and then a follow-up survey 4 weeks after they have started
      taking Néevo®/NéevoDHA®. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will
      receive individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and
      progress. Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to
      continue taking Néevo®/NéevoDHA® as directed. Patients will also receive educational
      materials about diet and nutrition during pregnancy.
