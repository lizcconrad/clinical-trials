  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constipation can be defined as &quot;an embarrassing ailment of the 21st century&quot;. It affects
      about 20-25% of the population, women as well as men, but occurs more frequently in women
      (female:male ratio of 2.2:1). Persons of different age suffer from it. Constipation is a
      bothersome ailment which negatively affects the general physical and mental state, lowers
      physical and mental fitness, significantly hinders professional work, and decreases life
      comfort As the factors which contribute to the occurrence of constipation are very diverse
      and complex, the treatment is a long-term and slow process. There are numerous conservative
      treatment methods for constipation, such as physical treatments, reflexotherapy, biofeedback,
      pharmacotherapy, and modification of lifestyle. There is also a possibility of applying
      classical massage in persons with constipation. However, observations of the authors suggest
      it is not a therapy commonly applied.

    <description>The massage consist of brushing the skin, stroking of the lower abdominal integuments. Elastic deformation of the thoracolumbar fascia. Then the abdominal integuments were elastically deformed by kneading to normalize the rest tension of the muscles of the abdominal integuments as well as, indirectly, the myofascial apparatus of the pelvic floor and in this way improve venous blood and lymph outflow from the large intestine and the sigmoid colon area. The next treatment stage - performing circular movements within the limits of the skin's mobility at 1/3 of the medial part of the thigh. By stroking movements in the direction of the armpit in accordance with the run of the thoracoepigastric and costalaxillary veins. Then the intercostal muscles were deformed.</description>
