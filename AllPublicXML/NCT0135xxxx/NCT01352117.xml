  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (AIDS-KS) occurs in persons with HIV infection who are also
      infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV). Several chemotherapy (anti-cancer)
      drugs work well in treating KS, but there is no treatment that cures KSHV infection. One
      chemotherapy drug called etoposide (VePesid®, ET) has caused KS tumors to get smaller in some
      people.

      Antiretroviral therapy (anti-HIV drugs or ART) is a group of medicines taken together to
      treat HIV infection. These medicines help to stop HIV from growing in the body. When this
      happens, the immune system, which fights infection and some cancers like KS, gets stronger.
      For some people, limited stage KS often improves or stays the same when they take ART.
      However, in some people KS continues to get worse when taking ART. These people may need
      chemotherapy at a later date.

      This study was done to find out if taking ART with immediate etoposide (ET) is better than
      taking ART alone or ART with delayed ET to treat limited stage KS. The study also tried to
      better understand KSHV and to see what kind of side effects are caused by ART and ET and how
      safe ART and ET are.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of three steps. At the study Step 1 entry, the participants were
      randomized (1:1) to receive ART alone (Arm A) or ART with immediate ET (Arm B). Study
      participants in Arm A who experienced KS progression that was confirmed by the Independent
      Endpoint Review Committee (IERC) could receive etoposide (ET) in addition to ART by entering
      Step 2 between study weeks 8 and 80. The target sample size was 468, 234 per arm.
      Randomization was stratified by:

        1. Screening CD4 cell count (&lt;200 or ≥200 cells/mm^3) and

        2. ART history (naïve or experienced).

      The duration of Step 1 or Step 1 and 2 combined was 96 weeks. After 96 weeks on study,
      participants who received ET (Arm B participants and Arm A participants who entered Step 2)
      entered Step 3 for a total of 144 weeks of safety follow-up.

      Step 1 visits occurred at screening, entry and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32,
      40, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96 from study entry. Step 2 visits were scheduled at entry and weeks
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84 from Step 2 entry until up to 96
      weeks on study. The key evaluations included physical examination, clinical assessments, KS
      exam, CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, hematology, chemistry and pregnancy testing (for women
      of reproductive potential). Plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), KS
      tumor punch biopsy were be stored for use in future analyses. Participants also completed ET
      and ART adherence evaluations and quality of life questionnaires. Step 3 visits were
      scheduled every 24 weeks and were limited to safety evaluations including targeted physical
      exam, clinical assessments and hematology.

      Study accrual terminated early, based on the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
      recommendation in March 2016. The participants in Steps 1 and 2 at that time were arranged to
      enter either Step 3 for safety follow-up after ET or, if they did not receive ET, to be taken
      off study. Step 3 safety follow-up is ongoing.

This outcome was initially specified in the study protocol. However, at the first post-entry visit, most participants had unquantifiable HIV-1 RNA levels. It would be misleading to calculate change from entry to HIV RNA-1 levels that could not be quantified. Therefore, the data collected did not support the outcome and the analytic method initially proposed in the study protocol, and this outcome measure could not be analyzed. The SAP updated the HIV-1 RNA outcome measure to HIV-1 RNA suppression at study visits (please refer to the secondary outcome measure #20).</description>

             information on this criterion can be found in the study protocol.

          9. Ability to swallow oral medications.

         10. Karnofsky performance score &gt;= 60 within 30 days prior to entry.

             entry at a DAIDS-approved laboratory.

         13. For treatment-experienced patients, the availability of an ART regimen that includes
             at least two ART drugs that in the opinion of the site investigator are expected to
             have activity based on historical genotypic testing (if available) and treatment
             history.

         14. For participants who were to receive ART other than EFV/TDF/FTC, the availability of
             those ART components.

        Step 2: Inclusion Criteria

          1. KS progression compared to study entry or best response with ART alone while on Step
             1, between weeks 8 and 80.

          2. Need for ET for treatment of KS progression, in the opinion of the site investigator,
             after confirmation of KS progression by the IERC.

          3. Willingness to receive ET for treatment of KS progression.

          4. For female participants of reproductive potential, a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test performed within 7 days prior to initiating ET.

          5. Karnofsky Performance Score &gt;= 50.

             fertilization).

          9. Participants who are participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy
             must have agreed to use a combination of TWO of the following methods- Condoms (male
             or female) with or without a spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with
             spermicide, IUD, tubal ligation, hormone-based contraception. For Etoposide,
             confirmation of lack of reproductive potential was required for all participants. More
             information on this criterion can be found in the study protocol.

        Step 3: Inclusion Criteria

        1. Received at least one dose of ET (Arm B participants and Arm A participants who entered

         10. In the opinion of the site investigator, any psychological or social condition, or
             addictive disorder that would have precluded compliance with the protocol.

         11. Chronic, acute, or recurrent infections that were serious, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, for which the participant had not completed at least 14 days of therapy
             prior to study entry and/or was not clinically stable.

        Step 2: Exclusion Criteria

          1. Chronic, acute, or recurrent infections that were serious, in the opinion of the site

        <description>KS status is a composite, categorical outcome, ordered from worst to best as E1 (Failure: KS progression (PD), initiation of an alternate KS treatment, or no follow-up at Week 48 including death and missed visit), E2 (Stable: in follow-up at Week 48 with no KS PD nor response and without initiation of an alternate KS treatment) and E3 (Response: in follow-up at Week 48, with KS partial or complete response (PR or CR) and without initiation of an alternate KS treatment). Alternate KS treatment was defined as chemotherapy agent other than ET or other treatment triggered by worsening KS. KS outcome status (PR, stable, PR, CR) compared to study entry was evaluated at Week 48 based on clinical assessment of KS cutaneous lesions (count, character and marker lesion area), oral KS, visceral KS and tumor-associated edema and as described in the publications (Krown et al 1989, Cianfrocca et al 2002).

        <title>Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) Status at Week 96 Compared to Study Entry</title>
        <description>KS status is a composite, categorical outcome, ordered from worst to best as E1 (Failure: KS PD, initiation of an alternate KS treatment, or no follow-up at Week 96 including death and missed visit), E2 (Stable: in follow-up at Week 96 with no KS progression nor response and without initiation of an alternate KS treatment) and E3 (Response: in follow-up at Week 96, with KS PR or CR and without initiation of an alternate KS treatment). Alternate KS treatment was defined as chemotherapy agent other than ET or other treatment triggered by worsening KS. KS outcome status (PD, stable, PR or CR) compared to study entry was evaluated at Week 96 based on clinical assessment of KS cutaneous lesions (count, character and marker lesion area), oral KS, visceral KS and tumor-associated edema and as described in the publications (Krown et al 1989, Cianfrocca et al 2002). Data on initiation of alternate KS treatment, loss to follow-up and deaths are from entry through Week 96.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Incidence of KS-IRIS</title>
        <description>KS-IRIS was defined as KS progressive disease that occurs within 12 weeks of initiation of ART that is associated with an increase in peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocyte cell count of at least 50 cells/mm^3 above the study screening value and/or a decrease in the HIV RNA level by at least 0.5 log10 below the study entry value prior to, or at the time of, documented KS progressive disease. Cumulative incidence was estimated with death and initiation of alternate KS treatment as competing risks. Time at risk was censored (1) when lost to follow-up, (2) at the study visit following Week 12 or (3) on the date when the DSMB's recommendation to close the study became public, whichever occurred earlier. Time of KS-IRIS was defined as the time of the initial KS progressive disease.</description>

        <description>Absolute change in log10 HIV-1 RNA from entry at study visits calculated as value at a given time point minus value at entry. This outcome was initially specified in the study protocol. However, at the first post-entry visit, most participants had unquantifiable HIV-1 RNA levels. It would be misleading to calculate change from entry to HIV RNA-1 levels that could not be quantified. Therefore, the data collected did not support the outcome and the analytic method initially proposed in the study protocol, and this outcome measure could not be analyzed. The SAP updated the HIV-1 RNA outcome measure to HIV-1 RNA suppression at study visits (please refer to the secondary outcome measure #20).</description>
