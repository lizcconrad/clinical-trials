  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus, the most virulent of the many staphylococcal species, has been
      recognized as one of the most important and lethal human bacterial pathogens. With the
      increased incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in
      community and hospitalized patients, MRSA infections are associated with greater lengths of
      stay, higher mortality, and increased costs. Vancomycin and teicoplanin, are the two most
      commonly used glycopeptides and are the first-choice of treatment for MRSA infection.
      Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is still a point of controversy. Teicoplanin is not known
      to have any nephrotoxicity. Acute kidney injury is a common complication of critical illness,
      which is reported in 5 to 7% of hospitalized patients. It is associated with significantly
      increased mortality, length of stay, and costs across a broad spectrum of conditions.

      In this retrospective observational study, data collection was performed using the patient
      list extracted from the medical management system of Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang
      Hospital. Hospitalized patients who had been prescribed either vancomycin or teicoplanin for
      treating bloodstream infection caused by MRSA and had at least one serum creatinine data
      within 7 days after initiating glycopeptide therapy were recruited for this study. The major
      outcome variables of interest were the new onset of nephrotoxicity, which was defined as
      decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for more than 25% or 50% from baseline based on
      serial serum creatinine (SCr) measurements. Other variables including age at admission,
      gender, comorbidities, laboratory data, concurrent medications (e.g., drug name, dose, route,
      dosing interval, starting date and end date), and medical cost information were also obtained
      from the database.

      We performed this observational clinical study with 2 main goals: (1) to determine the rate
      of nephrotoxicity and mortality in patients with MRSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin or
      teicoplanin; (2) to determine whether vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity increase length of
      stay and costs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized patients who had been prescribed either vancomycin or teicoplanin for
             treating bloodstream infection caused by MRSA and had at least one serum creatinine
             data within 7 days after initiating glycopeptide therapy were recruited for this
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who aged less than 15 years at admission were excluded. Those who switch
             treatment from vancomycin to teicoplanin or vise versa during the hospitalization were
             also excluded to avoid any possible carryover effect. Because the main objectives of
             this study were to compare the magnitude and consequences of nephrotoxicity associated
             with the two study medications, patients who underwent dialysis before the
             glycopeptides treatment were further excluded.
