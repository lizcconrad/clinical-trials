    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility (ability to be done) of an experimental
      test to help plan your cancer treatment. This study plan is not studying the effectiveness of
      the proposed combinations of therapy for your cancer that you may receive after the
      experimental testing.

      This study will look at an experimental technology to determine a tumor's molecular makeup
      (gene expression profile). This technology (called &quot;OncInsights&quot;) is being used to discover
      new ways to understand cancers and potentially predict the best treatments for patients with
      cancer in the future. The experimental technology has not been approved by the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically proven neuroblastoma and confirmation of refractory
             or recurrent disease with histologic confirmation at diagnosis or at the time of
             recurrence/progression

          -  Patients must be age &gt; 12 months and ≤ 21 at initial diagnosis.

          -  Life expectancy must be more than 3 months

          -  If measurable disease, this must be demonstrated by residual abnormal tissue at a
             primary or metastatic site measuring more than 1 cm in any dimension by standardized
             imaging (CT or MRI); tumor must be accessible for biopsy. Patients with bone marrow
             only disease expected to be &gt; 75% are eligible to enroll.

          -  Current disease state must be one for which there is currently no known curative
             therapy

          -  Lansky or KarnofskyScore must be more than 50

          -  Patients without bone marrow metastases must have an ANC &gt; 750/μl and platelet count &gt;
             50,000/μl

          -  Adequate liver function must be demonstrated, defined as:

             potential (≥ 13 years of age or after onset of menses)

          -  Informed Consent: All patients and/or legal guardians must sign informed written
             consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional

          -  Patients with any other medical condition, including malabsorption syndromes, mental
             illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with
             the interpretation of the results or which would interfere with a patient's ability to
             sign or the legal guardian's ability to sign the informed consent, and patient's
             ability to cooperate and participate in the study
