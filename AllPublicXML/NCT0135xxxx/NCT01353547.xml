      The purpose of the research study is to identify the genetic, environmental and immune
      profiles that may increase a person's risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). While MS is
      not a disease caused by a single variation in genetic material (DNA), a single environmental
      factor, or a single malfunction in immune cells, there are genetic alterations, environmental
      exposures and immunologic factors that make the development of MS more likely. Obtaining
      information about who is at risk for MS will be beneficial in the future if the investigators
      can identify effective ways to prevent or slow down the progression of this disease.

  <detailed_description>

      MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system (white bloods cells that normally
      fight infection) becomes misdirected and attacks healthy tissue. In patients with MS, the
      misdirected white blood cells attack myelin, a lining that insulates the nerves found in your
      brain and spinal cord. This results in inflammation and damage in the myelin. Loss of this
      protective lining disrupts nerve impulses and causes abnormal function in the nervous system.

      This large research study will ultimately enroll over 5000 subjects who are at risk of
      developing MS.

    <measure>Brain MRI after recruiting 2200 subjects and calculating their genetic and environmental risk score of Multiple Sclerosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Genetic and Environmental Risk Score (GERS) will be calculated based on answers given in subject questionnaire and DNA collected from saliva sample. The questionnaire is about their neurologic and family history and potential environmental exposures. Subjects with the top and bottom 10% of GERS will undergo a single draw of up to 120 cc blood for analysis of immunologic markers. Subjects with the top and bottom 2.5% of GERS will undergo brain MRI to assess for asymptomatic MS-like lesions.</description>

        This large research study will ultimately enroll over 5000 subjects who are at risk of
        developing MS. The study will last 20 years. We will recruit subjects from all over the
        United States, as everything is done via mail, email, or/and phone.
