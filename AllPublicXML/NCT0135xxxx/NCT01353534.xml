    <textblock>
      Groups 1 to 3 will receive two vaccinations on Day 0 and Day 21. Group 1 will receive 3.8µg
      A/H5N1 antigen formulated with AS03 adjuvant, administered by IM injection. Group 2 will
      receive 15µg A/H5N1 by IM alone. Group 3 will also receive 15µg A/H5N1 antigen administered
      IM but followed by the topical application of a VEP at the vaccination site. Group 4 will
      receive a single vaccination on Day 0 of 30µg A/H5N1antigen by IM, followed by application of
      a VEP at the vaccination site.

      The VEP (Vaccine Enhancement Patch) contains 50 mcg LT (heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli)

The percent of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibody titer should meet or exceed 40%
The percent of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 should meet or exceed 70%
