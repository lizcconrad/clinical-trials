  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous
      genetically modified T cells transduced to express the high affinity NY-ESO-1c259 TCR in
      HLA-A2+ subjects and 2) measure the incidence of GVHD in patients following infusion of TCR
      modified autologous T cells.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous
      genetically modified T cells. Genetic material is transferred into the subject's previously
      harvested autologous T cells to redirect them to target myeloma cells rather than their usual
      target. Study subjects must have systemic or multifocal myeloma requiring autologous stem
      cell transplantation whose disease has relapsed or incompletely responded to prior therapy or
      have high-risk features. Subjects must also have measureable disease on study entry, as
      defined by quantifiable or detectable levels of serum or urine paraprotein or elevated serum
      free light chains with an abnormal ratio.

    <description>Patients with advanced myeloma and who are candidates for autologous stem cell transplants, or syngeneic stem cell transplants (SSCT), will be eligible. Prior to full screening on this study, patients will undergo prescreening to evaluate HLA-A type and presence of NY-ESO-1c259T/LAGE antigen. Patients will undergo a steady-state mononuclear cell apheresis for T cell collection, with an optional second collection. Once mononuclear cells have been collected, patients (or donors in the case of SSCT) will then undergo hematopoietic stem cell mobilization. Patients will receive a dose &gt;0.1-1 x 10¹º anti-CD3/anti-CD28-costimulated autologous T cells which have been genetically modified to express high affinity NY-ESO-1c259 TCRs.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo myeloma restaging at days +42, +100, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year post infusion. At this point, in accordance with FDA Guidelines, all patients will enter long term follow up (LTFU) and be followed biannually for monitoring for gene transfer delayed adverse events until year 5 post infusion. From year 5, all patients will require annual LTFU visits for monitoring for delayed adverse events until year 15 after receiving the genetically modified T cells.
Patients whose disease progresses prior to year 1 will enter LTFU at time of progression; however these patients will be seen quarterly from progression until year 1 post infusion and then follow the LTFU schedule mentioned above.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Myeloma has relapsed, progressed, or failed to respond after at least one prior course
             of therapy (consisting of at least 2 treatment cycles or months of therapy)

          -  Myeloma has responded partially to initial therapy but a complete response
             (immunofixation negative and normal serum free light chain) has NOT developed after a
             minimum of 3 cycles or months of initial therapy

          -  Myeloma has high-risk features as defined by the presence of one or more cytogenetic
             abnormalities known to confer a poor outcome even after standard auto-transplants:
             complex karyotype (≥ to 3 abnormalities), t(4;14), t(14;16), del (17) (p13.1), and/or
             chromosome 13 abnormalities. These patients may be enrolled even while in complete or
             near-complete remission

          -  Measurable disease on study entry, as defined by quantifiable or detectable levels of
             serum or urine paraprotein or elevated serum free light chains with abnormal ratio

          -  Patients who are in complete remission at the time of proposed study entry (serum and
             urine immunofixation consistently negative and normal serum free light chains) are not
             eligible unless their disease meets the criteria for high-risk as defined in protocol
