  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In each of the four study periods, subjects will receive one of the four study treatments in
      a double blind, randomised, manner. The effects of study treatment on alcohol intoxication
      will be determined by measurement of breath alcohol concentration and subjective effects of
      intoxication. Safety and tolerability will be monitored by measurement of vital signs, in
      particular pulse, and review of adverse events.
