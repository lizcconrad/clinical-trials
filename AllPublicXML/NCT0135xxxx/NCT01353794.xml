      The objective of this Non-Interventional study is to evaluate the effectiveness &amp; safety of
      Nexavar in advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) patients under daily-life treatment conditions
      based on age of the patient (older (age &gt;70 years) and younger patients (age &lt;70 years).
      Specifically investigated are the tumor status, duration of Nexavar ® treatment (number of
      cycles) and incidence of Hand foot Skin Reaction.
