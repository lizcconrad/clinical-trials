    <textblock>
      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259) is a randomized clinical trial in
      25,876 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin
      D3 (2000 IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (OmacorÂ® fish oil, 1 gram) reduces the risk of developing
      cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of these
      illnesses. This ancillary study is being conducted among VITAL participants and will examine
      whether vitamin D or fish oil have effects upon A) autoimmune disease incidence, B)
      biomarkers of systemic inflammation, and C) chronic knee pain. Blood samples at baseline and
      in follow-up will be collected in a randomly selected subcohort of 2000 individuals and
      analyzed for changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation: C-reactive protein,
      interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-receptor 2. Approximately 2000 individuals with
      chronic, frequent knee pain will be followed with annual questionnaires to evaluate the
      effects of the supplements on chronic knee pain.

    <description>Blood samples at baseline and in follow-up will be collected and analyzed for changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation: C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-receptor 2. We will test whether either or both supplements are associated with a decrease in the biomarkers of systemic inflammation (blood biomarker levels among those receiving supplements vs. placebo).</description>

    <measure>Severity of Knee Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with chronic, frequent knee pain at trial baseline will be followed with annual questionnaires to test for decrease in severity of chronic knee pain in those taking supplements compared to those taking placebo. We will test whether either or both supplements are associated with reduced levels of knee pain at the end of the trial (comparing knee pain outcomes in those receiving supplements to placebo).</description>

    <description>We will test for interactions between the effects of vitamin D and those of fish oils for each of the primary outcomes above: (A) whether either or both supplements are associated with reduced numbers of new cases of autoimmune diseases; (B) whether either or both supplements are associated with reductions in biomarkers of systemic inflammation and; (C) whether either or both supplements are associated with reduced levels of knee pain at the end of the trial.</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will test for differential effects of and interactions between vitamin D and fish oils for each of the three primary outcomes, according to participant age, race, sex and BMI. We will test for these interactions for each of the primary aims above: (A) whether either or both supplements are associated with reduced numbers of new cases of autoimmune diseases; (B) whether either or both supplements are associated with reductions in biomarkers of systemic inflammation and; (C) whether either or both supplements are associated with reduced levels of knee pain at the end of the trial.</description>
