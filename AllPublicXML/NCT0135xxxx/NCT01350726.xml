      The aims of this study were divided into three parts:

        1. To develop a new software to carry out the functional-three- dimensional-reconstruction
           of the liver by 99mTc-GSA-SPECT scintigraphy

        2. To probe a new dynamic model of the metabolism of the 99mTc-GSA.

        3. To evaluate the liver function by 99mTc-GSA-SPECT scintigraphy before surgical
           treatment.

      Study design:

        1. Collectivity type: Prospective，randomized, controlled, multi-central clinical study.

        2. Patients: The subjects were from different hospitals including: Peking Union Medical
           College Hospital (PUMCH).
