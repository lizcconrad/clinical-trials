    <textblock>
      The aim of the present skin test study CS-BM32-001 is to evaluate whether the BM32 proteins
      exhibit low/no allergenic activity when applied by skin prick- and atopy patch testing to
      grass pollen allergic patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BM32 is a hypoallergenic grass pollen allergy vaccine which consists of an aluminum
      hydroxide-adsorbed equimolar mix of four active ingredients, BM321, BM322, BM325 and BM326.
      The four active ingredients are purified recombinant proteins containing non-allergenic
      peptides from the four major timothy grass pollen allergens, Phl p 1 (BM321), Phl p 2
      (BM322), Phl p 5 (BM325) and Phl p 6 (BM326) which are fused to the PreS domain of hepatitis
      B virus, a protein used in childhood vaccines. BM32 holds promise not to induce IgE mediated
      immediate type (e.g. anaphylactic reactions) or T-cell mediated late phase side effects
      during immunotherapy.

      The aim of the present skin test study CS-BM32-001 is to evaluate whether the BM32 proteins
      due to their low/absent IgE- and T cell-reactivity exhibit low/no allergenic activity when
      applied by skin prick- and atopy patch testing to grass pollen allergic patients (n=60). This
      study will therefore provide important information for immunotherapy studies based on BM32.

    <description>For skin prick testing a drop of the test solution will be placed on the subjectsÂ´ skin at a distance of at least 2 cm between individual application points. The skin will be pricked with sterile prick lancets. Reactions will be recorded after 20 minutes by measuring the diameters of the wheal. Wheals of more than 3 mm diameter will be regarded as positive reactions.</description>
