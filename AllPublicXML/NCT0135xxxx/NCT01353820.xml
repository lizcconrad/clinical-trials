      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus Delbruckii lactis
      (DN111244) fermented milk consumption on relative change of plasma LDL-cholesterol
      concentration in hypercholesterolaemic adults after 8 weeks of product consumption versus
      control product.
