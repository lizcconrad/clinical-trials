  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women who had received the AdimFlu-S
      (A/H1N1) influenza vaccine during gestation period. Eligibility into the study was confirmed
      by chart review. If subject meets the eligibility criteria during the study period, data from
      the medical chart were extracted retrospectively from the date of vaccination and the infant
      (s) health status were followed until 8 weeks after the delivery.The unexposed cohort
      included pregnant women who did not receive any influenza vaccine during pregnancy. Within
      each participated study center, women who were gestation after April 2009 were randomly
      selected according to maternal age matching. The pregnancy outcome, including the status of
      delivery, abortion and gestational age, were extracted retrospectively by chart review.

        The target population was derived from medical centers in Taiwan: National Taiwan
        University Hospital, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital - LinKou and China Medical University
        Hospital.

        The sample size for this study was planned to include 500 cases in exposed cohort and 500
        cases in unexposed cohort. Actual recruitment depended on the volume of pregnancy women
        received AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1) at each hospital. The size of unexposed cohort was be equal to
        the exposed cohort.
