  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A lot of elderly people travel to hepatitis A endemic areas. The prevalence of hepatitis A
      IgG positivity is declining in the Netherlands, also in the elderly. Studies show that people
      above 40 years of age have a slower immune response to hepatitis A vaccination. However, a
      lot of travelers seek pre-travel advice only shortly before their journey. More information
      about the time to adequate antibody response after hepatitis A vaccination is required to
      provide good protection during travelling. Alternative protection with immunoglobulins are
      available.

      Study design: Observational, longitudinal pilot study Study population: 20 adults over 60
      years of age with a negative hepatitis A IgG, (with a estimated 50% positivity for hepatitis
      A IgG in this age Group, 40 patients in this age group) 20 adults 18-40 years of age as
      controls.

      Intervention (if applicable): When hepatitis A vaccination is indicated and informed consent
      is obtained, hepatitis A IgG wil be measured at day 0, 7, 14, 21 en 28.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Time to protective hepatitis A IgG. Nature and extent of the
      burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: hepatitis A
      vaccination will be given also outside this study. In the study 5 venous punctures of 7 ml of
      blood.
