    <textblock>
      Although hip replacement surgery is a successful way of dealing with the pain and immobility
      caused by hip arthritis, 10% of the hip replacements carried out in the UK fail within 10
      years. The main reason for this is the development periprosthetic osteolysis, that is, loss
      of bone around the site of the hip replacement. The osteolysis is thought to be due to the
      small particles of debris worn from the surfaces of the hip implant. These particles cause a
      reaction in the blood cells around the joint which in turn affects bone cells and leads to a
      loss of bone around the implant. The joint implant will then eventually become loose and
      unstable, a condition known as aseptic loosening. At present the only way to treat aseptic
      loosening is to have another operation to secure the hip joint, known as revision surgery.
      Revision surgery is not always successful and exposes the patient to the risk of major
      surgery.

      In this study we explore the potential for giving a medication (denosumab) that may prevent
      the loss of bone around the hip replacement implant. We will recruit patients who have been
      listed for revision surgery. One group of patients will be given a single dose of denosumab;
      another group will be given a placebo (dummy drug). At the time of the revision surgery a
      small sample of the bone from around the hip replacement will be taken and examined under the
      microscope. Comparisons will be made between the patients having the denosumab and those
      having placebo to find out whether the denosumab is having a beneficial effect on the bone
      surfaces. If successful, this study will lead to further studies to develop the use of
      denosumab to prevent aseptic loosening.

      This is a single centre, double blinded, randomized, controlled trial of denosumab compared
      to placebo in adults undergoing revision surgery of total hip arthroplasty due to prosthesis
      related osteolysis. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive either denosumab or placebo. 15 participants will be assigned to each
      treatment arm.

        1. 60mg denosumab by injection as a single dose

        2. Placebo by injection as a single dose After they have given informed consent, all
           participants will have a screening visit (Visit 1). Participants who are eligible after
           completing all screening assessments will be randomly assigned to receive one of the two
           treatments. All screening procedures will be completed within 14 (±7) days before
           beginning the medication. Study medication will be given at visit 2, which will occur 8
           weeks (56 ±7 days) before the date of the planned revision surgery. Participants will
           attend for 5 visits in total as shown below. Visit 1, Baseline, 2 weeks (±7 days)before
