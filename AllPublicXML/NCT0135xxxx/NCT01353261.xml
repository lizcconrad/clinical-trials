  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn more about platelet reactivity (how well the small cells in
      the bloodstream work) in people who undergo Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for
      stable and unstable (acute myocardial infarction) indications. Stable means you have not
      demonstrated any acute injury to your heart prior to your PCI; unstable means you have
      demonstrated some acute injury to your heart prior to your PCI. The investigators intend to
      determine if there is a change in platelet reactivity from the time of PCI to 30days post-PCI
      and does this change differ depending upon the conduction in which you present for PCI. This
      is going to be done with a variety of platelet reactivity assays.

    <description>The primary endpoint will be whether the results of platelet function assays used to measure response to clopidogrel and prasugrel therapy is similar amongst patients with stable CAD and those with AMI undergoing PCI. On-treatment platelet reactivity will be measured using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary endpoint will be to determine on-treatment platelet reactivity at the same time points using:
The vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation assay; and/or
The Chrono-Log Lumi-Aggregometer, which measures platelet aggregation (via optical density or electrical impedance) in response to ADP stimulation.</description>

        Seventy five subjects (25 patients undergoing elective PCI for stable CAD and 50 patients
        undergoing urgent PCI for AMI(25 receiving clopidogrel and 25 receiving prasugrel - as

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient &gt;18 years old.

          -  Patient scheduled to undergo PCI for either stable CAD or AMI:

          -  Stable CAD defined as negative cardiac isoenzymes prior to the PCI as well as no
             resting ECG changes indicative of ACS.

          -  AMI defined as positive cardiac isoenzymes prior to the PCI and/or resting ECG changes
             indicative of ACS.

             3. Patients treated with a loading dose of clopidogrel at least 6 hours prior to the
             blood draw or on a maintenance dose of clopidogrel (of at least 75mg QD) for a minimum
             of 5 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergies to aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel

          -  Use of a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor within 8 hours of the blood draw;

          -  Patient known to be pregnant or lactating;

          -  Patient with known history of bleeding diathesis or currently active bleeding;

          -  Platelet count &lt;100,000/mm the day of the blood draw;

          -  Hematocrit &lt;25% the day of the blood draw;

          -  On warfarin therapy at the time of the blood draw or the need for warfarin therapy in
             the subsequent month following the blood draw;

          -  Known blood transfusion within the preceding 10 days of the blood draw;

          -  Patient who has received NSAID (not including ASA) within preceding 24 hours of the
             blood draw;

          -  Patients presenting with cardiogenic shock;

          -  Any significant medical condition, which in the investigator's opinion may interfere
             with the patient's optimal participation in the study.
