  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that patients can improve their safety through informed choice, safe
      medication use, and complication reporting. This includes not only the potential problems
      that occur from prescription medication use but also issues that may arise through the
      improper use of over-the-counter medications. The willingness of a patient to take on safety
      action is known to be complicated by an unwillingness to behave in a manner that might
      challenge a physician's judgment or actions. Community pharmacists are in the unique position
      to provide perspective on the physician's recommendation and act as an advocate to facilitate
      necessary change. Through supportive and repeated interaction with their community pharmacist
      patients will develop assertiveness toward their own health care, an increased frequency and
      quality of interaction with their physician, and thus a minimized risk of harm and maximized
      opportunity to optimize clinical outcomes.

      This is a single center, observational study to determine if geriatric patients who are on
      five or more chronic medications will have a difference in clinical, humanistic, and/or
      economic outcome through an integrated clinical pharmacy service intervention. The primary
      efficacy objective will be assessed through a single cohort, paired research design measuring
      the change from baseline in the adherence rate, number of medication related problems, and
      Beers criteria medications. The primary economic objective will be assessed through
      prescription revenue to validate the employment of a 0.5-1.0 Full-time equivalent (FTE).
      Secondary efficacy objectives will be assessed through a single cohort, paired research
      design measuring the change from baseline in the health literacy, optimization in the
      anthropometrics, and health related quality of life (HRQOL).
