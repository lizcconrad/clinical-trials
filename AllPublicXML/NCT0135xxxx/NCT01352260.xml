      The objective of this study is to validate Near-Infrared (NIRS) monitoring in patients
      undergoing circulatory arrest. This study will compare two-wavelength NIRS INVOS System,
      Somanetics; Troy, MI) with four-wavelength NIRS (Nonin Medical, Inc; Plymouth, MN) to
      determine which modality best correlates with jugular venous oxygen saturation
