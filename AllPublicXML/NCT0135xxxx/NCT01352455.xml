  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A health kidney works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to remove toxins and fluid from the body.
      Many children with permanent kidney failure undergo dialysis, a life saving procedure that
      takes the place of a kidney. Currently, many children with permanent kidney failure only
      receive dialysis treatments 3 days a week in the hospital dialysis clinic. Children on
      dialysis have a markedly reduced life expectancy, with a life span 40-50 years shorter than
      their healthy counterparts. Survival for these children has not improved over the last 20
      years. These data indicate that the current dialysis treatment strategy is unacceptable.

      This research project will study if more frequent dialysis, performed 5 days per week, will
      improve the health of children with permanent kidney failure compared to the current
      treatment strategy. Children will be treated with both traditional and more frequent dialysis
      schedules to measure improvements in their health and well being.

             chronic HD.

          -  Patients have to be on chronic HD for at least 2 months before eligibility

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a scheduled (with a specific transplant date) kidney transplant in the
             next 6 months

          -  Patients scheduled to be switched to peritoneal dialysis in the next 6 months

          -  Patients currently receiving &gt;3 days per week of hemodialysis

          -  Patients currently receiving &gt;12 hours per week of hemodialysis

          -  Anyone &lt;3 years of age would be excluded from the study, so our minimum anticipated
             patient weight would be about 11 kg

          -  Patients &gt;21 years of age at enrollment

          -  Patients receiving concomitant peritoneal dialysis

          -  Patients with &lt;2 months on chronic HD

             SBP &lt;95th percentile for age, sex, and height)

          -  Patients enrolled in an investigational drug trial involving blood pressure medication
             or any other clinical trial potentially affecting the primary outcome of the study

        Patients listed for a deceased donor transplant will not be excluded.
