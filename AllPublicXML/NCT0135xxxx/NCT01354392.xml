  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the commonest type of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a
      type of cancer of a cell called a lymphocyte which makes up part of the immune system.
      Although most patients are cured with chemotherapy used as initial treatment, about 20-30% of
      patients still experience relapse. Curing relapsed disease is much less successful, even with
      the use of high doses of chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. There is then an urgent need
      for effective, new agents to treat patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who have
      relapsed or who have developed resistance to other forms of chemotherapy.

      This trial is using a drug called AZD1152 which interferes with the ability of a cancer cell
      to divide and grow. It has been used before in patients with other types of cancer, but never
      before in lymphoma patients. Responses in other cancers have been seen, particularly in
      leukaemia which is a disease related to lymphoma. The investigators are planning to use this
      agent in 15 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in which potentially curative
      treatments have failed. The main aim is to see whether the drug shows any activity in this
      type of lymphoma. This will be mainly assessed using CT and PET scans. The investigators are
      also investigating how well a blood test can predict both the response to the drug and the
      toxicity of the drug - this is called a biomarker study and forms part of the clinical trial.
      The other main aim of the study is to assess the toxicity of the treatment. Previous studies
      in humans suggest the drug is reasonably well tolerated, although side effects such as
      stomatitis (soreness of the mouth) and suppression of the bone marrow (leading to risk of
      infection and bleeding) have been seen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Female, aged ≥ 18 yrs.

          -  ECOG performance score of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below Lab Test Value
             required Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9g/dL White Blood Count (WBC) ≥ 2x109/L Platelet count ≥
             100x109/L Absolute Neutrophil count ≥ 1.0x109/L; Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST
             (SGOT) or ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) &gt; 50 ml/min

          -  Relapsed or refractory DLBCL in which all participants must have received at least one
             potentially curative established immunochemotherapy lymphoma regimen that contained
             rituximab (e.g. R-CHOP, R-PMitCEBO, R-GCVP, R-CNOP). Participants must also have
             failed or be ineligible for salvage/high dose therapy.

          -  Relapsed or refractory DLBCL proven by biopsy (within 6 months of enrolment in trial);
             either de novo DLBCL or transformed follicular lymphoma.

          -  At least 1 lesion (&gt; 1.5cm), not previously irradiated, that can be accurately
             measured on CT and which is FDG avid on CT-PET scanning, as defined by Cheson
             criteria.

          -  Able to give informed consent and capable of co-operating with protocol.

             measures for the duration of the study (both male and female participants).
