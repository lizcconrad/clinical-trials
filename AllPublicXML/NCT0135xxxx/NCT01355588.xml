  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 1, double-blind, 4-way crossover study in healthy male and female
      volunteers. Subjects received 4 formulations of intranasal ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg.
      There was a wash-out period of 3-7 days between each dose. On Day 1 of each period subjects
      were randomised to receive either a single intranasal dose of 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine
      alone or single intranasal dose of 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine with 4%, 5% or 6% lidocaine
      hydrochloride. At the end of the study each subject had received all 4 treatments.

      The primary objective of this study in healthy volunteers was to compare the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 4 formulations of ketorolac tromethamine. A secondary
      objective was to monitor lidocaine hydrochloride plasma levels.
