    <textblock>
      This study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MK-8353 (formerly SCH 900353) given
      as single agent oral therapy for participants with advanced solid tumors will be done into
      two parts. In Part 1a, there will be a dose escalation to find the preliminary maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), and in Part 1b, dose confirmation to find out the recommended Phase 2
      dose (RPTD) that will be used in Part 2 of the study. In Part 2 of the study, participants
      with certain types of metastatic melanoma or metastatic colorectal cancer will be treated to
      see if MK-8353 is effective as single agent therapy.
