      Validation of a new Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire in a population of patient gaining a
      TiLOOP® TAPE surgical mesh for stabilization of the urethra.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of urinary incontinence in the adult female population has been estimated
      between 10% and 40%. Several treatment alternatives have been suggested until now.
      Nevertheless, the ideal treatment has not been identified yet. On the one hand this is
      related to the low amount of valid scientific information regarding different treatment
      methods. On the other hand the impact of patients' quality of life, which plays a major role,
      has not been fully considered. To date, there is no established Questionnaire on Quality of
      Life that provides physicians an assistance to obtain information on the subjective effects
      caused by stress urinary incontinence.

      In the present study the patients' Quality of Life will be assessed by use of two
      questionnaires, that is a new one and an already validated questionnaire. The study
      population consists of patients who already received an implantation of a sub-urethral
      surgical mesh (TiLOOP® Tape), of symptomatic patients before an operation, and of a group of
      non-symptomatic women. Subjects will be asked in a single visit only to fill in both
      questionnaires.

      Furthermore the safety and effectiveness of the TiLOOP® Tape mesh will be evaluated in the
      study arm of treated patients.

      Study has been terminated after major recruitment failure (only 21 instead of 240 patients
      has been included).

    <description>This arm of study patients is defined by patients treated with a TiLOOP® Tape mesh between 2007 and 2009 at the Franziskus Krankenhaus, Berlin. The sample of the treated population represents the patient population for which the medical device is intended. To minimize selection bias without compromising patients' rights and welfare, all treated patients will be invited. These patients will be asked to participate in the validation of the questionnaire on quality of life. In addition to this safety and effectiveness of the surgical mesh implantation will be collected</description>

        The indicated or treated population of women showing stress urinary incontinence that
        should / has been treated with a surgical mesh.

        The sample of patients treated with TiLOOP® Tape at the single center between 2007 and 2009
        represents the patient population for which the medical device is intended. The clinic
        continues to examine women with incontinence symptoms requiring a mesh implant. This group
        of patients is assumed to be similar to the study arm of treated patients.

        The Non-symptomatic Population consists of women comparable in age but without urinary
        incontinence
