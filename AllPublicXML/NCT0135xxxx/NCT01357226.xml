      Context: Use of automated blood pressure (BP) measurement devices in the office setting is
      increasingly recognized as superior to manual BP measurement. Current recommendations are to
      have the patient alone in a quiet room, with no interactions with health care professionals
      during the readings. However, this may not be practical in primary care offices where the
      exam rooms are constantly being used.

      Objective: To compare measurements with an automated BP device in private examination rooms
      with measurements in non-private areas of a primary care office.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial with cross-over.

      Setting: Community based primary care office participating in the NorTReN Practice Based
      Research Network in Toronto, Ontario.

      Participants: Fifty consecutive consenting patients over the age of 18 having their BP
      checked as part of their routine care.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomly allocated to either automated BP measurement in an
      exam room, or in a non-private area of the clinic. After being tested in the first location
      they will subsequently be tested in the second location with the same device.

      Main outcome measure: The primary outcome measure is a comparison between the mean systolic
      values of the automated BP measurements in the two office areas. The investigators will use
      the t-test for paired samples. The secondary outcome is a comparison of systolic values for
      patients with previously documented hypertension. The investigators define a clinically
      meaningful result as a difference of 5 mmHg or more in systolic BP.

      Conclusion: New technology is more readily adopted if barriers to use are minimized. If the
      investigators find no differences in BP readings between office locations, physicians will
      then have the convenience of an additional office area to implement the automated BP
      measurement device.
