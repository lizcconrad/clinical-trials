    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to provide evidence about the comparative
      effectiveness of mailed, tailored intervention materials on cancer prevention behavioral
      outcomes. The investigators will send out three (3) tailored mailings for participants who
      are assigned to the intervention group. Second, during the eligibility screening, the
      investigators will be assessing the relative yield and functioning of two risk assessment
      tools (BRAT and FEARS) on determining an individual's level of risk for skin cancer.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of a mailed, tailored intervention, on the skin cancer
      prevention and skin self-examination behaviors of high-risk and moderate-risk adults.
      Participants will be recruited in primary health care setting (Penn Radnor Clinic) after
      their scheduled appointment. During Phase I of this study, patients will be screened for
      their level of risk for skin cancer. They will be asked to complete a survey as well as
      undergo a quick skin exam administered by the research staff. Moderate- and high-risk persons
      will be invited to enroll in Phase II of the study, and will then complete a baseline survey
      either in person, over the phone, or via mail after they have consented. After completing a
      baseline survey, these participants will be randomized to receive tailored materials,
      including personalized risk feedback, or to a control group that will receive generic
      educational materials. Participants will then be re-assessed at follow-up approximately three
      (3) months later via a mailed survey.

      The intervention consists of one to three sets of intervention materials, depending on if
      they are randomized to the generic group or the tailored group. The first mailing will be
      sent out approximately two weeks after a participant completes the baseline survey, and is
      designed to educate participants on ways to prevent skin cancer though personalized
      behavioral changes. The second mailing will be sent out two weeks after the first mailing,
      and is designed to provide a guide to participants on steps to complete a skin self exam.
      Finally, the third mailing will be sent out two weeks after the second mailing, and will
      provide medical information to the participants regarding types of skin cancer along with
      tips to remember that encompass information from previous mailings.

      Finally, the participant will complete a follow-up survey approximately one (1) month after
      the last mailing has been mailed.

    <description>In Phase II of this study, we will conduct a randomized trial to compare the effects of a tailored intervention to a standard intervention of brochures with risk communication, skin cancer prevention, and skin cancer detection information. Outcomes are sun protection, sun exposure, frequency of sunburns, and skin examinations. Subjects in Phase II will be adults at moderate and high risk for skin cancer based on the scores they received from the risk assessment in Phase I.</description>

    <description>Phase I: Patients are screened for their level of risk for skin cancer. They will complete a survey and undergo a skin exam administered by the research staff. Moderate- and high-risk persons will be invited to enroll in Phase II.
Phase II: Three sets of materials will be sent in the mail over the course of 6 weeks. Pamphlets will contain information about ways to reduce participant's risk of skin cancer, including sun protection practices, benefits of skin screening practices, and how to do skin self-examinations.
The participant will also complete two surveys for this study, one at baseline and then one at follow up approximately three months later.
Each survey will ask the participant about:
Current and past skin cancer screening practices
Current and past sun protection practices
Attitudes about skin cancer and sun protection
Knowledge of melanoma</description>
