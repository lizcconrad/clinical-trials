      Background:

        -  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in individuals
           over 55 years of age. It can cause permanent loss of central vision, which is important
           for seeing fine details and long distances. AMD has two forms: wet AMD and dry AMD. Most
           people with AMD have dry AMD. But dry AMD can progress to wet AMD. Wet AMD is the more
           serious form and can result in severe vision loss.

        -  A method to identify and monitor the early to middle stages of AMD may help researchers
           develop new treatments to stop the disease before it becomes severe. In early dry AMD,
           people cannot see well at night. Researchers want to study whether a procedure that
           measures how the eye adjusts to the dark can help to identify and monitor early to
           middle dry AMD.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effectiveness of using a dark adaptation protocol to identify and monitor
      early to middle dry age-related macular degeneration.

      Eligibility:

      - People at least 50 years of age who have no AMD. Others who have early to middle dry AMD in
      at least one eye.

      Design:

        -  People will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine
           tests, and a full eye exam.

        -  This study will last 5 years and require at least 9 visits to NIH. (First visit; study
           visits at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24; and 3 yearly followup visits).

        -  Up to 10 people will be asked to come back to the clinic 1 week after their first visit.
           They will be asked to test the device to be used in the study.

        -  Participants will have baseline exams. These questions will be about problems that
           affect their eyes under different lighting conditions.

        -  At every visit, participants will answer questions about general health and current
           medications (including any vitamins or supplements). They will also have a full eye exam
           and a 20- to 40-minute test. This test measures how fast the eyes recover in response to
           decreasing levels of light. The test also measures how sensitive the eyes are to these
           conditions.

        -  Participants will continue to have these tests at the yearly followup examinations. They
           will be treated with the standard of care for any eye conditions they have or may
           develop during the study.

      Objective: This study is designed to investigate the use of dark adaptation as a functional
      endpoint for progression of eyes with no to intermediate age-related macular degeneration
      (AMD).

      Study Population: Two hundred forty (240) participants will be initially accrued; however, up
      to 280 participants who meet the eligibility criteria may be enrolled. Participants will have
      varying degrees of severity of AMD (Groups 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). Group 0 (N=40) is defined as
      participants without AMD meaning no large drusen (greater than or equal to 125 microns) or
      advanced AMD in either eye. Group 1 (N=40) is defined as participants with large drusen
      (greater than or equal to 125 microns) in the study eye and no large drusen or advanced AMD
      (choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or geographic atrophy (GA)) in the fellow eye. Group 2
      (N=40) is defined as participants with bilateral large drusen (greater than or equal to 125
      microns) with or without retinal pigment epithelial hypo/hyperpigmentary changes. Group 3
      (N=40) is defined as participants with large drusen (greater than or equal to 125 microns) in
      the study eye and advanced AMD (CNV or GA) in the fellow eye. Group 4 (N=40) is defined as
      participants with findings of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) defined as having (1) the presence
      of reticular interlacing patterns on at least one en face imaging method (color photography,
      autofluorescence or infrared) and (2) confirmation of previously described findings of
      hyperreflective material located between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the
      photoreceptor ellipsoid zone on SD OCT in those areas. Current participants in this study
      have been graded and categorized into this cohort. Up to 40 diabetic participants will be
      recruited.

      Design: This is a single center, exploratory, observational, longitudinal evaluation of dark
      adaptation response in AMD participants over five years and long-term evaluation of dark
      adaptometry (DA) change as a predictor for AMD progression and visual acuity (VA) loss.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is to determine mean change, including the distribution
      of change, in dark adaptation response between baseline and months 12 and 24 for Groups 0, 1,
      2, 3 and 4. Reproducibility between the Adapt RxTM (the research prototype of the AdaptDxTM)
      and the commercial AdaptDxTM will be evaluated in a minimum of 10 participants with repeat
      testing performed one week (- 6 days/+ 14 days) following the baseline visit. The secondary
      outcomes for each of the five groups are to determine mean change in dark adaptation response
      from baseline at months 3, 6, 18, 36, 48 and 60 and to determine mean best-corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA) of the study eye from baseline at months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60.
      Exploratory outcomes for each of the five groups are to correlate mean BCVA of the study eye
      with mean dark adaptation response at baseline and months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 and
      to correlate AMD severity with dark adaptation response at baseline and months 3, 6, 12, 18,
      24, 36, 48 and 60. This study will also analyze renal function in AMD participants.
      Additionally, exploratory analysis of the small sample of diabetic participants will also be
      performed.
