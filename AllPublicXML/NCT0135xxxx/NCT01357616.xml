      The purpose of this study was to compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and
      safety of AZARGA™ (Brinzolamide 1%/Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Suspension), dosed twice daily
      versus AZOPT® (Brinzolamide 1% Ophthalmic Suspension) and Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution,
      each dosed twice daily, in Chinese patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension
      who were insufficiently responsive to monotherapy.

      The study consisted of 2 sequential phases. Phase I was the Screening/Eligibility Phase, with
      a Screening Visit followed by an Eligibility Visit. Phase II was the treatment phase and
      included Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, and Week 8 visits. Eligible subjects were randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive Brinzolamide 1%/Timolol 0.5% or Brinzolamide 1% plus Timolol 0.5% two
      times a day for 8 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Mean diurnal IOP change from baseline at Week 8 (ie, the subject IOP change from baseline averaged over the 9 AM, 11AM and 5 PM time points at Week 8) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). A more negative change indicates a greater improvement..</description>

        <title>Mean Diurnal IOP Change From Baseline at Week 8</title>
        <description>Mean diurnal IOP change from baseline at Week 8 (ie, the subject IOP change from baseline averaged over the 9 AM, 11AM and 5 PM time points at Week 8) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). A more negative change indicates a greater improvement..</description>
