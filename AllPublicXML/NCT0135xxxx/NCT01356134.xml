    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that evidence of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI)
      may be evident in the vasculature of the fundus. The investigators will be examining fundi of
      multiple sclerosis patients and Ehlers-Danlos patients to see if evidence of CCSVI can be
      found in these patients having high risk for CCSVI. The investigators will read the fundus
      photos, compared to age-matched normals in a &quot;blind&quot; fashion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI) has been proposed as the cause of numerous
      neurodegenerative diseases of the brain. CCSVI is the result of poor drainage of blood (and
      cerebral spinal fluid to some degree) from weakened or stenosed veins usually located in the
      cervical area (most notably the internal jugular veins). Although current focus and treatment
      of CCSVI is on multiple sclerosis, CCSVI has also been implicated as a potential cause of
      Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's Disease. Additionally, patients with Ehlers-Danlos
      Syndrome (EDS) -- a disorder of connective tissue -- are more prone to developing multiple
      sclerosis than the general population. Many EDS patients are known to have weakened and
      abnormal blood vessels and 40 - 70% of EDS patients develop autonomic dysfunction in addition
      to numerous other symptoms found in patients with CCSVI. In the small subset of EDS and
      multiple sclerosis patients seen at Total Eye Care, the investigators have noticed a vascular
      irregularity (using the optomap® and examining the results under high magnification) which
      offers credence to the theory of CCSVI. Such objective data has been elusive, excepting for
      fMRI, ultrasound (to a limited degree) and venous angioplasty results. Current treatment of
      CCSVI involves the ballooning and sometimes stenting, of abnormally stenosed veins. The
      treatment of CCSVI offers hope to many patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. Although
      CCSVI research is in its infancy, many doctors believe that CCSVI is a significant portion of
      the solution to patients with neurodegenerative diseases of the brain. Because CCSVI is a
      vascular disorder, the investigators hypothesize that the investigators are able to screen
      candidates for CCSVI via the optomap®.

        Ehlers-Danlos patients will be accepted from any area, and will not be excluded based on
        location of residence. They need not be patients of Total Eye Care.
