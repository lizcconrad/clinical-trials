      Eligible subjects undergoing a colonoscopy will randomly receive either PICOPREP or
      polyethylene glycol 4000 electrolyte lavage solution before the procedure to evaluate its
      effectiveness, tolerability and safety.

    <measure>The Ottawa Scale Score of Patients Who Had Successfully Completed the Colonoscopy Examination After Having Completed the Study Bowel Preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The total Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS) score, rated by the treatment-blinded Investigator at colonoscopy, was designed to evaluate cleanliness of the colon by grading the endoscopic visibility of the mucosa according to a scale from 0 ('excellent' visibility) to 4 ('inadequate' visibility); The component scores for each of the colon segment are added together, along with an overall 'fluid' score (from small amount = 0, to large amount = 2). Thus, the total OBPS has a range from 0 (a perfect preparation) to 14 (a completely unprepared bowel)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Response to Acceptability and Tolerability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>On the day of the procedure, but before colonoscopy or any sedation for colonoscopy, subjects were asked to complete a standardised questionnaire regarding whether or not complete the IMP (yes or no), ease of taking IMP (rating from 1 point(very easy) to 5 point (very difficult)), degree of acceptability to study med (rating from 1 point (excellent) to 5 point (bad)), palatability of IMP (rating from 1 point (excellent) to 5 point (bad)) and tolerability (5 adverse reactions including abdominal bloating, spasms, nausea, vomiting and general malaise which were generally reported in bowel preparation with rating according to intensity from 1 point (None) to 4 point (Severe)).</description>

    <measure>Ottawa Scale Score by Colon Segment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>

    <measure>Proportion of Successful Colonoscopies in the Clinical Setting (Predicted by Ottawa Scale Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>At colonoscopy, bowel preparations were rated by the treatment-blinded endoscopist, as being of an overall quality &quot;adequate for clinical diagnostic purposes&quot; (Y/N). The total Ottawa Scale scores was correlated with 'adequate' or 'inadequate' quality of bowel preparation for clinical diagnostic purposes</description>

        <title>The Ottawa Scale Score of Patients Who Had Successfully Completed the Colonoscopy Examination After Having Completed the Study Bowel Preparation</title>
        <description>The total Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale (OBPS) score, rated by the treatment-blinded Investigator at colonoscopy, was designed to evaluate cleanliness of the colon by grading the endoscopic visibility of the mucosa according to a scale from 0 (‘excellent’ visibility) to 4 (‘inadequate’ visibility); The component scores for each of the colon segment are added together, along with an overall ‘fluid’ score (from small amount = 0, to large amount = 2). Thus, the total OBPS has a range from 0 (a perfect preparation) to 14 (a completely unprepared bowel)</description>
