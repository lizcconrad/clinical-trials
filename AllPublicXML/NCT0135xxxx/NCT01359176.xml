  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capnography is the non-invasive monitoring of the concentration or partial pressure of carbon
      dioxide (CO2) in the expired respiratory gases; it is thus a non-invasive monitoring
      technique which allows fast and reliable insight into ventilation, circulation and
      metabolism. The capnogram is a direct monitor of the inhaled and exhaled concentration or
      partial pressure of CO2, and an indirect monitor of the CO2 partial pressure in the arterial
      blood. The purpose of this study is to create a waveform library by collecting CO2 waveform
      data from healthy volunteers.

    <measure>To gather data received from monitoring healthy participants as reference for the creation of a capnography waveform library.</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will put on the capnography monitoring device (a simple tube with prongs that fit in the nostrils, similar in design to the oxygen delivering device &quot;nasal cannula&quot;) and this device will be hooked up to a computer. The participants will be asked to do very simple activities, such as sit, stand, eat and drink. The changes in their CO2 waveforms during these activities will be recorded in order to build a library of reference waveforms.</description>
