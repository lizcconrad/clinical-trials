    <measure>Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PR104 when administered weekly</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks (cycle 1)</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is based on cycle 1 data and defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 subjects with no more than one of the following DLTs:
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
Grade 4 heme toxicity (excluding thrombocytopenia) that lasts for ≥ 5 days (Neutrophils &lt; 500/mm3, ANC ≤ 0.5 K/mm3, lymphocytes &lt; 1K/mm3, HGB &lt; 6.5 gm/dL)
Non-heme toxicity ≥ Grade 3 despite appropriate treatment
Neutropenic fever
Grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity of ≥ 1 week
Any toxicity of Grade 2 or higher that has not resolved within 2 weeks of end of cycle 1 (except grade 2 alopecia)</description>

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1. See Section 15.1 (ECOG performance status) for
             definition of ECOG Performance Status 0 and 1

          -  Ability to read, understand and provide written informed consent

          -  If the subject is on systemic steroids, the dose of steroids must be stable for at
             least two weeks prior to the first dose of PR-104

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Licensed or investigational anti-cancer therapy (including radiotherapy) within four
             weeks of the baseline disease assessment (within six weeks for nitrosoureas and
             Mitomycin C). Subjects on androgen deprivation therapy are allowed on study and may
             continue to receive androgen deprivation therapy while one study

          -  Prior radiotherapy to more than 25% of bone marrow; prior high-dose chemotherapy
             (including either myeloablative or non-myeloablative transplants); or prior receipt of
             more than three chemotherapy regimens

          -  Absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1.5 x 109/L

          -  Platelet count of &lt; 100 x 109/L

          -  Hemoglobin level of &lt; 90 g/L (or requiring a red blood cell transfusion to maintain
             hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L)

          -  Serum bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal

          -  ALT and AST greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Serum creatinine less than 1.5 times upper limit of normal

          -  Prothrombin time (PT-INR) or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) greater than
             1.1 times the upper limit of normal range

          -  Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study

          -  Men or women of reproductive-potential who are unwilling to use an effective method of
             contraception during the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study
             medication. See section 5.11 (Contraceptives) for definition of effective methods of
             contraception

          -  Evidence of any other significant medical disorder or laboratory finding that in the
             opinion of the Investigator compromises the subject's safety during study
             participation, including uncontrolled infection or infection requiring a concomitant
             parenteral antibiotic

          -  Plans for concomitant anti-cancer therapy (excluding androgen deprivation therapy)
             while on study

          -  Less than four weeks since major surgery
