      A chronic condition such as psoriasis requires a high level of self- management and requires
      for many patients behaviour change to improve health outcome. Changing behaviour is a
      challenge that requires a commitment by the patient to implement successfully. Motivational
      interviewing is a patient centered directive counseling technique that focuses on assisting
      patients to identify their problems and involves exploring ambivalence in an empathic manner.
      It is a well-known method of counseling, and is considered to be a useful intervention
      strategy in the treatment of lifestyle problems.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial using telephone motivational interviewing. The
      counseling intervention comprises 6 telephone calls during a 12 week period, after attending
      3 weeks of supervised climate therapy on the Canary Islands

    <description>Motivational interviewing technique will be used to improve patient adherence to multiple health behaviour changes and support patients with psoriasis to self- manage effectively. The intervention will discuss on four main topics: diet, physical activity, stress management and psoriasis treatment.
Motivational interviewing is a patient centered directive counselling technique that focuses on assisting patients to identify their problems and involves exploring ambivalence in an empathic manner. A key goal in motivational interviewing is to increase the importance of change from the client`s perspective. This is accomplished by using specific types of open ended questions, selective reflections and reflective listening.</description>
