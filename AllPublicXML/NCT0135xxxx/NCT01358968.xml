  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect LY2603618 on a protein (enzyme CYP2D6)
      which is involved in the metabolic pathway of Desipramine in patients with cancer. This is a
      drug interaction study so the treatment of the disease will not be the main purpose of the
      study.

      The study involves two single doses of 50mg, 1 tablet by mouth, on Day 1 of Period 1 and 2.
      In Period 1 Desipramine will be administered alone, In Period 2 Desipramine will be
      administered in combination with LY2603618. LY2603618 will be administered as a 275mg IV
      infusion over 1hr.

      Desipramine will be administered at the end of the LY2603618 infusion. Information about any
      side effects that may occur will also be collected.

    <description>Single 50 mg oral dose of desipramine on day 1 of study period 1. Single 275 mg intravenous infusion of LY2603618 followed by single 50 mg oral dose of desipramine on day 1 of study period 2. Patients may then receive additional doses of LY2603618 in combination as follows: 1000 mg/m^2 intravenous dose of gemcitabine on days 1, 8 and 15 and 230 mg intravenous dose of LY2603618 on days 2, 9 and 16 of 28 day cycles OR 500 mg/m^2 intravenous dose of pemetrexed on day 1 and 275 mg intravenous dose of LY2603618 on day 2 of 21 day cycles.
Patients will be allowed to continue to receive the combination therapy until fulfilling of the criteria for discontinuation, such as unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.</description>

          -  Females with childbearing potential: Have had a negative serum pregnancy test less
             than or equal to 7 days before the first dose of study drug and must also not be
             breastfeeding

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy, in the judgment of the investigator, that will

             ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias,including atrial fibrillation), or other
             ECG abnormalities that would put the patient at unnecessary risk in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Drugs with narrow therapeutic windows and that are also known substrates of CYP2D6 or
             drugs that are classified as sensitive substrates of CYP2D6 are excluded

          -  Drugs or herbal supplements that are known inhibitors of CYP2D6 are excluded during
             the study, and during the 30-day period (or a minimum of 5 half-lives, whichever is
             less) prior to study start

          -  Patients who have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week
