  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: It is estimated that in the Netherlands each year approximately 900 patients with
      gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction are candidates for
      chemotherapy. Randomized studies comparing chemotherapy versus best supportive care have
      shown that survival and quality of life are prolonged with chemotherapy. However, no
      chemotherapy regimen is clearly superior with regard to prolongation of survival. Therefore,
      tolerability of treatment and ease of administration (outpatient compared to inpatient) are
      important considerations for the development of novel treatment schedules. Study design: This
      is an open-label, multicentre, phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel, oxaliplatin and capecitabine chemotherapy (B-DOC)
      as first-line therapy in patients with inoperable locally advanced or recurrent and/or
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction. In case of HER2
      positive inoperable locally advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
      stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction trastuzumab is added to this regimen (B-DOCT).

      Study Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint Progression free survival defined as the time measured from B-DOCT study,
      Protocol version 3.0 dated January 18, 2011 Page 5 / 60 the day of registration to first
      progression or death. Secondary endpoints Toxicity Overall survival, defined as the time from
      registration to death Response rate defined as the percentage of partial and complete
      responses Duration of response defined as time from response to first progression
      Translational research on pharmacogenomic and biological factors that may predict treatment
      response.

             to curative therapy.

          2. Measurable disease, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours
             (RECIST), assessed using imaging techniques (CT or MRI)
