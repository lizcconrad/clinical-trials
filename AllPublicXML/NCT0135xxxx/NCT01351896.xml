    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving lenalidomide together with vaccine
      therapy works in treating patients with early-stage asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      blood flow to the cancer. It may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to
      kill cancer cells. Giving lenalidomide together with vaccine therapy may make a stronger
      immune response and kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of early-stage, high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
      patients achieving a response (&gt;= 4-fold increase from baseline and/or antibody
      concentrations &gt;= 0.35 ug/mL in 6 of 7 type-specific anti-pneumococcal antibody levels) after
      2 doses of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugated vaccine (Prevnar 13, PCV13 [pneumococcal
      polyvalent vaccine]) administered concurrent with versus sequential to low-dose lenalidomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response (CR) rate after 2 years of lenalidomide therapy.

      II. To determine the time to first treatment (TFT), defined as the time from diagnosis to
      first non-lenalidomide therapy for progressive CLL as described by International Workshop on
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria.

      III. To determine the incidence of infection and invasive pneumococcal infections following
      treatment with the PCV13 vaccine and either concurrent or sequential lenalidomide.

      IV. To determine the frequency of humoral and cellular immune response to CLL tumor antigens
      following treatment with the PCV13 vaccine and either concurrent or sequential lenalidomide.

      V. To determine the safety and toxicity associated with long-term lenalidomide exposure.

      VI. To perform correlative pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies and correlate these
      with vaccine/tumor immunologic and disease response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (concurrent PCV13): Patients receive low-dose lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily on
      days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 24 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive 13-valent protein-conjugated
      pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) intramuscularly (IM) on days 78 and 134 (courses 3 and 5).

      ARM II (sequential PCV13): Patients receive PCV13 IM on days 1 and 78 (courses 1 and 3).
      Patients also receive low-dose lenalidomide as in arm 1 beginning on day 106 (course 4).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

             are not receiving an antiviral agent with known or potential interaction with
             lenalidomide; because the primary aim of this study is to measure the immune response
             to pneumococcal vaccination, only patients with cluster of differentiation (CD)4 cell
             counts &gt;= 200 and viral load &lt; 50 will be eligible

          -  Patients who have been treated for autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune
