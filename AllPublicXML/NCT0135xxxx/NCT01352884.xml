  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, first time in human study of AMP-224 in adult
      patients with cancer that is not responding to standard therapy. This study will be conducted
      in two stages consisting of a Dose-Escalation stage and an Expansion Stage.
