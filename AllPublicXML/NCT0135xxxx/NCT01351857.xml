      The purpose of this study is to determine if a structured transition program for adolescents
      and young adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) improves diabetes clinic attendance and
      management as well as glycemic control after transition from pediatric to adult diabetes
      care.

    <description>A Transition Coordinator, a Certified Diabetes Educator, will provide transition support and the link between pediatric and adult diabetes care. The Transition Coordinator is central to the intervention and will provide ongoing contact with the medical system as well as education and clinical support where appropriate.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control group will transition to adult care equal to the intervention group and will differ only by exclusion of Transition Coordinator. Control group will receive the current standard of diabetes care otherwise unchanged. Three months following randomization, subjects in the control group will be referred to the adult endocrinologist in the same way as subjects in the intervention group</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Established T1D diagnosis for a minimum of one year (chosen to allow time for
             adjustment to a new diagnosis and more stable disease control).

          -  Between the ages of 17 and 20 years. It is left to the clinical judgment of the
             pediatric endocrinologist to determine individually the appropriate age of the
             transition for each subject

          -  At least 1 visit during the previous year with the pediatric endocrinologist at a
             Diabetes Clinic (aim is to minimize the non-adherence with the intervention).

          -  Ability to participate in all aspects of this clinical trial.

          -  Written informed consent/assent must be obtained and documented.

          -  Resident of Ontario.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Prior enrollment in the current study.

          -  Current participation in another clinical trial or participation in another clinical
