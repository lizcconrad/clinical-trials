      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 3 g cinnamon was sufficient to delay the
      gastric emptying rate of a high-fat solid meal and subsequently reduce postprandial blood
      glucose and lipid responses, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness and satiety responses in a
      healthy adult population.

    <textblock>
      Cinnamon has been shown to delay gastric emptying (GE) of a high-carbohydrate meal and reduce
      postprandial glycaemia in healthy adults. However, it is dietary fat which is implicated in
      the etiology and is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). We aimed to determine the effect of 3 g cinnamon on GE, postprandial lipemic and
      glycemic responses, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness, as well as appetite sensations and
      subsequent food intake following a high-fat (HF) meal.

      The effect of acute oral administration of 3 g cinnamon on gastric emptying of a high-fat
      pancake test meal and subjective appetite sensations by visual analogue scale will be
      measured for six hours postprandially. During this time course, measurements of postprandial
      lipemic, glycemic, oxidative stress and arterial stiffness responses will be collected.
      Subsequently, food intake will be measured using an ad libitum buffet meal. The study will be
      conducted in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded manner in 9 healthy subjects.
