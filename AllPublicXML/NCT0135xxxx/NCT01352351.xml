  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The University of North Carolina (UNC) and Partners for Development (PFD), an American
      non-governmental organization, will conduct a 2-year cluster-randomized controlled trial in
      Bauchi State, Nigeria, to test the effectiveness of two behavior change strategies for
      increasing the proportion of participants who exclusively breastfeed their infants until 6
      months. The investigators will build upon PFD's existing microcredit and reproductive health
      program by adding face-to-face breastfeeding education during borrowers' meetings and
      bi-weekly cell phone breastfeeding messages. The hypothesis is that the control group will
      remain at the baseline level for exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months, while the intervention
      group will increase by 15%. The investigators will measure the effectiveness of the
      intervention by conducting baseline and final surveys with a cohort of 485 female borrowers
      who are pregnant at time 1 and who have a 6-month-old infant at time 2. The data will be
      analyzed using logistic regression adjusting for possible confounders and the effect of
      clustering.
