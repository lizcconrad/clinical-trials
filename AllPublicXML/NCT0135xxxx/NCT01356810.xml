  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with an acute onset and fluctuating course
      which is presented in 15 to 20% of patients admitted to general wards. It is a potentially
      life - threatening complication which can be prevented. It is the objective of this
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether a multicomponent environmental intervention
      could reduce the incidence of delirium in a general medical ward.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 287 patients 65 years of age or older who had been admitted to a general medicine
      ward and who were at risk of delirium were studied. Eligible patients were randomized to a
      multicomponent environmental intervention or standard care. Both groups were well balanced in
      patients characteristics and followed during the full hospital stay by a group trained in the
      application of the confusion assessment method to detect incident delirium.
