  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine how the consumption of different dietary oil varieties
      affects a broad range of metabolic responses that are important in the development of
      cardiovascular diseases. This study will examine the relationship between dietary oil
      consumption and arterial function, blood fat content, and blood markers of cardiovascular
      disease risk. Additionally, the efficiency of the body in converting fat from dietary oils
      into other specific fat compounds with know health benefits will be examined. Also, the
      correlation between psychosocial parameters and vascular function will be studied.

      Although consumption of omega-3 fatty acids favorably modulate circulating lipids and
      arterial health, there is confusion surrounding the specific health benefits of plant based
      alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) versus marine derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This research will examine the health benefits of ALA from
      consumption of diets rich in canola oil, novel monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and DHA
      enriched canola oils, and flax oil compared with a control diet representative of North
      American diets rich in omega-6 and saturated fats. Treatment oils will be examined for
      potential influence on endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidation, body composition,
      and plasma lipoprotein characterization. Furthermore, in an effort to elucidate the genetic
      factors that promote ALA conversion to EPA/DHA and strengthen the role of ALA in
      cardiovascular health, a major objective is to correlate common genetic variants in the fatty
      acid desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) gene cluster with ALA
      conversion to EPA/DHA and n-3 fatty acid composition of serum phospholipids in response to
      consumption of the treatment oils. Besides, psychosocial predictors of vascular function will
      be investigated.

    <description>On day 28 of each experimental phase, a fasting baseline blood sample is taken prior to administration of an oral dose of deuterium oxide containing a higher than normal proportion of the hydrogen isotope deuterium (2H).
