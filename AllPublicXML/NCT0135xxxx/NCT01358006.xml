    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the 5-HT2A binding over the maximum feasible
      dose range of JNJ-40411813, to estimate the plasma concentration associated with 50% 5-HT2A
      binding, and to investigate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-40411813 in healthy male
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label (volunteers and study staff will know the identity of assigned
      treatment), dose-ranging study to determine 5-HT2A receptor engagement by JNJ-40411813 as a
      function of dose and time in healthy male volunteers. The study will consist of an
      eligibility screening examination, an open-label treatment period and a follow-up examination
      (approximately 10 days after dose administration, a follow-up examination will be performed).
      Initially, 4 volunteers (Cohort 1) will be included to determine 5-HT2A receptor occupancy
      following single dose administration of JNJ-40411813. Dependent on the results, doses for the
      remaining 8 volunteers (Cohort 2 and 3) will be selected to further characterize 5-HT2A
      receptor occupancy within the feasible dose range up to maximally 700 mg JNJ-40411813.The
      maximal study duration for a volunteer will be 6 weeks. In this study, [11C]-MDL 100,907 will
      be used as positron emission tomography (PET) ligand to investigate the concentration-related
      binding of 40411813 to the 5-HT2A receptor in the brain. JNJ-40411813 (200 mg to 700 mg) will
      be taken orally (by mouth). If multiple capsules have to be taken, the actual intake may be
      spread over a 15-minute period. Study drug will be administered to each volunteer just after
      completion of a meal and within 30 minutes after the start of the meal.
