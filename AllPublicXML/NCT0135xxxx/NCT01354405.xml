      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Lanreotide on polycystic liver and
      kidneys in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

      The aim of this single center observational study is to assess the effect of lanreotide on
      polycystic liver and kidney. This is achieved by assessing total liver and kidney volume, and
      several urinary markers that could predict kidney damage or kidney dysfunction, such as GFR,
      blood pressure, and urinary tubular damage markers and serum biomarker FGF23.

      The investigators aim to include 43 patients affected by a polycystic liver due to ADPKD. The
      duration of the trial will be 28 weeks. The treatment will be 24 weeks and the first
      screening visit will take place four weeks before start of treatment. Eligible patients will
      be invited to participate.
