  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese adolescents are submitted to a multiprofessional weight loss program, which is formed
      by doctors, nutritionists, physiotherapists, psychologists,and physiologists. The volunteers
      have intervention 3 times a week during one year, where they practice exercises, have
      nutrition and psychology counseling, and physiotherapy orientation. Once a month they have an
      appointment with the doctor. The hypothesis of this study is that a multiprofessional therapy
      is able to improve anthropometric and biochemical parameters, and also the quality of life of
      obese adolescents.

      The volunteers are submitted to 10 exams (electrocardiogram, polysomnography, blood
      collection, body composition, rest metabolic rate, DXA, abdominal and carotid
      ultrasonography, lung function evaluation, ergospirometric test) 3 times a year (baseline,
      middle and at the end of the year). They also answer nutrition, sleep and psychology
      questionnaires.
