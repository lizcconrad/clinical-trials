  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what side effects a type of radiation treatment called
      focal brachytherapy has in treating early stage prostate cancer. The study is also looking at
      how useful focal brachytherapy will be in treating prostate cancer. Additionally, the
      investigators would like to see how this type of treatment impacts quality of life.

    <description>Post-treatment MRI outcome is defined as a 3-level categorical variable: positive, negative and undetermined. Post-treatment biopsy outcome is defined as a binary variable: positive and negative. We will examine the correlation between the 12-month MRI and 12-month biopsy, and between the 24-month MRI and 24-month biopsy. The correlation will be assessed by a Fisher exact test.</description>

    <description>This is a non-randomized, Phase II study examining the tolerance profile (primary endpoint) as well as the secondary endpoints of QOL changes, efficacy and the correlation of post-treatment MRI findings with post-treatment biopsy outcomes in men with early stage low volume prostate cancer treated with focal brachytherapy.</description>

    <description>A re-staging transrectal or transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy as currently performed at participating institutions. Focal brachytherapy will be performed at 8 weeks following the transrectal or transperineal biopsy or sooner if the patient has recovered from the repeat biopsy and the treating physician determines it is safe to proceed with treatment. The regions will be targeted with the prescription dose and receive 144 Gy of Iodine-125 (I-125). The quality-of-life assessment will focus on erectile function, urinary function, bowel function, and general health related quality of life. The patients will complete this assessment at baseline and then approximately 3 ± 1 months, 6 ± 1 months, 12 ± 2 months, 18 ± 2 months, and 24 ± 2 months after treatment.</description>
