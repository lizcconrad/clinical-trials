  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single arm study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in combination with methotrexate in patients with active
      rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to non-biologic disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously
      every 4 weeks for a total of 6 infusions plus methotrexate 10-25 mg orally weekly.
      Anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Low Disease Activity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Activity Score using 28-Joint Count (DAS28) was calculated from the number of swollen joints and tender joints using the 28-joint count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and global health assessment (participant-rated global assessment of disease activity using 10-mm visual analog scale [VAS]); DAS28 score ranged from 0 to 10, where higher scores correspond to greater disease activity. DAS28 less than or equal to (≤3.2) equals (=) low disease activity, DAS28 greater than (&gt;)3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity.</description>

          <title>Time to Achieve DAS28 Remission (DAS28 &lt;2.6)</title>
          <description>DAS28 was calculated from the number of swollen joints and tender joints using the 28-joint count, the ESR (mm/hour) and global health assessment (participant-rated global assessment of disease activity using 10-mm VAS); DAS28 score ranged from 0 to 10, where higher scores correspond to greater disease activity. DAS28 remission was defined as DAS28 &lt;2.6. Time to achieve remission was calculated in weeks as the time from the date of first infusion to the date of first achieving remission.</description>
