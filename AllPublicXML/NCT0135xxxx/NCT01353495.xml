      The primary objective of this study is to have ulcers completely healed by the Acellular
      Porcine Dermal Matrix (APM) protocol in the management of indolent diabetic ulcers at 12
      weeks.

    <description>We will evaluate the influence of continuous variables' effect on healing in general using a Mann Whitney U test. Dichotomous variables will be evaluated with a chi-squared test with odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). To evaluate the healing characteristics of each modality as a function of weeks of therapy and mean number of days to closure amongst patients healing within the 12-week study period, we will use a Kaplan-Meier life table analysis (log-rank test).</description>

    <intervention_name>APM Graft (BIOTAPE XMTM)</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients randomized to the APM group will, following surgical debridement for their diabetic foot wounds, receive a single application of an APM graft (BIOTAPE XMTM, Wright Medical Technology, USA) with dressing changes taking place weekly. All necrotic tissue will be removed from the wound prior to application. BIOTAPE XMTM will be sutured or stapled in place under a silver-based non-adherent dressing (Silverlon, Argenta Medical). Therapy will then be followed by a moisture-retentive dressing (hydrogel bolster) until complete epithelialization has occurred.</description>

          -  Patient's ulcer must be diabetic in origin and larger than 1cm2. Debridement will be
             done prior to randomization. Subject's informed consent for participating in this
             study, must be obtained prior to proceeding with sharp debridement.

          -  Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes
             mellitus per ADA).

          -  Patient's ulcer must exhibit no clinical signs of infection.

          -  Patient is of legal consenting age.

          -  Patient is willing to provide informed consent and is willing to participate in all
             procedures and follow up evaluations necessary to complete the study.

          -  Patient has adequate circulation to the affected extremity, as demonstrated by one of
             the following within the past 60 days:

               -  Dorsum transcutaneous oxygen test (TcPO2) with results ≥30mmHg, OR

               -  ABIs with results of ≥0.7 and ≤1.2, OR

               -  Doppler arterial waveforms,which are triphasicor biphasic at the ankle of
                  affected leg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting with an ulcer probing to bone (UT Grade IIIA-D). A positive
             probe-to-bone will be confirmed when bone or joint can be felt with a sterile,
             ophthalmological probe.

          -  Patients whose index diabetic foot ulcers are greater than 25cm2.

          -  Patients considered not in reasonable metabolic control, confirmed by an HgA1c greater
             than 12% within previous 90 days,

          -  Patients whose serum creatinine levels are 3.0mg/dl or greater.

          -  Patients with a known history of poor compliance with medical treatments.

          -  Patients who have been previously randomized into this study, or are presently
             participating in another clinical trial

          -  Patients who are currently receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

          -  Patients with known or suspected local skin malignancy to the index diabetic ulcer.

          -  Patients on anticoagulant medication will as in any surgical procedure, be monitored
             According to the protocols employed at the enrolling center.

          -  Patients diagnosed with autoimmune connective tissues diseases.

          -  Nonrevascularable surgical sites

          -  Active infection at site

          -  Sensitivity to the following antibiotics: Gentamicin, Cefoxilin, Linocmycin, Polymyxin
             B, Vancomycin

          -  Any pathology that would limit the blood supply and compromise healing;

          -  Patients that have received a biomedical or topical growth factor for their wound
             within the previous 30 days
