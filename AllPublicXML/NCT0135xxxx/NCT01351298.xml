  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flexible nasendoscopy involves passing a soft, thin, endoscope through the nose. This
      diagnostic procedure is often essential for assessment of a child by an Otolaryngologist in
      outpatients. The purpose of this randomized controlled double-blind study is to determine
      whether there is a difference in the degree of discomfort experienced by children undergoing
      flexible nasendoscopy, after receiving one of three different intranasal sprays: (A) placebo
      (isotonic saline solution), (B) decongestant (0.05% xylometazoline hydrochloride), or (C)
      decongestant with local anesthetic (0.05% xylometazoline hydrochloride with 1% lidocaine
      hydrochloride).

      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the degree of reported discomfort experienced
      (using a validated pediatric pain score) by children undergoing flexible nasendoscopy, after
      receiving either intra-nasal topical placebo, decongestant, or decongestant with local
      anesthetic.
