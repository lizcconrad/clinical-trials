      This study is being conducted at the Southern California University of Health Sciences.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups: chiropractic care
      alone, acupuncture care alone, and chiropractic and acupuncture care combined.

      Subjects will be treated on pragmatic basis for 60 days and then followed up for an
      additional 60 days. All examinations and treatments will be provided free of charge. The
      expected benefits for the participants are decreased pain and improved function.
