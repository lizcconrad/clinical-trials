      The purpose of this study is to provide data to support combination treatment of the upper
      face with Perlane-L® and Dysport™. This study will assess the outcome of upper face
      rejuvenation in the temporal fossa; outcome of glabella and/or periorbital regions will also
      be assessed as a secondary endpoint.

    <description>Patients entering will be based on gender and assessment of procerus and corrugator muscle mass. Muscle mass will be graded separately for males and females as +, ++, or+++ (light/small, moderate/medium, or heavy/large) by assessment of the procerus/corrugator muscles. Male patients will receive 0.3 mL to 0.4 mL (60, 70, or 80 units) in five equally divided doses of Dysport™ Female patients will receive 0.25 mL to 0.35 mL (50, 60 or 70 units) in equally divided doses of Dysport™ at 5 designated injection sites in the glabellar region
Subjects will be treated with Dysport™ 20 or 30 units bilaterally to crow's feet.
Subjects will be treated at baseline and if maximum amount of product has not been used at 1 month follow up subject will receive a touch up. No further treatment will be done for the remaining study visits.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient,male or female subjects of any race, 40-75 years of age.

          -  One of the following:

        Periocular rhytids characterized by a measurement of 3 or more during maximum attempted
        muscle contraction (during maximum smiling) upon evaluation using the Rao-Goldman 5 point
        Facial Wrinkle Scale.

        Mild to moderate glabella rhytiuds by a measurment of 3 or more upon evaluation using the
        Rao-Goldman 5-point Facial Wrinkle Scale.

          -  Subjects will be enrolled if previous history of facial cold sores, but will be
             medicated to avoid any recurrence.

             baseline and practice a reliable method of contraception throughout the study: A
             female is considered of childbearing potential unless she is post menopausal for &gt;12
             months prior to study drug administration.

          -  without a uterus and/or both ovaries; or

             administration.

        The following methods of contraception, if properly used, are generally considered reliable
        for females of childbearing potential who may participate in the study:

          -  hormonal contraceptives† (oral, patch, injection, implant);

          -  partner vasectomized††; or

          -  total sexual abstinence*.

               -  Hormonal contraceptives must be started at least 90 days prior to study drug
                  administration, and intra-uterine contraceptive device must be placed at least 30
                  days prior to study drug administration.

                    -  Vasectomized &gt;3 months or with a 0 sperm count; * Female subjects of
                       childbearing potential who are not sexually active are not required to
                       practice a reliable method of contraception. They may be enrolled at the
                       Investigator's discretion provided that they are counseled to remain
                       sexually inactive for the duration of the study and understand the possible

             eyelid or eyebrow surgery, etc.).

          -  Laser resurfacing, or soft tissue augmentation in the periocular area in the 12 months
