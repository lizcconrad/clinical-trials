      The main objectives of this study are:

        1. an effect evaluation of an in-home multicomponent cognitive behavioural program on
           concerns about falling and related avoidance of activity (primary outcomes), as well as
           disability, fall incidents (secondary outcomes) and several additional outcomes in frail
           community-dwelling older people,

        2. a process evaluation of the feasibility of the program, with the following main
           outcomes: population reached, performance according to protocol, exposure and
           engagement, opinion on the program of participants and facilitators, perceived benefit
           or achievement, and experienced barriers and potential solutions, and

        3. an economical evaluation on the impact of the program on healthcare utilization and
           related costs.

    <description>The in-home cognitive behavioral program aims to learn older persons, living in the community, how to deal with concerns about falling and to increase physical, social and functional activity. The principles of cognitive restructuring are used for shifting maladaptive in adaptive attitudes with respect to falling as well as increasing self efficacy beliefs and feelings of control. The following themes are discussed during the program: concerns about falling, thoughts about falling, physical exercise, assert oneself, overcome personal barriers, recognizing fall-ty habits and managing concerns about falling. Duration of the program is 10 weeks with 7 individual sessions (3 home visits (60, 60 and 75 minutes, respectively) &amp; 4 telephone contacts (35 minutes each). The program is facilitated by trained nurses qualified in the field of geriatrics and working for home care agencies.</description>
