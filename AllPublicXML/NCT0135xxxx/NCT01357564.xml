      This proposed study addresses this call by testing the efficacy of a transformative
      patient-centric intervention designed to reduce the burden of NPS in Veterans with dementia
      who live at home with family caregivers. The innovative intervention, the Tailored Activity
      Program (TAP-VA), involves 8 sessions over 4 months in Veterans' homes. An occupational
      therapist conducts a systematic assessment to identify a Veteran's preserved capabilities and
      deficit areas, and previous roles, habits and interests from which to develop and introduce
      activities tailored to the Veteran's profile. Family caregivers are then trained to
      incorporate tailored activities into daily care routines. The intervention was pilot tested
      in an NIMH funded study with 60 community-living individuals with dementia. Findings from
      this pilot showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in NPS,
      specifically agitation and less time being on &quot;duty&quot; by family caregivers. Results of this
      pilot phase support moving forward with a full-scale Phase III efficacy trial. The
      investigators plan to test TAP-VA in a randomized two-group parallel design in which 160
      racially and ethnically diverse Veterans with dementia and their family caregivers (dyads)
      will be randomly assigned to receive TAP-VA or an attention control group. All dyads will be
      evaluated at baseline and 4-months (main trial endpoint), and then reassessed at 8-months to
      evaluate long-term treatment effects (baseline to 8 months), including continued activity
      use, caregiver well-being, and costs.

    <description>Intervention Protocol: In session #1, the interventionist, an occupational therapist (OT), meets with the caregiver and introduces the intervention goals. The OT provides and reviews a 3-ring binder which contains written educational materials about dementia, importance of taking care of self, communication strategies and other educational materials. Also provided and reviewed will be a copy of Mace and Rabins' book, The 36 Hour Day. The OT will interview the caregiver to obtain information about previous roles, habits, past and current daily routines, caregiver and Veteran preferences and interests. The OT will also observe interactions, noting communication and management style. The OT will also meet with the Veteran, observe social capacity using the Peavy Comportment scale and administer the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS-2).</description>

          -  We will require that he/she have been on a stable dose for 60 days prior to enrollment
             to minimize possible confounding effects of concomitant medications (the typical time
             frame used in clinical trials).

               -  English speaking

               -  self-identify as the primary member of the family caring (hands-on or

               -  living with the Veteran

               -  accessible by telephone to schedule interview, intervention sessions and
                  follow-up interviews

             (antidepressant, benzodiazepines, antipsychotic, or anti-convulsant) at time of
             telephone screen be on a stable dose of the medication for 60 days prior to
             enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non English speaking
