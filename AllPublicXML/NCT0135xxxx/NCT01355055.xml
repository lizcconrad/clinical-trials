      Primary hypothesis:

      Catheter-based renal denervation reduces central sympathetic activation in patients with
      refractory hypertension.

      Secondary hypotheses:

        1. The magnitude of the individual depressor response after catheter-based renal
           denervation depends on the extent of sympathoinhibition.

        2. Both, the reduction in arterial pressure and in central sympathetic activation are
           sustained over time up to 24±3 months after catheter-based renal denervation.

        3. Catheter-based renal denervation resets the sympathetic baroreflex to lower blood
           pressure values.
