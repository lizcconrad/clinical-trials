  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Stereophotogrammetry (SP) uses four sets of digital cameras to generate a three-dimensional
      computer image. Unlike other types of evaluations which require radiation, SP only uses
      computer images to learn more about physical deformities such as scoliosis or about the
      placement of fat on the body. To refine the SP process, researchers are interested in
      collecting images and body data from individuals with skeletal structural problems such as
      scoliosis or chest wall deformities, individuals who are overweight or obese, and healthy
      volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To use stereophotogrammetry to study different individual body types and refine existing
      imaging techniques.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 2 years of age who have spine, rib, or chest wall deformities; are
      overweight or obese (body mass index greater than 25); or are healthy volunteers.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history. The
           physical examination will include measurements of range of motion and joint mobility,
           torso width and length, and other observational data.

        -  Healthy volunteers and participants in the obesity group will also have bioelectric
           spectroscopy (bioimpedance), which uses an additional machine to measure how fat is
           spread in different parts of the body.

        -  After the physical examination has been completed, participants will have SP photographs
           taken. Participants will be asked to remove all clothing from the torso, stand with arms
           raised at the center of four cameras, and remain still while several images are taken. A
           complete image takes less than 1 second.

        -  Participants with spine or rib deformities, or who are in the obesity group, may also
           volunteer to return for followup SP imaging, once a year for 5 years, to study progress
           over time.

      OBJECTIVE:

      The primary objective of this project is to determine which outcome measures derived from
      analysis of SP images are reliable within the healthy population and can distinguish between
      healthy volunteers and those with scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and obesity. Secondary
      objectives include comparing SP outcome measures with clinical and radiographic measures to
      test concurrent validity and to determine if the SP outcome measures correlate with clinical
      and radiographic measures taken over time. The ultimate goal is to develop SP as a
      measurement tool to be employed in clinical research involving the study of scoliosis, rib
      and chest deformities and the truncal distribution of adiposity.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      The population for this study consists of healthy volunteers, persons with scoliosis and/or
      chest wall deformities, and persons with obesity. Men and women of all races, ethnicities,
      and ages greater than two years may participate.

      DESIGN:

      This project will be carried out in three phases. In Phase I, we will analyze images of
      healthy volunteers captured by the SP scoliosis and chest-wall deformity ( scoliosis )
      software to identify the outcome measures that show minimal or no variance. We will also
      examine if healthy volunteers gender, age, height, and BMI contribute to the differences of
      these outcome measures.

      In Phase IIa, images captured from subjects with scoliosis and/or chest wall deformities will
      be processed by scoliosis software to determine the set of meaningful variables (those that
      show significant differences between the two populations). In Phase IIb, images captured of
      healthy volunteers will be processed using obesity software to determine the set of variables
      showing minimal or no variance among the data from healthy volunteers when controlling for
      the effects of potential confounders. Variables that continue to have minimal or no variance
      will be considered meaningful with respect to obesity analysis software. Those variables
      achieved from obesity image analysis will be compared to the set from the healthy volunteers
      to determine which variables show significant differences between the healthy volunteer and
      obese subjects.

      In Phase III, healthy participants, scoliosis/chest wall deformity, and obesity participants
      who are scheduled to return to NIH as part of another NIH protocol will be invited to return
      for yearly re-imaging up to a total of five years in order to analyze changes over time and
      compare them with concurrent radiographic measures.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The purpose of the study is to develop outcome measures for use in future research. These
      outcome measures will be developed from software which analyzes images derived from the
      stereophotogrammetry system.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               -  All subjects greater than 2 years of age, genders, and ethnicities will be
                  eligible so long as they can cooperate with physical examination and imaging
                  procedures.

               -  Subjects must be able to stand independently for imaging. This limits enrollment
                  to subjects 2 years of age and older.

               -  Subjects must agree to capture of image of their bare torso above the waist

               -  Healthy volunteers must be without scoliosis, or chest wall deformities, and with
                  BMI below overweight range. For adults, BMI must be less than or equal to 25. BMI
                  for children and adolescents will be corrected according to the guidelines
                  designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in Appendices
                  2 (boys) and 3 (girls).

               -  Adults with BMI less than or equal to 25 and children and adolescents with adjust
                  BMI below the overweight range AND with imaging confirmed scoliosis and/or chest
                  wall deformities will be recruited from participants in NIH intramural protocols
                  or referred by outside physicians and will be eligible to participate in phase
                  IIa of the study.

                    -  Adults (subjects who are 18 years of age or older), must either present a
                       previously obtained clinical standing scoliosis xray film dated no more than
                       12 months prior to the study visit or obtain a scoliosis series x-ray at the
                       National Institutes of Health Clinical Center to provide confirmation of
                       scoliosis. Therefore, xrays may be done for research purposes in adults if
                       there is prior imaging indication but no scoliosis series xray films taken
                       within the last 12 months.

                    -  Children must present a previously obtained clinical standing scoliosis film
                       dated no more than six months prior to the study visit to provide
                       radiological confirmation of scoliosis. No xrays will be done for research
                       purposes.

                    -  Volunteers who have undergone spinal fusion surgery must show a
                       postoperative film that shows that the instrumentation is intact and that
                       desired spinal fusion has occurred. Xrays may be done for research purposes
                       in adults if there is prior imaging indication but no scoliosis x-ray series
                       films taken within the last 12 months.

               -  Subjects with BMI greater than 25 (or for children and adolescents defined
                  according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines as
                  &quot;overweight&quot;) AND without deformities of the torso will be eligible to
                  participate in phase IIb, the obesity portion of the study.

               -  Subjects with deformities of the torso OR with BMI greater than 25 may be
                  eligible to participate in Phase IIIa or IIIb and be followed yearly over the
                  course of five years

                    -  Subjects with scoliosis and/or chest wall deformities that are followed over
                       the course of the five years must provide clinically obtained films with at
                       least a difference of a year between the current and previous films. In
                       adults, if the curve changes, it is clinically indicated to get a follow-up
                       film and subsequent scoliosis xray films may be taken at the NIH CC. Those
                       who do not require clinical films cannot be included in the scoliosis/chest
                       wall deformities group followed over time.

                    -  For subjects of BMI greater than 25, volunteers will be invited to be
                       followed over time using SP if they have a change in their body composition
                       over time (if they have not yet attained physical maturity, if they
                       participate in weight loss program, or report a significant weight gain).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subjects unable to tolerate having points on the torso marked with a surgical ink
             marker

          -  Subjects with contact or respiratory isolation status

          -  Women of childbearing age who are found to be pregnant by urinalysis will not be able
             to participate as a healthy volunteer or in phase IIa (for scoliosis participants) if
             they require scoliosis xray series films to be taken at the NIH or in the obesity
             group due to contraindication to participation in bioelectric spectroscopy testing.
             Pregnant women may, however, participate in the scoliosis section of the study if they
             meet all relevant inclusion criteria. (but they cannot get xrays taken at the--NIH)

          -  Subjects with pacemakers or other electrical or conducting metal medical devices
             implanted in their torso will not be able to participate in the normal volunteer and
             obesity groups due to contraindication to participation in bioelectric spectroscopy
             testing.

          -  Subjects with electrical or conducting metal medical devices in their arms or legs
             that are not limited to one side of the body will not be able to participate in the
             normal volunteer and obesity groups because it will cause data distortion in the
             bioelectric spectroscopy testing.

          -  Subjects who are unable to tolerate stroboscopic camera flash

          -  Subjects who are employees/staff of the NIH Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine
             Department.
