  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK is conducting a global retrospective chart review of patients treated with zanamivir as
      part of the Compassionate Use Program (CUP), in an effort to collect as much information as
      possible on the use of this investigational drug. The retrospective chart review is intended
      to gain a better understanding of the safety profile of investigational zanamivir and of
      clinical outcomes in the large number of patients treated outside of a clinical trial
      setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, retrospective, multi-centre, cohort data collection study.

      The CUP retrospective review study has been designed to collect safety and clinical outcome
      data from pediatric and pregnant patients (collectively referred to as the &quot;Tier 1&quot; cohort)
      treated globally within the CUP during the 2009/2010 pandemic (from May 2009) through 31
      January 2011. The study will also attempt to collect data from other adult patients (referred
      to as the &quot;Tier 2&quot; cohort) who were treated at sites identified as having Tier 1 patients.

      The treating physician at each site will receive a letter from the GSK medical director
      inviting him/her to participate in the retrospective chart review study. Physicians (or their
      delegates) who agree to participate will receive study-related documentation [including the
      protocol and case report form (CRF)] to orient the site to the study details and CRF. For the
      purposes of this study, the term &quot;site&quot; generally refers to a hospital where in-patient
      treatment was provided.

      The retrospective chart review will be monitored via remote visits by telephone. The
      interviewer will be a Kendle associate assigned to the study who will not have direct access
      to the patient's source documents or medical records during conduct of the study. The
      physician/delegate will review the patient's chart and record data on a paper CRF. The CRF
      will be in the English language. Site personnel will mail completed CRFs to Kendle. Kendle
      will review the CRF for data quality, and conduct a remote monitoring visit via telephone to
      address any data queries, if required. No visits to participating sites are planned.

        information on safety and clinical outcomes from Tier 1 and Tier 2 patients will be
        collected within this retrospective chart review study.
