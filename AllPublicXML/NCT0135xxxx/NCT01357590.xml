  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ThoraflexTM is designed for the treatment of aneurysm or penetrating ulcer of the descending
      thoracic aorta. Each system is advanced from a transfemoral or transiliac approach over a
      0.035&quot; guidewire and positioned under fluoroscopic control. If necessary, an arterial conduit
      technique may be required to allow access to the arterial system. The soft tapered tip allows
      atraumatic insertion into the vessel, while the catheter and sheath are designed to provide
      excellent flexibility and control through tortuous arterial anatomy.

      Each individual stent graft device is supplied sterile and pre-loaded in a single-use
      delivery system. The stent graft is a self-expanding endoprosthesis constructed of a thin
      wall woven polyester and nitinol ring stents, which are attached to the fabric with braided
      polyester sutures. The delivery system central catheter is a stainless steel braided
      co-extrusion of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyester elastomer, designed to provide
      significant torque control and strength, while also maintaining superior flexibility. The
      outer sheath is made in a tri-layer construction consisting of a PTFE liner, a stainless
      steel flat braid layer and a polyester elastomer outer jacket with a hydrophilic lubricant
      coating. These materials provide very low friction force during device insertion and
      deployment together with enhanced flexibility of the delivery system. The handle components
      are moulded from thermoplastic polyurethane.

      The materials of the endoprosthesis are identical to those of the current Conformité
      Européenne (CE) marked Vascutek Ltd. AnacondaTM Stent Graft System intended for abdominal
      aortic aneurysm repair. The materials of the delivery system are well established in medical
      applications. The design of ThoraflexTM is based on the same principles as other clinically
      established thoracic endovascular devices. The endoprosthesis is constructed of
      self-expanding nitinol stents and a polyester tube graft. Four proximal hooks anchor the
      endoprosthesis within the aorta. Unlike existing thoracic endovascular devices, the delivery
      system of ThoraflexTM allows repositioning of the endoprosthesis so that the optimal
      deployment position can be enhanced.

      The intended use of ThoraflexTM is the treatment of aneurysm or penetrating ulcer of the
      descending thoracic aorta, which is identical to other CE approved thoracic endovascular
      devices.

         21. Subject has a co-existing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in which the investigator
             believes requires concomitant treatment within 45 days.

             within45 days of the planned procedure or is planning to undergo other major surgical
             or medical procedure within 45 days post implantation (e.g., coronary artery bypass
             graft [CABG], organ transplantation, etc.). This excludes any planned procedures for
             the prospective stent-graft placement (e.g. common carotid to left subclavian
             transposition/bypass, left carotid to axillary bypass, etc. are acceptable.
