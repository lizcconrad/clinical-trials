  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of
      a randomized, controlled study of a mindfulness and values-based living intervention targeted
      at reducing fear of recurrence in breast cancer survivors compared to treatment as usual
      control. Furthermore, the secondary objective of this randomized, controlled pilot study is
      to determine preliminary efficacy and effect size of the mindfulness and values-based living
      intervention compared to the treatment as usual control condition in reducing fear of
      recurrence in breast cancer survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is pervasive, distressing and undermines quality of life in
      cancer survivors. For subgroups of survivors, FCR is implicated in both treatment
      non-adherence and medical over-utilization. Although some degree of FCR is nearly universal
      among cancer patients, effective psychological interventions have been understudied.
      Educational and cognitive approaches that have relied on reassurance may feed into the
      anxiety by encouraging experiential avoidance, according to behavioral theories of anxiety.
      Mindfulness and values based living approaches teach techniques for reducing experiential
      avoidance allowing patients to break this cycle and focus on functional, satisfying lives.
      Interventions based on these techniques offer promise for addressing FCR in breast cancer
      survivors.

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will receive seven sessions of a mindfulness and values-based living intervention, led by a trained licensed facilitator, conducted in groups of 10-12 participants and include components specifically designed to reduce FCR. The intervention arm will include six weekly 90 minute group sessions and one followup 90 minute group session &quot;booster session&quot; held three weeks later. The group sessions will be interactive and experiential and include homework practice for generalizing skills.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with early stage breast cancer within the past 18 months;

          -  Completed active treatment within the past year

          -  At least mild anxiety, and/or at least moderate fear of recurrence as measured by
             screening questionnaires.

          -  Ability to give written informed consent and willingness to comply with the
             requirements of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of clinically significant cognitive impairment, or comorbid psychiatric or
             physical illness, only if, in the PI's or Co-Is' opinions, such illness would
             interfere with the ability to participate in and complete the intervention;

          -  Inability to speak and comprehend English sufficiently to complete the intervention.

          -  We will use a screening questionnaire (administered over the phone by the Research
             Associate) to determine that women do not have a comorbid physical or mental illness
             that is so impairing that they would be unable to participate in the groups or
             complete the measures.
