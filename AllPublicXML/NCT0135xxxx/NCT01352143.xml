  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this investigation is to determine the ability of recombinant activated
      factor VII (rFVIIa) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) to improve thrombin generation
      in neonatal plasma after CPB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this investigation, the investigators propose a comparison in vitro of the ability of
      rFVIIa with that of PCC to increase thrombin generation in neonatal plasma after CPB. A
      pre-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) baseline blood sample will be obtained. After the
      termination of CPB and the administration of one round of protamine, platelets and fibrinogen
      (standard of care), a second blood sample will be drawn. All samples will be centrifuged to
      yield platelet rich plasma and stored until processing. In the pre-CPB sample, baseline
      thrombin generation will be measured. The post-CPB sample will be divided into three aliquots
      to measure thrombin generation under three different circumstances: the first will serve as a
      control, the second will include rFVIIa and the third PCC.
