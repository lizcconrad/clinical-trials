  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of
      Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare LLC. DTG is metabolized primarily by uridine diphosphate
      glucuronyltransferase (UGT)1A1, with a minor role of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A, and with renal
      elimination of unchanged drug being extremely low (&lt; 1% of the dose). Fifty-three percent of
      the total oral dose is excreted unchanged in the feces but it is unknown if all or part of
      this is due to unabsorbed drug or some percentage of biliary excretion of the glucuronide
      conjugate which can be further degraded to form the parent compound in the gut lumen. The
      current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies states
      that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment should be conducted even
      for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile, because renal impairment can
      inhibit some pathways of hepatic and gut drug metabolism and transport.

      This study is planned as an open label, single-dose, pharmacokinetic study to evaluate plasma
      DTG pharmacokinetics following oral administration to subjects with severe renal impairment
      (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min) and matched healthy controls. Results from this study are
      expected to enable the development of appropriate dosing recommendations in patients with
      renal impairment.
