  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite widespread and growing popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in
      the US, there currently exist significant gaps in our knowledge regarding CAM use, clinical
      effectiveness, safety and cost- effectiveness. With previous funding support from NCCAM, the
      Harvard Medical School (HMS) Osher Research Center established and trained a
      multidisciplinary integrative team of CAM and conventional providers to work collaboratively
      to provide state-of-the-art &quot;integrative care&quot; in a coordinated and individualized fashion.
      The Osher Integrative Care Center (OCC) was opened in fall 2007, physically located within
      the Ambulatory Care Center of the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) at 850 Boylston Street
      in Chestnut Hill, MA. The focus of this survey study is to characterize the decision-making
      process of both patients and conventional providers with respect to communication about and
      referral to an integrative care team in an academic hospital outpatient setting.

    <description>Surveys will be sent to: 1) 1500 consecutive new patients seen at the OCC over 3.5 years, to characterize the chief complaints; their medical history; referral sources; communication with their physicians; barriers to use of CAM; views regarding and previous use of CAM; and expectations for CAM therapy as adjuncts to their conventional care; 2) 300 BWH physicians from five divisions (Women's Health, Orthopedics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, General Medicine, and Rheumatology) most likely to refer to the OCC, to assess their use of, feelings about, and knowledge of CAM.</description>
