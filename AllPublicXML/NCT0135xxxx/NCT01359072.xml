  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Approximately 30% of all patients with cancer report levels of psychological distress
           indicative of the need for psychological intervention.

        -  Research suggests that learning more adaptive coping strategies improves psychological
           adjustment to cancer.

        -  It is imperative to develop cost-efficient, feasible psychosocial interventions.

        -  The aim is to test the efficacy of the self administered format of a psycho-educational
           intervention (NUCARE) in reducing distress and enhancing adaptive coping strategies for
           cancer patients.

      It is hypothesized that:

        -  patients would show significant reductions in distress (i.e., depression and anxiety)
           over the 6-week treatment period, and that treatment would produce superior results
           compared to wait-list; patients would maintain or even increase their improvement up to
           3 months following treatment.

        -  the treatment would enhance more adaptive coping strategies.

        -  greater self-reported adherence to the treatment/homework would be associated with
           symptom improvement, more autonomous self-regulation and higher perceived competence for
           adhering to the coping intervention program.

    <description>The self administered coping intervention (i.e. NUCARE workbook) aims to teach individuals how to cope with their cancer. The intervention embraces two major areas: (i) the enhancement of a sense of personal control; and (ii) the learning of emotional and instrumental coping responses. The approach emphasizes training in problem-solving, relaxation techniques, cognitive coping skills, goal setting, communication, social support and lifestyle factors. The didactic material of the Nucare program is comprised of a workbook containing 12 chapters addressing the above mentioned aspects.</description>
