      The purpose of this study is to assess the response of docetaxel and gemcitabine in the
      neoadjuvant setting in women with locally advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is now standard for patients with locally advanced breast cancer,
      and this method of treatment has been extended to patients with earlier disease without
      affecting the treatment outcome. This single arm, multicenter phase II study was designed to
      evaluate the response rate, toxicity, progression free survival and tumor control rate of
      docetaxel and gemcitabine in the neoadjuvant setting with locally advanced breast cancer.
