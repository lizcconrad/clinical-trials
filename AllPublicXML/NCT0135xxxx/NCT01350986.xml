  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of cognitive-behavioral based guided self-help for parents of children with
      externalizing problem behavior is tested in a randomized clinical trial. Parents work through
      cognitive-behavioral self-help booklets and additionally receive counseling telephone calls
      every two weeks. In the control condition parents are provided non-directive self-help
      booklets and additionally receive counseling telephone calls. It is hypothesized that the
      cognitive-behavioral treatment is superior.

    <description>In intervention period of 5 months parents work through 8 cognitive-behavioral self-help booklets (FLOH) and additionally receive 10 counseling telephone calls. Primary purpose of telephone calls is to clarify content of the booklets and support parents in managing their homework assignments accompanied with each booklet. 3 and 6 months after intervention period has ended, two additional booster telephone calls are provided. The booklets are based on the therapy manual &quot;Treatment program for children with hyperactive and oppositional problem behavior (THOP)&quot; (Döpfner, Schürmann, &amp; Frölich, 2007) and the parent self-help book &quot;Wackelpeter and Trotzkopf: Help for parents of children with hyperkinetic and oppositional behavior&quot; (Döpfner, Schürmann, &amp; Lehmkuhl, 2006).</description>
