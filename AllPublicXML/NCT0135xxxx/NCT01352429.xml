  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to first establish feasibility of the study and then to register the
      treatment data of adult patients with a diagnosis of intermediate risk of prostate cancer
      presenting for definitive radiation treatment with either proton radiotherapy or Intensity
      Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). The investigators propose to employ a hypofractionated
      strategy with our image guided treatment to further improve cancer control and decrease
      toxicity.

      This study will be done in two phases, first, a feasibility study and then a registration
      study. In the first, feasibility will be established using the primary objectives set below.
      The second phase will begin no earlier than 30 days after the last patient in the initial
      phase has completed treatment and once safety and feasibility has been verified. The
      secondary objectives will serve as the objectives for the second phase of the study.

    <description>Any grade 2 or higher GI or GU toxicity, other than GI or GU toxicity or any grade 3 or higher toxicity, other than GI or GU. In the feasibility phase of this trial, the observation window for acute toxicty is extended to 60 days from completion of radiotherapy, as a feasibility precaution.</description>

    <time_frame>open-ended</time_frame>
    <description>Any grade 2 or higher GI or GU toxicity or any grade 3 or higher toxicity, other than GI or GU which occurs beyond 60 days from completion of radiotherapy. Late toxicities will be graded according to the RTOG/EORTC late morbidity scoring system.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma within 365 days of registration.

          -  Clinical stages T1a-T2c N0 M0 (AJCC Criteria 6th Ed). For any suspicious pelvic lymph
             node &gt; 1.5cm (as exhibited on pelvic imaging), biopsy of the lymph node is suggested.

          -  Histological evaluation of prostate biopsy with assignment of a Gleason score to the
             biopsy material; Gleason score must be in the range 2-7. Biopsy with &gt; 6 cores is
             strongly recommended. (The highest Gleason Score in any core reported on the pathology
             report will be used for determining inclusion.)

          -  PSA values &lt;20 ng/ml within 90 days prior to registration, and done either prior to
             prostate biopsy, or at least 21 days after prostate biopsy.

          -  Zubrod (ECOG) status 0-1 documented within 90 days of registration.

          -  Androgen deprivation is at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.

          -  Subjects must give IRB-approved study-specific informed consent. Subjects must
             complete all required tests within the specified time frames.

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years old.

          -  Members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Clinical stages T3 or greater (AJCC Criteria 6th Ed).

          -  PSA of 20 ng/ml or greater.

          -  Gleason score 8 or higher.

          -  Evidence of distant metastasis. (Determined by CT scan, MRI, and/or bone scan prior to
             the simulation appointment; imaging results from UPHS will supercede results from
             similar scans from an outside facility.)

          -  Evidence of lymph node involvement.

          -  Previous prostate cancer surgery to include: prostatectomy, hyperthermia, and
             cryosurgery.

          -  Previous pelvic radiation for prostate cancer.

          -  Active rectal diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis.

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy for prostate cancer.

          -  History of proximal urethral stricture requiring dilatation.
