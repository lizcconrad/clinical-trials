  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the safety and efficacy of canakinumab pre-filled syringes in comparison
      to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg and canakinumab lyophilizate in patients that have frequent
      flares of acute gouty arthritis.

    <measure>Pain Intensity on a 0-100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Between the Canakinumab 150 mg PFS and Triamcinolone Acetonide 40 mg Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is an instrument used to measure a person's subjective quantitative evaluation of an item such as pain intensity. The VAS contains a continuous line between two end points whereby the respondent places a mark on the line to indicate his or her response. In this study, patients scored their pain intensity in the most affected joint of the gout flare on a 0 100 mm VAS. The scale ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (unbearable pain). The scores were measured to the nearest millimeter from the left. Missing pain intensity data at 72 hours was imputed using the Last-Observation-Carried-Forward (LOCF) method.</description>

    <measure>Patient's Assessment of Pain Intensity on a 5-point Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A Likert scale is a type of scale with a range of responses corresponding to an item such as pain. The respondent selects the best response that indicates the respondent's subjective evaluation of the item. Patients scored their pain intensity in the most affected joint of the gout flare on a 5-point Likert scale (none, mild, moderate, severe, extreme). The scores were measured to the nearest millimeter from the left. The LOCF method was used to impute post-dose pain intensity Likert measurements up to 14 days.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With at Least One New Gouty Arthritis Flare After Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients met the definition of a new flare if they had: a flare in a joint, which was not a previously affected joint (at baseline or during the study), or a flare in a joint previously affected (at baseline or during the study) after the previous flare in that joint had resolved completely according to the patient's perception. Patients did NOT meet the criterion of having a new gout flare if they had increasing/renewed gout pain in an affected joint before the flare had resolved completely.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to the First New Gouty Arthritis Flare</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients met the definition of a new flare if they had: a flare in a joint, which was not a previously affected joint (at baseline or during the study), or a flare in a joint previously affected (at baseline or during the study) after the previous flare in that joint had resolved completely according to the patient's perception. Patients did NOT meet the criterion of having a new gout flare if they had increasing/renewed gout pain in an affected joint before the flare had resolved completely. Less than 50% of patients had new flares. Therefore, the median time to new flare could not be calculated.</description>

In this study, patients scored their pain intensity in the most affected joint of the gout flare on a 0 100 mm VAS. The scale ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (unbearable pain). The scores were measured to the nearest millimeter from the left. Kaplan Meier estimate of time to 50% reduction in baseline pain, along with associated 95% confidence interval, were reported.</description>

    <description>A Likert scale is a type of scale with a range of responses corresponding to an item such as pain.

      <pre_assignment_details>Number of subjects randomized was 397. Only 389 subjects (including one subject with 3 placebo injections) received study drug (Safety set). Subjects who received more than one active dose were counted in each treatment group, leading to a safety set of 399 subjects.

        <title>Pain Intensity on a 0-100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Between the Canakinumab 150 mg PFS and Triamcinolone Acetonide 40 mg Groups</title>
        <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is an instrument used to measure a person's subjective quantitative evaluation of an item such as pain intensity. The VAS contains a continuous line between two end points whereby the respondent places a mark on the line to indicate his or her response. In this study, patients scored their pain intensity in the most affected joint of the gout flare on a 0 100 mm VAS. The scale ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (unbearable pain). The scores were measured to the nearest millimeter from the left. Missing pain intensity data at 72 hours was imputed using the Last-Observation-Carried-Forward (LOCF) method.</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients as randomized that had at least one dose of study drug. Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were analyzed according to the treatment they were assigned to at randomization.</population>

          <title>Pain Intensity on a 0-100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Between the Canakinumab 150 mg PFS and Triamcinolone Acetonide 40 mg Groups</title>
          <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is an instrument used to measure a person's subjective quantitative evaluation of an item such as pain intensity. The VAS contains a continuous line between two end points whereby the respondent places a mark on the line to indicate his or her response. In this study, patients scored their pain intensity in the most affected joint of the gout flare on a 0 100 mm VAS. The scale ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (unbearable pain). The scores were measured to the nearest millimeter from the left. Missing pain intensity data at 72 hours was imputed using the Last-Observation-Carried-Forward (LOCF) method.</description>

Patients did NOT meet the criterion of having a new gout flare if they had increasing/renewed gout pain in an affected joint before the flare had resolved completely.</description>

Patients did NOT meet the criterion of having a new gout flare if they had increasing/renewed gout pain in an affected joint before the flare had resolved completely.

        <title>Time to 50% Reduction in Baseline Pain on a 0 - 100 VAS</title>
        <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is an instrument used to measure a person's subjective quantitative evaluation of an item such as pain intensity. The VAS contains a continuous line between two end points whereby the respondent places a mark on the line to indicate his or her response. In this study, patients scored their pain intensity in the most affected joint of the gout flare on a 0 100 mm VAS. The scale ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (unbearable pain). The scores were measured to the nearest millimeter from the left. Kaplan Meier estimate of time to 50% reduction in baseline pain, along with associated 95% confidence interval, were reported.</description>

        <title>Physician's Global Assessment of Response to Treatment on a 5 Point Likert Scale</title>
        <description>A Likert scale is a type of scale with a range of responses corresponding to an item such as pain. The respondent selects the best response that indicates the respondent's subjective evaluation of the item. Study physicians scored their assessment of the patients' response to treatment on a 5-point Likert scale (very good, good, fair, poor, very poor).</description>
