  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare Botox injections without Physical Therapy sessions to Botox
      injections combined with Physical Therapy sessions for treatment of Cervical Dystonia. It is
      expected that Botox combined with Physical Therapy will improve Cervical Dystonia symptoms
      and quality of life more than Botox alone. It is also expected that Botox combined with
      Physical Therapy will enhance neuroplasticity, or the ability of the brain to make new
      connections, more than Botox alone at 4-5 weeks, and remain improved at 12 weeks, after Botox
      injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit primary cervical dystonia patients (age 18-80) who are stable on
      Allergan botulinum toxin type A (Botox). Patients will be randomized to receive their typical
      Botox injection alone, or with physical therapy.

      At Baseline, disease characteristics (as measured by the Toronto Western Spasmodic
      Torticollis Rating Scale, or TWSTRS, and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity, or CGIS)
      will be measured, along with quality of life (from the Short Health 36 Survey Form 36, or
      SF-36). One subscale of the TWSTRS will be videotaped to be later evaluated by blinded
      movement disorder specialists. A pain scale will also be completed and range of head motion
      will be measured using a device similar to a protractor (called a goniometer). An
      individualized Botox injection will be administered, as well as transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) to measure neuroplasticity, or the ability of the brain to make new
      connections. If randomized to receive physical therapy, participants will also receive
      instructions to perform physical therapy exercises five times per week by a physical
      therapist who specializes in movement disorders. The investigator will call weekly to check
      how the participant is doing with the exercise program.

      The same procedures outlined above will also be performed at 5 weeks past baseline, and at 12
      weeks (except for the Botox injection, which will only be given at baseline and 12 weeks).

    <measure>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) is a measure of symptoms, pain, and disability related to Cervical Dystonia. The total TWSTRS scale includes a global outcome score (total score) and scores on each of 3 subscales for severity (0-35), disability (0-30), and pain (0-20), with higher scores indicating greater impairment. The TWSTRS is completed by a neurologist who visually assesses the patient's symptoms, and asks the patient to self-report on pain and disability.</description>

    <measure>Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 Item Health Scale (SF-36) is a health survey with 36 questions that is self-reported by the study participant. It contains 8 subscales: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health. The lower the score, the less disability.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is an investigator- rated scale that measure illness severity on a single 7-point scale. Higher scores represent greater severity of illness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuroplasticity Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A standard transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol will be used to measure of neuroplasticity (the ability of the brain to form new connections). For these tests, participants will sit in a chair that looks like one found at the dentist's office. A nerve stimulator will be placed on the wrist of the right hand to stimulate the median and ulnar nerves. The intensity of the nerve stimulator will be gradually increased until the right thumb begins to twitch. A magnetic coil will be placed on the scalp on the left side of the head, overlying the brain's motor cortex, to stimulate the brain's output to the muscles in the opposite hand. This procedure will be repeated using the left wrist and the right side of the head.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a single item scale, on which participants will mark the level of pain from 0-100. Higher score represents more severe pain.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical Range of Motion Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to sit in a chair and move the head to the left, to the right, to the front, and to the back. Then, participants be asked to tilt the head from side to side. A goniometer will be used to measure how far the head is able to move. The goniometer is similar to a protractor that measures magnitude of angle.</description>
