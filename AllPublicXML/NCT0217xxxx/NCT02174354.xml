  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methotrexate (MTX) is widely prescribed to treat inflammatory conditions including psoriasis,
      where it is the recommended first-line systemic therapy in moderate-to-severe disease.
      Approximately 40% of patients with psoriasis have a sub-optimal response to MTX and a
      significant number experience side effects that may include deranged liver enzymes. There is
      currently no validated test to predict how patients with psoriasis will respond to MTX, in
      terms of disease outcome and/or toxicity, or to guide dose escalation in this group.

      Data for this study is drawn from the BSTOP (Biomarkers of Systemic Treatment Outcomes in
      Psoriasis) cohort. This is a multi-centre, prospective, cohort study to establish clinically
      relevant biomarkers and pharmacogenetic markers of systemic treatment outcomes in patients
      with severe psoriasis.

    <measure>Serial erythrocyte methotrexate polyglutamate measurements using high performance liquid chromotography</measure>
    <time_frame>From 3 months to 5 years after commencing methotrexate</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if there is a correlation between methotrexate polyglutamate concentrations and clinical response measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index( PASI) in patients on methotrexate monotherapy with psoriasis. This will consider potential confounding factors, including age, gender and dose of MTX</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alanine transaminase (ALT) and Full blood count (FBC) will be used to measure toxicity to methotrexate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months to 5 years after first MTX dose</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if there is an association between MTXPG levels and evidence of hepatotoxicity in patients with psoriasis taking either (1) methotrexate alone or (2) methotrexate in combination with another systemic drug. Evidence of hepatotoxicity will be determined by the use of current gold standard tests.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>A ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve will be produced in order to define a therapeutic dose range of MTXPG in psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months to 5 years after first dose of methotrexate</time_frame>
    <description>If a positive correlation is identified between MTXPG levels and clinical response we aim to define a therapeutic dose range of MTXPG.</description>
