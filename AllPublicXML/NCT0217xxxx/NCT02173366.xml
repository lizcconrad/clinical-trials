  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American women have among the highest rates of overweight and obesity and few meet
      dietary or physical activity guidelines. The investigators seek to develop a new intervention
      strategy that will help alleviate health disparities, thereby improving quality of life,
      health care costs, and disease burden. The African American Collaborative Obesity Research
      Network (AACORN) recommends an eco-social, community-engaged approach to behavior change that
      is in line with cultural values of interconnectedness and care for others. The purpose of
      this study is to operationalize the AACORN paradigm to promote improvements in weight status
      and health through a civic engagement approach. To achieve this, participants will meet in
      church-based Change Clubs and be led through a 6 month curriculum, which includes both
      lessons in cardiovascular risk reduction and a civic engagement project. Civic engagement may
      lead to change in individual health behaviors by increasing self-regulation and
      self-efficacy. The investigators will measure club members' adherence to the Change Club
      intervention, defined as average number of sessions attended, retention in the clubs,
      satisfaction with the Change Club experience and achievement of at least 50% of
      self-identified benchmarks for community change within 6 months. In addition the
      investigators will compare anthropometric factors, diet and physical activity behaviors,
      blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, and psychosocial factors before and after
      participation in the Change Club intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Weight from Pre to Post-Intervention (6 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-post; participants will be followed for the 6-month intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight will be measured in triplicate to the nearest 0.5 kg using a digital floor scale (Seca 876).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diet from Pre to Post-Intervention (6 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-post; participants will be followed for the 6-month intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Two 24-hour recalls (1 weekday and 1 weekend day) will be collected. Data will be entered into the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR). Nutrient and food group calculations will be performed using the NDSR software.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Activity Level from Pre to Post-Intervention (6 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-post; participants will be followed for the 6-month intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity levels will be measured objectively using accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3X worn for 7 days) and by self-report (7-Day Physical Activity Recall).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure from Pre to Post-Intervention (6 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-post; participants will be followed for the 6-month intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured to the nearest 1mm Hg using a validated automated monitor (Omron HEM-705CP), using American Heart Association guidelines.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cardiorespiratory Fitness Level from Pre to Post-Intervention (6 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-post; participants will be followed for the 6-month intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovascular fitness will be measured using the Rockport 1-mile walk test. Participants will walk a flat, 1-mile course as fast as possible without running. Heart rate will be measured immediately after. VO2max will be estimated from validated formulas using 1-mile walk time, gender, age, body weight, and ending heart rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Efficacy from Pre to Post-Intervention (6 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-post; participants will be followed for the 6-month intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be assessed the Weight Efficacy Life-Style Questionnaire (Clark 1991). The exercise self-efficacy scale contains 5 items measuring confidence in ability to exercise under various challenges.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Collective Efficacy from Pre to Post-Intervention (6 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-post; participants will be followed for the 6-month intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Collective efficacy will be measured using an adapted 8-item Likert style scale (Sampson, Raudebush, &amp; Earls 1997) that examines the extent to which individuals in a neighborhood or community trust and help others.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
