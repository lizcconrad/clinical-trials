      The purpose of this research study is to determine how cell changes during endotracheal
      intubation and artificial lung ventilation affect lung inflammation.

      Patients will undergo placement of an endotracheal tube (ETT) as standard of care. Tracheal
      (windpipe) lavage will be obtained each day for up to 72 hours. Lung samples or fiberoptic
      (lung) samples will be collected at the same time intervals when possible and if they are
      done as standard of care.

      Blood samples will be obtained simultaneous with the collection of the trachael (windpipe)
      specimens.

    <description>One tracheal sample will be obtained using sterile (5 ml) sterile saline solution using irrigation and wall suction from each patient every day for 72 hours, total sampling time is approximately 10 seconds per specimen. Lung samples or fiberoptic obtained samples will be collected at same time intervals as the tracheal samples when possible and if they are done as standard of care. Samples will not be collected for research only and the time for this procedure will not be extended to collect extra tissue. A blood sample (10ml) will be collected simultaneously with the airway samples and also will be used for baseline control measurements.</description>
