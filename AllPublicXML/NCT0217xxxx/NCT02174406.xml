  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ultrasound or Digital breast tomosynthesis
      (DBT) detects more cancers and to compare the types of cancers detected on ultrasound and
      DBT.

    <description>The detection rate of each imaging test is defined as the proportion of patients who are positive on that imaging test who truly have the disease compared to the total number of women screened. A positive imaging test is defined as a test with a recommendation for biopsy (BI-RADS 4 or 5).</description>

    <description>Each patient will have the following:
Screening whole breast ultrasound
DBT (Full field digital mammography + tomosynthesis views in the CC and MLO projections). The only change in patient management will be the addition of digital breast tomosynthesis views in patients scheduled for FFDM alone. DBT is currently clinically approved and being offered on a voluntary basis to patients scheduled for FFDM.</description>
