    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of the combined therapy 18 μg
      tiotropium q.d. plus pulmonary rehabilitation versus placebo plus pulmonary rehabilitation on
      6-minute walking distance (6MWD) after 7 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to
      severe COPD. The secondary objective of the study includes assessments of the effects of the
      combined therapy 18 μg Tiotropium q.d. plus rehabilitation versus placebo plus rehabilitation
      on dyspnoea, constant work rate exercise endurance, daily activity and lung volumes. The
      third objective of the study is to investigate the correlation between the results of the
      6-minute walking test (6MWT), the constant work rate exercise test (CWR) and daily activity.

          1. All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines
             prior to participation in the trial, which might include pre-study washout of their
             usual pulmonary medications and restrictions.

          2. All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and must
             meet the following spirometric criteria:

             Patients must have relatively stable airway obstruction with an FEV1 ≤ 65% of
             predicted normal and FEV1 ≤ 70% of FVC on visit 1 and 3.

          3. Patients must show TGV ≥ 120% of predicted normal

          4. Male or female patients ≥ 40 but ≤ 75 years old

          5. Patients must be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of more than 10
             pack-years.

          6. Patients must be able to perform all study related tests including the exercise tests,
             acceptable pulmonary function tests and must be able to maintain records during the
             study period as required in the protocol.

          7. Patients must be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler® and from a metered

             program as per the investigator's usual criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study.

          2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or
             urinanalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion.

          3. All patients with an serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &gt; 80 IU/L, serum
             glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) &gt; 80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine &gt;

             with a newly diagnosed, clinically relevant arrhythmia on the ECG performed on visit
             1. Patients with arrhythmias requiring an intervention (i.e. hospitalization,
             cardioversion, pacemaker placement, and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator
             (AICD) placement) or a change in drug therapy during the last year should also be

             supplemental oxygen, supplemental oxygen therapy will be used at all following tests
             including rehabilitation program under constant level.

         31. Patients with a history of orthopedic, muscular or neurologic disease that would
             interfere with regular participation in aerobic exercise or with exercise testing.
