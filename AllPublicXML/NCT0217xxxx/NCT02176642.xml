  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of posterior tibial nerve
      stimulation (PTNS) plus extended release oxybutynin versus PTNS alone (placebo pills) in
      women undergoing treatment of urgency urinary incontinence (UUI).

      The investigators hypothesize that combination therapy with PTNS and anticholinergic
      medication will result in a significant incremental improvement in UUI symptoms over that
      achieved with PTNS alone. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that the addition of
      anticholinergics to PTNS will result in a greater improvement in patients' perception of
      treatment response, symptom distress, and quality of life than PTNS alone.

      Specific Aim 1: To compare the change, from baseline, in mean number of UUI episodes per day
      using a 3-day bladder diary between PTNS plus anticholinergic medication versus PTNS plus
      placebo in women undergoing treatment for UUI.

      Specific Aim 2: To compare the change, from baseline, in a 24hr pad weight between PTNS plus
      anticholinergic medication versus PTNS plus placebo.

      Specific Aim 3: To compare subjective treatment response, symptoms distress, and quality of
      life between PTNS plus anticholinergic medication versus PTNS plus placebo utilizing the
      Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) and the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire
      Short Form (OABq-SF).

      An interim analysis will be conducted by an independent entity after 50 participants have
      completed the study protocol. A Data Safety Monitoring Board is not utilized because the
      study utilizes FDA approved treatments for urgency urinary incontinence.

Assuming 50% improvement in UUI episodes per day is a clinically significant improvement, we estimated the experimental group would have a mean reduction of 4.5 UUI episodes per day with a SD of 1.5 UUI episodes per day. To detect such a difference with 80% power and alpha 0.05, we would need 88 participants for our analysis. To allow for a 12% dropout rate, our goal was to enroll 100 women.</non_inferiority_desc>

        <title>Change in the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Short Form (OABq-SF) Part 1</title>
        <description>Part 1 of the OABq-SF questionnaire asks about the relative bother a patient experiences with regard to overactive bladder symptoms over the previous 4 weeks. This part of the questionnaire has 6 questions, with scores ranging from 6 (least amount of bother) to 36 (most amount of bother). For this secondary outcome, we are measuring the change in score on the OABq-SF Part 1 from baseline to 6 weeks. Median change in scores were compared between the 2 groups using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.</description>

        <title>Change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, Version Two (TSQMvII) - Side Effects Domain</title>
        <description>To compare bother from medication side effects between PTNS plus anticholinergic medication versus PTNS plus placebo using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication, version two (TSQMvII). The questionnaire was completed at baseline and at 6 weeks. The TSQMvII side effects domain at each time point was transformed into a score from 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 150 (extremely satisfied). Median change in scores from baseline to 6 weeks were compared between the 2 groups using Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test.</description>
