  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to investigate the influence of mild and moderate liver
      impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and selected pharmacodynamic parameters of BI 1744
      CL in comparison to a control group with normal hepatic function after single orally inhaled
      administration of BI 1744 CL with the Respimat® Inhaler.
