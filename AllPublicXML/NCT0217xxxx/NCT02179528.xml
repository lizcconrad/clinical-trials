    <textblock>
      Patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer receive six cycles of
      chemotherapy(etoposide plus platinum) as first-line treatment,who achieve Complete
      Response(CR)/Partial Response(PR) will accept small doses of etoposide as maintenance
      treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the progression free survival,overall
      survival,objective response rate,disease control rate and safety of etoposide as maintenance
      therapy. Based on previous studies on maintenance therapy in small cell lung cancer,the
      hypothesis of this study is maintenance therapy using etoposide may improve progression free
      survival,overall survival for selected patients. The investigators will use the peripheral
      blood to assess circulating tumor cell and cell-free DNA,which may help us to screen a
      subgroup of patients with better response to etoposide maintenance therapy.
