      • Main objectives and outcome measures.

        1. Establish prevalence of and factors contributing to fatty liver disease and liver
           fibrosis in patients with psoriasis.

           Fatty liver disease diagnosed via ultrasound. Liver fibrosis diagnosed by liver biopsy
           or non-invasive tests of fibrosis including transient elastography, ultrasound, serum
           markers of fibrosis including procollagen-3-N-terminal peptide (P3NP).

        2. Evaluate non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis in the psoriasis population. Namely
           transient elastography, standard liver function tests and P3NP.

        3. Evaluate the impact of psoriasis disease severity and comorbidities including metabolic
           syndrome on response to treatment in patients with psoriasis.

      Data on co-morbid disease collected through questionnaires and review of medical records.
      Response to treatment assessed using psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) physician
      global assessment (PGA) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI).

        -  Study population: 380 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis will be prospectively
           recruited to the study.

        -  Chief investigator: Professor Jonathan Barker. Co-investigator: Professor Catherine
           Smith

        -  Sponsor/funding organization: Pfizer and Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at Guys and St
           Thomas Hospitals Trust

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with liver fibrosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Liver fibrosis will be assessed by transient elastography and the use of standard liver function tests and other serum markers of fibrosis including P3NP. In a minority of cases fibrosis will be diagnosed by liver biopsy and evaluation of histology. Risk factors for the development of fibrosis including metabolic syndrome, alcohol and methotrexate use will be evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with fatty liver disease diagnosed by ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 12 months of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Fatty liver disease will be defined by the presence or absence of fatty changes on abdominal ultrasound. Risk factors for the development of fatty liver disease including abdominal obesity, diabetes, and alcohol use will be evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of noninvasive tests of liver fibrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 12 months of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The performance of non-invasive markers of fibrosis including standard liver function tests, P3NP, transient elastography and abdominal ultrasound will be assessed in this cohort of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Response to treatment measured by PASI and PGA scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12-24 months following enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment will be measure by physician global assessment (PGA) PASI and DLQI. Factors assessed include demographic data, psoriasis disease history, co-morbid disease and family history assessed by questionnaire. Lipid and glycaemic status assessed by fasting bloods.</description>
