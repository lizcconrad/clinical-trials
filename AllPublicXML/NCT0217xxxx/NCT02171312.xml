  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The iDETECT (Integrated Display Enhanced Testing for Concussion and mild traumatic brain
      injury) system is a novel portable, open access platform that enables immediate and rapid
      assessment of multimodal neurologic function. This study seeks to evaluate the iDETECT
      function testing battery with currently used balance and inner ear assessment methods during
      initial concussion clinic referral. Two groups of participants will be enrolled; a concussion
      related dizziness cohort and control subjects. The investigators will enroll the concussion
      cohort from patients presenting to the Sports Concussion Institute (SCI) with persistent
      dizziness and imbalance symptoms following possible concussion. Healthy control participants
      will be recruited from the local community. iDETECT's ability to identify post concussion
      balance/vestibular disturbances will be compared to an expert concussion assessment. Both
      cohorts will participate in the iDETECT assessment and the clinical assessment.

      The iDETECT (Integrated Display Enhanced Testing for Concussion and mild traumatic brain
      injury) system is a novel portable, open access platform that enables immediate and rapid
      assessment of multimodal neurologic function. This study seeks to evaluate and validate the
      iDETECT balance, vestibular, and oculomotor testing battery with clinician performed balance
      and vestibular assessment methods. Two groups of participants will be enrolled; concussion
      related dizziness cohort and control subjects (no concussion or dizzy symptoms). The
      investigators will enroll the concussion cohort from patients presenting to the Sports
      Concussion Institute (SCI) with persistent dizziness and imbalance symptoms following
      possible concussion. Healthy control participants with normal vestibular function and no
      history of concussion will be recruited from the local community. All participants will be
      tested with both the iDETECT balance and vestibular assessment battery and the current
      clinical reference standards for imbalance and vestibular dysfunction performed by a
      clinician. Performance on the iDETECT balance and vestibular assessment battery will be
      compared between normal controls and the concussion cohort.

    <measure>Imbalance assessed by the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 0 (Up to ten minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) is a quantitative measure of balance designed for evaluation of imbalance following sports concussion. The BESS is organized into a series of 6 conditions of increasing difficulty. Subjects perform a series of three stances for 20 seconds each standing on either a hard surface or a soft foam surface. Subjects are examined in these six separate conditions with eyes closed. The six balance conditions are; (1) double leg stance, hard surface; (2) single leg stance, hard surface; (3) tandem stance, hard surface; (4) double leg stance, foam surface; (5) single leg stance, foam surface; (6) tandem stance, foam surface. An examiner scores each condition with zero errors representing perfect balance and a maximum of 10 scored errors for each balance condition. The overall score is a composite balance score ranging from zero errors to a maximum score of 60 errors with lower scores representing better balance.</description>

    <measure>Postural Stability assessed by Quantitative Balance Testing (BioSway) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 0 (Up to five minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative Balance Testing (BioSway) provides information about postural stability by measuring subjects sway on a force platform under different conditions. Tests of sensory organization are used to evaluate sensory and postural responses using a series of conditions of increased difficulty.Subjects stand on a force platform that estimates sway in a horizontal antero-posterior direction. Subjects are examined in four separate conditions; (1) eyes open, fixed surface. (2) eyes closed, fixed surface; (3) eyes open, foam surface; (4) eyes closed, foam surface. Each condition is scored according to sway, where 100 is no sway and 0 is a subject fall.</description>
