    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the effect of food
      on the pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of oral semaglutide, in
      a SNAC (sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino] caprylate) tablet formulation with three
      different dosing conditions in healthy subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subject aged 18-75 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing
             informed consent

          -  Body mass index of 18.5-29.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

          -  A good general health based on medical history, physical examination, and results of
             vital signs, electrocardiogram and laboratory safety tests performed during the
             screening visit, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant or is of
             child-bearing potential and not using adequate contraceptive methods. Female of child
             bearing potential must use effective methods of birth control for the duration of the
             trial and for 5 weeks following last dose of oral semaglutide. Only highly effective
             methods of birth control are accepted (i.e. one that results in a less than 1% per
             year failure rate when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables,
             combined oral contraceptives, and some intrauterine devices)

          -  History of, or presence of, cancer, diabetes or any clinically significant
             cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             endocrinological, haematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological, psychiatric
             diseases or other major disorders, as judged by the investigator

          -  Not able or not willing to refrain from smoking or use of nicotine substitute products
             when staying at the clinical unit

          -  Any blood draw in excess of 25 mL in the past month, or donation of blood or plasma in
             excess of 400 mL within the 3 months preceding screening

          -  Previous gastrointestinal surgery such as invasive and corrective procedures involving
             the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, gallbladder, pancreas or intestinal resections.
             Exempt are subjects that underwent uncomplicated surgical and diagnostic procedures
             such as appendectomy, hernia surgery, polypectomy, biopsies, as wells as colonic- and
             gastric endoscopy
