  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary: To identify doses of Micardis®(telmisartan) which, administered once daily, are more
      effective than placebo and not inferior to HCTZ in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in
      patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), and to assess the dose response
      relationship of the antihypertensive effect of telmisartan over the dose range of 20 to 80
      mg.

      Secondary: Target fall in SBP, change from baseline in seated DBP. Safety and tolerability of
      Micardis® and HCTZ in patients with ISH as measured by changes in physical examinations,
      heart rate, laboratory parameters and/or 12-lead ECG, as well as the incidence and severity
      of adverse events.
