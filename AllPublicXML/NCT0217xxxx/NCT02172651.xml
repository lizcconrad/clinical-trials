  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to learn more about the vitamin D receptor and its relationship to colon
      cancer. The Vitamin D receptor is found in colon cancer cells. When Vitamin D binds to the
      receptor in the cancer cells, it may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally and may cause
      cancer cell death. Vitamin D has been used in other research studies and information from
      those other research studies suggests that Vitamin D may help in the treatment of colon
      cancer.

      Participants will receive either high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose vitamin D. The study
      drug will be given 14-28 days prior to your surgery. The number of days will depend on when
      the surgery is scheduled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary to keep track of when they take the
      study drug. The participant will be taking the study drug once every day, for 14 - 28 days,
      prior to their surgery.

        -  Run-In Phase: The first 6-12 participants will receive high-dose vitamin D prior to
           surgery. The number of participants in this phase will be based on the results of the
           analyzed research samples.

        -  Randomized Phase: Because no one knows which of the study options is best, the
           participant will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups: high dose vitamin D or
           standard dose vitamin D.

             -  48 Participants will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose
                vitamin D. Randomization means that the participants are put into a group by
                chance. Neither the participant nor the research doctor will choose what group the
                participant will be in. The participant will have an equal chance of getting
                assigned to each arm (like flipping a coin). The randomized phase will enroll to
                two groups at the same time:

                  -  Group A: 24 participants with a recent diagnosis of stage I, II or III colon
                     cancer will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose
                     vitamin D.

                  -  Group B: 24 participants with resectable liver metastases from colon cancer
                     will be randomized to receive high-dose vitamin D or standard-dose vitamin D.

      Additional research procedures to be performed on study:

        -  Blood samples will be collected for research purposes (a little more than 2 teaspoons of
           blood). The samples will be collected immediately prior to the participant's surgery and
           used to study the vitamin D receptor and pathway, as well as its relationship to colon
           cancer. Some of this blood will be stored to be used for future cancer research.

        -  Tumor tissue will be collected for research purposes at the time of the participant
           surgery. This tissue will also be used to study the vitamin D receptor and pathway, as
           well as its relationship to colon cancer. Some of the tumor tissue collected will be
           sent for use in a separate, but related study. In this study, the participant's tumor
           will be used to grow cell lines. This means the participant's tumor cells will be
           multiplied in the lab. These cell lines will be used to study the binding sites in the
           genes of participants and learn more about vitamin D's role in preventing colon cancer.

    <description>Compare VDR binding sites between supplementation arms (high-dose versus standard-dose), between malignant versus adjacent benign colon or liver tissue in those receiving high-dose vitamin D, and between primary colon tumors versus liver metastases in patients exposed to high-dose vitamin D. Laboratory procedures for enriching epithelial cells from the surgical specimen, sonicating cross-linked chromatin, immunoprecipitating VDR-chromatin complexes, and preparing DNA libraries for massively parallel sequencing will be refined.</description>

    <description>The goal is to infer direct transcriptional targets of VDR by determining which loci bind VDR and also alter gene expression in response to high-dose vitamin D supplementation. RNA-Seq libraries, prepared from poly(A)+ mRNA and sequenced by Illumina Hi-seq, will be analyzed using Tophat, Cufflinks60 and other new statistical packages to identify consistent differences in transcript levels between tissues exposed to high-dose versus standard-dose vitamin D3 at pre-determined FDRs on the order of 0.01. Stringent tests for statistically significant differences in RNA levels between samples are built into the algorithms for RNA-seq analysis.</description>

    <description>One capsule of vitamin D3 10,000 IU orally once daily for 14 days until the date of surgery. To allow for some flexibility in the scheduling of surgery, patients can be treated with preoperative vitamin D3 for up to 28 days. On the morning of surgery, prior to operating, a second blood sample will be collected for follow-up 25(OH)D, calcium, and albumin determination. Colon and liver resection will occur per institutional standards of care, and malignant and adjacent benign tissue will be collected for the laboratory endpoints described in this protocol.</description>

                  experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization
                  (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not
                  postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive months; or women on hormone
                  replacement therapy with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone level &gt;35
                  mIU/mL). Women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive
                  hormones or mechanical products such as intrauterine device or barrier methods
                  (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or who are practicing
                  abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to
                  be of child-bearing potential.

               -  The effects of higher-dose vitamin D3 and colon or liver surgery (and associated
                  perioperative medications and anesthesia) on the developing human fetus are
                  unknown and may pose unacceptable risk. For this reason, women of child-bearing
                  potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
                  method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
                  study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
                  while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                  immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible
        for admission into the study.

          -  Prior systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or investigational agent in participants
             undergoing surgery for stage I, II, or III colon cancer.

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             bevacizumab) of liver resection.

          -  Concurrent use of other anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy agents, targeted
             agents, biological agents, immunotherapy, or investigational agents not otherwise
             specified in this protocol.

          -  Inability to swallow pills.

          -  History of malabsorption or uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea, or any other disease
             significantly affecting gastrointestinal function that could interfere with absorption
             of oral medications.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to vitamin D.

          -  Regular use of supplemental vitamin D totaling ≥ 2,000 IU/day in the past year.

               -  Use of supplemental vitamin D or supplements containing vitamin D beyond the
                  protocol-prescribed study treatment is not allowed during the treatment period of
                  this clinical trial.

               -  In order to maintain blinding, vitamin D levels should not be routinely checked
                  at screening or during the study by the treating investigator. Vitamin D levels
                  will be assayed only as part of the research blood samples collected during the
                  study. If there are concerns related to a participant's vitamin D status, the
                  lead Principal Investigator should be contacted for further discussion.

          -  Use of chronic oral corticosteroid therapy, lithium, phenytoin, quinidine, isoniazid,
             and/or rifampin (all of which can cause vitamin D depletion). Short-term use of
             corticosteroids as anti-emetic therapy for chemotherapy is permitted.

          -  Regular use of thiazide diuretics (i.e., hydrochlorothiazide), which can lead to
             hypercalcemia, and unwillingness or inability to discontinue or switch to an
             alternative anti-hypertensive agent.

          -  Pre-existing hypercalcemia (defined as baseline serum calcium above the institutional
             ULN, corrected for albumin level if albumin is not within institutional limits of
             normal).

             -- The use of supplemental calcium or supplements containing calcium is prohibited
             during the treatment period of this clinical trial.

          -  Known active hyperparathyroid disease or other serious disturbance of calcium
             metabolism in the past 5 years.

          -  History of symptomatic genitourinary stones within the past year.

          -  Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may increase the risks associated with study participation or study
             treatment, limit compliance with study requirements, or interfere with the
             interpretation of study results.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or men/women of child-bearing potential who are unwilling to
             employ adequate contraception.

             -- Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown
             but potential risk of adverse events related to higher-dose vitamin D3 and colon or
             liver surgery (and associated perioperative medications and anesthesia) on the human
             fetus. Consequently, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on
             the study.

          -  History of prior or synchronous malignancy except:

               -  A malignancy that was treated with curative intent, for which there has been no
                  known active disease for &gt;3 years prior to randomization, and for which the risk
                  of recurrence is low as determined by the investigator.

               -  Curatively treated non-melanoma skin malignancy, cervical cancer in situ, or
                  prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence of prostate cancer.

          -  Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, or
             acute or chronic hepatitis B infection.

               -  Participants with these infections are ineligible because they are at increased
                  risk of significant complications in the perioperative period, particularly for
                  active hepatitis B or C patients undergoing liver resection. Appropriate studies
                  will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy
                  when indicated.
