    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy (superiority to placebo) of ipragliflozin
      based on the changes in HbA1C, as well as its safety, in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus in combination with an insulin preparation once daily for 16 weeks. The long-term
      (52 weeks) safety and the persistence of the efficacy will also be evaluated.

      This study consists of two parts. First part is a placebo-controlled multicenter,
      double-blind, parallel group study, in which subjects will receive ipragliflozin or placebo
      once daily in combination with an insulin preparation for 16 weeks. Second part is a
      multicenter, open-label period (36 weeks) with no placebo group. The dose of ipragliflozin
      can be doubled in combination with an insulin preparation during the second part.
