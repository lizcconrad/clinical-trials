    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride and eribulin mesylate work in
      treating patients with bladder cancer that has spread to other places in the body or cannot
      be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and
      eribulin mesylate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the objective response rate of gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride)-eribulin (eribulin mesylate) (GE) when given to cisplatin ineligible patients
      with advanced or unresectable urothelial carcinoma who have not received any prior
      chemotherapy for the advanced disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the median progression-free survival (PFS). II. To summarize the toxicity
      profile (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v] 4 criteria)
      of the GE regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8
      and eribulin mesylate IV over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 36
      months.

    <description>All observed toxicities will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by the CTCAE v4.0), and time of onset (i.e. course of treatment). Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities and side effects, overall, by course - possibly by the cause of the cisplatin ineligibility, if numbers permit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be calculated as the ratio of the number of eligible patients who experienced a confirmed CR or PR (by RECIST v1.1) divided by the total number of eligible patients who began treatment; 90% confidence intervals will be constructed. A secondary estimate (more conservative) of the overall response rate will count in the numerator, only those patients who experienced a confirmed CR or PR AND who received 2 or more doses of eribulin mesylate.</description>
