  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a widely accepted palliative therapy for
      the treatment of HCC. Palliative means that it does not cure the disease prolongs your life
      and improves quality of life. During TACE, a mixture of chemotherapy drugs is combined with
      an oil called lipiodol. Lipiodol has a role as both drug carrier and embolic agent (a
      material that blocks blood flow to tumors). The lipiodol/chemotherapy mixture is injected
      into an artery (blood vessel) directly supplying blood to a HCC tumor.

      Lipiodol is made up of fat and water which can be seen on MRI. Therefore, MRI can be used to
      quantify the amount of lipiodol delivered to the HCC tumors.

      In this study, the investigators want to see if patient survival is related to the amount of
      lipiodol delivered to HCC tumors.

    <time_frame>Every 4-6 weeks during active treatment and then every 3-6 months, up to 5 years or death.</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response will be assessed according to 3D European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria. EASL criteria propose using contrast enhanced (CE) images to measure viable volumes. We will transfer all images to a computer workstation. We will measure 'viable' enhancing tumor volumes at each interval and percent change in viable tumor volume (change from baseline). We will correlate lipiodol delivery measurements to primary outcomes post-therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 4-6 weeks during active treatment and then every 3-6 months, up to 5 years or death.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response will be measured using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status classification. We will consider a change of 0.5 ECOG levels to be clinically significant.</description>

    <measure>Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4-6 weeks during active treatment and then every 3-6 months, up to 5 years or death.</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be measured according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) version 3.0 criteria for each patient. We will define Grades 0-2 as tolerance to therapy and Grades 3 or 4 as toxic.</description>

    <time_frame>Every 4-6 weeks during active treatment and then every 3-6 months, up to 5 years or death.</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-tumor progression will be assessed by monitoring viable tumor volumes post-TACE and defining progression as a &gt;44% volume increase (3D EASL criteria).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prospective studies will be performed in 20 patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma
             (HCC) independently scheduled to undergo TACE; tumors in each of these candidates will
             already have been deemed un-resectable.

          -  Reasons may include

               -  concurrent co-morbidities including cardiac or respiratory compromise

               -  recurrent or multi-lobar disease

               -  cirrhosis or portal hypertension

               -  vascular invasion

               -  high tumor burden

               -  contraindications to general anesthesia.

          -  Diagnosis of HCC will have been established by a) biopsy or b) non-invasively, based
             upon &gt; 2cm diameter tumor with characteristic imaging findings in the setting of
             cirrhosis.

          -  Male or female aged 18 to 89 years, all ethnicities

        Exclusion Criteria:
