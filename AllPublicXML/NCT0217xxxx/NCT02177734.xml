    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female adults who are 18 to 60years of age (inclusive) at the time of first

          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and physical examination.

          -  Access to a consistent means of telephone contact.

          -  For subjects who undergo a screening visit: Results of screening safety laboratory
             tests that figure in eligibility assessment must be within reference ranges before
             dosing.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Administration of an inactive vaccine within 14 days or of a live attenuated vaccine
             within 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine/placebo.

          -  Planned administration of any vaccine other than the study vaccine/placebo before
             blood sampling at the Day 42 visit.

          -  Previous administration of any H7 vaccine or physician-confirmed H7 disease.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine
             within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned use
             during the study period.

          -  Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 90 days before the
             first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned administration of any of these
             products during the study period.

          -  Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines or component
             used in the manufacturing process of the study vaccine including a history of
             anaphylactic-type reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse
             reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.

          -  Known pregnancy or a positive urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test
             result before the first dose of study vaccine/placebo.

          -  Lactating or nursing women.
