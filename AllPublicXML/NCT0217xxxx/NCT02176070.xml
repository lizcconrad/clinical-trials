      The purpose of this study is to learn about reproductive health, including fertility and
      pregnancies, in people with vasculitis.

      All patients enrolled in the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium's Contact Registry were
      invited via email to participate in this study. The Contract Registry includes people who
      self-identify as having one of 6 vasculitities: Wegener's Granulomatosis, Microscopic
      Polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, Polyarteritis Nodosum, Takayasu's Arteritis, and Giant
      Cell Arteritis. People voluntarily enroll in this Registry with the understanding that they
      will receive information about clinical studies for which they might be eligible. The
      introductory email included basic information about the study and all of the required
      elements for informed consent in a brief format. By clicking the link to the reproductive
      health questionnaire, participants gave their consent to be included in the study.

        All patients with vasculitis included in the VCRC Contact Registry were invited to
        participate. Data was included for all patients who provided a vasculitis diagnosis,
        estimated date of diagnosis, confirmed that the diagnosis was made by a rheumatologist, and
        reported having taken at least one appropriate anti-rheumatic medication. Other
        participants were excluded as the likelihood that they have a true vasculitis condition is
        low.
