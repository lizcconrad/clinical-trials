    <textblock>
      Bladder management has a major impact on the quality of life in patients with neurogenic
      bladder dysfunction. This a prospective investigation of the effects of the method for
      bladder evacuation on the health-related quality of life in patients with neurogenic bladder
      dysfunction. The changes in health-related quality of life over time (longitudinal
      investigation) and the differences between the different methods for bladder evacuation will
      be investigated. Patients will be given a standardized and validated questionnaire annually
      for 10 years.
