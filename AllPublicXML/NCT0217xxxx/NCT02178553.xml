      Unilateral intercostal nerve blocks provide pain control as effectively as a continuous

    <textblock>
      In this study we will study to see if a single set of unilateral intercostal nerve blocks
      provides pain control as effectively as a continuous thoracic epidural, and will a lower
      incidence of side effects. Although the anesthesiologists involved in providing care for
      patients having thoracotomy incisions at St. Mary's Hospital are experts at placing thoracic
      epidural catheters, this study will attempt to show that a less technically challenging
      procedure done by surgeons intra-operatively can provide comparable pain relief.

    <description>In the epidural catheter (TEC) group, a thoracic epidural catheter will be placed at the level of T6-T8 and advanced 5 cm into the epidural space and a 3 ml test dose of lidocaine 1.5% will be administered before the induction of general anesthesia. Patients will be excluded from the study if the catheter cannot be placed. A bolus dose of 0.5 mg hydromorphone plus 4.5 ml 0.125% bupivacaine will be administered before surgical incision. An epidural infusion of 0.075% bupivacaine and 10 mcg/ml hydromorphone, prepared by the hospital pharmacy, will be started intraoperatively at a rate of 5 ml/hr.</description>

    <description>In the intercostal block (ICB) group, liposomal bupivacaine 1.3% (4 ml) will injected by the surgeon under direct vision into the proximal intercostal space at the level of the thoracotomy and one interspace above and below. In addition, liposomal bupivacaine 1.3 % (4 ml) will be injected at each of the chest tube exit sites. Thus, a total of 20 ml liposomal bupivacaine 1.3% (260 mg) will be administered.</description>
