  <official_title>Randomised, Open Label, 3-way Cross Over Phase I Study to Investigate the Impact of Concomitant Use of Multiple Doses of Clopidogrel (75 mg qd After a Loading Dose of 300 mg) With Multiple Doses of Dabigatran Etexilate (150 mg Bid) on the Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Parameters, and Additionally the Impact of Single Oral Doses of 300 mg and 600 mg of Clopidogrel Administered Under Steady State Conditions of Dabigatran of 75 mg and 150 mg in Healthy Male Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study (Main Part 2) was to investigate whether and to which
      extent a combination of multiple oral doses (steady state conditions) of 75 mg of clopidogrel
      q.d. (after a loading dose of 300 mg) and multiple doses of 150 mg of dabigatran etexilate
      b.i.d. at steady state affects pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of dabigatran
      etexilate and clopidogrel.

      The objective of the preceding Pilot Part 1 of the study was to explore the effect of a
      single dose of 300 mg clopidogrel administered after multiple doses of 75 mg and 150 mg
      dabigatran had reached steady state, regarding safety as well as pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic parameters.

      The Main Part 3 of the study moreover was to compare intra-individually the effects of a
      single dose of 600 mg clopidogrel with the same dose, 600 mg clopidogrel, given additionally
      to multiple doses of 150 mg dabigatran in steady state condition with respect to safety and
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters.
