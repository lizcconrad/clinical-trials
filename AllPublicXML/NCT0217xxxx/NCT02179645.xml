  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of GRC 27864 in healthy volunteers. The purposes of this study are to
      look at safety, how well the study drug is tolerated, how much of the study drug gets into
      the blood stream, and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given to humans.
      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. Participants will
      remain in the study for approximately 3 months. This study is for research purposes only and
      is not intended to treat any medical condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female healthy subjects, age ≥18 to ≤55 years (≥65 years for elderly subjects
             study) at the time of informed consent

          2. Body mass index between 18.5 and 32.0 kilograms per square meter (kg/m2), inclusive

          3. Female subjects who are of child-bearing potential or had tubal ligation must agree to
             use highly effective methods of contraception

          4. Male subjects whose partners are of child-bearing potential or had tubal ligation must
             also agree to use two highly effective method of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with inherited or acquired disorders in platelet function, bleeding or
             coagulation.

          2. Presence of any clinically relevant acute or chronic disease which could interfere
             with the subject safety during the clinical study, expose the subject to undue risk.

          3. Veins unsuitable for repeat venepuncture.

          4. Presence of clinical laboratory test values judged clinically significant by the
             investigator.

          5. Positive test results for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (HCVAb) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and/or -2 antibodies at
             screening.

          6. History or presence of drug abuse at screening or upon admission to the CRU.

          7. Participation in another clinical study with an experimental drug within 3 months
             before the first administration of the IMP.

          8. Any psychological, emotional problems, any disorders or resultant therapy that is
             likely to invalidate informed consent, or limit the ability of the subject to comply
             with the Clinical Study Protocol requirements.
