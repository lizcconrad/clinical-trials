  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm pilot study evaluating the feasibility and preliminary safety of a
      single intravesical instillation of TC-3 gel mixed with botulinum toxin (BTX) for symptomatic
      improvement in overactive bladder patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BTX is considered as therapeutic option for overactive bladder (OAB). Randomized
      placebo-controlled studies have shown that BTX administered by intramural injection into the
      bladder wall in patients with OAB leads to significant improvement in urodynamic parameters
      and quality of life. (Schurch 2008). On the other hand, the animal study suggests that
      intravesically applied BTX acts to decrease frequency of bladder contraction by inhibiting
      sensory mechanism in the urothelium rather than directly through inhibition of the smooth
      muscle contraction. (Khera 2005). The efficacy of intravesical BTX instillation was only
      tested in a few open label trials for overactive bladder patients whereby the clinical
      improvement observed was short-lasting with a mean duration of 6.8 weeks (Petrou 2009, Krhut
      2011). The short exposure duration of the urothelium to BTX could be one of the factors
      responsible for the lack of a sustained effect. TC-3 is a hydrogel with reverse thermal
      gelation properties that when mixed with BTX and instilled intravesically serves as the drug
      reservoir allowing for gradual release of BTX and thereby for its extended contact with
      bladder urothelium.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female 18 to 85 years old with symptoms of idiopathic OAB for ≥ 3 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Patient has signed Informed Consent Form and is willing and able to comply with all
             requirements of the protocol, including proper completion of the voiding diaries and
             self-administered questionnaires.
