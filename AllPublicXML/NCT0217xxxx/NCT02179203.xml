      Study Purpose and Rationale The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lung Doppler signals
      changes during cardiac resynchronization procedure. As the LDS represent the various
      mechanical events of cardiac origin it is assumed that they may reflect the relative timing
      between contraction of the ventricles and atria and thus serve for effective synchronization
      of these activities.

      Aim of the study:

      The aim of the study is to assess whether the changes in Lung Doppler Signal (LDS) waves'
      characteristics will mimic the changes in echocardiographic parameters designed to assess
      diastolic inflow and systolic flow in patients undergoing Echo-based CRT optimization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients 18 years or older, who met the indications for cardiac
             synchronization therapy (CRT) per the ACCF/AHA guidelines, underwent successful system
             implant for more than 3 months, and were referred to the CRT non-responder clinic at
             the Ohio State University for CRT- Echo optimization due to absence of clinical
             improvement in functional class or ejection fraction after the implant per the
             judgment of the referring physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Chronic atrial fibrillation or new cardiac arrhythmias detected at the time of the
             visit that are known to affect the response to CRT (Atrial fibrillation,
             supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or frequent premature
             ventricular contractions).

          2. CRT device malfunction

          3. Inadequate CRT programming that has contributed to lack of response to CRT

          4. Coronary sinus lead anatomical or electrical malfunctions at the time of the visit

          5. Acute systemic illness that can explain their lack of functional improvement (i.e.,
             anemia, severe electrolyte imbalance, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, pneumonia)

          6. Inability to sign informed consent
