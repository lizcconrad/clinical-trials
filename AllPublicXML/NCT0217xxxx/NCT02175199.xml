  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Comfort Likert Response at Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Subject indicated agreement with the following statement, &quot;These lenses provided the same excellent comfort at the end of the month as they did at the beginning of the month&quot; using a 4-point Likert scale, where 1=Strongly disagree, 2=Disagree; 3=Agree; 4=Strongly agree. The Top 2 responses (agree, strongly agree) were calculated and reported as a percentage of all responses. Both eyes were rated together. This outcome measure was prespecified for the AIR OPTIX COLORS arm only.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Subject indicated agreement with the following statement, &quot;These lenses provided the same excellent comfort at the end of two weeks as they did at the beginning of the two weeks&quot; using a 4-point Likert scale, where 1=Strongly disagree, 2=Disagree; 3=Agree; 4=Strongly agree. The Top 2 responses (agree, strongly agree) were calculated and reported as a percentage of all responses. Both eyes were rated together.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Comfort 1-10 Scale Response</measure>

          -  Willing to sign an Informed Consent Document or Assent, if applicable.

          -  Vision correctable to 20/30 Snellen (feet) or better in each eye at distance with
             pre-study contact lenses.

          -  Manifest cylinder (at screening) less than or equal to 0.75 diopters (D) in each eye.

          -  Successful wear of clear/handling tint, single-vision spherical, bi-weekly/ monthly
             replacement soft contact lenses in both eyes during the past 2 months for a minimum of
             5 days per week and 8 hours per day.

          -  Requires spherical contact lenses within the available range of powers (i.e.,-1.50D to
             -5.00D in 0.25D steps).

          -  Interested in wearing contact lenses that change the appearance of the color of the
             eyes.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of herpetic keratitis.

          -  Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated including any use of topical ocular medications that would require
             instillation during contact lens wear, except for rewetting drops.

          -  Corneal vascularization greater than 1 millimeter (mm) of penetration.

          -  Habitual lenses worn in an extended wear modality (routinely sleeping in lenses
             overnight for 1 night per week or more) over the last 3 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Previous corneal or refractive surgery or irregular cornea.

          -  Monovision and monocular (only 1 eye with functional vision) or fit with only 1 lens.

          -  Anisometropia ≥1.50D (study contact lens prescription).

          <description>Subject indicated agreement with the following statement, &quot;These lenses provided the same excellent comfort at the end of two weeks as they did at the beginning of the two weeks&quot; using a 4-point Likert scale, where 1=Strongly disagree, 2=Disagree; 3=Agree; 4=Strongly agree. The Top 2 responses (agree, strongly agree) were calculated and reported as a percentage of all responses. Both eyes were rated together. This outcome measure is prespecified for the AIR OPTIX COLORS arm only.</description>
