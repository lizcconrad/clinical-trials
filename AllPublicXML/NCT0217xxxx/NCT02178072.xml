  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the activity of 5-azacitidine in patients with Human
      Papilloma Virus (HPV)-positive and HPV- negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC). The response activity will be determined by analyzing your tumor tissue prior to and
      after treatment with 5-azacitidine. Preliminary studies in mice bearing human head and neck
      cancers or head and neck cancer cells cultured in laboratories suggest that treatment with
      5-azacitidine increases changes in cancer cells that lead to their death. This study is
      designed to determine if similar changes occur in cancer cells of patients with head and neck
      cancer.

      The study also aims to determine the amount of a specific type of protein, p53 before and
      after treatment. Research has shown that the p53 protein is associated with anti-tumor
      activity.

      Finally, this study is measuring the amount of a specific type of protein called interferon
      in your tumor tissue. Interferons are proteins made and released by the body in response to
      pathogens (disease causing agents) such as viruses, bacteria, or tumor cells. Interferons
      allow for communication between cells to trigger the protective defenses of the immune system
      that remove pathogens (disease causing agents) or tumors.

      Primary Objectives:

      The primary objectives of this study are

      • to investigate response (proliferation, apoptosis), as well as reactivation of p53 pathways
      in patients treated with 5-azacitadine for HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  to investigate response (proliferation, apoptosis), as well as reactivation of IFN
           pathways in patients treated with 5-azacitadine for HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC.

        -  to investigate the clinical activity of 5-azacitadine in patients with HPV-positive and
           HPV-negative HNSCC.

        -  to investigate the safety of 5-azacitadine in patients with HPV-positive and
           HPV-negative HNSCC

    <description>The post-treatment biopsy will occur the day after the last injection of 5-azacytidine. 5-aza is currently FDA-approved and used for therapy of myelodysplastic syndrome. Pre- and post- 5-aza treatment tissue will be analyzed for proliferation (IHC-Ki-67), apoptosis (IHC-cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP-1), and for p53 protein (IHC, immunoblots), as well as p53, CDKN1A, MDM2, IFITs, and CCL5 mRNA levels (as described above). The primary outcome is the change from baseline of the p53 protein level in post-treatment vs. pre-treatment biopsies. Although tumor response may not be expected due to the short treatment course, the post-treatment vs. pre-treatment change from baseline of the gross tumor measurements will be used to measure tumor response.</description>
