    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate how the body absorbs and processes the sustained
      release (SR) and extended release (XL) medication bupropion (WellbutrinÂ®). Subject who are
      1-3 years post gastric bypass surgery will be invited to participate. Non-surgical controls
      will also be enrolled based on a matching criteria to post gastric bypass subjects.
      Participants will be asked to complete two 12-hour study days approximately 11 days apart.

    <description>The primary aim of this research is to provide a comparison of pharmacokinetic measures associated with a single dose of bupropion SR (sustained release) and bupropion XL (extended release) in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and matched nonsurgical &quot;control&quot; subjects. Comparisons will be based upon bupropion plasma concentrations obtained during the 48 hour sample collection window.</description>

    <time_frame>48 hour collection</time_frame>
    <description>We will also evaluate other PK characteristics associated with bupropion, such as Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, and the ratio of bupropion to the active metabolite ODV, and others.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female

          2. Age 18-65 (inclusive, at time of informed consent)

          3. No tobacco use in the past three months.

          4. Underwent Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass weight loss surgery 12-36 months prior to study OR
             has not had a weight loss surgery but matches the gastric bypass patients on age,
             gender, and BMI.

          5. Ability to read, write and understand English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Taking a medication that has a clinically significant interaction with bupropion or an
             interaction that may alter the study data.

          2. Hypersensitivity to bupropion or any excipient contained within the dosage forms.

          3. Inability to tolerate repeated blood draws.

          4. Any history of bipoloar disorder or a psychotic disorder.

          5. Current major depressive disorder or current suicidality.

          6. Alcohol or substance dependence in the past year.

          7. Currently pregnant or lactating or unwillingness to use medically accepted
             contraception during study

          8. Taking a medication which significantly alters gastrointesinal transit time or
             significantly reduces acid secretion (e.g. routine use of proton pump inhibitors, H2
             antagonists, sucralfate).

          9. Medical conditon which may increase participant risk with bupropion (e.g., history of
             significant head injury, seizure disorder, etc.)

         10. Self reported history of viral hepatits or HIV.

         11. Positive urine drug screen unless documented prescription of a non-interacting
             medication.

         12. History of seizures or epilepsy or other conditions which may increase seizure risk
             with bupropion as described in the package insert (e.g. history of significant head
             injury, alcoholism, etc).

         13. History of eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia.

         14. Renal impairment as evidenced by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than
             60 ml/min/1.73 m2 as reported by the laboratory, or any other abnormality on a renal
             panel that the medical provider feels puts the participant at risk or may compromise
             the study data

         15. Hepatic insufficiency as defined by any hepatic enzyme greater than 3x the upper limit
             of normal or other hepatic laboratory abnormalities at the discretion of the medical
             provider.

         16. Any significant electrolyte abnormality on a basic metabolic panel that the medical
             provider feels may put the subject at risk of a seizure from bupropion.
