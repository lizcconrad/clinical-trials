      The purpose of this study is to investigate the variation in blood glucose levels,
      hemodynamic effects and patient anxiety score during tooth extraction in type 2 diabetes
      mellitus with coronary disease patient under local anesthesia with lidocaine 2% with and
      without epinephrine.

      This is a prospective randomized study including 70 diabetes with coronary disease patients
      that needed to be submitted to oral surgery. The study was double blind in relation to
      glycaemia measurements. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels for 24 hours was
      performed using the Minimed Continuous Monitoring System (CGMS, Medtronic). Patientes were
      randomized into two groups: 35 received 5.4 mL of 2% lidocaine and 35 received 5.4 mL of 2%
      lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. In addittion, hemodynamic effects (blood pressure and
      heart rate) and degree of anxiety were also evaluated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>varition in blood glucose levels during oral surgery with local anaesthesia (lidocaina and lidocaine with epinephrine)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To asses the blood glucose levels the Continuous monitoring system (MiniMed CGMS, Medtronic) was employed. The MiniMed monitor was installed in the morning of the day before the surgery and the patient went to home. The patient returned to the hospital for the surgery 24 hours later and the monitor was retired one hour after the end of the oral surgery.</description>

    <measure>Hemodynamic effects during the surgery with local anesthetia (lidocaine and lidocaine with epinephrine)</measure>
    <time_frame>almost 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressur and heart rate were recorded by automatic sphygmomanometer (Microlife APA-P00001) in four times: one hour before the surgery, five minutes before the surgery, after anesthesia injection and one hour after the surgery.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety levels during the oral surgery with local anesthesia (lidocaine and lidocaine and epinephrine)</measure>
    <time_frame>almost 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety levels was measurement by the Image Facial Scale at the times: one hour before the surgery, five minutes before the surgery and one hour after the surgery.</description>
