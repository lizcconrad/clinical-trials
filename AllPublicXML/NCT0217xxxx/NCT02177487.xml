        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who were randomized and completed all study visits of the preceding
             double-blind trial with the fixed dose combination (502.261) who meet the following
             criteria:

               -  Patients that are not controlled on telmisartan 80 mg monotherapy at the final
