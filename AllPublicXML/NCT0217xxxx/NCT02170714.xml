      Background and aims: Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASC) is a potentially life-threatening
      event. Poor pediatric data are available about the success rates of Infliximab (IFX) as a
      second line therapy. This study was performed in consecutively observed pediatric patients
      with ASC, treated according to the 2011 European Crohn's colitis Organization (ECCO)-
      European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and nutrition (ESPGHAN)
      guidelines on pediatric ASCÂ¹ and aim to assess the long-term efficacy of IFX and clinical
      predictors of poor outcome.

      Methods: Children hospitalized for an episode of ASC, defined as a Pediatric Ulcerative
      Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) of at least 65 points, were enrolled. Clinical assessment
      through PUCAI and laboratory data (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, C-Reactive Protein,
      hemoglobin, albumin, hematocrit, ferritin) was recorded at admission and at day 3 and 5. All
      patients were treated according to the above mentioned guidelines for ASC and received
      intravenous (iv) corticosteroids (CS) as first-line therapy. IFX was administered as
      second-line therapy in CS-refractory patients. In a 2-year follow up the overall colectomy
      rate and the efficacy of IFX in avoiding colectomy were evaluated.

    <description>Consecutive children hospitalized for an episode of acute ASC, defined as a PUCAI &gt; 65. All patients were treated according to the 2011 ECCO-ESPGHAN guidelines for ASC: all patients received intravenous (iv) corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1.5-2 mg/Kg/day) for 5 days. Patients not responding to corticosteroids (i.e. PUCAI&gt;65 at day 5) started Infliximab (IFX, 5 mg/Kg 0,2,6 then every 8 weeks) as second-line therapy. All therapies were decided at the discretion of the referral gastroenterologist and recorded on standardized case report forms. A follow-up of 2 years for the colectomy risk was evaluated for all patients.</description>
