  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare surgery plus bracing versus bracing alone. Both
      groups are considered standard of care treatments. The goal of this study is to determine
      which group is a better treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient must be between 18 and 65 years old and had an acute trauma with an AO type A3 burst
      fracture (a spinal injury where one of the bony parts of the spine [vertebra] breaks due to
      immediate and severe compression).

      The purpose of this study is to compare surgery plus bracing versus bracing alone. Patients
      will be followed for 10 years. The investigators will compare patients' x-ray outcomes and
      clinical outcomes (i.e. how a patient is feeling and how a patient is able to do usual daily
      activities) as well as patients' immediate and delayed medical and surgical side effects
      between the 2 study arms. The goal of this study is to determine if treating patients with
      surgery plus bracing is better than just bracing alone.
