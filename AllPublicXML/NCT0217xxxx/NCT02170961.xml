      this study aim to investigate the:

        -  association of RAAS polymorphisms and AHF

        -  association of MMP 3 and 12 polymorphisms and AHF

      Heart failure can be defined as a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural
      or functional disorder of the heart, with impairment of ability to fill the ventricles or
      eject blood. The main event of the IC is dyspnea and fatigue, which limit exercise tolerance
      and induces water retention.

      The renin angiotensin aldosterone system governs the salt and water homeostasis in the body.
      Renin is a proteolytic enzyme secreted by the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney (area
      near the glomeruli). Renin has no direct action on the organism, but that is part of the
      renin-angiotensin system or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is known.

      To date, few published studies have examined the association between the polymorphism AGT
      M235T * and cardiac dysfunction; and available results are contradictory. What is not known
      yet is the ratio of this polymorphism with the prognosis of heart failure.
