      Importance Team members speaking-up by raising concerns about inappropriate or unsafe actions
      of others within the team can have direct, immediate, and preventive effect on adverse
      outcomes. However, little is known about the hurdles and enablers of this behavior in
      healthcare, especially within the operating room setting.

      Objective

      1. Determine if an educational workshop would improve speaking-up behaviors of practicing
      anesthesiologists when presented with realistically-simulated clinical situations. 2.Describe
      speaking-up behaviors addressed to a surgeon, a nurse, and a colleague. 3. Identify the
      self-reported hurdles and enablers for speaking-up in those situations encountered.

      Design Randomized controlled experiment of an educational workshop intervention on
      communication behaviors in a simulated case. Qualitative analysis of debriefing conversations
      following the simulated case.

      Setting Established academic simulation center

      Participants Seventy-one practicing anesthesiologists from four academic medical centers and
      one community hospital

      Intervention Fifty minute educational workshop on speaking-up that included rationale,
      conversational techniques, a rubric for speaking-up, and role-play.

      Main Outcomes and Measures

      1. Observed communication in a simulated case that included a surgeon falling asleep during
      surgery, inappropriate activation of a speakerphone by a nurse, and an incorrect treatment
      order by a colleague in response to a venous air embolism. 2. Transcribed conversation during
      a structured debriefing, analyzed for hurdles and enablers.
