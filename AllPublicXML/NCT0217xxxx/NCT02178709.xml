      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ≥ 18 years old at the time of informed consent

          4. Patient must be eligible for abdominal surgery

          5. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that has been documented to be
             resectable by standardized radiographic criteria by a pancreatic surgeon

          6. Patients must to have tumor tissue collected prior to enrolling on this trial. Up to
             10 patients will be accepted with no pre-treatment research tissue collection or
             tissue collection from an outside institution.

             a.If the tissue is from an outside institution, it must be reviewed at Indiana
             University Health Pathology Department if a biopsy was performed outside of this
             institution.

          7. Women of childbearing potential definition (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test performed within 14 days prior to initiation of FOLFIRINOX.

             Any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or
             remaining celibate by choice) is classified as WOCBP if she meets the following
             criteria:

               1. Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               2. Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          8. WOCBP and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior, to study entry, for the
             duration of study participation, and 8 weeks after the end of treatment.

          9. Patients must have adequate organ function as defined by the following laboratory
             values at study entry:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (transfusions are acceptable)

               2. ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

                  Cockcroft-Gault or measured)

               5. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

             (DCIS) of the breast and low grade prostate cancer. Any cancer curatively treated &gt;3
             years prior to entry with no clinical evidence of recurrence is permitted.

          3. Hypersensitivity to 5FU, oxaliplatin (or other platinum agents), irinotecan (or to
             their excipients).

          4. Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of
             study treatment. Patients are not permitted to participate in another investigational
             drug study while being treated on this protocol.

          5. Inability to receive a port or PICC line.

          6. History of or suspected Gilbert's Disease (testing not required if presence is not
             suspected).

          7. Baseline peripheral neuropathy/paresthesia grade ≥ 1.

          8. Active hepatitis B, unless patient has been on antiviral agents for at least 2 months
             (baseline testing not required).

          9. Active clinically serious infections (&gt; grade 2).

         10. Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 8 weeks of first study drug. A
             core pancreatic or liver biopsy does not preclude the patient from the study.

         11. Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of ketoconazole or St John's wort. Use of
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin and rifabutin is discouraged, but
             not contraindicated. If patients require phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital
             monitoring of drug levels is suggested during the study.

         12. Pregnant or lactating women.

         13. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be
             discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.
