  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  To determine the therapeutic window of BIBR 1048 in order to select doses for further
           studies in the development plan.

        -  Twice daily regimen will be tested for most dose levels and once daily administration
           will also be evaluated when appropriate.
