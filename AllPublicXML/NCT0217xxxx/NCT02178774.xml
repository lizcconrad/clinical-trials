    <textblock>
      Hypotension after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section is one of the most common
      perioperative issue, with an incidence up to 83%.Hypotension is mainly induced by the
      associated sympathetic blockade, with a drop of peripheral vascular resistance in the lower
      extremities and an increase in venous capacitance. Hypotension is a distress for both
      anesthesiologists and obstetricians as it endangers parturient's hemodynamics and compromises
      the uteroplacental blood flow. In clinical practice, there are several ways to treat
      hypotension after spinal anesthesia such as preloading with intravenous fluids and
      administrating ephedrine. Normotensive maternal blood pressure does neither guarantee the
      well-being of the fetus nor ensure the tissue perfusion of the parturient. Based on the
      anatomy and physiology basis, we hypothesize that uterine perfusion under spinal anesthesia
      would correlate with the perfusion of the lower extremities. To measure the perfusion of the
      lower extremities, we use a relative new tool, the non-invasive transcutaneous near infrared
      spectroscopy.

      This is a prospective observational study. Parturients who are going to receive an elective
      cesarean section will be enrolled. Before entering the operating rooms, the parturient
      enrolled receives the Doppler studies. The external iliac artery is identified and color
      Doppler is activated to locate the uterine artery crossed the external iliac artery. The
      probe is stabilized to obtain the maximum flow velocity waveform.The pulsatility index of
      these three waveforms is calculated and recorded as the baseline. Three minutes after the
      anesthetics are injected, the same procedures of color Doppler are performed again, and the
      PI after the spinal anesthesia is recorded.

      Tissue (cerebral) oximeter (INVOS Cerebral Oximeter Model 5100B; Somanetics, Troy, MI, USA)
      is used for the NIRS technique. Two adhesive sensor patches are attached to the parturient.
      One sensor patch is applied over the the biceps brachii of the upper limb while the other
      adhere to the medial side of the gastrocnemius muscle. After the oximeter shows a stable
      reading, the baseline data are recorded. The parturient then receive spinal anesthesia in the
      right lateral decubitus position. The intrathecal injection consists of 0.5% hyperbaric
      bupivacaine. NIBP is monitored at 2.5 minutes interval for 30 minutes. Tissue oximeter starts
      recording every minute right after local anesthetics are injected into the intrathecal space
      for a total of fifteen minutes.
