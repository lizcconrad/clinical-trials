      Previous research shows a significant proportion of smokers work in full-time employment.
      Given that the majority of smokers do not aware of the smoking cessation services available
      in Hong Kong, implementing smoking cessation policy in the workplaces may assist a
      considerable number of smokers to stop or reduce smoking.

      This study aims to:

        1. examine the employers' knowledge, attitudes and practices in promoting smoking cessation
           in workplace.

        2. test the effectiveness of a brief and an intensive smoking cessation interventions to
           help workers stop smoking

      In Phase I of this study, a large scale cross-sectional survey will be conducted to 3000
      corporate companies in Hong Kong. The questionnaire will examine the employers' knowledge,
      attitudes and practices in promoting smoking cessation in the workplaces.

      In Phase II, a longitudinal study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      smoking cessation intervention offered by the Department of Psychology, the University of
      Hong Kong. Smokers from the participating companies will be interviewed before the
      intervention at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at 1-, 4-, 12-, 26- and
      52-week post-intervention follow-ups.

      The follow-up assessments will consist of a biochemical validation for the self-reported
      quitters who report quitting in the past 7 days via exhaled carbon monoxide and saliva
      cotinine concentration tests. Participants' smoking behaviour, knowledge on smoking and
      satisfaction of the smoking cessation services will also be evaluated.

      It is hypothesized that the smoking cessation intervention helps workers stop smoking.
      Employers' knowledge and attitudes are positively associated with the practices in promoting
      smoking cessation in workplace.

      Process evaluation: Qualitative interviews, including in-depth interviews and/or focus group
      will be conducted after 6-month follow-up.

The questionnaires consist of three parts:
Employers's knowledge was assessed by measuring the average number of correct answers on questions about smoking and quitting (Scale 1-7).
Employers' attitude was assessed by measuring the average number agreeing items about their willingness to support employees to quit which included implementation of measures to show support for smoking cessation in the workplace or participation in smoking cessation programme (Scale 1-17).
Employers' practice was assessed by the level of smoking ban in the workplace as reported by the employer. (Scale 1-4; 1: not prohibited, 2: prohibited by not strictly, 3: Strictly prohibited and 4: absolutely strictly prohibited).</description>
