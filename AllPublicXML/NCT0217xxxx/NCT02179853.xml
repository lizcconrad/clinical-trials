  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in the
      developed world. Despite available treatment, 25% of children in San Diego County
      appropriately treated for KD develop coronary artery abnormalities that may lead to
      complications later in life, including heart attack. Although the investigators can identify
      children with KD that have these coronary artery abnormalities, there is no approved
      additional treatment to decrease coronary artery inflammation and arrest or prevent damage to
      the coronary arteries. Anakinra, a therapy that blocks the high levels of interleukin 1 (IL1)
      that lead to inflammation during acute KD, has been shown in the KD mouse model to prevent
      the development of coronary artery damage. Therefore, the investigators propose to study the
      safety and activity of anakinra in infants and children &lt; 2 years old with coronary artery
      abnormalities from KD.
