  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) represents the first cancer related cause of death
      worldwide with 1.4 millions of deaths every years. Current standard therapies include
      platinum-containing drugs but at one year from diagnosis the survival rate is still low
      (30-40%) .

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of a platinum-free drug, named Vinorelbine,
      administered by the so called &quot;metronomic schedule&quot; in order to prolong the progression free
      survival of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic therapy remains the mainstay of treatment of advanced stage NSCLC. Combination
      chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen has emerged as standard therapy for patients with
      advanced stage disease. Observations supported by the findings of several clinical trial,
      established the notion that an efficacy plateau had been reached in advanced stage NSCLC
      patients treated with platinum-containing drugs.

      Recent phase III trials suggest the benefit of &quot;switch&quot; and &quot;continuing&quot; maintenance
      treatment with different drugs. As &quot;switched therapy&quot;, Vinorelbine has been selected on the
      base of its anti-mitotic role. In fact, the use of anti-mitotic drugs at lower dose but with
      higher frequency (metronomic schedule) seems to augment the anti-angiogenetic effect of this
      kind of drugs, thus augmenting the efficacy of the therapy.

      Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to evaluate the role of a &quot;switched
      maintenance&quot; with oral vinorelbine administered as a metronomic schedule in terms of
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) in advanced NSCLC patients with stable disease after first
      line platinum based chemotherapy.
