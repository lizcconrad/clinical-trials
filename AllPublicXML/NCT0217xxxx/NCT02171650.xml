          -  Life expectancy of at least three (3) months

          -  Written informed consent that is consistent with International Conference on
             Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice guidelines

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0, 1 or 2

          -  Patients must be recovered from previous surgery

          -  Patients with untreated or symptomatic brain metastases. Patients with treated,
             asymptomatic brain metastases are eligible if there has been no change in brain
             disease status for at least eight (8) weeks, no history of cerebral edema or bleeding
             in the past eight (8) weeks and no requirement for steroids or anti-epileptic therapy

             hormones taken for breast cancer, or bisphosphonates), or participation in a clinical
             study other than 1200.1 or 1200.2

          -  Patients unable to comply with the protocol

        will not be eligible if the following conditions are met:

          -  Patients with clinical signs of disease progression or if latest X-ray, CT, MRI or US
             reveals progressive disease

          -  Cardiac left ventricular function CTC Grade ≥ 2 at any time during the previous course

          -  Patients fulfilling any of the Exclusion Criteria listed in Section 3.3 on Day 29 of

          -  Patient not recovered from any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 14 days after the last
             administration of BIBW2992 in the previous course. Recovery is defined as return to
             baseline condition (Visit 1 of 1200.1 or Visit 1 of 1200.2) or CTC Grade 1, whichever
