  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomised controlled trial covering all general practitioners working in
      the National Health System (SNS) and all pharmacists working in community pharmacies in the
      area covered by the Health Region Administration of Center (ARS-C) . A specific educative
      intervention, designed from gaps detected in knowledge and attitudes with respect to
      antibiotics and resistance, will be carried out on the intervention group. The control group
      will not receive any specific intervention.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The attitudes and knowledge towards antibiotics generate habits of prescription by
           physicians

        2. The attitudes and knowledge towards to antibiotics generate propensity to dispense
           antibiotics without prescription by pharmacists

        3. The identification of the attitudes, knowledge and factors that generate habits of
           inadequate prescription will allow the design of specific educative interventions to
           improve the use of antibiotics

        4. The identification of the attitudes, knowledge and factors that generate propensity to
           dispense antibiotics without prescription will allow the design of specific educative
           interventions to antibiotic use

        5. The interventions designed from gaps detected in knowledge and attitudes with respect to
           antibiotics and resistance will improve the prescription and dispensation of antibiotics
           by physicians and pharmacists, respectively.

        6. The intervention will collaborate in the control of the bacterial resistance.

      The intervention will consist of group outreach visits (40 minutes), and will be targeted at
      changing the knowledge-attitudes previously found to be associated with poor prescribing of
      antibiotics in the case of physicians and propensity to dispense antibiotics without medical
      prescription in the case of pharmacists.. An observational cohort study of a sample of 1100
      primary care physicians and 1200 community pharmacists will be carried out to identify
      knowledge-attitudes associated with inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics. The independent
      variables (knowledge-attitudes) will be assessed by a self-administered postal questionnaire
      and dependent variables are some quantity and quality indicators of the prescribing
      antibiotics, and consumption data.
