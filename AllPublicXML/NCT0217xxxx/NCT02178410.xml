  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is an ongoing randomized clinical trial of 25,874
      U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin D3 (2000
      IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor® fish oil, 1 gram) reduces the risk of developing cancer,
      heart disease, and stroke in individuals who do not have a prior history of these
      illnesses.The purpose of this ancillary study is to ascertain and adjudicate atrial
      fibrillation (AF) outcomes for the primary aim of testing whether omega-3 fatty acid and/or
      vitamin D supplementation influence atrial fibrillation risk in the general population. We
      also plan to examine how these agents might impact intermediate phenotypes for heart rhythm
      disorders (electrocardiographic parameters), as well as explore effects on arrhythmic death
      and whether baseline blood levels and/or race modify treatment effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death assessments, as well as blood analyses, will be
      conducted on the entire VITAL Study population, and ECG analyses will be limited to the
      Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) sub-cohort of 1,054 VITAL participants who
      live near the Boston area and agree to participate in a series of ancillary studies in
      addition to the main trial.

      Investigators will ascertain atrial fibrillation events utilizing self-report of physician
      diagnoses of atrial fibrillation received on annual questionnaires from study participants
      supplemented by outpatient and hospital visits for AF identified through Centers for Medicare
      and Medicaid Services (CMS) data linkage. Investigators will also ascertain additional
      information regarding atrial fibrillation diagnosis from supplementary questionnaires, and
      seek consent to review all inpatient and outpatient hospital records pertaining to atrial
      fibrillation diagnosis and evaluation. Atrial fibrillation events will be confirmed by an
      endpoint committee composed of cardiologists, which will also make a determination on atrial
      fibrillation subtype and pattern. An intention-to-treat analysis examining the main effects
      of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D on incident atrial fibrillation will be performed to
      address the primary aims.

      Electrocardiograms will be obtained at baseline and again after two years of treatment and
      follow-up among a sub-cohort of 1,054 patients being enrolled in VITAL at the CTSC.
      Investigators will utilize these ECG data to evaluate whether treatment with omega-3 fatty
      acids and vitamin D3 have significant effects on ECG measures. The ECGs will also be utilized
      to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation in our population
      not detected by our atrial fibrillation surveillance methods.

      Investigators will examine baseline blood samples for an estimated 500 participants with
      confirmed atrial fibrillation for the purpose of exploring whether the effect of vitamin D3
      or fish oil supplementation on atrial fibrillation risk varies by the baseline blood levels
      of these nutrients.

      Investigators will also seek additional information necessary to classify deaths as sudden or
      arrhythmic in origin, and cardiac deaths will be reviewed by an endpoint committee of
      cardiologists. Once these results have been compiled investigators will explore whether
      omega-3 fatty acids and/or vitamin D might have an effect on sudden and/or arrhythmic cardiac
      death.
