      Comparison of Images of the same area in the bladder in four different SPIES modalities on a
      tablet computer. Participants are asked to delineate the area on the image suspect for
      malignancy as precise as possible with a stylus on the tablet screen. Delineated area(s)
      is/are captured. Time to start the drawing and total time per image are captured. Hereafter,
      an judgement of Image quality is asked on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being worst possible and 10
      being best possible.

      Karl Storz Company has recently introduced the Storz Professional Image Enhancement System.
      To evaluate the interpretation of cystoscopy images in different SPIES modalities a tablet
      program was developed. Images of 20 bladder areas were captured in 4 different SPIES
      modalities; white light, Clara&amp;Chroma, Spectra A and Spectra B. Of each bladder area, one
      extra image was added to the program, so that a total of 100 images were interpreted.

      Every image is shown 45 seconds on the tablet screen. Participants are asked to delineate
      with a stylus on the tablet the precise area they suspect to be malignant and would resect or
      treat. After they are done they go to the next slide and the time is stopped.After each
      image, participants are asked to judge the quality of the image on a scale of zero to ten,
      with zero being the worst and ten the best.After this judgement, the next image for
      interpretation is presented.
