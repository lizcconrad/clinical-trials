  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical study to determine if Metformin can increase Prostate Specific
      Antigen (PSA) doubling time for patients with Prostate Cancer who have failed primary
      treatment with radiation, or surgical patients that are at high risk for recurrence based on
      surgical pathology. Men with confirmed prostate cancer and rising serum PSA levels will
      receive Metformin and will be monitored for PSA response and disease progression.

      Prostate cancer patients who have received treatment with radiation therapy or surgery, who
      have indicators of high-risk disease will be administered 750mg Metformin Extended Release
      twice per day for a period of 9 months. Metformin is an FDA-approved drug that is prescribed
      to treat high blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 Diabetes. To track prostate cancer
      response in study participants, investigators will obtain prostate specific antigen (PSA)
      levels every three months for the duration of the trial.
