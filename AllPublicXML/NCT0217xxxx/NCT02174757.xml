  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a multifactorial disease that can lead to the destruction of supporting
      tissues of the teeth resulting in pocket formation, recession or both. Since the primary
      etiological factors for periodontal disease are bacteria in supra and sub gingival biofilm,
      efforts for disease prevention and treatment are mainly focused on pathogen reduction and
      strengthening of epithelial barrier, thus contributing to decreased susceptibility to
      infection. Due to emergence of antibiotic resistance and frequent recolonization of treated
      sites with pathogenic bacteria, there was need for a new treatment paradigm to be introduced
      to periodontal disease. The need was fulfilled by the introduction of Probiotics and
      Bacterial Replacement Therapy. The term probiotic is derived from the Greek, meaning &quot;for
      life&quot; are microorganisms proven to exert health promoting influences in humans and animals.
      Food and Agriculture Organization and WHO have stated that there is potential for probiotic
      foods to provide health benefits and that specific strains are safe for human use.
