  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective clinical trial will be to evaluate the efficacy of an FDA
      approved and marketed universal dental adhesive formulation in adult noncarious cervical
      lesions using self-etch and selective etch approaches.

      The hypothesis is that using a selective enamel etch with this universal adhesive will
      enhance the restoration margin performance.

      The purpose of this prospective clinical trial will be to evaluate the efficacy of a newly
      formulated universal dental adhesive formulation in adult noncarious cervical lesions using
      self-etch and selective etch approaches.

      Thirty-three patients with at least two non-carious cervical lesions will receive one
      restoration utilizing the self-etch universal adhesive with no separate enamel etching and
      another restoration utilizing the universal adhesive and a a selective etch protocol in which
      in which enamel is etched with 37% phosphoric acid.

      After a screening/baseline visit at which the restorative procedures listed above will
      conducted, the patient will be seen at recall visits after approximately 6, 12 and 24 months
      to observe sensitivity, retention, marginal discoloration and marginal adaptation.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be restoration retention. In these non-retentive dental lesions, the adhesive will be the only mode of retention. Failure of the adhesive would result in loss of the restoration.</description>
