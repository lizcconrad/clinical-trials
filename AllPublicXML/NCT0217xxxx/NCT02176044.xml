  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial working memory (ability to remember where objects are in space) is impaired in
      patients with schizophrenia. It is thought that this impairment occurs due to problems with
      the chemical messenger (neurotransmitter), glutamate, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      glutamate receptor, particularly in the hippocampal brain region. NMDA receptor activation
      leads to increases in the release of the second messenger Nitric Oxide. Impaired NMDA
      receptor function would therefore be predicted to lead to reductions in Nitric Oxide
      production. Recent work suggests that a drug, sodium nitroprusside, which releases nitric
      oxide, enhances some aspects of cognition in schizophrenia (specifically related to negative
      symptoms). In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that sodium
      nitroprusside improves spatial working memory in patients with schizophrenia. 15 patients
      will receive sodium nitroprusside, and 15 will receive a nonactive compound (placebo). Their
      performance on a spatial working memory task will be tested before and after administration
      of sodium nitroprusside or placebo.
