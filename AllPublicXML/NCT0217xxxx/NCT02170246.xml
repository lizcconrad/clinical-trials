  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project will study whether the drug telmisartan administered in conjunction
      with antiretroviral therapy (ART) will help reduce nervous system infection with HIV. The
      investigators are studying the effect of this treatment in people who have contracted HIV
      infection within the past three weeks, and thus have a form of HIV called acute HIV
      infection. The investigators will measure biological markers of immune activation in the
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid to see if telmisartan may reduce the spread of HIV reservoirs
      in affected patients.

      Note regarding the primary purpose of the study: In the Study Design section, this protocol
      is classified as &quot;Other&quot;, since it is specifically designed to examine the effect of
      telmisartan administered in conjunction with ART on the size of HIV reservoirs in the central
      nervous system.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of neopterin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients placed on antiretroviral therapy (ART) administered in conjunction with telmisartan, versus those placed on ART only</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 48 weeks following ART initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Neopterin is a biological marker of immune activation. Its presence in the CSF provides information on the establishment and persistence of HIV viral reservoirs within the central nervous system of HIV-positive patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in levels of mast cell progenitor-1 (MCP-1), IP-10, and HIV RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 48 weeks following ART initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess CSF levels of MCP-1, IP-10, and HIV RNA. Absolute levels of these compounds will be compared between subjects on ART + telmisartan versus those on ART only.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood plasma levels of neopterin, interleukin-6, D-dimers, soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14), and soluble cluster of differentiation 163 (sCD163)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 48 weeks following ART initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess blood plasma levels of these biomarkers in subjects on ART + telmisartan versus those on ART only.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in absolute concentrations and ratios with respect to creatine of choline, myoinositol, and n-acetylaspartate (NAA) in specified brain regions</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 48 weeks following ART initiation</time_frame>
    <description>These measurements will be made using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).</description>

    <measure>Test scores on HIV neuropsychological battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 48 weeks following ART initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The assessments to be used in this study have been tested for use with native Thai speakers and will be consistent with other SEARCH study tests. SEARCH employs a HIV neurocognitive battery designed to minimize cultural bias, which has been tested in Bangkok.</description>

    <description>Acute HIV-infected subjects (n=14) will be randomly assigned to a group that will receive treatment with telmisartan in addition to ART. Subjects will receive 40mg telmisartan daily for 4 weeks, followed by 80mg telmisartan daily for 44 weeks, to be taken in conjunction with ART. Subjects unable to tolerate 80mg of telmisartan will be able to de-escalate to 40mg daily. After telmisartan is stopped, subjects will continue to take ART for an additional 24 weeks (total 72 weeks).</description>
