      The identification of abnormal narrowing of a blood vessel from non-invasive coronary
      angiography remains an exciting goal. While Computed Tomography (CT) has established a clear
      role in patients it retains some limitations. Primarily, alterations in blood flow leading to
      a restriction in blood supply to tissues cannot be accurately predicted from the anatomical
      assessment of an abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel - a limitation of both invasive, and
      computed tomographic, angiography. This is important, as there is now a raft of evidence
      demonstrating that revascularisation should only be considered in the presence of a
      restriction in blood supply to tissues.

      The gold standard method of identifying a restriction in blood supply to tissues is
      measurement of the fractional flow reserve (FFR), a dimensionless value generated as a ratio
      between the circulatory pressure before and after a narrowing of a blood vessel.

      At present, patients with indeterminately significant abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel
      identified using CT must go on to have a further test for a restriction in blood supply to
      tissues, prior to any decision about revascularisation being made.

      As part of our governance commitment to maintaining our reporting standards, we undertake
      ongoing audit of our cardiac CT practice. The investigators recently identified a group of
      patients who have undergone FFR measurement as part of routine clinical care, and compared
      these to our clinical reports, to ensure that appropriate recommendations were being made. It
      appeared that the ability to predict important abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel was
      reasonable (~70%) and hence we propose the formulation of a research question to explore this
      further.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of a visual assessment of
      the likely significance on blood flow of a narrowing of a blood vessel identified on cardiac
      CT, in comparison to invasive, fractional flow reserve.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate features of an abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel
      that is likely to have a significant impact on blood flow.

      The investigators' working hypothesis is that cardiac CT FFR is a useful predictor of
      abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel.

      This is a retrospective study of diagnostic accuracy. We do not intend to undertake any
      intervention or require patient involvement at any stage of this research.

      The study would utilise anonymised patient data, identified as part of the previous audit.
      FFR values are already known for each patient. The image dataset would be retrieved and
      matched to an FFR. At this stage all data, including the images, would be anonymised. The
      images would be reviewed independently by two expert readers who would record their
      impression of the likely haemodynamic significance of a particular stenosis. Two weeks later,
      to minimise bias, the readers would re-review the images to identify features of the stenoses
      known, or likely, to cause haemodynamic significance, including stenosis length, territory of
      the vessel, calcification.

      The results would be directly compared to the FFR readings and the features would be
      subjected to multivariate analysis to identify any salient anatomical feature which may
      predict haemodynamic significance.
