      The purpose of this study is to determine whether, in patients undergoing elective valvular
      heart surgery, revascularization of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) guided by FFR
      (Fractional flow reserve) would be superior to standard angiography-guided-revascularization
      approach on major efficacy and safety outcomes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SAVE-IT trial is a multicenter, international, randomized, controlled, superiority trial.
      Patients scheduled to undergo elective valvular heart surgery will be screened for presence
      of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) by invasive coronary angiography. Patients with
      a stenosis &gt; 50% in at least one epicardial vessel (excluding left main) considered suitable
      for surgical revascularization will be randomized to FFR guided- or standard
      angiography-guided surgical revascularization. A proportion of patients with no concomitant
      CAD will be followed in a parallel registry

      Baseline clinical, laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data will be
      obtained. Coronary anatomy severity will be assessed by quantitative coronary angiography
      (QCA) and Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery
      (Syntax) score. Surgical risk will be assessed by Euroscore. Patients randomized to
      FFR-guided arm will have functional severity of the angiographic stenosis assessed by a St.
      Jude Medical coronary pressure wire measurement under hyperemic conditions using intravenous
      or intracoronary adenosine administration. If the FFR is ≤0.8 then a graft will be placed
      distal to the coronary stenosis. If the FFR is &gt;0.8 no grafting will be performed to the
      epicardial vessel containing the stenosis. Patients will receive cardiac surgery no later
      than 8 weeks after randomization.

      Peri-operative data will be collected. Clinical follow-up data will be collected at 1, 6 and
      12 month after surgery. Graft patency at 12 months will be assessed by cardiac computed
      angiography (CCTA) for all patients who received at least one graft, except if an invasive
      coronary angiography has been performed in the preceding 3 months based on clinical grounds.
