  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A few studies state that 3-segment SARPE has the following advantages: a) higher level of
      expansion symmetry; b) higher level of stability of the expansion achieved; and c) faster
      bone healing. The investigators hypothesize that 2-segment SARPE is as effective as 3-segment
      SARPE concerning treatment and/or quality of life in daily practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      32 healthy, literate adult patients (male and female) with 7-millimeter transverse maxilla
      deficiency bilaterally distributed will participate in this study.

      The participants will be assigned randomizable in equal number to undergo either 3-segment or
      2-segment SARPE.

      Individuals that a) have undergone maxilla surgery previously; b) have craniofacial
      anomaly;and c) have dental crowding will not be enrolled.

      All participants will be assessed before and after surgery for sensitivity to pressure and
      temperature in the innervated structures linked to the maxilla, as well as for quality of
      life using OHIP-49 and B-OQLQ assessment tools.

      The expansion of maxilla will be assessed by superimposing tomographic images before and
      after surgery.
