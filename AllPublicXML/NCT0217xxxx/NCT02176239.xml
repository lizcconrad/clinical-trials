  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the utility of measuring outcomes in 5% treatment
      naïve Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PIDD) patients
      using infusion nurse and patient measured physical, quality of life (QOL), respiratory, and
      disability assessments using CareExchange in the home setting.
