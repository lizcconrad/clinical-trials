    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies vaccine therapy before surgery in treating patients with
      kidney cancer that has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body.
      Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and white blood cells may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill tumor cells when they are infused back into the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the immune-modulatory systemic and intratumoral effects of AGS-003 (renal cell
      carcinoma/cluster of differentiation [CD]40L ribonucleic acid [RNA]-transfected autologous
      dendritic cell vaccine AGS-003) as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with localized renal
      cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility that total tumor RNA processing-related activities meet
      specifications for AGS-003 manufacturing utilizing a core needle biopsy procedure for tumor
      harvesting prior to nephrectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 3 injections of renal cell carcinoma/cluster of CD40L RNA-transfected
      autologous dendritic cell vaccine AGS-003 intradermally (ID) once every 7 days during weeks
      6-8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo
      partial or radical nephrectomy on week 10.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 30 days post-nephrectomy</time_frame>
    <description>The time component will be modeled as a three-level classification factor. The full model for the effects of time will be fit using linear mixed model methods. The model will include a random patient effect and 5 fixed effects for time and the interactions. The presence of any time effect will be assessed with full-reduced model type 3 test. If the omnibus test is statistically significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level, then three pairwise time-point comparisons will be conducted.
Expression measurements may be transformed to satisfy modeling assumptions.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have localized non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (&lt; pT2, NO, MO), as per the
             American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh (7th) edition criteria

          -  Must be surgical candidates as deemed fit by surgeon

          -  Patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods
             (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
             and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
