  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Otitis media with effusion (OME) cases refer to a clinically silent condition. Otoscopic
      findings are subjective and not always reliable. As an objective test tympanometric
      evaluation is imperfect for diagnosis of OME. The objective of our study was to investigate,
      in OME cases, the correlation of tympanic membrane color changes with the presence and
      viscosity of effusion in the middle ear. The study aimed to provide objective diagnostic and
      therapeutic criteria for patients scheduled for surgery by 2 means: measuring the viscosity
      of the fluid and evaluating color changes objectively with red-green-blue (RGB) measurements.

      Endoscopic images of the tympanic membranes of 52 patients (Group 1) and 52 healthy controls
      (Group 2) were taken during their otologic examinations. All patients in Group 1 had hearing
      loss and were diagnosed with OME after audiological evaluation. Specific points were
      designated at certain areas on each tympanic membrane, and RGB values of those specific
      points were measured on the tympanic membrane images of both groups. Additionally, in Group 1
      viscosity of each effusion taken by paracentesis during surgery was also measured
      intraoperatively with a viscometer. Patients with viscosity values lower than 450 cP
      (centipoise) were subdivided into Group 1a, and those with values higher than 450 cP into
      Group 1b.

    <description>All Group 1 patients were diagnosed with OME, diagnoses made by endoscopic-otoscopic examination findings and type-B tympanograms. They were all scheduled for ventilation tube insertion. Diagnosis of OME was confirmed during this surgery. All patients were examined by 4 mm 0-degree Storz endoscope and light source. The Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 program was used for RGB measurements. Viscosity was measured by the Brookfield DV-II+ProCP Viscometer.</description>

    <description>Children in Group 2 had totally normal tympanic membranes and type A tympanograms. They had no hearing loss, Eustachian tube dysfunction, or any other ear-related problem, and were included in the study as healthy controls. Excluded from the study were patients presenting with acute otitis media, tympanosclerotic plaques, mental retardation, and children who were difficult to cooperate with. All subjects were examined by 4 mm 0-degree Storz endoscope and light source. The Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 program was used for RGB measurements.</description>

    <description>To determine whether higher or lower viscosity of an effusion impacted RGB values, the patient group was subdivided into two subgroups according to viscosity level. Patients with an effusion below the mean viscosity value of 450 cP (centipoise) were assigned to Group 1a.</description>

    <description>When a circular area of 30 surrounding pixels are placed exactly upon the above-mentioned standardized points, the Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 program automatically measures the numerical values of the RGB color components in that area. The RGB values of the same points on the tympanic membrane images of the two groups were obtained and compared. Diagnostic significance of objectively assessed color changes at the tympanic membrane in OME patients was evaluated.</description>
