      The purpose of this study is to identify the appropriate dose of irinotecan by dose
      escalation(dose climbing) test. The study would provide rationale for regimen decision in a
      future phase III clinical trial, in which irinotecan combined with cisplatin(IP) will be
      selected as therapeutic drugs.
