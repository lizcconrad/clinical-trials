    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3b, multi-centre, open-label, single-arm companion study to the MDS 20090160
      study for the treatment of anaemic subjects with MDS. Subjects that complete the
      active-treatment period of the darbepoetin alfa MDS 20090160 study and meet the eligibility
      criteria may be enrolled into this study to continue treatment of darbepoetin alfa for up to
      73 weeks or until progression to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), whichever occurs first.

    <description>Darbepoetin Alfa will be given at 500 μg three-times per week/two-times per week. The first dose and dosing frequency on day 1 / week 1 should carry forward from the last dose and frequency from the parent study (darbepoetin alfa MDS 20090160 study) administered at week 70 / 71. The day 1 / week 1 visit should align within +10 days of the End of Active Treatment Period (EOATP) visit at week 72 / 73 from the darbepoetin alfa MDS 20090160 study. The investigator may choose to increase the dose of darbepoetin alfa with the maximum dose permitted of 500 μg two-times per week. Dose increases should follow a step-wise approach, (eg, 300 μg to 500 μg; 200 μg to 300 μg) with at least 8 weeks at a given dose before the dose may be increased.</description>

        Subject must continue long term follow up within parent study (20090160);

        Subject must have an ongoing clinically relevant erythroid response as assessed by the
        Investigator using current response criteria (ie, International Working Group (IWG)
        response criteria);

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Transfusion dependence defined as receiving a total of ≥ 4 units of red blood cell (RBC)
        transfusion in the previous 8-week period prior to enrolment;

        Known diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or marrow collagen fibrosis;

        Known diagnosis of intermediate-2 or high risk MDS per International Prognostic Scoring
        System (IPSS);

        Subjects received thrombopoiesis-stimulating factors (eg, eltrombopag, romiplostim) in the
        MDS 20090160 study or planning to receive such agents during the study;

        Other protocol defined inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.
