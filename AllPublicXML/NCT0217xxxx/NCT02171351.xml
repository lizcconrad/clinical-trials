    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA) is recommended for the treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes to
      increase insulin sensitivity and improve metabolic control. However, adherence to PA is often
      poor, due to a lack of motivation or due to disabling complications or comorbidities.
      Neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES) is a physical treatment commonly used to improve
      muscle strength and volume in several situations: after stroke, after limb trauma or during
      chest rehabilitation in deconditioned patients. The investigators have already shown in a
      first pilot study (manuscript in preparation) that NMES improves insulin sensitivity : in the
      study ELECTRODIAB (No. ID-RCB: 2011-A00930-41), the investigators showed a 25% insulin
      sensitivity improvement after a week of daily 25-min bi-quadricipital NMES session, in a
      population of patients with orally-treated type 2 diabetes. Insulin sensitivity increased up
      to 50% in the most deconditioned subjects. Discrepancy between this result and the very low
      energy expenditure measured during sessions suggests that the metabolic effect was not solely
      mediated by muscle contractions. The investigators hypothesize the involvement of
      neurological pathways. Indeed, it is demonstrated that the autonomic nervous system is an
      important regulator of glucose metabolism with pancreatic action, a key role in energy
      metabolism and a complex relationship with insulin resistance. Muscle activity, whether
      static (isometric) or dynamic causes changes in sympathetic nerve activity in healthy
      subjects but its effect in type 2 diabetic subjects is not known. The investigators
      hypothesize that, in type 2 diabetic subjects, the modulation of sympathetic nerve activity
      by NMES could be involved in the improvement of insulin sensitivity. To address this
      question, the investigators propose to assess sympathetic nerve activity with the gold
      standard method of microneurography before and after a single bi-quadricipital NMES session.
      The impact of neuro-electro-stimulation (NES) (a sensitive stimulation under muscular
      threshold) and the impact of voluntary isometric muscle contractions (VC) will also be
      evaluated. These procedures will also be applied in healthy control subjects.
