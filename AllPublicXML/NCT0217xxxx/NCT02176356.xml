  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Satisfaction With Facial Appearance Overall Using a 10-item Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their satisfaction with the way they look right now with their entire face in mind using a 10-item questionnaire. Possible responses to each question were: 1=Very dissatisfied, 2=Somewhat dissatisfied, 3-=Somewhat satisfied and 4=Very satisfied. The responses were added across items and transformed to a Rasch scale ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Aging Appearance Using a 7-item Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated how they look now using a 7-item questionnaire. Possible responses for each question are 1=Definitely disagree, 2=Somewhat disagree, 3=Somewhat agree or 4=Definitely agree. The responses were added across items and transformed to a Rasch score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Age Appraisal Using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed how old they think they look compared to their actual age using a VAS by placing a mark on a number on a horizontal line where the far left of the line= -15 (look 15 years younger), 0=look current age, to the far right of the line=15 (look 15 years older). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Social Confidence Using an 8-item Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their social confidence with their facial appearance in mind in the past week using an 8-item questionnaire. Possible responses for each question are 1=Definitely disagree, 2=Somewhat disagree, 3=Somewhat agree or 4= Definitely agree. The responses were added across items and transformed to a Rasch score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psychological Well-Being Using a 10-item Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their psychological well-being with their facial appearance in mind using a 10-item questionnaire. Possible responses for each question are 1=Definitely disagree, 2=Somewhat disagree, 3=Somewhat agree or 4= Definitely agree. The responses were added across items and transformed to a Rasch score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's Self- Perception of Age (SPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed SPA by answering the question: How do you think your facial appearance looks compared to your age today? Participants recorded how many years younger or older they thought their facial appearance made them look. A negative result indicates improvement (a younger appearance).</description>
