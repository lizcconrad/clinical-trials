    <textblock>
      Background: Intraoperative wound infiltration with local anaesthetic is commonly used. Apart
      from the obvious immediate action it has been supported that a possible down regulation of
      pain receptors may lead to longer effects. Our aim was to compare the use of local
      anaesthetic versus placebo in order to assess if indeed there is a late beneficial effect.

      Materials and methods: We will conduct a RCT involving 400 consecutive general surgery
      patients randomized in 2 groups: Group A= placebo, Group B= wound infiltration with
      ropivacaine 10%. We will record the preoperative and postoperative pain for the 1st week as
      well as the type and quantity of the analgesia used during the study period.

      Hypothesis : patients who receive intraoperatively wound infiltration with local anaesthetic
      have lower pain during the 1st postoperative week and require less pain killers .

    <description>the intensity of the pain will be assessed using the : The visual analogue scale (VAS) which is a psychometric response scale and the patient has to indicate a position along a continuous line between two end-points (no pain and maximum pain) and (2) the numeric rating scale (NRS) which is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which the patient indicates the number (0-10) that best reflects the intensity of their pain. Both tests are easy to obtain, reliable, valid and can detect changes of over time</description>
