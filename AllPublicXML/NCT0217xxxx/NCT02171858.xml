    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of main causes of death and impairment worldwide. Objective of this study is to
      analyze serum High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein in acute phase stroke in patients attended
      at Petróleos Mexicanos Hospital Central Sur de Alta Especialidad and to correlate with stroke
      extension and clinical features.
