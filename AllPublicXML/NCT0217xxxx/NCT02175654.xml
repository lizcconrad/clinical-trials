      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of single-agent regorafenib in the
      second-line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer with any RAS or BRAF mutation
      previously treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in terms of progression-free survival at 6
      months.
