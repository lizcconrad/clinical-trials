  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the care of the chronic pain in pain's department, pain consultation or Evaluation and
      Treatment of the Pain Center (CETD), the patients are often in a situation of physical and
      psychic suffering which requires a multidisciplinary follow-up. So, 19 percent of the chronic
      painful patients lost their employment, are &quot;disintegrated&quot; because of their pain, this being
      able to provocate a loss of their financial autonomy. A large number of painful patients thus
      find themselves in situations of social vulnerability even of precariousness often denied and
      difficult to detect by the caring team. Precarity is define as &quot; the lack of one or several
      securities, in particular the employment, allowing the people and the families to assume
      their professional, family or social obligations, and to enjoy their fundamental rights.&quot; To
      allow a earlier identification of the populations in deprivation situation, the questionnaire
      EPICES (Evaluation of the Precariousness and the Disparities of health for the Centers of
      Examination of Health (CES)) was administered to more than 7000 people. The individual score,
      indicator of the precariousness and the disparities of health, is calculated after answer to
      11 questions and was calculated on about 200 000 French people. Among numerous indicators, it
      appears that the consumption of psychotropics or a negative perception of the health are
      socioeconomic indicators, mode of life and health which are prevailing according to the
      quintiles of the score EPICES.

      This national study, on the French CETD aims is: 1 - to study prevalence of the social
      vulnerability even of the precariousness thanks to adapted questionnaires of which the
      questionnaire EPICES, 2 - to identify predictive social-economic factors which generate and
      amplify this circumstance, 3 - to identify the patients for whom a situation of
      precariousness and social vulnerability is proved true, justifying the earlier orientation
      towards the social worker of the Center so allowing a &quot;global&quot; care of the patient during the
      second visit

      This national study is the first study on the chronic pain and the social vulnerability, as
      well at the level national as international because at this day there is no international
      publication dealing with this problem which begins to emerge in the structures setting in
      charge of the patients suffering of chronic pain. A recent article (Denk and al, on 2014)
      underlines the importance to look for the predictive factors of the chronic pain. This
      epidemiological study of prevalence of the social vulnerability even of the precariousness as
      well as predictive factors of this circumstance will allow to identify the patients with risk
      in a earlier way and to refer them as soon as possible for a support in the social domain. In
      a completely empirical way we notice important obstacles of psychosocial and societal order
      during the therapeutic care of the patients. This study will allow to bring important
      information on a troop about one thousand patients distributed on the French CETD.

Patient which have a score EPICES ≥ 30, 2. will be considered as &quot; vulnerable socially or precarious&quot; and will came for a second consultation in the center of Evaluation and Treatment of the Pain, to benefit an earlier orientation and better adapted with a social worker.</description>
