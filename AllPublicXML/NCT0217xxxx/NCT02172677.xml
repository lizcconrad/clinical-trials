  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schemas describe mental structures storing recurrent and organized pattern of information.
      Schemas may have a strong influence on the process of storing and retrieving new information
      into memory. Previous approaches in the cognitive neuroscience of memory have entirely
      focused on the individual dimension of preexisting schemas. In the real world though, much of
      our experiences and knowledge are collective or shared. Such social-cultural frameworks
      stored in collective memory may also reshape and reconfigure the construction of individual
      memories. Attempting to ascertain the influence of collective schema on the neural substrates
      of individual memories using cutting-edge brain imaging methods represents the challenge that
      MULTIBRAIN seeks to tackle. To achieve this goal, we will record brain activity in a group of
      24 participants while there are remembering pictures from a tour at the World War II Memorial
      of Caen. This study will seek to identify brain areas of the prefrontal cortex encoding the
      organization of knowledge in collective memory using multivariate analyses of brain patterns
      of activation, and then to understand how such regions might modulate the recruitment of the
      hippocampus during episodic memory retrieval using analyses of effective connectivity. The
      organization of knowledge in collective memory is measured in parallel through 1) the
      analysis of French social memory of World War II using a corpus of 100 000 television and
      radio shows from the National Institute of Audiovisual, and 2) an internet task measuring the
      organization of individual knowledge in a large group of individuals that will allow to
      separate shared from non-shared memories of the World War II. Once collected, these data will
      help us to understand how collective schemas may reconfigure the organization of individual
      memories.
