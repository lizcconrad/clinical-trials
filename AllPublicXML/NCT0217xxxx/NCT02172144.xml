        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants in the study will be healthy males or females, ranging from 21 to 50 years
        of age, with a body mass index (BMI) be within 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (BMI calculation: weight
        in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters). In accordance with Good Clinical
        Practice and the local legislation all volunteers will have given their written informed
        consent prior to admission to the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG)
             deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders, clinically relevant electrolyte disturbances

             classes

          -  Previous tendon disease related to quinolone treatment

          -  Congenital or documented acquired QT- prolongation, previous history of symptomatic
             arrhythmias

          -  Pulse rate at screening of &gt; 80 bpm or &lt; 45 bpm

          -  Any screening ECG value outside of the reference range of clinical relevance
             including, but not limited to PR (Pulse rate) interval &gt; 220 ms, QRS interval &gt; 115
             ms, QTcB &gt; 450 ms, or QT (uncorrected) &gt; 470 ms

        For Female Subjects:

          -  Pregnancy
