  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real-world adherence to inhaled and oral therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients remains
      discouragingly low, ranging between 31-53% for inhaled antibiotics and 41-72% for hypertonic
      saline. Programs to enhance adherence, including comprehensive behavioral interventions with
      adolescents, have met with mixed success. Advances in therapy, treatment delivery systems,
      and data capture technology offer the potential for enhancing adherence by providing
      immediate and more frequent feedback to the patient regarding his or her fidelity to the
      prescribed treatment regimen. We propose to conduct a proof-of-concept study to evaluate a
      systematic approach to linking treatment and feedback components to enhance adherence.

      Study Design: This will be a single group intervention involving a 28-day baseline (Phase 1),
      a 28-day treatment period with enhanced adherence feedback. Subjects will be treated with
      Cayston via a blue tooth enabled nebulizer.

    <description>These data will be aggregated and displayed graphically in weekly intervals. Adherence will be displayed as percentage and timing percentage within a set criterion of prescribed inter-dose interval. Drug holidays, operationally defined as missing two or more consecutive doses will be displayed along with average length. Patient self-reported adherence information, collected via handheld (i.e, smart phone, tablet, laptop) application will be displayed as percentage and timing percentage on the dashboard.
