    <textblock>
      Single administration, double-blinded, placebo-controlled (3 subjects in each group will take
      placebo) and 3 dose groups (20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg). There are three groups which are 20mg
      lurasidone or placebo, 40mg lurasidone or placebo and 80mg lurasidone or placebo.

      This study comprises a screening period (between signing of the informed consent form and Day
      -2), baseline period (Day -1), treatment period (Days 1-3) and ending of study examination
      period (Days 8-11 after the last sample collection for PK evaluation).
