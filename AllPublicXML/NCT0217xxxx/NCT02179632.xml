      Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers work closely with doctors and hospitals, and
      the companies often pay large sums for consulting and advising services. Recipients of these
      payments and companies have stated that these financial relationships contribute to
      innovation in health care. However, multiple studies have also found that such payments have
      the potential to bias prescribing and treatment behaviors, and thus may lead to increases in
      health care costs.

      One way to address potential conflicts of interest in medicine is public disclosure. As part
      of the Affordable Care Act, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act (PPSA) will establish a
      national disclosure website that posts all payments from pharmaceutical, medical device, and
      biologics manufacturers to doctors and hospitals starting in 2014. Payments exceeding $10
      must be reported, and they will be listed by category, such as speaking engagements, meals,
      travel, and consulting services.

      The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) explicitly state in their Final
      Regulations for the PPSA that the disclosure website &quot;will permit patients to make better
      informed decisions when choosing health care professionals and making treatment decisions,&quot;
      but the ways in which patients will evaluate and interpret disclosure remain unclear. One
      prominent topic in the discussion of disclosure is patient trust in health care providers and
      how transparency will affect the patient-doctor relationshipâ€”and, consequently, how the new
      law may affect physicians and hospitals.

      Patient trust is associated with improved self-care among patients with conditions from
      diabetes mellitus to HIV, and patient trust has also been found to correlate with medication
      adherence and continuity with physician. Therefore, an exploration of how large-scale public
      disclosure of payments will affect patient trust in doctors and the medical profession can
      help predict the effect of the policy on patient care.

      Past studies of patient responses to disclosure present contradictory findings: some patients
      may refuse to see doctors who accept payments, while others may see the potential for
      conflicts of interest as only a small factor in the choice of physician. In one literature
      review, both patients and participants believed that disclosure would lead to increased
      confidence in their providers' decisions. Yet another study found that while disclosure does
      not have much impact on a person's willingness to participate in research, 59% of
      participants said that disclosure did not change their trust in the researcher or institution
      and 36% of participants indicated that their trust decreased. Moreover, in a role-playing
      experiment, patients who heard a disclosure statement said they would feel uncomfortable
      turning down a doctor's recommendations for fear of suggesting that the doctor was corrupt.
      However, none of these studies explicitly measured trust in a clinical relationship in the
      context of large-scale disclosure, which will be the setting for the PPSA website.

      Defining Trust Both in the medical context and beyond, many definitions of trust have been
      proposed, and multiple measurement tools have been developed. Trust is generally thought of
      as &quot;the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the
      expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor,
      irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party.&quot; One of the most
      comprehensive conceptual models for trust in physicians and medical institutions is based on
      5 dimensions: 1) fidelity, pursuing a patient's best interests; 2) competence, avoiding
      mistakes and producing the best results; 3) honesty, or telling the truth, 4)
      confidentiality, protection of private information, and 5) global trust, a holistic aspect.

      There are multiple predictions for how disclosure will influence patient-provider relations
      when considering these dimensions. For example, the increased transparency about ties to
      industry could increase patient perceptions of honesty. Physicians who receive payments for
      consulting may be viewed as experts in their fields, and therefore may be seen as more
      competent. Alternatively, patients may question the fidelity of a doctor who receives
      payments, wondering if she has the patient's best interests as her priority. Thus, the
      implications for a national disclosure website on patient trust in physicians and the
      institution of medicine are unclear, despite CMS' claims that the PPSA will aid consumer
      decision-making. This project sets out to explore the effects of disclosure on patient trust
      in doctors and the medical profession.

    <description>Treatment Group 1: This group will be directed to ProPublica's Dollars For Docs physician payment disclosure registry for State of Massachusetts, and be asked to search for Dr. A. Participants will be asked to complete a worksheet reporting the total dollar amount listed for Dr. A, according to manufacturer, in 2012. Dr. A will be a physician the researchers have chosen who does not appear on the website and therefore did not receive any payments in 2012. Participants should report $0/not listed as the response. Following this stage, participants will be told that Dr. A does not appear on the website and therefore did not receive any payments.</description>
