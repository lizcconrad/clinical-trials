  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been the investigators observation that large diameter traction pins cause more
      postoperative knee pain than smaller traction pins. To the investigators knowledge, no study
      to date has identified knee pain as a consequence of traction pin placement. Furthermore, no
      study has identified whether pin size has an effect on the incidence of postoperative knee
      pain. The goal of the present study is to establish whether use of temporary skeletal
      traction is associated with subsequent knee pain and to determine whether traction pin size
      influences the incidence and/or magnitude of knee pain.

      Objective #1:

      Determine whether pin size influences the incidence and/or severity of postoperative knee
      pain in patients who undergo temporary skeletal traction.

      Hypothesis:

      Larger traction pins are associated with an increase in both the incidence and severity of
      postoperative knee pain.

      Objective#2:

      Determine whether pin size affects musculoskeletal function in the postoperative period.

      Hypothesis:

      There is no difference between small and large traction pins in postoperative musculoskeletal
      function.
