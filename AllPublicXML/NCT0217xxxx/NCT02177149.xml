  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis is that the use of a DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) clinical decision
      support system for individual patient management will enable considerable time savings
      compared to standard care. This hypothesis was formulated from pilot studies that showed
      dramatic decreases in DBS programming time compared to standard care for clinicians who used
      an iPad-based decision support system (99% time savings from over 4 hours to 2 minutes. Study
      group Parkinson's patients with DBS Systems

      In most cases these subjects have failed to maintain adequate control of their symptoms on
      medications alone.

      The Diagnosis of PD (Parkinson's Disease) and the decision to have DBS qualifies a subject
      for enrollment. Subjects would be selected because they will require DBS programming.

      The investigators will prospectively enroll 20 PD DBS patients at the Froedtert Movement
      Disorders Center (surgical targets: subthalamic nucleus (STN) or internal segment of globus
      pallidus (GPi). Post-operative care, patients will be randomized 1/1 to standard care or
      using the clinical decision support system. The DBS RN will use ImageVis3D Mobile app on the
      iPad to program the DBS system, this software does not interact with Froedtert imaging
      systems. The study team uses identified images provided by the Froedtert PACS system, de
      identifies them, adds a study code. The images are loaded into the software system and used
      to identify the leads locations. The Patients will be assessed for 6 months starting with the
      initial DBS programming session. Importantly, the investigators do not anticipate that the
      clinical decision support tool will provide the final DBS settings, nor do we anticipate that
      this approach will obviate the need for motor exams. The clinical decision support system
      will help nurses choose good initial settings and then explore around those initial settings.

      The investigators will measure the time spent on DBS programming for patients in each group.
      The investigators will capture programming session duration, number of programming sessions
      and total time spent on DBS programming. The investigators will compare total time spent
      programming for the standard care versus the intervention group.

    <description>Patients will be assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, motor section) by a blinded rater (Dr. Hiner, movement disorders neurologist). Patients will be tested in their best &quot;On&quot; state (e.g.on medication, on stimulation). The investigators will compare UPDRS-III scores for the standard care versus the intervention group. The UPDRS, Motor section is performed at each visit.
Patient-Reported Outcomes
The study team will capture patient-reported QOL (Quality of Life) using PDQ-39 (Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire. The PDQ-39 is a validated, widely used scale completed by the patient, and is used to assess health-related quality of life in this cohort (Jenkinson, Peto, Fitzpatrick, Greenhall, &amp; Hyman, 1995). Patients will fill out rating scales using a web-based form on an iPad or workstation during each clinic visit.</description>
