  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to assess the efficacy of telmisartan 40-80 mg once daily compared with losartan 50-100
      mg once daily in hypertensive patients evaluated by change from baseline in diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP) during the last 6 hours of the 24-hour dosing interval, at the end of the 12
      weeks period of monotherapy treatment (ABPM - ambulatory blood pressure measurement).

      Secondary objectives: Changes from baseline in BP at the end of the monotherapy period of
      treatment and at the end of the study, evaluated by sphygmomanometric blood pressure
      measurement and ABPM

      Safety:

      Incidence of adverse events (AE's); withdrawal due to adverse events; laboratory parameters
