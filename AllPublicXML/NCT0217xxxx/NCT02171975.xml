      Multiple passes and attempts while administering spinal anesthesia are associated with a
      greater incidence of post dural-puncture headache, paraesthesia and spinal hematoma. The
      investigators hypothesised that the routine use of pre-procedural ultrasound-guided
      paramedian spinals reduces the number of passes required to achieve enter the subarachnoid
      space when compared to the conventional landmark-guided midline approach.

      Spinal anesthesia is widely performed using a surface landmark based 'blind' technique.
      Multiple passes and attempts while administering spinal anesthesia are associated with a
      greater incidence of post dural-puncture headache, paraesthesia and spinal hematoma.

      Real time and pre-procedural neuraxial ultrasound techniques have been used to improve the
      success rate of spinal anesthesia. The use of real time ultrasound-guided spinal anesthesia
      has to date been limited to case series and case reports. Its use may be limited by the
      requirement for wide bore needles and the technical difficulties associated with simultaneous
      ultrasound scanning and needle advancement. The use of pre-procedural ultrasound has been
      shown to increase the first pass success rate for spinal anesthesia only in patients with
      difficult surface anatomic landmarks.No technique has been shown to improve the success rate
      of dural puncture when applied routinely to all patients.

      Studies on pre-procedural ultrasound-guided spinal techniques are limited to a midline
      approach using a transverse median view (TM). The parasagittal oblique (PSO) view
      consistently offers better ultrasound view of the neuraxis compared to TM views. However no
      studies have been conducted to assess whether these superior PSO views translate into easier
      paramedian needle insertion.

      We hypothesised that the routine use of pre-procedural ultrasound-guided paramedian spinal
      technique results in less number of passes required to enter the subarachnoid space when
      compared to the conventional landmark based midline approach.

    <description>In group P, a portable ultrasound unit was used for initial pre-procedural marking. The interspinous space at which the clearest image of the anterior complex (ligamentum flavum dura complex- LFD) and posterior complex (posterior longitudinal ligament- PLL) was obtained, was selected. At the selected interspace, and with the probe positioned to obtain the clearest ultrasound image, a skin marker was used to mark the midpoint of the long border of the probe and the midpoints of the short borders of the probe . At the same horizontal level as the midpoint of the long border of the probe, the midpoint of the line drawn between the two short border midpoints of the probe was used as paramedian insertion point for the spinal needle.</description>
