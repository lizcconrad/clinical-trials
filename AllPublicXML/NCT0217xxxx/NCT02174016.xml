      This is a prospective pilot study evaluating the safety and feasibility of implementing the
      ketogenic diet in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with acute brain
      injury such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Animal studies
      suggest that in the aftermath of injury the brain's ability to use glucose as a fuel is
      impaired. The ketogenic diet is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet which is already used in
      clinical practice for the treatment of medication resistant epilepsy and is intended to
      switch the body over to burning fat rather than carbohydrates for fuel. In lieu of their
      standard tube-feeds, 5-10 children admitted to the PICU with these diagnoses will receive low
      carbohydrate, high fat ketogenic feeds for 2 weeks. We hypothesize that ketones will be
      detectable through serum tests and MRI spectroscopy studies of the brain within several days
      of diet initiation, and that there will be a low incidence of side effects and adverse
      events,

      Measures of interest will include the incidence of kidney stones, excessive acidosis and
      excessive hypoglycemia. The feasibility of implementing this protocol for a larger efficacy
      trial will be assessed through serial measurements of blood glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate (a
      type of ketone body), and serum bicarbonate levels. In addition, levels of ketone bodies
      within the brain will be measured through MRI spectroscopy sequence which will be acquired at
      the same time as a follow-up MRI brain study ordered for clinical purposes.
