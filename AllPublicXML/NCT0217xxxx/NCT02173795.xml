    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to investigate patients acceptability / preference of
      Berodual® Respimat® inhaler as compared to the conventional Berodual® Metered Aerosol (MA)
      inhaler. Ease of handling and assembling the Respimat® inhaler at home under real life
      conditions was also evaluated.

             least 4 weeks prior to study

          -  Patients should be able to perform all study related tests including using a peak flow
             meter, to perform acceptable PEFR measurements, and should be able to maintain records
             (Patient Daily Diary Cards) during the study period as required in the protocol

          -  All patients must sign and Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial,

             weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of
             prednisolone per day or 20 mg every other day

          -  Patients on inhaled or short-acting beta-adrenergics other than the study medication

          -  Patients on inhaled or short-acting beta-anticholinergics other than the study
