  <brief_title>Comparison of Safety and Efficacy of Berodual® Administered Via the Respimat® Device With That Administered Via the Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Within-device, Double-blind Tri-national Study to Compare the Safety and Efficacy of Berodual® Administered Via the Respimat® Device (50 µg Fenoterol Hydrobromide/20 µg Ipratropium Bromide and 25 µg Fenoterol Hydrobromide/10 µg Ipratropium Bromide, 1 Puff q.i.d) With That Administered Via the MDI (50 µg Fenoterol Hydrobromide/21 µg Ipratropium Bromide, 2 Puffs q.i.d) in COPD Patients Over a 12-week Period</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that at least one of the two doses of Berodual® (50 µg fenoterol
      hydrobromide/20 µg ipratropium bromide and 25 µg fenoterol hydrobromide/10 µg ipratropium
      bromide, 1 puff q.i.d) administered via the Respimat® gives a bronchodilator response which
      is not inferior to that obtained from one dose of Berodual® (50 µg fenoterol hydrobromide/21
      µg ipratropium bromide, 2 puffs q.i.d) administered via the MDI and that the safety profile
      is at least as good when COPD patients are treated for 12 weeks.
