      Title: Safety and efficacy of fentanyl citrate in combination with midazolam in critically
      ill children with mechanical ventilation

      Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fentanyl citrate in combination with
      midazolam in children with mechanical ventilation.

      Design: Double-blind randomized controlled study

      Patients: Patients age 2 months through 18 years who are admitted in Seoul National
      University Hospital pediatric intensive care unit, and applied with mechanical ventilation.

      Interventions: After enrollment of patient, blind reagent (fentanyl citrate or normal saline)
      is prepared by assigned pharmacist. Investigators, caregivers, patient, and parents of the
      patient don't know whether the blind reagent is fentanyl citrate or not, but only preparing
      pharmacist knows that.

      Protocol: All enrolled patients receive continuous infusion of midazolam and blind reagent.
      The start time of study is when the continuous infusion of midazolam and blind reagent are
      begun. Assigned research nurse check Comfort behavior scale of the patient every hour
      regularly, and whenever the patient seem to be overactive. Endpoint of the study is 48 hours
      after begining. If there is any adverse effect or unexpected event, however, the study can be
      early terminated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comfort behavior scale consists of 7 components of alertness, calmness, respiratory response,
      crying, physical movement, muscle tone, and facial tension. Because intubated patients cannot
      be evaluated 'crying', however, we use 6 components among total of all 7 components, except
      'crying'.

      Adverse effect of fentanyl include hypotension, coma, and ileus. Unexpected event means the
      situation which study cannot last in, such as withdrawal of consent, necessity of drugs which
      can affect the level of consciousness of the patient, emergent interventional procedure, etc.
