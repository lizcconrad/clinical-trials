    <textblock>
      In children aged 3 months to 10 years who present to the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED)
      with recent, significant vomiting and moderate dehydration, is treatment with Ondansetron
      Orally Disintegrating Tablet (ODT) better tolerated than treatment with Ondansetron Oral
      Solution (OS)? Our hypothesis is that children who receive Ondansetron ODT will have 10% less
      vomiting within 15 minutes of administration than those receiving Ondansetron OS.

      Vomiting related to viral gastroenteritis is the most common presentation to the Alberta
      Children's Hospital Pediatric Emergency Department. Recently, a clinical pathway was
      implemented to improve the care and flow of patients with vomiting and/or diarrhea through
      the department. Administration of an antiemetic, Ondansetron, is an integral part of
      improving the hydration status of children managed by the pathway. However it is not know
      whether Oral Solution or Oral Disintegrating Tablets are better tolerated in children who
      have active vomiting. The investigators aim to show that children receiving Oral
      Disintegrating Tablets have less vomiting immediately after medication administration than
      children receiving Oral Solution. By demonstrating this improved tolerability the
      investigators will provide health care providers the stimulus for implementing Ondansetron
      Oral Disintegrating Tablets into their practice for children with active vomiting.
