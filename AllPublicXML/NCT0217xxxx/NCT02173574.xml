  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Part 1 is to inform dose selection for use of alisporivir and EDP239 in
      combination and obtain initial safety data for co-administration of alisporivir and EDP239 to
      support future treatment studies in patients. The purpose of Part 2 is to inform the
      drug-drug interaction potential of EDP239 more broadly and possibly facilitate the
      interpretation of lower than expected alisporivir concentrations in Part 1, if observed.

    <description>The following PK parameters were determined from the plasma concentration time profile of EDP239 and DEB025 using a non-compartmental method: AUCtau: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the end of the dosing interval AUC0-24: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours AUClast: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration. AUClast was calculated as the sum of linear trapezoids using non-compartmental analysis. AUCinf: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity. AUCinf was calculated by adding AUClast and the value obtained from dividing the last measurable plasma concentration by λz, where λz was determined from automated linear regression of the last three time points with non-zero concentrations in the terminal phase of the log-transformed concentration-time profile</description>
