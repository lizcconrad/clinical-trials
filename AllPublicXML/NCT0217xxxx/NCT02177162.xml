  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapists' knee OA care is suboptimal. Exercise therapy including a combination of
      aerobic, muscle strengthening and functional exercises is not always performed and a lot of
      treatments are used for which there is no evidence. By a continuing education session and a
      pop-up in the electronic patient file, this study wants to improve knee OA care by focusing
      on combined exercise therapy.

      The study will be performed in collaboration with Pro-Q-Kine, an independent organization
      implementing quality improvement in Belgian physiotherapists' care. Besides Pro-Q-Kine the
      study will be performed in collaboration with two or three software producers of
      physiotherapists' electronic patient files that reached a national homologation for their
      respective software packages and covering a large part of the Flemish physiotherapists.

      Pro-Q-Kine will organize sessions of continuing education with a focus on optimal knee OA
      care. These sessions will be performed in LOK-groups (local peer-groups of physiotherapists
      who meet each other for continuing education). At these sessions the physiotherapists will be
      asked to take part to the study. A pop-up will be installed in the electronic patient file of
      the participating physiotherapists, lightening up when physiotherapists register a patient
      with knee OA. The pop-up includes a short message about optimal knee OA care. The
      physiotherapists will also receive a script for a query in their electronic patient files in
      order to extract those patients that initiated a treatment for knee OA between 1 year and 3
      months before the therapists received education. These patients will receive a letter of
      their respective physiotherapists in which they are addressed to take part to the study. An
      informed consent, patient questionnaire and retour-envelope will be included. There will also
      be the opportunity to complete the questionnaire electronically with an electronic informed
      consent. The patient questionnaire will include some background details (such as age and
      gender) and details about the physiotherapeutic treatments they received for knee OA. The
      patient questionnaire will be coded with a number, referring to the physiotherapist and to
      the individual patient (the first patient of the first physiotherapist will be coded as 1.01,
      the 10th patient of the 14th physiotherapist will be coded as 14.10). Patients' names will
      not be revealed to the investigators and physiotherapists will not have any access to the
      completed patients' questionnaires. The general practitioners in the environment of the
      physiotherapist will (probably) receive a letter from the researchers. This letter will
      contain information about the importance of referral to a physiotherapist in knee OA care and
      about knee OA care in general. This letter will also refer to the study that is going on in
      physiotherapists' care, without details.

      Six months after the installation of the pop-up, the physiotherapists will be asked again to
      perform the query to extract patients out of the electronic patient file that have been
      treated for knee OA and whose treatment sessions had been started in the period of three
      months from the installation of the pop-up.
