  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate safety and efficacy using decidual stromal cell therapy for toxicity and
      inflammation, with special focus on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation patients.
      The hypothesis to be tested is that the cells are safe to infuse and that they have an
      anti-inflammatory and healing effect.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with toxicity, inflammation or hemorrhages will receive decidual stromal cells at
      approximately 1x10^6 cells/kg at one or more occasions at weekly intervals dependent on
      clinical response.
