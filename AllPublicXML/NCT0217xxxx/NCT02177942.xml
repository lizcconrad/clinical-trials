  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of supplementation using both protein and multiple micronutrients in preschool age
      children on cognitive performance and growth is unknown. The study will compare the effect of
      combination of protein and multiple micronutrients on indicators of cognitive performance and
      growth in preschool age children. Cognitive performance and anthropometric assessments will
      be measured at baseline and at 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in short term memory at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were evaluated on basis of optimized short term memory tests. Short term memory was measured using word order and number recall sub tests of Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC) at baseline and at 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in weight at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weight was measured (single measurement) in standard clothing on weighing scale to the nearest 0.1kilograms(kg).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in height at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Height was measured (single measurement) using a portable stadio-meter, with the participant standing bare-foot, to the nearest 0.1centimeters (cm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>BMI for was obtained using the World Health Organization Anthroplus software version 1.0.2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in triceps skin fold (TSF) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TSF was measured in the midline of the posterior aspect of the arm, over the triceps muscle, at a level midway between the lateral projection of the acromion process of the scapula and the inferior margin of the olecranon process of the ulna. The right elbow is flexed at 90°and the midpoint between the acromion and the olecranon process is located and marked at the lateral side of the arm. The skinfold was then measured with the arm hanging loosely while standing. The triceps skinfold was picked up with the left thumb and index finger approximately 1cm proximal to the marked level and the tips calipers were applied to the skin-fold at the marked level. The triceps measurement was done (three measurements) using Holtain calipers to the nearest 0.2 millimeters (mm) and the average value was recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MUAC (single measurement) was measured midway between the acromion and the olecranon process, while the participant stands with the elbow flexed at 90. The circumference was measured with a fiber glass tape to the nearest 0.1 cm on the right hand.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in arm muscle area (AMA) and arm fat area (AFA) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the MUAC measurement and TSF measurement, the arm muscle AMA and AFA were calculated i.e. AMA (cm2) = (MUAC-(π*TSF))2/4 π and AFA (cm2) = (MUAC2/4π) - AMA</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of ill days at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline upto 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of ill days due to cold, cough and/or associated fever were recorded. The mean number of ill days due was analyzed at 6 months using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in problem solving at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The staff took the required shapes for each item and placed the set of shapes in front of the participant.. The participants were asked to arrange flat shapes of various sizes and colours to match a model or picture If correct, the staff proceeded to item 1, if not then the staff taught the participant and then proceeded to item 1. For items 1 to 2, two trials were given, and score 2 for success on the first trial and 1 for success in the second trial was given. For item 3, score 1 for success and 0 for failure, according to the scoring criteria for each item was given. From item 5, demonstration stopped and the pictures in the easel were shown to make the shapes. On completion of item 10, the plastic shapes were kept away, and the foam triangles for samples were used. After the participant understood the concept the test was continued through items 11 till the participant gets 3 consecutive scores of 0. Items from 11 had time limits. The raw score was the total of item scores.</description>
