  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy kills tumor cells but can also damage healthy cells and cause significant
      digestive disorders such as ulcers of the mouth, called mucositis. Mucositis are transient
      but their intensity may require special measures. Mucositis are painful and morphine gel or
      intravenous morphine is used to relieve pain.

      However, the pain of oral mucositis induced by chemotherapy is not completely relieved by
      morphine administered intravenously.

      As part of the study, the investigators want to evaluate an oral gel containing a small
      amount of morphine so that it acts directly on the mucositis. The investigators believe that
      the direct action of morphine on mucositis may be more effective on pain.

      The objective of the study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of topical morphine gel
      versus placebo gel in the pediatric oncohaematology oral mucositis induced by chemotherapy in
      children treated with systemic opioids.

      To confirm these results, we propose to conduct a randomized double-blinded study designed to
      compare the analgesic efficacy of morphine oral topical gel versus placebo gel in children
      over 5 years with mucositis induced by chemotherapy and treated with systemic opioids. This
      analgesic effect should reduce persistent pain to maintain oral feeding and thus delay the
      implementation of parenteral nutrition, and hence reduce the dose of systemic morphine and
      also reduce the adverse effects of opioids

    <description>Pain is assessed before gel application and 30 minutes after application (i e 8 times per day and for the duration of the mucositis between 8 to 21 days). The gel is administered 4 times daily 30 minutes before each meal. Response to treatment is defined as a greater than or equal to 30% decrease in pain level between before and after application of the gel.</description>
