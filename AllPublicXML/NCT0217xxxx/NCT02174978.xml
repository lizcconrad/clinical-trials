    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a Phase 1 study with controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) designed
      primarily to evaluate the safety of the FMP012 combined with AS01B adjuvant system. AS01B is
      a proprietary current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) grade adjuvant manufactured by
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals. It is a formulation based on liposomes mixed with the
      immunostimulants monophosphoryl lipid (MPL) and Quillaja saponaria (QS)-21. The
      immunogenicity and efficacy of this new candidate vaccine will be evaluated in addition to
      safety.
