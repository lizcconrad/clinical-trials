  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participation in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (CR) decreases morbidity and mortality for
      patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous
      revascularization. Unfortunately, only 10-35% of patients for whom CR is indicated choose to
      participate. Medicaid coverage and similar state-supported insurance are robust predictors of
      CR non-participation. There is growing recognition of the need to increase CR among patients
      with this form of insurance and other economically disadvantaged patients, but there are no
      evidence-based interventions available for doing so. In the present study we are examining
      the efficacy of using financial incentives for increasing CR participation among Medicaid
      patients. Financial incentives have been highly effective in altering other health behaviors
      among disadvantaged populations (e.g., smoking during pregnancy, weight loss). For this study
      are randomizing 130 CR-eligible Medicaid enrollees to a treatment condition where they
      receive financial incentives contingent on initiation of and continued attendance at CR
      sessions or to a &quot;usual-care&quot; condition where they will not receive these incentives.
      Treatment conditions will be compared on attendance at CR and end-of-intervention
      improvements in fitness, decision making and health-related quality of life. Cost
      effectiveness of the treatment conditions will also be examined by comparing the costs of the
      incentive intervention and usual care conditions with their effects on increasing CR
      initiation and adherence. Should this intervention be efficacious and cost-effective, it has
      the potential to substantially increase CR participation and significantly improve health
      outcomes among low-income cardiac patients.
