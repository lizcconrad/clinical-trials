      RATIONALE: Laparoscopic staging may help doctors plan more effective treatment for gastric
      cancer, yet the efficiency have not been fully investigated in Chinese people.

      PURPOSE: Study the effectiveness of laparoscopic staging in patients with pre-diagnosed as
      locally advanced gastric cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the feasibility of laparoscopic staging of patients with
      pre-diagnosed as locally advanced gastric cancer. II. Assess the adverse effects associated
      with this technique.

      OUTLINE: Surgery. Laparoscopy with cytologic examination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 450 patients will be accrued over approximately 2 years.
