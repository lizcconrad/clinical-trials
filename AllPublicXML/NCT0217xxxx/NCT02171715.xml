  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to investigate the relative bioavailability and
      pharmacokinetics of 20 mg BIBW 2992 administered as film-coated immediate release tablet
      (final formulation, i.e. phase III/to-be-marketed formulation) to healthy subjects in
      comparison with the drinking solution and in comparison with the trial formulation II tablet,
      which was administered in phase II clinical trials and also partly in phase I trials.
