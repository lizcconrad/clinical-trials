      This was a single-centre, open-label, parallel group, non-randomised study with a single-dose
      phase (Phase A) followed by a multiple-dose phase (Phase B), in 12 healthy elderly and 12
      healthy young subjects. During the whole study, subjects were to receive a single 600 mg dose
      of BIA 2-093 (Phase A) followed by 600 mg BIA 2-093 once daily for 8 days in Phase B. Phase B
      was to begun 96 hours post-Phase A dose.
