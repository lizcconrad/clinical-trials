    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects no younger than 30 and no more than 75 years of age.

          2. Subjects who scored 3 or 4 on the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) and want to
             improve the appearance of their nasolabial folds (the subject does not need to have
             the same score on both sides.*)

             *The scores need not to be same on both sides, but the two nasolabial folds should
             have symmetry in the range of 3-4.

          3. Subjects who have symmetric nasolabial folds.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who received an antithrombotic agent within 2 weeks prior to screening (with
             the exception of low dose Aspirin less than 300 mg/day)

          2. Subjects who have a history of bleeding disorder.

          3. Subjects who have received calcium hydroxyapatite, CaHA injection in nasolabial area.
