    <textblock>
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive brain stimulation
      technology that has demonstrated the ability to temporarily increase or decrease activity in
      specific regions of the brain. The researchers are investigating the effect of this
      technology on sleep propensity by applying two different types of stimulation as well as sham
      (Placebo) stimulation during three different afternoon naps. The researchers are subsequently
      hoping to recruit healthy volunteers without medical, or sleep problems who have a regular
      sleep schedule to participate in the study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that there are cortical direct current (DC) changes that
      accompany sleep onset and transitions between sleep states in a stereotyped manner. In these
      studies it was determined that negative potential shifts occurred prior to and at the
      transition from wakefulness to sleep and at transitions between Rapid Eye Movement sleep
      (REM) sleep, and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. In a subset of experiments it was
      demonstrated that the same DC potential shifts occur during the transition from wake to sleep
      in an afternoon nap. The recorded DC potential shifts occurred predominantly in the
      pre-frontal cortex (F3, F4), with spread into central areas. No current literature exists
      that explores whether tDCS could be used to modulate cortical activity prior to sleep,
      resulting in either increased or decreased sleep propensity.

      The application of focal, non-invasive brain stimulation has already led to novel and
      effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disease with minimal side effects (Most well
      studied in depression and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation or, rTMS). Should the
      application of tDCS modulate sleep propensity it would represent a novel study paradigm with
      the potential to lead to a completely novel treatment for sleep disturbance. With this small
      pilot study, we propose taking the first step in exploring the utility of tDCS in modulating
      sleep propensity. We propose to recruit 15 healthy non-treatment seeking participants from
      the community and expose them to three total nap conditions in a randomized counter balanced
      fashion, with 10 minutes of either, Anodal, Cathodal, or Sham tDCS stimulation occurring
      prior to each nap opportunity.
