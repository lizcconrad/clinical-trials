    <textblock>
      This study compares two ways of placing a dental implant on the day of tooth extraction. One
      method will place a additional bone graft (derived from bovine bone) and the other group will
      not have the graft placed. Both groups will be restored at the same time with an immediate
      crown.

      The investigators will be researching and comparing the changes in gum level that occur after
      each surgical method, as well as changes in jaw width where the implant is placed.

      The investigators will enroll 16 patients per group. The patients will be followed for 3, 6,
      and 12 months post-immediate implant placement to observe healing.

      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the soft tissue dimensional changes after
      extraction of teeth in the esthetic zone, when combined with the placement of implants into
      these fresh extraction sockets. In addition, the effect of placing a graft material, such as
      Bio-Oss Collagen速 into the gap between implant and the labial plate of bone will be evaluated
      after an immediately loaded provisional restoration is placed. 32 subjects will have an
      immediate dental implant placed in the maxillary anterior region (#4-12) after extraction of
      a hopeless tooth. 16 subjects will be randomly selected to receive Bio-Oss Collagen速 (Test
      group) and 16 subjects will have no graft (Control group) in the gap between the implant and
      the labial plate of bone. Hopeless maxillary anterior teeth will be extracted and implants
      will be placed in a flapless procedure. Implants will be immediately loaded with provisional
      restorations once determined that the implant is stable. Changes in vertical height and
      horizontal dimensional changes of the free gingival margins will be evaluated at 3, 6, and 12
      months post-immediate implant placement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must have read, understood and signed an informed consent form.

          2. Subjects must be willing and able to follow study procedures and instructions.

          3. Subjects must have labial plate of bone present after extraction no more than 4 mm
             from the free gingival margin.

          4. Subjects must require one maxillary anterior implant.

          5. Subjects must be older than 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects having participated within the last six months in other clinical studies.

          3. Subjects with any systemic condition like uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cancer,
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), disorders that compromise wound healing, chronic
             high dose steroid therapy, bone metabolic diseases, radiation or other
             immuno-suppressive therapy which would preclude periodontal surgery.

          4. Subjects with the presence of acute infectious lesions in the areas intended for
             surgery.

          5. History within the last 6 months of weekly or more frequent use of smokeless chewing

             late prosthetic joint infection. Patients who cannot undergo standard oral surgery
             procedure for any reason.

          9. Subjects that have adjacent teeth next to tooth slated for extraction and immediate
             placement showing periodontal disease, endodontic and/or caries pathology will be
             excluded.

             function.

         11. Implant site will not be next to an adjacent implant.
