        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female based upon a complete medical history, including the physical
             examination, regarding vital signs (blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead ECG
             measurement, and clinical laboratory tests. There is no finding deviating from normal
             and of clinical relevance. There is no evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant
             disease.

          -  Age ≥21 and ≤50 years

          -  BMI ≥18.5 and &lt;30 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index)

             accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR, and ECG measurements)
             deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

             the trial)

          -  Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomisation or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre

        The following exclusion criteria are specific for this study due to the known class side
        effect profile of ß2-mimetics:

          -  Asthma or history of pulmonary hyperreactivity

          -  Hyperthyrosis

          -  Allergic rhinitis in need of treatment

          -  Clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Paroxysmal tachycardia (&gt;100 beats per minute).

        For female subjects:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Positive pregnancy test

          -  No adequate contraception e.g. oral contraception, sterilisation, IUD (intrauterine
             device). Females who are not surgically sterile will be asked to additionally use
             barrier contraception methods (e.g. condoms) prior to administration of study
             medication, during the study and at least 2 months after release from the study.

          -  Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period
