  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects, good and/or bad, of a beta blocker
      (carvedilol) on heart function during treatment with anti-HER2 medication(s) including
      trastuzumab (Herceptin).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II placebo-controlled study will evaluate the effect of carvedilol, compared to
      placebo, on anthracycline/anti-HER2 therapy induced left ventricular dysfunction in patients
      with HER2-positive breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. All
      patients will undergo routine cardiac surveillance with 2D echocardiograms per standard of
      care at multiple time points which will align as closely as possible to the following:
      pre-anthracycline (baseline), pre-anti-HER2 therapy, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (+/- 4 weeks)
      after initiation of anti-HER2 therapy. In the case that standard of care echocardiograms are
      not done at these time points, either due to a delay in anti-cancer therapy or due to the
      patient's medical condition, the principal investigator will determine if the standard of
      care echocardiogram may be used in lieu of one of the time points listed. Additional speckle
      tracking strain analysis will be performed on these echocardiograms, and blood specimens will
      be drawn at several time points for biomarker analysis.

      After completion of anthracycline treatment and prior to initiation of anti-HER2 therapy, 32
      patients with abnormal myocardial strain, defined as global longitudinal strain &lt; 19% or %
      change from baseline by &gt; 11%, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to carvedilol versus
      placebo. Carvedilol will be administered twice daily for approximately 1 year OR until the
      end of anti-HER2 therapy, if it is discontinued prior to 1 year. Treatment in both carvedilol
      and placebo groups will be systematically up-titrated at weeks 3, 6, and 9 (+/- 1 week) after
      randomization to a goal dose of 25mg twice daily.
