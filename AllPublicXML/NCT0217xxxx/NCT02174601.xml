      After written consent for participating in clinical research studies, all clinical studies
      conducted to in the one day. The investigators will ask and record about bowel cleansing
      state in all patients who performed colonoscopy. There is no additional cost and the expected
      complications.

      Based on answer, the investigators will develop a prediction model for inadequate bowel
      preparation and prove validation. This model can take the additional measures to subjects
      predicting improper cleansing. It can contribute to improve the accuracy of the test and
      reduce the discomfort due to re-performing colonoscopy after re-preparation, as well as cost
      savings due to reduced frequency of re-colonoscopy Ultimately, it will be able to bring a
      improvement of the quality of management
