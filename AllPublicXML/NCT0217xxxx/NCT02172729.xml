  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether increased dose of local anesthetic (lidocaine) increases duration of
      peripheral nerve block (adductor canal block) and to develop a model for assessing duration
      of peripheral nerve blockades. The investigators hypothesize that increasing the dose of
      lidocaine (by increased concentration) will increase the duration of an adductor canal block.

      The study is a follow up on an identical study (SM1-PJ-13, EudraCT number: 2013-001822-24 )
      made earlier with different concentrations of lidocaine and a placebo group. For further
      information see trial registration at European Union Drug Regulatory Authorities Clinical
      Trial System.
