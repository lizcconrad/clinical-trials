  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a highly prevalent, frequently debilitating illness that too often fails
      to respond to currently available treatments such as antidepressant medication. Furthermore,
      randomized controlled trials of antidepressants consistently demonstrate large placebo
      effects. The investigators hypothesize that individual differences in the function of key
      brain circuits underlie the observed variability in clinical responses to both placebo and
      antidepressant medication. This study will test this hypothesis by recruiting
      treatment-seeking volunteers with major depression, with or without comorbid nicotine
      dependence. Volunteers will participate in positron emission tomography (PET) and functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans in the context of a treatment trial in which they
      will receive both placebo and antidepressant medication. A major goal of the study is to
      improve prediction of individual clinical responses in future treatment trials in which brain
      imaging may be unavailable, and to study the mechanisms of antidepressant response in Major
      Depression.

      We performed a single-blinded two-week cross-over randomized controlled trial of two
      identical oral placebos (described as having either potentially &quot;active&quot; fast-acting
      antidepressant-like effects or to be &quot;inactive&quot;) followed by a 10-week open-label treatment
      with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or in some cases, another agent as
      clinically indicated. The volunteers were studied with PET and the Âµ-opioid receptor
      selective radiotracer [11C]carfentanil after each 1-week &quot;inactive&quot; and &quot;active&quot; oral placebo
      treatment. In addition, 1 mL of isotonic saline was administered intravenously (i.v.) within
      sight of the volunteer during PET scanning every 4 min over 20 min only after the 1-week
      active placebo treatment, with instructions that the compound may be associated with the
      activation of brain systems involved in mood improvement. This challenge stimulus was
      utilized to test the individual capacity to acutely activate endogenous opioid
      neurotransmission under expectations of antidepressant effect.

    <description>Binding Potential = Bmax/Kd (receptor concentration/affinity). This is the most common measure of in vivo receptor binding with positron emission tomography. Whole brain changes in mu-opioid receptors binding potential during PET from the Inactive to the Active placebo condition.
Positive numbers presented here represent reductions in binding potential from the inactive to the active condition.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Pre to post- active placebo, and from pre to post- inactive placebo (1 week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a self-report measure of depression with 16 items.
Questions in the QIDS - SR-116 correlate with the nine DSM-IV symptom criterion domains, Including: Sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and late insomnia or hypersomnia) (Q 1 - 4), Sad mood (Q 5), Decrease/increase in appetite/weight (Q 6 - 9), Concentration (Q 10), Self-criticism (Q 11), Suicidal ideation (Q 12), Interest (Q 13), Energy/fatigue (Q 14), Psychomotor agitation/retardation (Q 15 - 16).
Severity of depression can be judged based on the total score: 1-5= No depression; 6-10= Mild depression; 11-15= Moderate depression; 16-20= Severe depression; 21-27= Very severe depression.
The PHQ-9 and QIDS were used to assess changes in mood during the placebo intervention (first 2 weeks), and therefore results are described as changes from the inactive to the active condition.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in PHQ-9 Depression Scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Pre to post- active placebo, and from pre to post- inactive placebo (1 week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression, based on participant answers. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represents mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. The minimum possible score is 0 and the maximum possible score is 27.

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, week 0, week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The total score is obtained by summing the score of each item, 0-4 (symptom is absent, mild, moderate, or severe) or 0-2 (absent, slight or trivial, clearly present). For the 17-item version, scores can range from 0 to 54, with 0 meaning no depression, and 54, severe depression.
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess symptoms during the open label antidepressant treatment phase, so results are described as mean scores at each bi-weekly visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, week 0, week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Designed in 1979 by researchers as an adjunct to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) which would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than the Hamilton Scale. MADRS was used to assess symptoms during the open label antidepressant treatment phase, so results are described as mean scores at each bi-weekly visit.
Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 where 0 is no depression and 60 is most extreme depression.
The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms 1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts
Usual cutoff points are:
0 to 6 - normal[5] /symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20 to 34 - moderate depression &gt;34 - severe depression</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) Score</title>
        <description>This scale is a self-report measure of depression with 16 items.
Questions in the QIDS â SR-116 correlate with the nine DSM-IV symptom criterion domains, Including: Sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and late insomnia or hypersomnia) (Q 1 - 4), Sad mood (Q 5), Decrease/increase in appetite/weight (Q 6 - 9), Concentration (Q 10), Self-criticism (Q 11), Suicidal ideation (Q 12), Interest (Q 13), Energy/fatigue (Q 14), Psychomotor agitation/retardation (Q 15 - 16).
Severity of depression can be judged based on the total score: 1-5= No depression; 6-10= Mild depression; 11-15= Moderate depression; 16-20= Severe depression; 21-27= Very severe depression.
The PHQ-9 and QIDS were used to assess changes in mood during the placebo intervention (first 2 weeks), and therefore results are described as changes from the inactive to the active condition.</description>

        <title>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale</title>
        <description>Designed in 1979 by researchers as an adjunct to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) which would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than the Hamilton Scale. MADRS was used to assess symptoms during the open label antidepressant treatment phase, so results are described as mean scores at each bi-weekly visit.
Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 where 0 is no depression and 60 is most extreme depression.
The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms 1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts
Usual cutoff points are:
0 to 6 â normal[5] /symptom absent 7 to 19 â mild depression 20 to 34 â moderate depression &gt;34 â severe depression</description>
