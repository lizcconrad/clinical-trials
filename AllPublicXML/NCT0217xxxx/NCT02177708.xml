  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is
      tightly associated with low-grade cerebral edema. Uptake of ammonia in astrocytes leads to
      osmotic swelling caused by glutamine formation. Previous studies were performed in covert HE
      patients or used indirect methods.

      Methods: The investigators wish to describes quantitative measurement of localized water
      content using MRI water mapping in a cohort of patients with cirrhosis during an episode of
      overt HE type C and again after recovery. Furthermore patients with cirrhosis and no history
      of HE and healthy subjects will be investigated as controls.
