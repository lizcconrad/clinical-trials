        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is healthy based upon a complete medical history, including the physical
             examination, regarding vital signs (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG measurement, and clinical
             laboratory tests. There is no finding deviating from normal and of clinical relevance.

        effect profile of ß2-mimetics:

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of asthma or history of pulmonary hyperreactivity

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of hyperthyrosis

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis in need of treatment

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia

          -  No adequate contraception e.g. oral contraception, sterilisation, IUD (intrauterine
             device). Females who are not surgically sterile will be asked to additionally use
             barrier contraception methods (e.g. condoms) prior to administration of study
             medication, during the study and at least one month after release from the study

          -  Inability to maintain this adequate contraception during the whole study period
