    <textblock>
      This was a blinded study conducted on the efficacy and safety of a one-day versus a three-day
      bowel preparation in a pediatric population. Limited data is available in this regard, and
      this study supports the use of a one-day bowel preparation, as this is both safe and
      effective.

    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy in children and young adults is performed by gastroenterologists for a variety of
      indications, including but not limited to evaluation of rectal bleeding, chronic diarrhea,
      family history of polyposis syndromes and surveillance for colon cancer in patients with
      inflammatory bowel disease. A successful bowel preparation that enables clear visualization
      of the intestinal mucosa is essential to diagnose and treat the underlying pathology.
      Currently, gastroenterologists use a variety of colon cleansing preparations, but
      Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 3350 given for three to four days appears to be standard. Though it
      is well tolerated, safe and effective the duration of preparation may cause disruption to the
      routine and missed school days. To date, there is limited data that shows efficacy of a
      shorter duration of bowel preparation with PEG. This study aims to compare the efficacy and
      safety of a one-day preparation with that of a three-day preparation with PEG 3350 as
      preparation for colonoscopy in children and young adults.

    <description>The tolerability was documented by monitoring the patient's clinical ability to consume the entire colonoscopy preparation without abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. Furthermore, this was objectively documented by monitoring and recording the following parameters: Ease of Administration, Compliance, Willingness to take again</description>
