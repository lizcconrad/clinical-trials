  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of ixazomib when
      administered as multiple oral doses at escalating dose levels in participants with lupus
      nephritis.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to find a
      safe and well tolerated dose in participants with lupus nephritis. This study will look at
      side effects and lab results in participants who take ixazomib, along with the determination
      of the pharmacokinetics (PK). This study is designed as a randomized, sequential-panel,
      multiple rising dose study.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. The study population will consist of 4
      Cohorts. At least 5 participants (4:1) will be recruited into the 0.5 mg dose group (Cohort
      A), at least 5 participants (4:1) in the 2.0 mg dose group (Cohort B), 8 participants (6:2)
      in the 3.0 mg dose group (Cohort C), and 8 participants (6:2) in the 4.0 mg dose group
      (Cohort D). Participants in each Cohort will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8 and 15
      in a 28-days cycle, for 3 cycles. PK samples will be collected Predose on Days 1, 8 and 15.
      Cycle 1 - Postdose Day 1 at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 168 hours. Cycle 2 - Postdose
      Day 15 at 168 hours. Cycle 3 - Postdose on Day 15 following the third dose, samples will be
      collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 24, 168 and 312 hours . The starting dose in Cohort
      1 will be 0.5 mg followed by administrations of 2, 3 and 4 mg in subsequent cohorts.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Europe. The overall time
      to participate in this study is up to 196 days. Participants will make 19 visits to the
      clinic during the treatment period and will make follow-up visits monthly for 3 months for
      follow-up assessments.
