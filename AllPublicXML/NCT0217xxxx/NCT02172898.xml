      To conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with
      well-characterized alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and frequency matched individuals (by age,
      gender, and race) with comparable history of alcohol consumption but no clinical evidence of
      liver disease (controls). At the end of the study, a robust clinical information, central
      bio-repository will be developed from both cases and controls.

    <description>Heavy alcohol drinking will be defined as &gt; 40 grams per day on average in women and &gt; 60 grams per day on average in men for a minimum of 6 months and within the 6 weeks prior to study enrollment. Heavy drinkers, who have just become abstinent within prior 2 weeks, including those we convince to seek treatment as part of the recruiting process, are eligible for enrollment. Control subjects must meet the following criteria: (1) AST, ALT, and total bilirubin levels must be within normal range; (2) no prior history of known alcoholic liver disease; and (3) absence of hepatosplenomegaly (from physical examination or radiographic imaging) or stigmata of liver disease.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Subjects with AH</arm_group_label>
    <description>Diagnosis of AH will be established on published criteria based on history of heavy alcohol consumption (defined as &gt; 40 grams per day on average in women and &gt; 60 grams per day on average for men for a minimum of 6 months and within the 6 weeks prior to study enrollment), clinical evaluation and appropriate laboratory testing (as defined as total bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL and AST &gt; 50 U/L). When diagnosis of AH remains in question, a liver biopsy (if clinically feasible and subject has no contraindications) will be required. We plan to enroll patients with AH in special population infected with hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), or HIV.</description>

        CASES: Heavy drinkers with alcoholic hepatitis

        Inclusion criteria

        1. The diagnosis of AH will be established on published criteria this is based on:

          1. Average daily ethanol consumption of &gt; 40 grams/day for women and &gt; 60 grams/day for
             men for a minimum of 6 months and within the 6 weeks prior to study enrolment.
             Judgment regarding daily and yearly alcohol use will be made by the site investigator

          2. Clinical evaluation and appropriate laboratory testing as defined by total bilirubin &gt;
             2 mg/dL and AST &gt; 50 U/L. When the diagnosis of AH remains in question, a liver biopsy
             (if clinically feasible and that subject has no contra-indications) will be required.

          3. Subjects with HBV, HCV and/or HIV will be eligible for enrollment

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Evidence of other liver diseases such as autoimmune or drug-induced

          2. Significant concomitant medical illnesses such as uncontrolled congestive heart
             failure or COPD, or multiorgan failure

          3. Abstinence of alcohol use &gt; 6 weeks immediately preceding enrollment

          4. Hemochromatosis

          5. Wilson Disease

          6. Active intravenous drug use

        CONTROLS: Heavy drinkers without alcoholic hepatitis

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Average daily ethanol consumption of &gt; 40 grams /day for women and &gt; 60 grams/day for
             males for a minimum of 6 months and within the 6 weeks prior to study enrollment. In
             addition, heavy drinkers who have just become abstinent within prior 2 weeks are
             eligible to be enrolled. Judgment regarding daily and yearly alcohol use will be made
             by the site investigator

          2. AST and ALT â‰¤ 50 and total bilirubin levels within normal range. If bilirubin is
             increased due to a suspected Gilbert's Syndrome, patient may be enrolled if the direct
             bilirubin is within normal limits

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Evidence of liver disease

          2. Significant concomitant medical illnesses such as uncontrolled congestive heart
             failure or COPD, or multiorgan failure

          3. Abstinence of alcohol use &gt; 2 weeks immediately preceding enrollment

          4. Hemochromatosis

          5. Wilson Disease

          6. Active intravenous drug use

          7. Prior history of known alcoholic liver disease

          8. Presence of hepatosplenomegaly from the physical examination/radiographic imaging or
             stigmata of liver disease
