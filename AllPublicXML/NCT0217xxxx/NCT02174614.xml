  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of rapid abstinence initiation
      and cognitive control training as a precursor to our new web-based version of the CBT4CBT
      (Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) program to evaluate its
      effectiveness relative to standard outpatient counseling at the Midwestern Connecticut
      Council of Alcoholism (MCCA). CCT will be used to assess attention, working memory and
      inhibitory control and the computer-based training program (CBT4CBT) focuses on teaching
      basic coping skills, presenting examples of effective use of coping skills in a number of
      realistic situations in video form, and providing opportunities for patients to practice and
      review new skills while receiving cocaine abuse treatment.

      150 cocaine dependent individuals will be randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions delivered
      over 4 weeks in the context of intensive outpatient treatment. 1. Treatment as Usual (TAU),
      2. rapid abstinence initiation (RAI) or 3. computerized cognitive control training with
      escalating reinforcement for improved performance on training tasks (CCT). All participants
      will then receive an 8 week trial of CBT4CBT in addition to TAU. Follow up evaluation thru 6
      months posttreatment will assess durability and delayed emergence of treatment effects.
