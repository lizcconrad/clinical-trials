  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is an invalidating disease mainly diagnosed in young
      people. The disease is characterized by a heterogenic phenotype and the disease course by
      flares and remissions. As in most chronic diseases the economic burden of IBD is important
      due to direct health care costs and disability. Health care reorganization for IBD patients
      in the Netherlands is necessary for several reasons. First chronic (sub)clinical mucosal
      inflammation results in irreversible bowel damage and complications and none of the presently
      available drugs is effective for all patients and many drugs have possible severe side
      effects. To prevent complications of the disease and side effects IBD should be monitored
      carefully. In the Netherlands however there is a shortage of gastroenterologists where the
      incidence of IBD is rising. Secondly evidence exists that direct involvement of health care
      workers, patient empowerment and integrated care can improve the outcome of chronic diseases.
      Thirdly many clinically relevant aspects (e.g. malnutrition) of this complex disease are not
      systematically followed in routine care. Finally the government demands registration of
      efficacy endpoints for expensive drugs in the near future. Therefore the investigators
      developed a web-based Telemedicine tool for IBD patients in collaboration with the Dutch IBD
      patient's organization (CCUVN). &quot;myIBcoach&quot; contains E-learning modules, monitors disease
      activity, disability, quality of life, adherence, infections, smoking status, side effects,
      stress and malnutrition on fixed time points with validated questionnaires, allows the
      patient to communicate with health care workers and gives feedback to the back office and the
      patient. A feasibility study in 30 IBD patients in 3 centres showed a high satisfaction and
      compliance of IBD-patients and health care workers with this telemedicine tool.

      The aim of this study is to compare standard care for IBD patients in 3 hospitals with a care
      via the telemedicine tool myIBDcoach.
