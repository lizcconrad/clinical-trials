  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects (good and bad) of using newer
      technologies that allow very precise delivery of radiation. These newer technologies are
      Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the treating physicians will deliver a high dose of radiation to pelvic lymph
      nodes of 56 Gy (Gy/Gray = measure of amount of radiation) and at the same time give a boost
      (additional) radiation to the prostate itself (to 70 Gy). The study will evaluate the
      response of the cancer and side effects of radiation to pelvic lymph nodes and to the
      prostate.

      It is hoped that these newer technologies will:

        1. allow a higher daily dose of radiation to the tumor and pelvic nodes

        2. avoid nearby normal tissue and organs like the rectum and bladder

        3. prevent the cancer from spreading or coming back
