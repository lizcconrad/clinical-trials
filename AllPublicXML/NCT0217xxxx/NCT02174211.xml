    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults of either sex aged 55 years and older

          -  Active neovascular AMD in the study eye

          -  Intravitreal dose of 0.5 mg ranibizumab required, as per current clinical guidelines

          -  Venous access that is sufficient to allow easy blood sampling on a frequent basis

          -  Able to give written consent

          -  Willingness to comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Myopia greater than 8 dioptres in the study eye

          -  Axial length of eye under 22mm or over 26mm

          -  Pseudophakia or aphakia in study eye

          -  Glaucoma in study eye

          -  Current renal dialysis

          -  Presence of inflammatory eye conditions, such as uveitis, or systemic conditions
             likely to elevate CRP, such as infection, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, asthma and
             inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  Intraocular surgery within 6 months of enrolment, except for routine
             phacoemulsification cataract surgery that may occur within 4 months of enrolment

          -  Current treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration with an intravitreal agent
             other than ranibizumab in the study eye. Patients expected to change their anti-VEGF
             agent during the sampling period are also excluded.

          -  Known significant allergy to ranibizumab

          -  Participants who, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not be willing or able to
             comply with the study protocol or provide informed consent.

          -  Patients with severe anaemia

          -  Patients who have received anti-VEGF therapy in either eye within 8 weeks of
             enrolment, or who are likely to require anti-VEGF treatment in the fellow eye during
             the course of venous sampling. Note that the final venous sample at 4 weeks can be
             undertaken on the same day as an anti-VEGF injection, but must be taken prior to any
             injection.

          -  Patients presently taking any topical (skin or eye), periocular, intraocular, local or
             systemic treatment with immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents, such as
             steroids, steroid sparing agents, and NSAIDs. Patients who have received any of these
             agents within 2 months prior to enrolment are also excluded, as are those thought
             likely to receive these medications during the course of venous sampling.
