  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive and memory problems characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD). Along with these
      disorders, psychological and behavioral symptoms (also known as neuropsychiatric symptoms) ,
      as well as pathophysiological processes are frequently found and involved significantly in
      maintaining autonomy, prognosis and treatment of the disease. Apathy or disorder motivation
      is the most common disorder behavior and early stages of cognitive impairment. Apathy is
      particularly associated with cognitive difficulties such as attention deficit disorder -
      concentration.

      In terms of prevention as term care , there is now a broad consensus that interventions on
      cognition and behavior must not be limited to pharmacological treatment but should also
      promote non-drug approaches.

      Interest in video games (serious games and serious games) as intervention support
      rehabilitation is growing. Similarly, the virtual reality (VR) and the new information
      technologies and communications offer significant opportunities in terms of rehabilitation
      and therapeutic assistance.

      This protocol is part of a European project to propose techniques for improving the treatment
      of people at risk of social exclusion ( VERVE project ) aims .

      A first experiment conducted in 2013 showed the acceptability of Virtual Reality (VR) in
      healthy elderly subjects. In a second step , it is important to validate the feasibility of
      using the RV or in frail subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease in
      mild to moderate in a clinical environment.

      This is a biomedical , randomized given to a group of patients with mild cognitive impairment
      or Alzheimer's disease &amp; diseases associated with mild to moderate.
