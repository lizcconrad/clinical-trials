  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), recurrent risk is low suggesting the
      occurrence of novo mutations (dominant or recessive). Our objective is to test this
      hypothesis by combining the search for pathogenic genomic alteration and intragenic mutations
      through whole exome sequencing in a homogenous group of patients.

      To elucidate the genetic basis of non syndromic congenital diaphragmatic hernia in a sub
      group of individuals with similar phenotype: Isolated CDH presenting with
      postero-lateral-left diaphragmatic defect with good perinatal outcome (n=16) To establish the
      prevalence of the identified gene(s) in a cohort of identical patients (n=30)

      Two complementary approaches will be used:

        -  Search for pathogenic genomic alterations using microarrays (~2.106 markers (SNP and
           CNV) in 16 trios (affected child and 2 parents).

        -  Sequencing of the whole exome from patient genomic DNA (n=16)

        -  Selection of unknown or very rare variants according to different criteria: recessive or
           dominant model, prediction of their pathogenicity, filtered on genes already known in
           CDH or involved in diaphragmatic development and non annotated CNV or variants of new
           gene(s) shared by different patients.

        -  Variants will be validated by Sanger sequencing (for intragenic variants) or
           quantitative PCR (for CNV) on CDH cases and their parents as well as their absence on
           100 controls.
