               -  Patients who are being treated with oral beta adrenergics or long-acting beta

               -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than
                  four weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of
                  prednisolone per day or 20 mg every other day.

               -  Patients who are being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic
                  antidepressants.
