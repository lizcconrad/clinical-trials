  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of hypofractionated proton beam
      radiation therapy when given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients
      with stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer. Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of
      radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (tiny particles with a positive charge) to
      kill tumor cells. Giving proton beam radiation therapy at higher doses over fewer days
      (hypofractionation) may improve local control of the tumor. Giving hypofractionated proton
      beam radiation therapy with chemotherapy may be a better treatment for non-small cell lung
      cancer

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.

          2. Clinical AJCC stage II-III (AJCC, 7th ed.) with plans to be treated with concurrent
             chemoradiotherapy.

               1. Recurrent non-small cell lung cancer is allowed, provided the intent of the
                  current treatment is curative and there has been no prior radiation to the
                  thorax.

               2. Prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy is permitted as long as
                  patients have recovered from prior toxicities to grade ≤ 1

          3. Appropriate stage for protocol entry based upon the following minimum diagnostic
             workup:

               1. History/physical examination within 30 days prior to registration;

               2. FDG-PET/CT scan for staging within 60 days prior to registration;

               3. MRI scan with contrast of the brain (preferred) or CT scan of the brain with
                  contrast within 60 days prior to registration.

               2. Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3;

               3. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to
                  achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dl is acceptable.);

          7. AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 upper limit of normal within 30 days prior to registration.

          8. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 upper limit of normal within 30 days prior to registration.

             (72)]

             Creatinine Clearance (female) = 0.85 x Creatinine Clearance (male)

         10. Peripheral neuropathy ≤ grade 1 at the time of registration.

         11. Presence of measurable or evaluable disease.

                  of registration;

               3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of

               4. Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects;
                  note, however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation
                  parameters are not required for entry into this protocol;

               5. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition;
                  note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol. The
                  need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the
                  treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.
                  Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients.

          2. Prior radiotherapy to the thorax.

          3. Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          4. Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          5. Presence of a cardiac pacemaker (due to the risk created by the proton magnet).

        Inclusion of Women and Minorities

        Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
