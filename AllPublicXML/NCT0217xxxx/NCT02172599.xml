  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the contribution of sit-stand workstations to total
      daily physical activity in a multi-component office-based 12 month intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study adopts a randomised control trial design and is mixed methods (qualitative and
      quantitative). The outcome data from the trial is quantitative. Alongside this a qualitative
      process evaluation will be conducted to inform the intervention, explain trial results and
      understand the intervention implementation and context (Cathain et al. 2014). Two worksites
      will participate in this study, in line with COCHRANE recommendations for randomised control
      trials.

    <description>ActivPAL:
Sitting and standing will be measured objectively using the ActivPAL device. The ActivPAL provides reliable measures of total sitting time and standing time, and number of sit-to-stand transitions per hour (Lyden et al. 2012).
ActiGraph (GT3X+):
Physical activity intensity and duration will be measured objectively using the ActiGraph activity monitor.The GT3X reliably classifies physical activity intensity in free-living environments (Ozemek et al. 2014).
Activity diaries:
These dairies will be used to assess the type and context of physical activity behaviour. A text reminder will be sent to all participants once daily for the duration of the data collection period. Text message models have shown some success in increasing compliance to research (Armstrong et al. 2009).</description>

    <description>Sit-stand workstation provision
The multi-component intervention will align with the World Health Authority's promotion of a healthy workplace model, which emphasises that best-practice workplace health interventions should involve an integrated approach involving organisation and individual level approaches to behaviour change (WHO, 2010). Thus, participants will receive a sit-stand workstation with additional support to use the sit-stand workstation.</description>
