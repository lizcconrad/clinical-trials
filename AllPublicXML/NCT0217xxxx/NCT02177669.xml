    <textblock>
      The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) provides a comprehensive characterization of spatial
      vision and predicts functional vision better than visual acuity, but long testing times
      prevent its psychophysical assessment in clinical applications. Dr. Luis Lesmes et al. (2010)
      developed the qCSF method to obtain precise CSF measurements in only 30-50 trials using a
      computerized software program that presents letters on a large monitor that are identified by
      a patient similar to typical visual acuity testing with an eye chart. The quick CSF method is
      a Bayesian adaptive method that estimates the full shape of the CSF, and the test duration is
      only about 3-6 minutes. Some preliminary testing has been performed at other sites with this
      test in patients with vision loss due to amblyopia and glaucoma, but data from individuals
      without eye disease who have normal visual acuity has not been systematically collected with
      the latest version of this test procedure across a wide range of ages. In addition, we aim to
      gain a better understanding of the typical test-retest variability that is obtained
      between-sessions that are about a week apart from individuals with good ocular health and
      visual acuity.

    <description>We will evaluate various contrast sensitivity metrics that are generated by the computer program: (i) AULCSF or area under the curve for the log contrast sensitivity function (CSF), (ii) CSF acuity or the cutoff-frequency at which sensitivity=2.0 is calculated, and (iii) contrast sensitivity at various spatial frequencies (i.e. 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18.5 cycles per degree), obtained with testing performed binocularly, with the better eye monocularly, and with the better eye using a NoIR 4% transmission filter. Within subject, the data will be analyzed as differences between the two values obtained at the two sessions, which can then be used to determine a 95% coefficient of repeatability across subjects.</description>
