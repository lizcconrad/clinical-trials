  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of BIBW 2992 MA2
      after a single oral dose of [14C]-radiolabelled BIBW 2992 MA2 in healthy male volunteers.
      Metabolites in human plasma and excretions were measured, the structures of the metabolites
      analysed and compared with metabolites in animals. In addition, the mass-balance of
      excretion, the protein binding of [14C]-radioactivity, the plasma concentrations of BIBW 2992
      MA2, and the [14C]-radioactivity in blood cells, plasma, urine and faeces were measured. The
      safety and tolerability of BIBW 2992 were also investigated.
