    <textblock>
      Most people are born with the ability to digest lactose, a dissacharide consisting of
      β-D-glucose and β-D-galactose, because of the presence of lactase at the brush border of the
      small intestine. In about 75% of the world population the activity of this enzyme decreases
      after weaning (primary hypolactasia or lactase-nonpersistence), resulting in incomplete
      digestion of lactose and lactose malabsorption in adulthood (1). Secondary forms of lactose
      malabsorption may be due to inflammation or functional loss of the intestinal mucosa such as
      celiac disease, infectious enteritis or Crohn's disease. Very rarely, lactase deficiency is
      congenital due to an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, preventing lactase expression from
      birth (2). Whereas some people with lactose malabsorption are asymptomatic, most
      lactose-nonpersisters experience symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, excess flatulence or
      diarrhea. Lactose intolerance refers to the syndrome of having one or more symptoms after
      consumption of lactose-containing food (3). At present, the origin of the symptoms of
      lactose-intolerance is not well understood.

      Several studies have indicated a poor correlation between lactose maldigestion and symptoms
      of lactose intolerance (4). In a study by Vonk et al. (2003), lactose intolerant subjects
      with severe symptoms (diarrhea) and intolerant subjects with only mild symptoms (without
      diarrhea) did not differ in degree of lactose digestion in the small intestine indicating a
      similar lactase activity and leading them to the hypothesis of a &quot;colon resistence factor&quot;
      (5). It was suggested that the colonic processing of maldigested lactose may play a role in
      the symptoms experienced by lactose intolerant patients. When lactose is malabsorbed and
      enters the colon, it is rapidly fermented by the resident microbiota into a variety of
      metabolites including lactate, formate, succinate and short chain fatty acids (SCFA, acetate,
      propionate, butyrate) as well as gases (H2, CO2 and CH4). When incubating fecal samples from
      lactose-tolerant and intolerant subjects with lactose, the samples from the
      lactose-intolerant subjects showed faster production rates of D- and L-lactate, acetate,
      propionate and butyrate, as compared to tolerant subjects (6). Although the colon is thought
      to possess a high capacity to absorb SCFA, it was hypothesized that a temporary accumulation
      of these metabolites due to rapid fermentation of maldigested lactose could be responsible
      for abdominal pain, excess flatulence and bloating (7;8). Possible mechanisms proposed to
      explain how SCFA might induce symptoms included an increase in the osmotic load that draws
      fluid to the colonic lumen, changes in colonic motility and an increased colonic sensitivity
      (9-11). However, the calculated amount of fluid drawn in the colon is unlikely to cause
      symptoms considering the high water absorbing capacity of the colon and the effect of SCFA on
      colonic motility and colonic sensitivity have only been observed in rats and not in humans.

      More recently, Campbell et al. introduced the bacterial metabolic toxin hypothesis, stating
      that also other bacterial metabolites, such as alcohols, aldehydes, acids and ketones,
      resulting from carbohydrate fermentation play a role in the pathogenesis of
      lactose-intolerance. These metabolites might inhibit bacterial growth and affect eukaryotic
      cells (12). In our own previous studies in which we related colonic fermentation patterns to
      parameters of cytotoxicity, we identified compounds like propionic acid, medium chain fatty
      acids, 1-octanol and heptanal as more prevalent in the most cytotoxic samples (13),
      supporting the hypothesis of Campbell et al. Therefore, it seems necessary to include not
      only SCFA, but also other metabolites, in the investigation of the pathogenesis of lactose
      intolerance.

      Differences in fermentation patterns might be associated with differences in the composition
      and/or activity of the intestinal microbiota. Evidence on the potential role of the colonic
      microbiota in lactose intolerance is very limited. Total bacterial numbers were not
      significantly different between 16 intolerant and 11 tolerant lactose maldigesters although a
      negative correlation between total bacteria and symptom score was found (14). Similarly, the
      composition of fecal microbiota was not different between 5 intolerant and 7 tolerant
      subjects (6).

      In this study we will compare colonic fermentation and parameters of gut health (fecal water
      cytotoxicity) between patients who are lactose intolerant, patients who have lactose
      malabsorption and healthy subjects.

    <description>Fecal water, prepared by ultracentrifugation of fecal samples, will be incubated with HT-29 cells, a colonic adenocarcinoma cell line. Fecal water genotoxicity will be assessed using the Comet Assay, a sensitive method to detect DNA damage at the level of the individual eukaryotic cell. During the Comet Assay, the cells undergo electrophoresis causing movement of the damaged DNA out of the nucleus. The amount of DNA damage will be determined by measuring the extent the DNA has moved out of the nucleus, using fluorescent microcropy and dedicated software.</description>

    <description>Fecal water cytotoxicity will be measured using the WST-1 assay, a colorimetric test based on the conversion of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 by cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenases present in viable cells. The dilution of fecal water at which 50% of the cells survive will be determined. The higher the dilution, the more cytotoxic the sample is.</description>
