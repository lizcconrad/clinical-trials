      -  Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is a common form of heart failure

        -  Standard treatment for heart failure, show less than ideal results in HFpEF

        -  Evidence of systemic inflammation is common in all forms of heart failure, including
           HFpEF

        -  The main hypothesis of this study is that systemic inflammation contributes to heart
           failure symptoms and exercise limitations in patients with HFpEF

        -  The main objective is to treat patients with HFpEF and evidence of systemic inflammation
           with an anti-inflammatory drug targeting Interleukin-1 (or placebo) to determine effects

    <textblock>
      Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is a common form of heart failure,
      characterized by symptoms of congestion and impaired exercise tolerance, secondary to
      impaired left ventricular filling (diastole) in absence of a significant impairment in
      contractility (LVEF&gt;50%) or significant valvular abnormalities, shunts or intra- or
      extra-cavitary obstruction.

      The standard treatment for patient with heart failure is very effective in Heart Failure with
      Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF), but it not very effective in HFpEF.

      Evidence of systemic inflammation is common in all forms of heart failure, including HFpEF,
      and predicts worse outcomes. C reactive protein (CRP) is the preferred inflammatory biomarker
      used as risk predictor for cardiovascular disease. Patients with heart failure (HFpEF or
      HFrEF) with elevated CRP levels are more likely to be severely limited by heart failure
      symptoms, are more likely to be admitted to the hospital for heart failure, and are more
      likely to die of cardiac causes.

      Preclinical studies show that a key mediator of systemic inflammation, Interleukin-1 (IL-1),
      impairs cardiac and vascular function, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of heart
      failure.

      The main hypothesis of this study is that systemic inflammation, and IL-1 in particular,
      contributes to heart failure symptoms and exercise limitations in patients with HFpEF.

      The main objective is to treat patients with HFpEF and evidence of systemic inflammation with
      an IL-1 blocker, anakinra (recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist)(or placebo) to
      determine effects on exercise capacity measured as peak oxygen consumption at maximal
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

    <description>Absolute changes in aerobic exercise capacity (peak VO2) after 12 weeks treatment will be considered co-primary endpoints. This will compare patients treated with anakinra (N=40) vs placebo (N=20), and provide a randomized, double-blinded assessment of the effects of IL-1β blockade on aerobic exercise performance.</description>

    <description>Absolute changes in ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 [carbon dioxide] slope) after 12 weeks treatment will be considered co-primary endpoints. This will compare patients treated with anakinra (N=40) vs placebo (N=20), and provide a randomized, double-blinded assessment of the effects of IL-1β blockade on aerobic exercise performance.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the changes from baseline in VO2 and VE/VCO2 at 12 weeks (which constitute the co-primary endpoints), secondary endpoints will compare changes in VO2 and VE/VCO2 at 4 and 24 weeks in patients treated with anakinra versus placebo.</description>

    <measure>Diastolic and contractile reserve</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise stress echocardiography will be performed at baseline and 12 weeks to measure diastolic and contractile reserve. We will perform an assessment before initiation of exercise and immediately after cessation of peak exercise.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two independent questionnaires will be used to assess quality of life and HF symptoms. The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ) is a 21-question graded questionnaire that has been extensively used to measure impairment in quality of life in patients with HF. The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) questionnaire is a 12-question, yes/no, instrument that allows for the calculation of perceived functional capacity, in which each question describes a different physical activity and the questions are weighted according to their degree of physical exertion. Both questionnaires will be administered at 0, 4, 12 and 24 weeks in accordance with cardiopulmonary test (CPET) and echocardiography.</description>
