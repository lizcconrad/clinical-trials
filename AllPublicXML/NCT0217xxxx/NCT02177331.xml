  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to confirm the proposed metabolic effect of lacidipine these follow-up study was to
      provide long-term data on its impact on liver function, glucose homoeostasis and lipid
      metabolism. Additionally, its adverse drug reactions and antihypertensive effects were to be
      studied.
