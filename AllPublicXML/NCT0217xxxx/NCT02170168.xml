  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to deliver better health care services through improved
      coordination of cancer care within specialist care (at the local hospital Orkdal Hospital)
      and community care (13 municipalities in the Orkdal region, Norway), and between these two
      levels in the health care system. &quot;The Orkdal model&quot; is developed and will be implemented and
      evaluated within cancer care. Cancer patients living in one of the 12 municipalities
      participating in the formal collaboration &quot;Samhandlingsenheten i Orkdalsregionen&quot; (SIO), or
      the municipality of Oppdal, having metastatic and/or loco-regional disease will be included
      in the study. Carers and health care providers will be included as well. Results from this
      project will be transferable to other parts of Norway and/or to other countries as well as to
      patients with other diagnoses causing complex conditions, such as chronic heart-, lung- and
      neurological disease.

      This study will be a prospective controlled observational pre-post study. The intervention
      consists of three parts: a standardised care pathway, an educational programme and
      information to general public, patients and their carers. Data from patients, carers and
      health care providers (physicians, nurses and nurse assistants) will be collected before the
      model is implemented (pre-intervention part) and after final implementation
      (post-intervention part). In addition, a comparison with a similar patient population, carers
      and health care providers will be conducted. A local hospital in the county of Romsdal and
      community care in the same region will be used as control.
