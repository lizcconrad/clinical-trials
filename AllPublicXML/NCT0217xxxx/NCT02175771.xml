    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety of fluticasone
      propionate (Fp) inhalation powder in 2 strengths and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol
      inhalation (FS) powder in 2 strengths when administered with the Teva multidose dry powder
      inhaler (MDPI) device over 26 weeks in patients with persistent asthma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a stratified, randomized, open-label, active drug-controlled Phase 3 study.

      Patients who met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at the
      screening visit completed a 14 day (±2 days) pretreatment run in period. During the run-in
      period, patients continued using their current asthma medications (ie, inhaled corticosteroid
      and/or other controller therapies) except for their SABA, which was replaced by the
      sponsor-provided albuterol (salbutamol) hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) inhaler to be used as needed
      for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms during the run in and treatment periods.

      Patients were assigned to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy or inhaled
      corticosteroid/long acting beta2 agonist (ICS/LABA) combination therapy and then to a mid- or
      high-treatment strength based on their current asthma maintenance therapy regimen. Patients
      in each strength of the ICS monotherapy cohort were randomly assigned in a 3:1 distribution
      to either the Fp MDPI or FLOVENT HFA treatment arm. Patients in each strength of the ICS/LABA
      combination cohort were randomly assigned in a 3:1 distribution to either the FS MDPI or
      ADVAIR DISKUS treatment arm. There was a total of 8 treatment arms following randomization.

    <measure>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences (TEAE) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 26 of the Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Positive Swab Test Results for Oral Candidiasis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-treatment), Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 26, Endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>Oropharyngeal examinations for visual evidence of oral candidiasis were conducted at each visit by a qualified healthcare professional. Any visual evidence of oral candidiasis during the oropharyngeal exam was evaluated by obtaining and analyzing a swab of the suspect area.
This outcomes indicates how many participants had positive swab test results. The total number of participants who had oropharyngeal exams at each timepoint are specified in the timepoint field. Appropriate therapy was to be initiated immediately at the discretion of the investigator and was not to be delayed for culture confirmation. Participants with a culture-positive infection could continue participation in the study on appropriate anti-infective therapy, provided this therapy was not prohibited by the protocol.</description>

    <measure>Analysis of 24-Hour Urine Cortisol Free Over the 26-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-treatment), Weeks 14 and 26 and early termination visit if applicable</time_frame>
    <description>Samples for 24-hour urine cortisol were collected at baseline (Day 1, pretreatment), and Weeks 14 and 26. For participants requiring early termination (ET), this evaluation was performed at the ET visit. For participants requiring ET for safety reasons, the visit was not delayed in order to collect the 24-hour urine cortisol.
The analysis is based on a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) model with adjustment for visit, treatment, and a treatment*visit interaction. The urine cortisol result is log transformed prior to analysis and the results are back transformed after modeling. An unstructured covariance matrix is used in the MMRM model.</description>

             periods and withholding of all applicable medications. (Patients that require
             continuous treatment with β-blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic
             antidepressants, anticholinergics, and/or systemic corticosteroids are excluded).

         15. The patient has untreated oral candidiasis at the SV. Patients with clinical visual
             evidence of oral candidiasis who agree to receive treatment and comply with
             appropriate medical monitoring may enter the study.

         16. The patient has a history of a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus, active
             hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C infection.

         17. The patient is either an employee or an immediate relative of an employee of the
             clinical investigational center.

         18. A member of the patient's household is participating in the study at the same time.
             However, after the enrolled patient completes or discontinues participation in the
             study, another patient from the same household may be screened.

         19. The patient has a disease/condition that in the medical judgment of the investigator
             would put the safety of the patient at risk through participation or that could affect
             the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition worsened during the study.

               -  Other criteria may apply, please contact the investigator for more information

        Criteria for Randomization:

        Patients were randomized into the study if they met all of the following criteria:

          1. The patient continued to be in general good health, meeting the entry criteria.

          2. The patient continued to have a predose/pre-albuterol FEV1 at the randomization visit
             (RV) that was ≥40% of predicted normal.

          3. The patient had no clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results or ECG
             findings at the screening visit.

          4. The patient had no significant changes in asthma medications during run-in, excluding
             the albuterol/salbutamol HFA (90 mcg ex actuator) or equivalent used as rescue
             medication as supplied per protocol.

          5. The patient did not have a upper respiratory tract infection (URI) or lower
             respiratory tract infection (LRI) during the run in period. Patients who developed a
             URI or LRI during the run in period could be discontinued from the study and allowed
             to re-screen 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms.

          6. The patient had no asthma exacerbation during the run in period, defined as any
             worsening of asthma requiring any significant treatment other than rescue
             albuterol/salbutamol HFA (90 mcg ex actuator) or equivalent or the patient's run-in
             MDPI. This included requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or emergency
             department (ED) visit or hospitalization or an increase in the patient's regularly
             prescribed nonsteroidal maintenance treatment. Urgent care/ED visits where the
             treatment was limited to a single dose of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol did not meet
             the criteria of an asthma exacerbation.

          7. The patient had no clinical visual evidence (on oropharyngeal examination) of
             oropharyngeal candidiasis.

          8. The patient did not experience an adverse event that would result in failure to
             continue to meet selection criteria.

          9. The patient did not use any of the prohibited concomitant medications during the run
             in period.

         10. The patient complied with completion of the daily diary, defined as follows:

               -  completion of AM and PM asthma symptom scores on 4 or more of the 7 days
                  immediately preceding the RV.

               -  completion of rescue medication use (whether used or not) on 4 or more of the 7
                  days immediately preceding the RV.

               -  completion of AM peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements on 4 or more of the 7
                  days immediately preceding the RV.

               -  recording of AM and PM asthma inhalation therapy use on 4 or more of the 7 days
                  immediately preceding the RV.

        <title>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences (TEAE) During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

        <title>Participants With Positive Swab Test Results for Oral Candidiasis</title>
        <description>Oropharyngeal examinations for visual evidence of oral candidiasis were conducted at each visit by a qualified healthcare professional. Any visual evidence of oral candidiasis during the oropharyngeal exam was evaluated by obtaining and analyzing a swab of the suspect area.
This outcomes indicates how many participants had positive swab test results. The total number of participants who had oropharyngeal exams at each timepoint are specified in the timepoint field. Appropriate therapy was to be initiated immediately at the discretion of the investigator and was not to be delayed for culture confirmation. Participants with a culture-positive infection could continue participation in the study on appropriate anti-infective therapy, provided this therapy was not prohibited by the protocol.</description>

        <title>Analysis of 24-Hour Urine Cortisol Free Over the 26-Week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Samples for 24-hour urine cortisol were collected at baseline (Day 1, pretreatment), and Weeks 14 and 26. For participants requiring early termination (ET), this evaluation was performed at the ET visit. For participants requiring ET for safety reasons, the visit was not delayed in order to collect the 24-hour urine cortisol.
The analysis is based on a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) model with adjustment for visit, treatment, and a treatment*visit interaction. The urine cortisol result is log transformed prior to analysis and the results are back transformed after modeling. An unstructured covariance matrix is used in the MMRM model.</description>

        <description>Spirometry measurements were obtained before the AM dose of study drug for the randomization visit (Day 1), at each of the treatment visits and at the early termination visit if applicable. At each visit where FEV1 was assessed, the highest acceptable results from each session were recorded.
The analysis is based on a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with adjustment for baseline FEV1, sex, age, (pooled) investigational center, visit, treatment, and treatment-by-visit. An unstructured covariance matrix is used in the MMRM model.</description>
