  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies exist on patient performance in drive simulators especially around and after
      surgery. Recommendations concerning the ability to drive preoperatively are based on these
      studies, which generated their data using drive simulators. However, in all the datasets
      driving performance remains highly individual. Since a drive simulator is not readily
      available in normal general practitioner surgeries it would be helpful to have convenient
      clinical tests to evaluate a patients individual ability to perform an emergency stop. This
      study aims at evaluating different possibilities how such performance might be predicted.
      Patients with knee osteoarthritis and patients who have received total knee arthroplasty are
      tested clinically and their results are compared with the gold standard experiment - a drive
      simulator.
