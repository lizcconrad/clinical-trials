  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This global, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      atezolizumab in combination with other immune-modulating therapies in the treatment of
      selected advanced or metastatic malignancies. The atezolizumab plus ipilimumab arm (Arm A)
      will focus primarily on participants with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). The atezolizumab plus interferon alfa-2b arm (Arm B), plus pegylated interferon
      alfa-2a (PEG−interferon alfa-2a, Arm C), and atezolizumab plus PEG-interferon Alfa-2a plus
      bevacizumab (Arm D) will enroll participants with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      (RCC), metastatic NSCLC and melanoma. The atezolizumab plus obinutuzumab) (Arm E) will enroll
      participants with recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC). Atezolizumab will be administered as intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks (q3w).
