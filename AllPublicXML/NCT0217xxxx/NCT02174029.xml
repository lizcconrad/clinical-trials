  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a person is put on a breathing machine the investigators think that the breathing
      muscles can get weaker. The investigators are not sure how quickly this happens but in some
      people this leads to problems when they try to breathe on their own without the breathing
      machine. The diaphragm is at the bottom of a person's chest separating their lungs from what
      is in their belly and it is a very strong muscle. In fact, it is main muscle that one uses
      for breathing.

      An ultrasound machine is a painless way to see what is happening beneath the skin. It is safe
      and easy to do. Using an ultrasound the investigators are planning to measure how thick the
      diaphragm is and how much it changes while a person is on a breathing machine in the ICU.

      Getting a better understanding of this condition could lead to improved treatments that might
      help support patients who require a ventilator for breathing.

      The investigators hypothesis is that patients for whom the breathing machine is doing all of
      the work of breathing, will have their diaphragm thickness gradually decrease and changing to
      a breathing modem mode where they have to put in more effort the diaphragm thickness will
      start increasing again.

      The investigators propose to expand the investigators single-centre longitudinal pilot study
      into a complete study in which the investigators will use B-mode ultrasonography to evaluate
      daily changes in diaphragm thickness in all critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation
      (MV) until successful weaned from MV. The impact of patient age, co-morbidities, and the use
      of various modes of ventilation on diaphragm thickness will be assessed. Diaphragmatic
      thickness and its change from baseline will be evaluated as predictors of the need for a
      prolonged wean (&gt;7days).

      The investigators hypothesize that in patients on mandatory mode ventilation, diaphragmatic
      thickness will progressively decrease. Switching from mandatory to assisted breathing modes
      will correlate with increases in diaphragmatic thickness.
