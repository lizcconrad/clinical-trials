      Previous study found that lipid extract from hard-shelled mussel (HMLE) at a dose of 100mg/kg
      possessed strong anti-inflammatory activity by diminishing the hind paw swelling and
      arthritis index in rat model. In the present study, HMLE was processed to capsules under
      strict food safety supervision and patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA）were
      selected to examine whether supplementation with HMLE could improve clinical and laboratory
      parameters of disease activity. The validated disease activity score that include 28 joint
      counts and ESR (DAS28) and validated clinical disease activity index (CDAI) were primary
      outcome measure. Laboratory parameters including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α,PGE2 and COX-2
      were also measured to explore the mechanisms.

      In this randomized controlled design, patients continued receiving background medications
      (slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) without change
      and were assigned to two groups. The first group (G1) received daily four mussel oil capsules
      (containing 800mg mussel oil and 800mg corn oil) for first two months and two mussel oil
      capsules per day thereafter. The second group (G2) received corn oil capsules (400mg corn oil
      per capsule) according to the same regimen. All patients were asked to keep a 7-day food
      diary before intervention and during wk 12. Dietary energy and nutrient intake of each
      subject during the preexperimental and study period were assessed from the dietary records by
      using &quot;Diet Analysis&quot; software (Cao Aihong, Taiyuan, China). All the enrolled patients
      visited Zhejiang Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital in the morning following an overnight fast at
      baseline and 3-month intervals, and underwent anthropometric measurements including height,
      body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, heart rate and blood pressure. Then
      clinical evaluations were performed during face-to-face interview by a professional attending
      doctor and ten milliliter of peripheral venous blood was drawn. Serum and erythrocyte samples
      were also promptly processed and frozen at -80℃ until analysis.

    <description>The validated disease activity score that include 28 joint counts and ESR (DAS28) were primary outcome measure. DAS28 was calculated as the formula: DAS28=[0.56*sqrt（T28）+0.28*sqrt（SW28）+0.70*Ln（ESR）]*1.08+0.16.
T28: Tender joint count; SW28: Swollen joint count; ESR: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
T28 and SW28 were determined by a professional doctor who was blind to the patient groups and ESR (Westergreen's method) was analyzed on Monitor 20 (VITAL Diagnostics, Italy).</description>
