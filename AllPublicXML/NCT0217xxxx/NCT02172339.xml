        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects:

               1. Subject with normal renal function ( creatinine clearance of 80% of predicted
                  creatinine clearance in healthy volunteers), as confirmed by normal physical
                  examination including vital signs, ECG and laboratory values

                  Calculated creatinine clearance (male);

                  = ((140 - age(yr)) x (Wt (kg))) / (72 x predicted serum creatinine (mg/dL))

                  Calculated creatinine clearance (female);

                  = ((140 - age(yr)) x (Wt(kg))) / (85 x predicted serum creatinine (mg/dL))

               2. Subject with impaired renal function must be of age related good health and
                  without clinically significant abnormalities as assessed during the physical
                  examination. Mildly impaired renal patients were defined as those with creatinine
                  clearance of 40 - 80% of predicted creatinine clearance; moderately impaired
                  renal patients were defined as those with creatinine clearance of 10 - 40% of
                  predicted creatinine clearance. Laboratory values of subjects with renal
                  impairment could have been outside the normal range if the deviations were due to
                  the underlying renal disease.

          2. Male or female, age between 40 and 70 years with normal body - weight index (+/- 25%,
             Broca-index)

          3. Subjects with normal 12 - lead ECG recording

          4. Subjects with normal physical examination

          5. Subjects with normal clinical and laboratory tests (except for indicators of renal
             impairment)

          6. Female of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test

          7. All subjects must have a negative HIV-Ab test and negative Hepatitis B test

          8. All subjects must have a negative drug screening

          9. All subjects must sign a written informed consent prior to enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a history of more then moderate alcohol consumption (more than 1 litre
             of beer per day or the equivalent amount of alcohol in any other alcoholic beverage,
             approximately 50 g of alcohol per day). 24 hours before dosing and 24 hours post
             dosing, alcohol was not permitted

          2. Present or past participation in a drug detoxification program

          3. Smokers

          4. Subjects requiring any concomitant medication not compatible with this study

          5. Subjects with hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg, diastolic less
             than 60 mmHg) or hypertension (systolic blood pressure more than 165 mmHg or diastolic
             more than 100 mmHg) under adequate medication

          6. Subjects who participated in a clinical trial of any other investigational drug within
             two months prior to the start of this study

          7. Pregnant or lactating women or women of child bearing potential not using a medically
             approved means contraception. (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm)

          8. Subjects who donated blood within three months prior to the start of the study

          9. Subjects with a history of chronic or recurrent convulsive disorders or ongoing
             hepatic dysfunction

         10. Subjects with ongoing acute systemic illness or recovery from acute systemic illness

         11. Subjects with a history of cancer within the last five years

         12. Subjects with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs

         13. Subjects with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction

         14. Subjects with known narrow-angle glaucoma
