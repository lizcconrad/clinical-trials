      A non-randomized, multi-site feasibility study to evaluate the safety of the Glyder Device in
      subjects with a history of lumbar facet joint disease (L2 to the sacrum) and successful
      neural ablation in which the facet joint is confirmed as the source of pain.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed bilateral facet joint disease demonstrated by a successful facet rhizotomy
             (neural ablation) within 18 months prior to enrollment

          2. Facet pain is limited to one to two levels from L2 to the sacrum and pain is bilateral

          3. Two diagnostic injections (MBBs) both resulting in 80% relief to confirm back pain is
             facetogenic

          4. VAS back pain of ≥ 60 mm on a 100 mm scale, and VAS back pain is greater than or equal
             to the highest VAS leg pain score

          5. ODI ≥ 20 points

          6. At least six (6) months of non-operative conservative management (Analgesic therapy
             for a minimum of 2 weeks and a minimum of 4 weeks of NSAID therapy; Supervised
             exercise and/or physical therapy program-minimum of 12 sessions)

          7. At least 22 years of age and skeletally mature

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pain is from a spinal structure other than facet joints (i.e., disc, hip and SI joint
             pain are excluded)

          2. Osteoporosis or severe osteopenia

          3. Lumbar fusion

          4. Symptomatic spinal stenosis requiring surgical intervention

          5. Prior total disc replacement, fusion, decompressive laminectomy, facetectomy, or
             placement of a posterior spinous process device

          6. Disc herniation requiring surgical intervention

          7. The subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of greater than 35

          8. Planned elective surgery within 12 months
