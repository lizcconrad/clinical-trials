    <textblock>
      The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one of common clinical critically diseases.
      In the United States, the incidence of ARDS reaches 31%, which is one of the main causes of
      death in patients. There is no unified treatment process for ARDS currently and the treatment
      measures are not yet standardized, so the standardization of ARDS treatment processes is
      needed to reduce mortality in patients. Following the evidence-based medicine principles and
      six-step treatment standards of ARDS, this study uses the method of multi-center randomized
      controlled clinical trials to evaluate the standardized treatment process of ARDS, which
      provides the basis for the standardized treatment of ARDS.
