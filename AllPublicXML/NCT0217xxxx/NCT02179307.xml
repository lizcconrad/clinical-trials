  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The literature is not clear as to which training volume to employ during initial phases of
      resistance training programs to ensure optimal muscular adaptations. The purpose of this
      study is therefore to compare effects of strength training with low versus moderate volume on
      muscular function and hypertrophy in previously untrained, healthy individuals. Furthermore,
      the investigators will relate individual variation in responses to proxy markers of
      individual training state, such as baseline muscular function and muscle fiber type.

      The study will include 25 women and 25 men and will consist of a 12-week resistance training
      protocol. Each study participant will act as their own control, performing both the low-
      (1-set) and the moderate-volume (3-sets) protocol, allocated to either the dominant or
      non-dominant leg, in a stratified and randomized fashion.

      Primary outcome measures are thigh muscle cross section area and unilateral knee extension
      strength. Additionally, muscle fiber type composition will be evaluated as well as additional
      parameters of muscular function.

      The primary hypothesis is that low-volume protocols will be beneficial for individuals with
      glycolytic muscle phenotypes, whereas the opposite will be true for individuals with more
      aerobic phenotypes.
