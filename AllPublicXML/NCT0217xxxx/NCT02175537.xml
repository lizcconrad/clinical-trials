  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to pilot-phase test the effectiveness of the microclinic social
      induction model and its effects on behavioral and metabolic outcomes in different levels of
      social and familial relationships in Qatar. The investigators novel microclinic model is
      based on the principle that both healthy and unhealthy behaviors spread through preexisting
      social networks. A microclinic is a small group of approximately 2-8 friends or family
      members who are taught to modify their own behaviors as well as the behaviors of those around
      them, with a particular focus on the four &quot;M's&quot;: Meals, Movement, Monitoring, and Medication.
      More than social support groups or peer-to-peer interventions, the microclinic model is
      unique in its focus on the long-term propagation of healthy behaviors throughout a
      participant's entire social network. Qatar is uniquely positioned (with its central
      geographic location in the Gulf region and its leadership in science and education) to
      spearhead a regional intervention focused on managing and preventing diabetes in the Gulf
      region.

      This pilot study, &quot;Microclinic Social Induction Intervention for Diabetes and Obesity
      Management in Qatar,&quot; is a two-arm randomized controlled trial of a 7-week condensed
      intervention to evaluate the efficacy of the microclinic social induction model on
      propagating lifestyle changes and in improving glycemic and metabolic control in Doha, Qatar.

      The microclinic social induction model leverages different levels of social and familial
      relationships to positively influence behaviors relating to diabetes and other metabolic
      conditions through small treatment units called 'microclinic groups,' consisting of 2-8 peers
      and family members of the same social network. The intervention model brings microclinic
      groups to a larger classroom network (~25 people/class) where each class shares access to a
      culturally salient diabetes educational curriculum and group support to promote health
      behavior changes such as improvement in diet, exercise, medication adherence, and blood
      pressure management to then influence better glycemic and metabolic control.
