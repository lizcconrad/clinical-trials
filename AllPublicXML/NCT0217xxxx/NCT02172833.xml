    <textblock>
      Over the past few decades, a good number of studies with regard to coagulopathy and increased
      bleeding tendency which is defined as macro- or microscopic hemorrhage, declination of
      hemoglobin level, thrombocytopenia, and hypoprothrombinemia potentially caused by the use of
      antibiotics through a variety of suggested mechanisms, including myelosuppression,
      immune-mediated destruction of thrombocytes and coagulation factors, and suppression of
      vitamin K epoxide reductase or vitamin K-dependent Î³-glutamate carboxylase which may lead to
      inhibition of biosynthesis of coagulation factor II, VII, IX, and X, have been reported or
      published. Nevertheless, many of them are case-series studies or case reports with low level
      of evidence, and there have been no large-scale retrospective cohort studies regarding
      antibiotic-associated coagulopathy being published. Moreover, in addition to exposure to
      antibiotics, there are several risk factors, including severity of illness, hepatic or renal
      function, nutrition status, comorbidities such as cancer and hematologic disease, surgery or
      other invasive procedure, concomitant use of anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and salicylates, and
      age, which may exert influence on the function of the coagulation system as well. Therefore,
      the study aims to clarify the association between the use of antibiotics and the increase of
      bleeding tendency or the development of bleeding event and to identify possible risk factors
      of the increase of bleeding tendency or the development of bleeding event in patients
      receiving antibiotic treatment through the application of nested case-control design and the
      usage of both the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and medical records in
      National Taiwan University Hospital during the time period from January, 1995 to December,
      2013.
