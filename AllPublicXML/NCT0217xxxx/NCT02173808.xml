      To evaluate the levonorgestrel (LNG) pharmacokinetic (PK) profile following injection of a
      single 20 mg dose of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I single center, open-label, single dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      study of an injectable formulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) jointly developed by the
      National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and CONRAD, and manufactured
      by Coldstream Laboratories, Inc. Healthy normal weight and obese women will be followed as
      outpatients for up to eight months. During this study, subjects will undergo a screening
      cycle to confirm normal ovulatory function, and then receive active treatment with a single
      injection of LB. They will undergo frequent evaluations to obtain serum samples to evaluate
      drug levels and ovulatory function, as well as transvaginal ultrasound and cervical mucus
      evaluation at selected visits. Follow up will continue until normal ovulatory cycles resume.
      Based upon detailed studies in non-human primates, it is expected that most subjects will
      resume menstrual cyclicity within 12- 26 weeks following the injection. Subjects will
      continue to be followed for one normal cycle after return of menses. This study will be
      conducted by the NICHD at one of the Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) sites
      (Oregon Health &amp; Science University, (OHSU)) in the USA and will enroll approximately 16
      women.

      This study will enroll approximately 16 subjects that demonstrate favorable cervical mucus
      and normal ovulatory function during a baseline cycle. Enrollment will be stratified to
      ensure that 50% of the subjects have a BMI &gt;32 kg/m2 and &lt;40 kg/m2 and approximately 50% of
      subjects have a BMI &lt;32 kg/m2.

    <description>PK profile will be assessed in terms of the pharmacodynamics profile that correlates with the goal of reversible female contraception. For each subject and for the low and high BMI groups, the primary endpoint will be the time to return of ovulation based on two consecutive serum progesterone &gt;3 ng/L or a single progesterone &gt;10 ng/L.</description>

          5. Pap test within the last 12 months or undergo a Pap test at screening prior to
             enrollment. If a potential subject states that she has had a Pap test within the last
             12 months, then she will need to provide documentation of acceptable test results

          6. Cervical mucus score of &gt;7, which is based on the modified Insler scoring system
             during the screening cycle. The cervical mucus is collected by aspiration and the
             assessment is based on the modified Insler scoring system (the volume and pH of the
             mucus are not included in the total scoring) yielding a total possible score of 12 (3,
             4)

          7. Regular menstrual cycles that occur every 24 - 35 days

               1. If subject is postpartum or post-abortal (with abortion in second trimester), she
                  will be required to have two normal menstrual cycles prior to screening

               2. If subject had an abortion in the first trimester, she will be required to have
                  at least one menstrual cycle (two menses) prior to screening

          8. Heterosexually abstinent or, if heterosexually active, must have undergone previous
             tubal sterilization, be in monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, or

          7. Undiagnosed vaginal discharge or vaginal lesions or abnormalities. Subjects diagnosed
             at screening with a Chlamydia or gonococcus infection may not be included in the trial
             unless they are treated and proof of cure is documented after treatment (i.e. repeat
             test with negative results). In accordance with PI/medical designee assessment and
             local standards of practice, women with a history of genital herpes can be included if

             their risk for cardiovascular (CVD) and thromboembolism

         16. Current or past deep vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders

         17. History of known thrombophilia in a first-degree relative &lt;45 years of age suggesting
             familial defect in blood coagulation system, which in the opinion of the principal
             investigator, suggests use of a hormonal contraceptive could pose a significant risk

         18. Cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease or increased risk for arterial thrombosis

         19. History of retinal vascular lesions, unexplained partial or complete loss of vision

             Investigator's judgment

         27. Participation in another clinical trial involving an investigational drug or device
             within last 30 days (prior to screening)

         28. Use of liver enzyme inducers within last 90 days (prior to screening) or intention to
             use liver enzyme inducers during the study

         30. Women at high risk of contracting HIV, e.g. women with multiple sex partners who need
             to use condoms consistently, injection drug users. Women enrolled in the study, who
             use condoms to protect against STIs or pregnancy, should be instructed that they can
             use condoms that are pre-lubricated with spermicide or lubricated, but they cannot use
             a spermicide applied separately and they should record all condom use in their diaries

         31. Women who use any medications on the Exclusionary Medication List OR used any within
             the past three months prior to the screening visit

         33. Have issues or concerns (in the judgment of the investigator) that may compromise the
             safety of the subject or confound the reliability of compliance and information
