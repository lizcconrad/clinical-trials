  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic technique that takes pictures of organs of
      the body. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves that cannot be felt. Perfusion MRI uses
      faster imaging. It also includes a contrast material that is given by vein. This makes
      specific organs, blood vessels, or tumors easier to see. Diffusion MRI lets us measure the
      motion of water in the tumor.

      Perfusion and diffusion MRI give extra information which is not available with the regular
      MRI. A regular MRI only shows pictures of the tumor. Thyroid MRI scans are not part of the
      current standard of care. The purpose of this study is to see if new MRI methods can give us
      more information about the tumor.

      The aim of this pilot study clinical trial is to provide MRI biomarkers as quantitative
      (surrogate) biomarkers of aggressiveness in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) including PMCs and
      to lay out the scientific basis for their translation into patient management. In this study
      we will perform specially designed diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and dynamic contrast agent
      MRI (DCE-MRI) protocols in the PTC patients.

      DW-MRI allows for quantifying water diffusion which has been shown to be related to tumor
      cellularity (29). Particularly, appropriate modeling with DW-MRI data acquired at multiple b
      values will enable quantifying tumor cellularity and vascularity simultaneously (30-32).
      DCE-MRI with proper compartmental modeling will yield metrics related to tumor-vessel
      permeability, tumor perfusion, and extracellular-extravascular volume fraction (33, 34).
      These facts provide the potential of DW-MRI and DCE-MRI metrics as quantitative imaging
      biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness in PTCs. The DW-MRI and DCE-MRI may ultimately help in
      personalized management approach, in which imaging biomarkers may be used to recommend either
      immediate surgery or active surveillance for PTC patients.
