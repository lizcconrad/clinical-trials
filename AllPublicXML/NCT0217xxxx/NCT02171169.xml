      The purpose of this retrospective data review is to evaluate the health economic drivers and
      complications of two surgical procedures: transsacral lumbar interbody fusion and
      transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion when used in conjunction with bilateral supplemental
      screw fixation as an adjunct to fusion. Devices used in both systems are cleared for use and
      comply with US regulations and requirements.

      Study Objective:

      The study objective is to demonstrate via retrospective data review the relative value of two
      lumbar fusion procedures: transsacral lumbar interbody fusion and the transforaminal lumbar
      interbody fusion when used in conjunction with bilateral supplemental screw fixation as an
      adjunct to fusion. Subject candidates are those who had required fusion at L5-S1 where this
      was the only lumbar level treated for spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or degenerative
      disc disease (DDD).

      Consecutive subjects who were treated with the transsacral lumbar interbody fusion or
      transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion procedure at least 1 year (- 2 months) prior to the
      date the data is collected will be evaluated.

      Study Design, Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoint:

      Safety: Incidence of reported adverse events, including those requiring medical intervention,
      by 3 months post-operative.

      Secondary Endpoints:

      Health Economic: Operative measures, including the direct and surrogate measurement of
      estimated blood loss, anesthesia time, transfusions, length of surgery and time to hospital
      discharge, as applicable.

      Health Economic: Comparative hospital data (from time of admission through time of discharge)

      Clinical Effectiveness: A decrease in back pain compared to baseline at 3 months (+/-2 weeks)
      as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

      Clinical Effectiveness: A decrease in disability compared to baseline at 3 months (+/-2
      weeks) as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).

      Study Design, Enrollment:

      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in this study, 100 subjects who have been treated
      with transsacral lumbar interbody fusion and 100 subjects who have been treated with
      transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion.

      Study Design, Analyses:

      The retrospective clinical evaluation will collect and compare results for the procedure
      transsacral lumbar interbody fusion versus transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as defined
      by the primary and secondary endpoints.

             procedure with bilateral supplemental screw fixation (e.g. pedicle screws, anterior
             devices with screw anchoring, anterior lumber plates) as an adjunct to fusion at L5-S1
