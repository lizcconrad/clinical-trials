  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain can be severe after liver resection surgery. However, postoperative pain
      management may be difficult for this group of patients. Opioidergic neurotransmission may be
      altered in cirrhotic patients and selectively increasing receptor affinity for opioids. Large
      dose of strong opioid may be required to achieve adequate pain control. However, this may not
      be possible due to the side effect of opioid and liver dysfunction after liver resection.

      Propofol is a commonly used anaesthetic with rapid recovery and less side effects and TIVA
      (total intravenous analgesia) with propofol is a common technique now. The reduction on
      certain serum pro- inflammatory cytokines may lead to more smooth post- surgical recovery.

      Recent case report proved the analgesic effect of propofol infusion. However other animal and
      clinical studies showed controversial result.

      The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the postoperative analgesic effects and
      side effects of intraoperative TIVA with propofol in patient undergoing liver resection
      surgery at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong between 2010 to 2012.

      Retrospective audit.

      Anaesthetic records and acute pain service records of patient undergone liver resection
      surgery between 2010 to 2012 in Queen Mary Hospital would be retrieved from the computer.

      Data Collection

        1. Demographic data;

        2. Types of analgesic techniques;

        3. Type of pain relief modalities;

        4. Pain score up to 72 hours postoperatively;

        5. Postoperative opioid consumption;

        6. Incidence of adverse events during APS care;

        7. Patients' satisfaction on pain relief.

      Data Analysis For summarising analysis, mean or median with standard deviation or
      interquartile range will be reported. Parametric and non-parametric comparative tests will be
      used for analysis between/among patients with various characteristics. Kaplan Meier survival
      analysis and log-rank test will be used for duration of APS use.
