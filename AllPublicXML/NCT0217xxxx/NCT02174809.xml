  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excess weight gain in pregnancy is linked to a number of adverse outcomes for mothers and
      their offspring, and in 2011, 59 % of women in Nova Scotia gained weight in excess of
      recommendations. A number of factors influence how much weight a woman gains, including lack
      of knowledge, age, the number of previous pregnancies she's had, smoking, ethnicity, income,
      and education. Although a clinician's advice also plays a role, simply giving advice does not
      necessarily translate into patient behaviour change. On the other hand, advice that is given
      through a patient-centred approach is significantly associated with increased patient
      acceptance of and adherence to recommendations, and increased intentions and attempts at
      behaviour change. In addition, this approach has been shown to decrease costs to the health
      care system. Patient-centredness can measured from the perspective of the clinician, an
      observer, or the patient. Research suggests that the patient's perspective of
      patient-centredness is the perspective most significantly associated with improved health
      outcomes.

      Clinicians avoid discussing weight-related matters for a number of reasons, including a lack
      of time and general discomfort in raising the subject. There are some tools that can address
      some of these barriers, and example being the &quot;5As of Obesity Management&quot;. This tool is based
      on principles of behaviour change science and patient-centredness. Pilot data on the use of
      this tool showed a two-fold increase in the initiation of weight-related discussions between
      clinicians and their patients. Our team was instrumental in the development, dissemination
      and initial evaluation of this tool, and Dr. Piccinini-Vallis has recently led a national
      multidisciplinary endeavor to adapt it to pregnancy, which has resulted in the &quot;5As of
      Healthy Pregnancy Weight Gain&quot; tool. It is now time to evaluate whether the use of this tool
      is acceptable to clinicians and whether its use translates into any patient outcomes.
