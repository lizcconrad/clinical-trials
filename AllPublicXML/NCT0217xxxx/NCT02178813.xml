  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of high-dose minocycline
      in the patient population undergoing carotid revascularization procedures, namely carotid
      endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS). Establishment of safety will
      facilitate proceeding to a phase II trial.

      During this trial, patients undergoing carotid revascularization procedures will receive high
      doses of minocycline with the following schedule (based on previous trials):

        -  Day prior to procedure: 800mg orally (p.o), 700mg p.o.

        -  Day of procedure: 600mg intravenously( i.v.), 500mg p.o.

        -  Day after procedure: 400mg p.o., 400mg p.o.

      The levels of the drug in the plasma, standard blood tests (complete blood count, creatinine,
      liver function tests) as well as markers of neuronal injury (Neuron specific enolase,
      protein- S100b) and inflammation (C-reactive protein) will also be monitored. The patients
      will be monitored closely for the development of side effects from minocycline.

      MRI imaging will be used to follow the development of small strokes as a result of the
      revascularization procedures and their resolution. The patients of this study, all receiving
      peri-operative minocycline, will be compared with historical controls with regards to
      development of small strokes and persistent of these strokes on subsequent MRI imaging.

    <description>The primary aim of this phase I study is to establish the safety and tolerability of this drug in patient population undergoing carotid revascularization procedures by monitoring complete blood counts, liver enzymes, renal function tests, and clinical side effects
During the above time frame (one day prior to procedure until 1 day after the procedure) the number of patients that develop any side effects requiring discontinuation of the drug will be noted.
Side effects that will lead to discontinuation of the drug are the following:
The patient reports a clinical side effect as intolerable (nausea /vomiting, dysphagia, rash, vertigo or other side effects attributable to the administration of minocycline)
Change in liver function tests ( 2 times elevation of alanine-aminotransferase above the normal range)
Change in renal function tests (creatinine more than 1.5 points from baseline)</description>

    <description>Secondary Aim 1:To examine the effect of perioperative treatment with minocycline on the number and overall volume of new neurologic ischemic lesions detected by Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) within 24 hours following carotid revascularization, and on the conversion of these acute lesions to persistent changes on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a clinical indication for carotid revascularization (CRV) as decided by
             the treating physicians (the clinical indications for CRV as well as the choice of the
             type of CRV, either CEA or CAS, will be entirely up to the treating physicians)

          2. Patients who can perform the neurocognitive tests in English

          3. Women of childbearing age who are non-lactating and have a negative pregnancy test

          4. Patients in the age range of 18 years - 90 years

          5. Patients able to undergo MRI imaging.

          6. Patients that are dependable and able to return for follow-up studies and exams.

          7. Patients that will be in the hospital (inpatients) the day prior to the procedure for
             clinical purposes (for evaluation of side effects from the first dose and for
             overnight infusion of minocycline before the procedure)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines

             mono-paresis (motor strength equal or less than 3/5) or neglect.

          3. Baseline abnormalities on the MRI of the brain which would preclude the detection of
             new DWI or FLAIR changes. (e.g large areas of acute stroke, large areas of previous
             encephalomalacia, existing hardware such as aneurysm clips or coil masses etc.)

          4. Patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or lactating.

          5. Patients with a contraindication to undergo MRI, including those with pacemakers,
             metal implants and metal fragments within their bodies.

             renal or pulmonary disease).We will screen for physical and mental capacity to undergo
             study procedures and will obtain proxy consent for subjects who appear decisionally
             impaired. The screening process will be performed by the physician co-investigator
             obtaining the informed consent.

         11. Patients with a Mini-Mental Status Exam score (MMSE) of less than 21 (as determined by
             one of the co-investigators). Patients with MMSE score of 21 will be included.

             identification, or patients who are undecided about participation less than 36 hours
             prior to the procedure will not be eligible for the study.

         13. Patients with any other factor that would make follow-up studies difficult (e.g
             patient is from another country, or patient is a prisoner)
