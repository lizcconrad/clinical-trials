  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial will test the hypothesis that inhibition of c-kit signalling pathways in
      pediatric patients with Neurofibromatosis Type I(NF-1) and progressing plexiform neurofibroma
      will result in objective reduction and/or inhibition of plexiform neurofibromas progression.

      This will be a Phase II study of imatinib mesylate given orally. Patients with stable or
      responding disease may receive the drug for a period not exceeding one year.

      Clinical objectives

        1. Demonstrate the clinical benefit of imatinib in a pediatric patient population with
           progressing and metabolically active plexiform neurofibromas (NF)

        2. Demonstrate the need or not to pursue treatment for more than a year in responders to
           imatinib

      Biological studies objectives

        1. Identify biological markers of plexiform neurofibroma progression and response to
           treatment

        2. Identify biological markers of mast cell responses to imatinib, given that mast cells
           are required for tumorigenesis and are a target for imatinib

      Imaging studies objectives

      Using 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET/CT):

        1. Identify imaging characteristics of progressing plexiform neurofibromas

        2. Assess the role of F18-FDG PET/CT in comparison with CT/MRI to evaluate response to
           imatinib ¸

      Pharmacological study

        1. Evaluate trough plasma levels of imatinib and its active metabolite (NDMIL N-desmethyl
           imatinib) achieved in this pediatric population

        2. Identify potential correlation between imatinib (and NDMI) trough levels achieved and
           clinical response

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age Greater than or equal to 2 years and up to 21 years of age at time of study
             enrolment

          2. Diagnosis Patients with NF1 and an inoperable plexiform NFs that has the potential to
             cause significant morbidity.

          3. Patients must have measurable disease by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
             progressive plexiform neurofibroma(s) with or without clinical symptoms.

               -  Patients must have a recent FDG-PET scan imaging study done in the last 3 months
