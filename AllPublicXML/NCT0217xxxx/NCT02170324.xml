    <textblock>
      Adipose tissues, which include white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT),
      play an essential role in regulating whole-body energy homeostasis. Excess expansion of WAT
      due to positive energy balance and defects in thermogenic gene expression in BAT are
      associated with obesity and various metabolic diseases. Until 2009 the question of whether
      adult humans had BAT and whether it could conceivably contribute to whole body energy usage
      in a meaningful way was a matter of vigorous debate. The publication of three apppers in the
      New England Journal of Medicine that demonstrated adult humans do have BAT, that it can be
      activated, and that this activation appears to be defective in obesity reframed the debate,
      and revived interest in BAT physiology. Recent studies also reveal the presence of a subset
      of cells in WAT that could be induced by environmental or hormonal factors to become
      ''brown-like'' cells, and this ''beigeing'' process has been suggested to have strong
      antiobesity and antidiabetic benefits.

      The extrapancreatic actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on endothelial cells and the
      liver have been reported. Additionally, effects of GLP-1 on adipose tissue have been
      described. Studies performed in isolated adipocytes have demonstrated that GLP-1 has the
      ability to induce both lipogenic and lipolytic mechanisms in white adipose tissue (WAT) .
      More recent study showed that GLP-1 agonism stimulates brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and
      browning through hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in animal. However, there
      is no data clearly show that GLP-1 agonism stimulates browning of subcutaneous white adipose
      tissue (SWAT) in human obesity.

      Individuals were treated for 10 days. Biopsy for subcutaneous white adipose (1.5X1.5X1.5cm)
      was performed before and after 10 days treatment programme under local anesthesia. Measure
      the brown fat characteristics of biopsy samples.The sample was immediately processed in 3
      sections.One part was stored for immunohistology and western blot, the second was snap-frozen
      for estimation of biochemical markers, and the remainder was used to harvest small
      subcutaneous arteries with micro-dissection. Also, the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) was
      studied on the changes of morphology and possible signal pathways before and after GLP-1
      treatment.

    <description>Brown fat characteristics of biopsy samples will be assessed by determining the expression levels of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-r, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor r coactivator 1 a (PGC1a) , growth factor receptor binding protein-10 (Grb10), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16); In addition, a combination of PET and computed tomography (CT) â€” with the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) as a tracer will be performed for brown adipose tissue before and after GLP-1 agonism treatment programme.</description>
