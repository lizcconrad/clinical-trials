    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to confirm that chronic dosing of 20 mcg and 40 mcg of
      ipratropium bromide, administered via the RESPIMAT device, demonstrates clinical
      comparability and similar safety profiles to the 36 mcg dose of ATROVENT® Inhalation Aerosol
      (containing chlorinated fluorocarbons (CFC)) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). The efficacy and safety profiles of the two doses administered via the
      RESPIMAT device will also be compared to their respective placebo groups

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric
             criteria:

               -  Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with
                  a FEV1 =&lt; 65% of predicted normal and FEV1 =&lt; 70% of FVC

          2. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older

          3. Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten packs-years. A pack-year is
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year

          4. Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests and maintain records during
             the study period, as required in the protocol

          5. Patients must be able to be trained in the proper use of an inhalation aerosol and the
             Respimat device

          6. All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial
             i.e., at least 24 hours prior to screening (Visit 1)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease, which in the opinion of the investigator, may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study

          2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the
             patient is excluded

          3. All patients with a serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase &gt; 80 U/L, serum
             glutamate pyruvate transaminase &gt; 80 U/L, bilirubin &gt; 34.2 µmol/L or creatinine &gt;
             176.8 µmol/L will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory
             evaluation will not be conducted in these subjects

          4. Patients who have a blood eosinophil count &gt;= 0.6 GI/L. A repeat eosinophil count will
             not be conducted in these patients

          5. Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction

          6. Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure or
             patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy

          7. Patients with a history of cancer, other than treated basal cell carcinoma, within the
             last five years

          8. Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis

          9. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history of a thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion
             criterion #1

         10. Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy

         11. Patients with a history of and/or active alcohol or drug abuse

         12. Patients with known active tuberculosis

         13. Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in the past
             six weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period

         14. Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, or
             urinary retention

         15. Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma, or raised intra-ocular pressure

         16. Patients with current significant psychiatric disorders

         17. Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy

         18. Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium

         19. Patients who are being treated with antihistamines

         20. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day

         21. Patients who are being treated with beta-blocker medication

         22. Patients who have had changes in their therapeutic plan within the last six weeks
             prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1)

         23. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices or
             diaphragm with spermicide, or Norplant®)

         24. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs or any other components
             of the ATROVENT® Solution including Benzalkonium chloride and Edetic acid

         25. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives
             (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Visit (Visit 1)

         26. Previous participation in this study
