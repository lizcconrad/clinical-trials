      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the safety (that is, frequency of adverse events)
      and efficacy (that is, hemostatic effect, rate of rebleeding after confirmation of
      hemostasis) of administration of lansoprazole intravenous 30 milligram (mg) (Takepron
      Intravenous 30 mg ) to a large number of participants with acute stress ulcer or acute
      gastric mucosal lesion in daily medical practice.

      This survey was designed to evaluate the safety (that is, frequency of adverse events) and
      efficacy (i.e., hemostatic effect, rate of rebleeding after confirmation of hemostasis) of
      administration of lansoprazole intravenous 30 mg (Takepron Intravenous 30 mg) to a large
      number of participants with acute stress ulcer or acute gastric mucosal lesion in daily
      medical practice.

      For adults, 30 mg of lansoprazole is typically mixed in physiological saline (JP) or 5
      percent (%) glucose solution for injection (JP) and administered twice daily by drip infusion
      or dissolved in 20 mL of physiological saline (JP) or 5% glucose solution for injection (JP)
      and administered twice daily by direct slow intravenous injection.

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting One or More Adverse Drug Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse drug reactions are defined as adverse events (AEs) which are in the investigator's opinion of causal relationship to the study treatment. AEs are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product reported from the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Observed Hemostatic Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Hemostatic effect was categorized on the basis of degree of improvement as: markedly improved, moderately improved, slightly improved and poor in the participants with observed hemostatic effect. Efficacy rate was reported as percentage of participants showing efficacy and was calculated as the sum of percentage of number of participants reporting markedly improved + moderately improved + slightly improved divided by the percentage of total number of participants with observed hemostatic effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Hemostatic Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Hemostatic effect was categorized on the basis of degree of improvement as: markedly improved, moderately improved, slightly improved and poor in the participants with confirmed hemostatic effect by endoscopy. Efficacy rate was reported as percentage of participants showing efficacy and was calculated as the sum of percentage of number of participants reporting markedly improved + moderately improved + slightly improved divided by the percentage of total number of participants with confirmed hemostatic effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Hemostatic Effect Who Experienced Rebleeding During Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Rebleeding rate was reported as percentage of participants who experienced rebleeding after confirmed hemostasis by endoscopy during treatment with lansoprazole. It was calculated by dividing the percentage of the number of participants who experienced rebleeding after hemostasis divided by the total number of participants with confirmed hemostasis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Hemostatic Effect Who Experienced Rebleeding After the Completion of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 17 (8 weeks after the last dose of study drug)</time_frame>
    <description>Rebleeding rate was reported as percentage of participants who experienced rebleeding after confirmed hemostasis by endoscopy and was calculated at 8 weeks after the completion of treatment with lansoprazole. It was calculated by dividing the percentage of the number of participants who experienced rebleeding after hemostasis divided by the total number of participants with confirmed hemostasis.</description>
