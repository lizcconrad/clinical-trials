    <textblock>
      The Intensive Dietary Counselling (IDC) intervention is a prevention and health promotion
      activity. It is being implemented by the Andalusian Health Service to reinforce basic
      intervention advice on healthy diet and exercise. The IDC intervention is aimed at the
      prevention of diseases of the heart and blood vessels (e.g. heart failure, heart attack and
      stroke).

      The main objective of the present study is to assess adherence to the IDC intervention and,
      consequently, its effectiveness on the prevention of the above mentioned diseases.
