      Introduction. Tension-type headache is a highly prevalent disorder with a significant
      socio-economic impact, affecting psychological aspects. This study aims to assess aspects
      pertaining to anxiety, depression, headache frequency and pain intensity.

      Subjects and methods. A clinical trial was conducted on 84 participants suffering from
      tension-type headache, divided into 4 groups, the mean age being 39.76 years (SD 11.38). The
      first group received suboccipital soft tissue treatment (ST); the second group was treated
      with articulatory technique (AT); the third group was applied a combination of both
      techniques (ST and AT) and a forth group which served as control group. Treatment sessions
      were administered during four weeks, with a post-treatment assessment, and follow-up after
      one month. The investigators conducted Repeated measures Analysis of Covariance (RM-MANCOVA)
      to evaluate the effect of treatment on between and within-subject conditions and their
      interaction on reported depression, anxiety, and headache pain frequency and intensity.

    <time_frame>Basline, week 4 and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>During the study, all subjects completed a weekly register of headaches, recording on a daily basis their intensity, using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which measures pain intensity in a 0-10 scale (0=no pain, 10=the most severe pain).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>All patients were assessed under the same conditions before the treatment, after the treatment (at 4 weeks), and at follow-up (after 8 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-SA and STAI-TA). Scores range from 0 to a maximum of 60 points; scoring above the 50th percentile indicates the presence of anxiety. For men, this percentile correlates with a score of 19 points, both for STAI-state and STAI-trait. For women, scores over 21 for STAI-state and 24 for STAI-trait determine this level.</description>

    <description>The suboccipital technique (ST) aims to release the spasm of the muscles affected in tension-type headaches and in general of suboccipital soft tissues, as they are responsible for the mobility dysfunction of the occiput-atlas-axis joint; this releases the facial restriction of this region.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>- The articulatory technique (AT) was administered to correct and restore the mobility of joints between occiput, atlas and axis - correcting a global joint dysfunction. This technique was performed in supine position, in the same manner as the preceding technique, bilaterally and in two phases.</description>

    <description>The suboccipital technique (ST) aims to release the spasm of the muscles affected in tension-type headaches and in general of suboccipital soft tissues, as they are responsible for the mobility dysfunction of the occiput-atlas-axis joint; this releases the facial restriction of this region. Patients lied on the stretcher, in supine position, with their occiput resting against the physiotherapist's hands. Fingertips slide until contacting the posterior arch of atlas so that it &quot;hangs&quot; from the fingers. A deep and progressive pressure is applied, perpendicularly to muscle fibers, until the therapist perceives that muscle tone decreases. Approximate duration of ST is 10 minutes and it is performed with patients' eyes closed because of the connection between craniocervical muscle tone and eye movements</description>

    <description>The articulatory technique (AT) was administered to correct and restore the mobility of joints between occiput, atlas and axis - correcting a global joint dysfunction. This technique was performed in supine position, in the same manner as the preceding technique, bilaterally and in two phases. First, a gentle head decompression is applied, followed by small circumduction searching for the joint barrier in rotation through selective tension. Second, the manipulation is performed by a cranial rotation towards the same side as the circumduction and around a vertical axis passing through the axis, without cervical flexion or extension and very little bending</description>
