      This clinical study aims to assess whether the benefits of using Leukosan Adhesive on trocar
      incisions are greater or equivalent to those provided by the standard therapy of
      transcutaneous sutures.

      In particular, it tests the long-term cosmetic result after 3 months, the safety and
      tolerance, as well as the practicality of treatment with Leuksan Adhesive.

      An open, randomised, controlled, prospective, single location, clinical study of women of
      ages between 18 and 60 years within the time span of March 2013 and April 2013.

      The medical devices compared were EU (European Union) approved market-ready products with
      relevant designation according to the legal requirements for medical devices and according to
      Council guideline 93/42/EWG dated 14th July.

      Leukosan Adhesive is a sterile, ultra high viscose adhesive for external skin closure. Due to
      the skin's moisture, this skin adhesive polymerizes within seconds into a flexible film
      firmly holding the edges of the wound together and protecting the wound itself.

      Premilene DSMP 24, 3/8 needle, thread 3/0 denier was used a a comparison. This suture
      material was the standard suture material used in the study centre.

    <description>The primary outcome was the satisfaction of the patients with the cosmetic result of the wound healing after 3 months. This was measured by a visual analogue scale. In order to validate this result, an additional known wound assessment instrument, an ordinal scaled index, was implemented and the assessment of independent assessors was called on.</description>
