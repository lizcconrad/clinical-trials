      After the placement of a central venous catheter in children, a routine chest X-ray will be
      performed in order to examine the correct position of the catheter. In this feasibility study
      the investigators intend to evaluate whether the ultrasound is as sufficient as the chest
      X-ray to verify the correct position of the central venous catheter in children with the
      purpose to prevent radiation on children in the future.

    <textblock>
      For punctures of a central vein in very small children, ultrasound is an useful tool which
      allows for exact examination of the relevant anatomy in order to visualize the target vessel,
      so as to facilitate the puncture in real-time. However, to ascertain the correct position of
      the central venous catheter (CVC), a chest X-ray is still the gold standard. The main
      disadvantage of the X-ray is the children's exposure to radiation. That's why the
      investigators intend to perform this study whether the ultrasound is as sufficient as the
      chest X-ray to verify the correct position of a central venous catheter in children.

    <measure>Diagnosis of the correct central venous catheter position.</measure>
    <time_frame>After all patients have been included (three months), all clips of each participant will be presented to three blind observers, classifying these clips for two times and outcome measure will be assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound imaging will be stored in mpeg format and deidentified for all examinations. The ultrasound movie will be split into five clips with a length of 5 seconds each (four clips with CVC not inserted but ultrasound head slightly moving and one clip with CVC in situ). The total of 110 clips is presented in random order to three blinded observers who classify these clips two times with a time gap of at least 2 weeks between the classifications.</description>

    <time_frame>At 30 to 60 minutes after central venous catheter insertion each participant will undergo chest ultrasound and chest X-ray.</time_frame>
    <description>The chest X-ray and ultrasound will be performed in the post anesthesia care unit to rule out a pneumothorax.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants and children aged between 0 and 8 years requiring a central venous catheter.
             The planned sample size is 20 subjects. The indication for a CVC, will be determined
             by the attending physician.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Infants (inclusive early and late preterm) and children aged between 0 and 8 years

          -  Necessity of a central venous catheter

          -  Written informed consent given by parents after being provided with detailed
             information about the nature, risks, and scope of the catheterization

          -  No legal incapacity and/or other circumstances rendering the parents unable to
             understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the catheterization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents refusal
