  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to investigate a possible drug-drug interaction between BI 10773 and
      metformin when co-administered as multiple oral doses. Therefore, the relative
      bioavailabilities of BI 10773 and metformin were determined when both drugs were given in
      combination compared with BI 10773 or metformin given alone.
