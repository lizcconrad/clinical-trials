        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male based upon a complete medical history, including the physical
             examination, regarding vital signs (blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead ECG
             measurement, and clinical laboratory tests. There is no finding deviating from normal
             and of clinical relevance. There is no evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant
             disease.

          -  Age ≥21 and ≤45 years

          -  BMI ≥18.5 and &lt;30 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR, and ECG measurements)
             deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

             neurological disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to the drug or its
             excipients) as judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (&gt;24 hours) within at least 1 month or less than
             10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to medication

          -  Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial based on the
             knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within 10 days prior to medication

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 2 months prior to
             medication

          -  Smoker (&gt;10 cigarettes or &gt;3 cigars or &gt;3 pipes/day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days as judged by the investigator

          -  Alcohol abuse (more than 40 g alcohol a day)

          -  Drug abuse

          -  Blood donation (more than 100 mL blood within 4 weeks prior to medication or during
             the trial)

          -  Excessive physical activities within 1 week prior to randomisation or during the trial

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of the study centre.

        The following exclusion criteria are specific for this study due to the known class side
        effect profile of ß2-mimetics:

          -  Asthma or history of pulmonary hyperreactivity

          -  Hyperthyrosis

          -  Allergic rhinitis in need of treatment

          -  Clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Paroxysmal tachycardia (&gt;100 beats per minute)
