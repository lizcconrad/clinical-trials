    <textblock>
      Introduction: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is considered to be the most important
      intracranial mechanism causing secondary injury in patients admitted after acute traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) and intracranial haemorrhage (ICB) including subarachnoid haemorrhage
      (SAH). Currently, ICP can be measured and monitored only using invasive techniques. The two
      ICP measurement methods available - intraventricular and intraparenchymal - require both a
      neurosurgical procedure in order to implant the catheter and probes within the brain. The
      invasiveness of current methods for ICP measurement limits the diagnoses reliability of many
      neurological conditions in which intracranial hypertension is a treatable adverse event. A
      reliable, accurate and precise non-invasive method to measure ICP would be of considerable
      clinical value, enabling ICP measurement without the need of a surgical intervention.

      Aim:

      The aim of this study is to validate a novel non-invasive ICP measurement device by comparing
      its measurement with the &quot;gold standard&quot; invasive ICP-measurement by intracranial probe. The
      device used in this study has been been developed in the Telematic Science Laboratory at the
      Kaunas University of Technology, Lithuania.

      Methods:

      The non-invasive ICP measurement method will be assessed prospectively using repeatable
      simultaneous non-invasive and invasive (standard with intracranial probe) ICP measurements on
      patients presenting with TBI and SAH. The device method is based on two-depth transcranial
      doppler (TCD) technique for simultaneously measuring flow velocities in the intracranial and
      extracranial segments of the ophthalmic artery (OA). The intracranial segment of the OA is
      compressed by ICP and the extracranial segment of the OA is compressed by the pressure Pe
      externally applied by the device. Two-depth TCD device is used as an accurate indicator of
      the balance point (Pe = ICP) when the measured parameters of blood flow velocity waveforms in
      the intracranial and extracranial segments of OA are identical. The device has the same
      ultrasound transmission parameters as existing TCD devices and meets all patient safety
      criteria.
