  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cold contact urticaria (CCU) is a frequent form of physical urticaria that is characterized
      by the development of wheal and flare type skin reactions due to the release of histamine and
      other proinflammatory mast cell mediators following exposure of the skin to cold. Typically,
      symptoms occur within minutes after cold contact, including exposure to cold air, liquids or
      objects and are limited to cold exposed skin areas.

      The investigators postulate that there is an overlap between acquired cold urticaria and
      cold-induced autoinflammatory syndromes, and that cold urticaria patients unresponsive to
      antihistamines will benefit from IL-1 targeting treatment strategies.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the IL-1 transfusion protein rilonacept
      in patients with cold contact urticaria who could not be successfully treated with first-line
      medication such as antihistamines.

      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group phase II study of the efficacy and
      safety of rilonacept in subjects with CCU. A total of 20 patients will be included by the
      Urticaria specialty clinics of ACC. The total duration of the study course for each patient
      is 14 weeks and is divided in:

        1. Screening period (2 weeks, days -14-0)

        2. Placebo-controlled double-blind phase (Part A, 6 weeks, days 0-42)

        3. Open label phase (Part B, 6 weeks, days 42-84) All eligible patients will be randomized
           (1:1 randomization) to one of two groups: 1) Rilonacept 160mg/week or 2) Placebo, and
           will receive the respective dose subcutaneously. Following the placebo-controlled
           double-blind phase patients will enter the open-label phase and receive rilonacept
           open-label treatment (160mg or 320mg depending on treatment response during part A).
