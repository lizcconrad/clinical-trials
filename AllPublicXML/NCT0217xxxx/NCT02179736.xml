      This is an open, non-comparative study to evaluate effectiveness and safety of Restylane in
      correction of nasolabial folds up to 12 months after the initial treatment, and to evaluate
      the safety of repeat treatment of the nasolabial folds 12 months after the initial treatment.

          -  WRSR 3-4

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Markedly indurate defects such as significant mid-face volume loss or prominent
             commissures.

          -  Active skin disease, inflammation or related conditions, such as infection, psoriasis
             and herpes zoster near or in the area to be treated.

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study product or
             anaesthesia used in the study.

          -  Concomitant anticoagulant therapy and therapy with inhibitors of platelet aggregation,
             (e.g. non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetylsalicylic acid, Omega 3 and Vitamin
             E) within 2 weeks prior to treatment, or a history of bleeding disorders.

          -  Concomitant treatment with chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, immunomodulatory
             therapy (e.g. monoclonal antibodies), systemic or topical (facial) corticosteroids.
             (Inhaled corticoids are allowed).

          -  Cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions in the treatment area.

          -  Subjects who have performed aesthetic facial surgery.

          -  Tissue augmenting therapy with non-permanent filler or neurotoxin below the lower
             orbital rim in the last 12 months.

          -  Facial laser treatment or chemical peeling below the lower orbital rim during the last
             6 months.

          -  Permanent implant or filler, including fat-injections, placed in the area to be
             treated.

             unsuitable for inclusion (e.g. a chronic, relapsing or hereditary disease that may
             affect the general condition or may require frequent medical treatment, psychiatric
             disorders or subjects not likely to comply to study procedures or to avoid other
             facial cosmetic treatments below the lower orbital rim).

          -  Subjects who are study site staff for this study, or close relatives (defined as
             parents, siblings, children or spouse) of the study site staff, as well as subjects
