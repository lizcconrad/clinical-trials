  <brief_title>MICARDIS® and Valsartan in Patients With Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension Using Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the trial was to compare the effect of telmisartan and valsartan in
      lowering ambulatory diastolic and/or systolic blood pressure in the last six hours of the
      dosing interval. Secondary variables included changes from baseline in diastolic and systolic
      blood pressures during other times during the 24-hour ABPM profile, changes from baseline in
      seated trough diastolic and systolic blood pressures as measured by manual cuff, and
      responder rates. Assessment of safety was also considered. Adverse events and use of
      concomitant therapies were monitored at each study visit. Blood pressure and heart rate were
      collected at each visit. Physical examination, electrocardiograms (ECG) and laboratory tests
      were completed during the trial as well.
