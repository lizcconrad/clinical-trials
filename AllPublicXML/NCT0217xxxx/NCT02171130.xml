  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to two hundred (200) adult patients with T1D aged 18 to 75 years will be selected for
      inclusion in the study. The target is to obtain treatment response and user-experience data
      following use of AMG504-1 in treating episodes of hypoglycemia. The population will be
      enriched to include participants who suffer from impaired hypoglycemia awareness.

      This study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of intranasal (IN) glucagon administered
      under clinical use conditions in treating episodes of hypoglycemia in persons with T1D.

      This study also aims to assess the ease with which caregivers can administer the experimental
      medication in treatment of hypoglycemic events.

      The study will also generate data on the patients' assessment of local tolerability and
      provide information on immunogenicity of AMG504-1 with regards to the potential development
      of anti-glucagon antibodies.
