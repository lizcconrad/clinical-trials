  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a growing problem worldwide and its prevention has become one of the leading
      priorities for the World Health Organisation. Obesity results from chronic imbalance between
      energy intake and energy expenditure. Although early prevention of obesity is preferable,
      surgical treatment is often required for severely obese people.

      Bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective therapy for severe obesity. Weight
      loss following bariatric surgery results in significant improvements in coexisting
      comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension but there is controversy whether bariatric
      surgery also improves aerobic capacity.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of bariatric surgery on
      cardiopulmonary function and on daily physical activity. It is hypothesized that bariatric
      surgery will improve aerobic capacity and result in beneficial lifestyle changes from
      sedentary to more active.
