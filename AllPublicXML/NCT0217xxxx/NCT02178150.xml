    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial which will start at June 2014 and end on
      June 2015 in Isfahan city. Serum insulin level is considered as a key variable and the sample
      size calculated 70 persons (35 persons for control group and 35 persons for patient group).
      Patient group will receive magnesium supplement (250 milligram) and the other group will
      receive placebo which is similar to the magnesium tablets in color, odor and appearance both
      for 8 weeks. All subjects will complete 4 physical activity and 4 dietary records. Outcome
      measurements including sex hormone levels, metabolic and inflammatory profiles will be
      measured at the beginning and end of the study as well as anthropetric measurements.
