    <textblock>
      This goal of this randomized controlled effectiveness trial is to compare the effectiveness
      of a peer-led health lifestyle intervention (Peer GLB) versus usual care services in
      supportive housing agencies in New York City and Philadelphia serving diverse clients with
      serious mental illness who are overweight or obese. The intervention follows the Group
      Lifestyle Balance curriculum derived from the Diabetes Prevention Program and that has been
      shown to help people achieve clinically significant weight loss (equal to or greater than 5%
      weight loss of initial weight). The intervention will be delivered by trained
      peer-specialists employed at the supportive housing agencies and supervised by the study
      team. Peer GLB is a 12-month group intervention that focuses helping people lose weight by
      improving people's diet and increasing their physical activity and consists of weekly core
      group sessions (3 mo.), bi-monthly transitional group sessions (3 mo.), and maintenance
      monthly sessions (6 mo.).

      We plan to enroll 300 clients with serious mental illness who are overweight/obese (BMI equal
      to or greater than 25) from our two supportive housing agencies. Clients will be randomized
      to either the Peer-led healthy lifestyle intervention or usual care conditions. The primary
      outcome for this study is achieving clinically significant weight loss (equal to or greater
      than 5% weight loss from baseline weight) at 12 and 18 months post randomization. The
      secondary outcomes for this study include overall reductions in weight, waist circumference,
      blood pressure, and improvements in physical activity, self-efficacy, recovery and
      health-related quality of life. Repeated assessments will be at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 month
      post randomization.

      Primary Hypothesis: Peer GLB participants will have a higher proportion of persons achieving
      clinically significant weight loss (equal to or greater than 5% weight loss) at 12 and 18
      months than UC participants.

      Secondary Hypothesis: At 6, 12, and 18 months post-randomization, there will be significant
      reductions in average weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and significant
      improvements in physical activity, self-efficacy, recovery, and health-related quality of
      life in Peer GLB compared to UC.
