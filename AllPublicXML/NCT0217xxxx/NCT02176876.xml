    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple
      infusions of GS-5745 in adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Participants will be
      randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive 1 intravenous (IV) infusion of GS-5745 or placebo every
      2 weeks, for a total of 3 IV infusions.

    <description>This composite endpoint will measure the plasma PK profile of GS-5745. The following parameters will be measured, where applicable:
Cmax: maximum observed concentration of drug in plasma
Tmax: time of Cmax
Clast: last observable concentration of drug
Tlast: time of Clast
AUClast: concentration of drug from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration
AUCinf: concentration of drug extrapolated to infinite time (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve extrapolated to infinite time)
AUCtau: concentration of drug over time (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing interval)
Ctau: observed drug concentration at the end of the dosing interval
λz: terminal elimination rate constant
CL: systemic clearance of the drug following intravenous administration
Vz: volume of distribution of the drug following intravenous administration</description>
