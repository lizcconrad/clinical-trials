  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy is a genetic disorder caused by maternal transmission
      of mitochondrial DesoxiroboNucleid Acid mutations. It is manifested by a rapidly progressive
      blindness, profound, due to atrophic optic nerve. The visual loss is primarily unilateral
      bilateralisation taking place in the vast majority of cases in weeks or months. The
      neuro-cardio-protective properties of cyclosporine (and its analogs specifically targeting
      the anti-apoptotic mechanisms) are particularly promising.

      The investigators hypothesis is that cyclosporine may limit apoptosis during the acute phase
      of the disease process and would limit the loss of visual acuity and improve the visual
      prognosis of these patients.
