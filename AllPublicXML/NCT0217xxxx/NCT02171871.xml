  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine changes in the respiratory system mechanics and in respiratory
      physiology after exposure of subjects to passive smoking. It is about healthy non-smoking
      volunteers and it will be carried out through the techniques of forced oscillation with
      Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) technique methodology and nitrogen washout.

      The present study will contribute to the understanding of passive smoking consequences on the
      respiratory system of healthy non-smokers. Thanks to the nitrogen washout technique, changes
      to closing volume and closing capacity will be examined during measurement in different
      positions (sitting, decubitus) together with exposure to passive smoking. With IOS
      methodology, changes in respiratory system resistance in four positions (standing, sitting,
      right and left lateral decubitus) will be evaluated before and after exposure to a passive
      smoking environment. Results of the present study are expected to provide interesting
      information on the changes in measured parameters not only in different positions but also
      after exposure to smoking.

      Methodology

      For the current study the following techniques will be used. Impulse Oscillometry (IOS)
      methodology constitutes a method of studying the respiratory system mechanics, during which
      the investigators manage to determine the flow resistance, the capacity resistance and the
      resonant frequency through the application of multifrequent signals. It also offers the
      possibility of studying the mechanics of central and peripheral respiratory system.

      The nitrogen washout technique is a method of indirect measurement of the functional residual
      capacity, during which exhaled nitrogen is measured after the subject has breathed oxygen of
      a 100% density. A single breath nitrogen washout contributes to the measurement of closing
      volume and closing capacity.

      Emitted particles, detected in a smoking environment, will be measured with the SIDEPAK
      AM510, which is a measurement device of particles based on their diameter.

      The research will be conducted according to the following procedure. Healthy non-smoking
      volunteers (18-40 years old) will be subject, after giving their brief medical history, to
      IOS and to the nitrogen washout test. The IOS will be conducted in four positions (standing,
      sitting, right and left lateral decubitus), whereas the nitrogen washout test in two (sitting
      and decubitus).

      Then the subject will be exposed to a smoking environment for 20 minutes, under a continuous
      measurement of emitted particles using the SIDEPAK AM510 in Pm level 2,5=250, in a closed
      space of 20 m3. The passive smoking environment will be achieved via a smoking machine.
      Afterwards, the subject will again undergo IOS in four positions (standing, sitting, right
      and left lateral decubitus) and nitrogen washout test in two positions (sitting and
      decubitus). Thanks to the above mentioned techniques, changes in measured parameters will be
      evaluated.
