      Primary Objective:

      To collect and analyze clinical data of Allergic Rhinitis patients' Total Nasal Symptom Score
      (TNSS) change after Dellegra internal use under high density pure Japanese cedar pollen
      exposure.

      Secondary Objective:

      To collect and analyze clinical data of Allergic Rhinitis patients' change in Total Symptom
      Score (TSS) and amount of nasal discharge, safety, and overall patients' impression about
      efficacy of Dellegra after Dellegra internal use under high density pure Japanese cedar
      pollen exposure.

          -  Positive radioallergosorbent test (RAST) for Japanese cedar pollen antigen (CAP-RAST
             class &gt;=2) within 1.5 years before the exposure test.

          -  Patients with Total Nasal Symptom Score of 8 or more, and nasal congestion scores of 2
             (moderate) or more at least 1 assessment point of 90 to 150 minutes after the start of
             the screening exposure.

          -  Age ≥20 and ≤65 years.

          -  Patients written informed consent.

          -  Patients with nasal diseases (hypertrophic rhinitis, paranasal sinusitis, nasal
             polyps, deviation of the nasal septum, etc.) or eye diseases that could interfere with
             judgment of the efficacy of Dellegra Combination Tablets.

          -  Patients with evidence of upper and/or lower respiratory tract inflammation (acute
             rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, congestive rhinitis, atrophic rhinitis, purulent nasal
             discharge, sinusitis in the presence of cold-like, etc.) on the day of treatment
             exposure.

          -  Patients who have taken any of the following medications that may affect the
             evaluation of Dellegra Combination Tablets (except for the use of topical preparation
             in which investigator/sub-investigator judged them not to affect the efficacy
             evaluation; the treated site is different, etc.):

          -  Patients who are considered by the investigator/sub-investigator to be unsuitable for
             enrollment in the study for any other criterion.

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to antihistamines or antihistaminic agent
             (fexofenadine HCI is included), and the pseudoephedrine hydrochloride.

          -  Patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease, narrow angle
             glaucoma, urinary retention, or those who have shown sensitivity to adrenergic agents
             (manifestations include insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, or arrhythmias).
