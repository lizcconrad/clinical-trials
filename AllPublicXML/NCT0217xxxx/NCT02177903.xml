  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of active warming to patients whether awake or under general anesthesia has
      been proven safe in numerous studies and it is common practice to use warmers. The warmers
      are commonly used with both the supplied blankets and also with hospital blankets.

      Subjects receiving standard care will not benefit from this study. Subjects in the
      investigational group may benefit in several ways:

        -  Increased comfort in the pre-operative period by being warmer

        -  Decreased incidence of mild hypothermia

        -  Possible decreased incidence of transfusion with less bleeding

        -  Possible decreased pain and discomfort in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)

        -  Possible shorter stay in the PACU and overall Length of Stay (LOS)

        -  Possible decreased risk for surgical site infection

    <description>The primary endpoint is duration of hypothermia as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). This is achieved by recording patient temperature readings continuously from baseline (prior to initiation of 30 minutes if active or passive pre-warming) until PACU discharge.</description>
