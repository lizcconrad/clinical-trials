    <textblock>
      Patients with PKAN will be treated with the iron chelator deferiprone for 18 months. Only
      patients who have completed the earlier study TIRCON2012V1 (a double-blind placebo-controlled
      trial in which participants were randomized to receive either deferiprone or placebo for 18
      months) are eligible to enroll.

    <textblock>
      TIRCON2012V1-EXT is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label study. All patients who completed
      the earlier study TIRCON2012V1 are eligible to take part. In the initial study, patients were
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 18 months of treatment with either the iron chelator
      deferiprone or placebo, respectively. In this extension study, all participants will receive
      deferiprone for 18 months. Thus, depending on which product was received earlier, patients
      will be on deferiprone for a total of either 1.5 years or 3 years. As in the earlier study,
      assessments will be carried out every six months to look at the safety of the drug and to see
      if patients are showing any improvement in dystonia and other symptoms of PKAN.
