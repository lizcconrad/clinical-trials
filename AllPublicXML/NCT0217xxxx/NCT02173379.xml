  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ABSORB IV is a prospective, randomized (1:1, Absorb BVS to XIENCE), single-blind,
      multi-center study, registering approximately 2610 subjects from approximately 140 sites in
      the United States and outside the United States. ABSORB IV is a continuation of ABSORB III
      (NCT01751906) trial which are maintained under one protocol because both trial designs are
      related. The data from ABSORB III and ABSORB IV will be pooled to support the ABSORB IV
      primary endpoint. Both the trials will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Absorb BVS.

      The ABSORB IV Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is designed to continue to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness as well as the potential short and long-term benefits of Abbott
      Vascular Absorb™ Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) System, and the Absorb GT1™ BVS System
      (once commercially available), as compared to the commercially approved, control stent
      XIENCE.

      ABSORB IV:

      A. Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate 30-day clinical outcomes of the Absorb BVS compared to XIENCE in the
           treatment of subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to three de novo native
           coronary artery lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a maximum of two
           lesions per epicardial vessel.

        -  To evaluate long-term clinical outcomes of Absorb BVS compared to XIENCE in the
           treatment of subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to three denovo native
           coronary artery lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a maximum of two
           lesions per epicardial vessel.

      B. Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate 1-year clinical outcomes of the Absorb BVS compared to XIENCE in the
           treatment of subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to three de novo native
           coronary artery lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a maximum of two
           lesions per epicardial vessel.

        -  To evaluate the incidence of angina occurring within 1 year, with treatment of Absorb
           BVS compared to XIENCE.

      The enrollment of the 2610 subjects in ABSORB IV will start after enrollment completion of
      the 2000 primary analysis subjects in ABSORB III. All registered subjects will have clinical
      follow-up at 30, 90, 180, 270 days and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 years.

      Note: All registered subjects in ABSORB IV will potentially be followed up at 8 years and/or
      9 years and/or 10 years via telephone contact/office visit if it is necessary as determined
      by the Sponsor.

      In addition, all 2610 subjects in ABSORB IV will complete patient-reported outcome (PRO)
      self-administered questionnaires at baseline, 30 days,180 days, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients who experienced angina within 1 year, tested first for non-inferiority with reflex to superiority against the control.
Angina is defined as any angina or angina equivalent symptoms determined by the physician and/or research coordinator after interview of the patient, and as adjudicated by a clinical events committee (CEC).
This analysis will exclude angina or angina equivalent symptoms that occurred following the index procedure through hospital discharge or 7 days, whichever occurs first.
For subjects who receive a planned staged procedure to treat one or more target lesions, the analysis will exclude angina or angina equivalent symptoms that occurred following the original index procedure through hospital discharge or 7 days after the final procedure, whichever occurs first.
This analysis will consist of ~2610 subjects in ABSORB IV.</description>

        General Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Subject or a legally authorized representative must provide written Informed Consent
             prior to any study related procedure, per site requirements.

          3. Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., silent ischemia, stable or
             unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI), OR recent ST-segment elevation
             MI (STEMI). Patients with stable coronary syndromes can be enrolled any time after
             symptom onset if eligibility criteria are otherwise met. Patients with acute coronary
             syndrome can be enrolled under the following conditions:

               1. Unstable angina or NSTEMI within 2 weeks of the index procedure.

               2. STEMI &gt; 72 hours ≤ 2 weeks prior to the index procedure.

             Note: Subjects with Unstable angina (UA) or NSTEMI or STEMI occurring &gt; 2 weeks of the
             index procedure can be included in the trial but should be categorized based on their
             current angina class.

          4. Subjects must be suitable for PCI. Subjects with stable angina or silent ischemia and
             &lt; 70% diameter stenosis must have objective signs of ischemia as determined by one of
             the following: abnormal stress echocardiogram, nuclear scan, electrocardiogram (ECG),
             positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or
             fractional flow reserve (FFR).

             (Note: subject with silent ischemia must have a prior history of typical angina,
             angina-equivalent symptoms, or atypical angina within the past year to be included in
             the trial.)

          5. Subject must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery.

          6. Female subject of childbearing potential who does not plan pregnancy for up to 1 year
             following the index procedure. For a female subject of childbearing potential a
             pregnancy test must be performed with negative results known within 7 days prior to
             the index procedure per site standard.

          7. Female subject is not breast-feeding at the time of the screening visit and will not
             be breast-feeding for at least 1 year following the index procedure.

          8. Subject agrees to not participate in any other investigational or invasive clinical
             study for a period of 5 years following the index procedure.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

        Treatment of up to three de novo lesions in a maximum of two epicardial vessels, with a
        maximum of two lesions per epicardial vessel. If only a single lesion is to be treated, it
        must be a target lesion. Up to one non-target lesion can be treated. Non-target lesion
        treatment can occur only in a non-target vessel.

        If there are two target lesions within the same epicardial vessel, the two target lesions
        must be at least 15 mm apart per visual estimation; otherwise this is considered as a
        single target lesion for lesion (and stent) length determination and must be treated with a
        single study device.

        1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated
        or quantitatively assessed %DS of ≥50% and &lt; 100%, with a thrombolysis in myocardial
        infarction (TIMI) flow of ≥ 1, and one of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%, an abnormal
        functional test (e.g., fractional flow reserve ≤0.80 AND/OR a positive stress test), or
        presentation with an acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or NSTEMI within 2 weeks of
        index procedure, or STEMI &gt;72 hours but ≤ 2 weeks prior to the index procedure).

          1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with reference vessel
             diameter (RVD) by visual estimation of ≥ 2.50 mm and ≤ 3.75 mm.

          2. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with length by visual
             estimation of ≤ 24 mm.

        Note: Subjects with Unstable angina (UA) or NSTEMI or STEMI occurring &gt; 2 weeks of the
        index procedure can be included in the trial but should be categorized based on their
        current angina class.

        Note: To exclude enrollment of excessively small vessels, if the operator believes that
        based on visual angiographic assessments, the distal reference vessel diameter is ≤ 2.75 mm
        such that the plan is to implant a 2.5 mm device (stent or scaffold) in a target lesion, it
        is strongly recommended that either on-line QCA or intravascular imaging (ultrasound or
        optical coherence tomography) is used and demonstrates that the measured distal RVD for
        this target lesion is ≥ 2.50 mm (by at least one of these imaging modalities). This
        measurement may be performed before or after pre-dilatation, but before randomization. If
        the distal RVD measures &lt;2.5 mm, that lesion IS NOT ELIGIBLE for randomization. Such a
        lesion may be treated as a non-target lesion.

        General Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any surgery requiring general anesthesia or discontinuation of aspirin and/or a P2Y12
             receptor inhibitor is planned within 12 months after the procedure.

             the following: aspirin; or clopidogrel and prasugrel and ticagrelor; or heparin and
             bivalirudin, and therefore cannot be adequately treated with study medications.

          4. Subject had an acute STEMI (appropriate clinical syndrome with ≥1 mm of ST-segment
             elevation in ≥2 contiguous leads) within 72 hours of the index procedure.

             LVEF may be obtained within 6 months prior to the procedure for subjects with stable
             CAD. For subjects presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), LVEF must be assessed
             within 1 week of the index procedure and after ACS presentation, which may include
             contrast left ventriculography during the index procedure but prior to randomization
             in order to confirm the subject's eligibility.

          7. Subject has undergone prior PCI within the target vessel during the last 12 months.
             Prior PCI within the non-target vessel or any peripheral intervention is acceptable if
             performed anytime &gt;30 days before the index procedure, or between a minimum of 24
             hours and 30 days before the index procedure if successful and uncomplicated.

             not included as immunosuppressant therapy.

         12. Subject has previously received or is scheduled to receive radiotherapy to a coronary
             artery (vascular brachytherapy), or the chest/mediastinum.

         13. Subject is receiving or will require chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., coumadin,
