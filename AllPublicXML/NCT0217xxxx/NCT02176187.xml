    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric
             criteria:

               -  Patients must have relatively stable, mild to severe airway obstruction with an
                  forced expiratory volulme in one second (FEV1) ≤70% of predicted normal and FEV1
                  ≤70% of forced vital capacity (FVC). Predicted normal values calculated according
                  to evolutionary conserved chromosome segments (ECCS)

               -  Patients who have frequent exacerbations which could be expected to interfere
                  with the patient's ability to participate in the study should be excluded

          -  Male or non-pregnant/non-lactating female patients aged ≥18 years

          -  Patients must demonstrate poor MDI technique prior to the start of the study. Presence
             of any of the following will be considered poor technique:

               -  Failure to co-ordinate &quot;firing&quot; of an MDI with inhalation

               -  Too fast an inhalation rate (&gt; 30 litres/minute (L/min))

               -  Presence of &quot;Cold Freon&quot; effect (MDI spray hitting the back of the throat that
                  caused the patient to stop inhaling)

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent form prior to participation in the study,
             i.e. prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications

          -  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of &gt;10 pack years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study

          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion will
             be excluded

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e. six months or less) of myocardial infarction

          -  Patients with any unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia or who have been
             hospitalised for heart failure within the past year

          -  Patients who regularly use daytime oxygen therapy for more than 1 hour per day and in
             the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen

          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis

          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated
             basal cell carcinoma are allowed

          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis

          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion 1

          -  Patients with any upper respiratory infection in the past 14 days prior to the
             screening visit or during the baseline period

          -  Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme or who have
             completed a pulmonary rehabilitation programme in the six weeks prior to the screening
             visit

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to β2-agonists, anticholinergic drugs or any
             excipients of the active or placebo Berodual®

          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma

          -  Patients who are being treated with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists)

          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e. less than six
             weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of
             prednisolone per day or 20 mg every other day

          -  Patients who are being treated with monamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic
             antidepressants

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception (i.e. oral or injectable eg Depo-Provera or Noristerat
             contraceptives, intrauterine devices, diaphragm (plus spermicide) or subdermal
             implants eg: Norplant®)

          -  Patients with, in the opinion of the investigator, a history of and/or active
             significant alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within four months or six half lives
             (whichever is the greater) prior to screening visit and/or the administration of
             radiolabelled dosage forms within the three months prior to the screening visit

          -  Radiation exposure from clinical studies, including that from the present study and
             diagnostic X-rays but excluding background radiation, exceeding 5 millisievert (mSv)
             in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last five years. No patient whose occupational
             exposure is monitored will participate in the study

        Precautions: As with other anticholinergic drugs, Berodual® should be used with caution in
        patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction.
