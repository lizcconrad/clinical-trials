  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to verify that Dermalax (Deep) is not inferior to the reference device,
      Restylane®, in terms of efficacy and safety in the correction of nasolabial folds. Subjects
      who voluntarily signed the informed consent and are judged to be eligible for this study will
      be intradermally injected both of study device and comparator device. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive injection of study device and comparator device on their each
      nasolabial fold. Efficacy is evaluated based on the change in Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale
      (WSRS) from baseline. Safety will be assessed based on 24 weeks follow up visits and subject
      diary which will be given to subjects during the first 2 weeks after the injection. Any
      uncomfortable things and adverse events will be investigated from subject diary and follow up
      visits.

          1. Male or female subjects no younger than 30 and no more than 65 years of age.

          2. Subjects who scored 3 or 4 on the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) and want to
             improve the appearance of their nasolabial folds (the subject does not need to have
             the same score on both sides.*)

             *The scores need not to be same on both sides, but the two nasolabial folds should
             have symmetry in the range of 3-4.

          3. Subjects who have symmetric nasolabial folds.

          4. Subjects who agreed to discontinue the use of any dermatological procedure or therapy,
             including facial wrinkle reduction procedures.

          5. Subjects with the ability to understand and follow the instructions and who are
             committed to availability for the entire study period.

          6. Subjects who have voluntarily decided to participate in this study and who have signed
             the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who show hypersensitive skin reaction to the investigational devices,
             confirmed by the intradermal reaction test performed at screening.

          2. Subjects who received an antithrombotic agent within 2 weeks prior to screening (with
             the exception of low dose Aspirin 100 mg, maximum of 300 mg/day) or NSAIDs or Vitamin
             E within 1 week.

          3. Subjects with a liver problem and/or blood coagulation defect or subjects who require
             the administration of an antithrombotic agent during the clinical trial period (with
             the exception of low dose Aspirin 100 mg, maximum of 300 mg/day).

          4. Subjects who have used a local ointment on their faces (medication such as steroid or
             retinoid are included and cosmetic products are excluded from this criterion) within 4
             weeks prior to screening or subjects who are planning on using such an ointment during
             the clinical trial period.

          5. Subjects who have received treatment for wrinkles or acne within 24 weeks prior to
             screening.

          6. Subjects who have received facial (chemical) peels and/or skin rejuvenation procedures
             or plastic surgeries, including the injection of the Botulinum toxin, within 24 weeks
             prior to screening.

          7. Subjects who have a permanent skin expander such as soft form or silicon implanted in
             the face.

          8. Subjects who have scars on the face requiring a medical treatment but who have not
             received any treatment for more than a year or subjects who have scars or wounds on
             which the test investigational devices will be applied.

          9. Subjects with skin disease or wound infection on the face.
