  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This field study is designed such that it may be implemented for any individual who has been
      administered raxibacumab for treatment of anthrax or for post exposure prophylaxis including
      sporadic cases, small anthrax incidents and/or a mass event. This study is designed to
      describe the clinical effectiveness (including course of illness and survival), safety
      profile, and raxibacumab pharmacokinetics (PK) from patients who are treated with raxibacumab
      as part of their clinical care following exposure to B. anthracis. Study data and samples for
      PK and other investigational research will be collected prospectively to the extent possible
      at pre-specified time points. However, because of the logistical complexities that would
      likely accompany a mass anthrax event, most data in this study is anticipated to be collected
      retrospectively. During such a mass anthrax event scavenged blood samples will be utilized
      where possible to maximize sample analyses for PK and other investigational parameters.
      Therefore, both retrospective and prospective data collection are allowed in this protocol in
      order to maximize the amount of information obtained in subjects who have been administered
      raxibacumab. This field study will be the first opportunity to collect data on B.
      anthracis-exposed patients treated with raxibacumab, to better understand the clinical
      benefit and safety of the drug and to further inform patient care and treatment choices for
      management of anthrax

      The protocol is a post-marketing requirement from the FDA to evaluate the clinical benefit,
      safety and pharmacokinetic of raxibacumab administered to patients as part of their medical
      care following exposure to Bacillus anthracis.

    <intervention_name>Collection of samples</intervention_name>
    <description>Whenever possible serum samples will be collected from all subjects to determine serum raxibacumab concentrations pre-infusion, and at specific timepoints post-infusion. In the event cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural, ascites, or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid are collected for ad hoc clinical laboratory testing, any remaining excess sample will be provided to GSK for determination of raxibacumab concentrations.
Any available serum remaining from ad hoc clinical laboratory specimen collections prior to raxibacumab administration will be provided to GSK for measurement of serum PA concentrations. In addition, remaining post raxibacumab dose serum specimens may also be analyzed for TNA or ADA. If serum, pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, CSF, and BAL sample volume remains following analyses by GSK, the remaining sample may be sent to CDC for investigational analyses. Any such analyses performed by CDC will be reported separately, by the CDC.</description>
