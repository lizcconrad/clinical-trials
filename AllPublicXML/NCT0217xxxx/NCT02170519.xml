  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) often leads to dysfunction of the right ventricle
      (RV) and can be a significant cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Selective pulmonary
      vasodilation with inhaled nitric oxide (INO) has become the treatment of choice for this
      condition. The evidence supporting INO safety and efficacy under these circumstances is
      sparse, however, and is largely extrapolated from the use of INO in neonatal pulmonary
      hypertension. Moreover, the high cost and potential toxicity of INO makes the therapy far
      from ideal. Emerging evidence suggests that inhaled aerosolized prostacyclins such as
      iloprost may be a favorable alternative therapy.

      Phase 1- In the original study, 3 doses of Iloprost were given. This was revised after 5
      subjects were enrolled in order to study the effects of continuous delivery over a longer
      period of time.

      Phase 2 - All remaining subjects received Iloprost as a continuous treatment.

      The study was designed for an enrollment of 200 subjects and was ended early.

A 20 mcg dose of Iloprost will be given initially. During this treatment there will be a nitric oxide titration to 0. Iloprost will be aerosolized three different times on hour apart. Thirty minutes after the last iloprost dose, INO will be added back at the previous (baseline) dose and data collected 5 minutes later (combined therapy). Another 1 hour period of stable baseline dose INO therapy will be given during which the final data collection will occur (end INO).
