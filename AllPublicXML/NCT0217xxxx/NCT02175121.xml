    <time_frame>Baseline up to 10-14 days after last dose of study drug, up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. An HAE was identified by characteristic symptoms or blood glucose levels. TEAEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to 10-14 days after last dose of study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>

             and 70 years old.

          -  Body Mass Index of 18.0 to 45.4 kg/m2; and a total body weight of &gt;50 kg

          -  HbA1c value at the screening visit meeting once of the following criteria:

               -  Currently taking acceptable oral antiglycemic drug therapy within 6.5 to 9.5%

               -  Not currently taking any oral antiglycemic drug therapy within 7 to 10.5%

          -  Fasting plasma glucose concentrations&lt;270mg/dL at the screening and run-in visit,
             confirmed by a single repeat, if deemed necessary.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to perform self-tests of blood glucose at least 4
             times per day, and maintain a diary for the duration of participation in the study;
             and therefore, subjects must be literate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of Type 1 diabetes mellitus or secondary forms of diabetes

          -  One or more self-reported hypoglycemic episodes of sever intensity within 3 months of
             screening; or 2 or more self-reported hypoglycemic episodes of severe intensity within
             the previous 6 months.

          -  History of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke,
             New York Heart Association Functional Class II-IV heart failure, or transient ischemic
             attach within 6 months of screening.

          -  History or evidence of diabetic complications with significant end organ damage, such
             as

               -  Proliferative retinopathy and/or macular edema;

               -  Diabetic neuropathy complicated by neuropathic ulcers;

          -  Screening seated systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure
             &gt;100 mm Hg after at least a 5 minute seated rest. If the blood pressure exceeds this
             limit, the blood pressure may be repeated 2 more times following approximately 2
             minutes of rest between measurements and the median of the 3 values should be used to
             determine subject eligibility;

          -  Male subjects with partners currently pregnant; or male subjects capable of conceiving
             children who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception
             as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 28 days
             after the last dose of investigational product.

An HAE was identified by characteristic symptoms or blood glucose levels.

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. An HAE was identified by characteristic symptoms or blood glucose levels. TEAEs are events between first dose of study drug and up to 10-14 days after last dose of study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>
          <population>The safety analysis set was defined as all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug.</population>
