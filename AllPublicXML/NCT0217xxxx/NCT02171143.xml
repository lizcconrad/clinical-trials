    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      single, ascending, intravenous (IV) doses of ASP2409 in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis
      (RA) on methotrexate (MTX) and to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of ASP2409.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study. Sequential cohorts of subjects will receive increasing doses
      of ASP2409 or matching placebo.

      Subjects in all cohorts will stay confined in the unit for 3 days. All subjects will have
      scheduled outpatient visits and be followed for a minimum of 90 days.
