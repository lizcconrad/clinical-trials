  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are conflicting evidences of the effects of dietary supplementation with
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on athletic performance. The investigators working
      hypothesis is based on the polyunsaturated fatty acids, given its pro-oxidative character and
      also by its action on transcription factors can modulate the antioxidant response and
      oxidative damage induced by physical activity.The overall objective of the study is to
      establish situations improving athletic performance and study the oxidative balance by
      manipulation of feeding patterns and consumption of nutritional supplements and investigate
      the involved mechanisms.

      There are conflicting evidences of the effects of dietary supplementation with
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on athletic performance. The described effects of PUFAs
      on the fat metabolism may be modulated by the expression and activity of transcription factor
      genes, suppressing or expressing genes associated with the synthesis and oxidation of fats
      and in oxidative stress and inflammation.

      The investigators' working hypothesis is based on the polyunsaturated fatty acids, given its
      pro-oxidative character and also by its action on transcription factors can modulate the
      antioxidant response and oxidative damage induced by physical activity.

      In the field of professional sports and leisure use of food and / or antioxidants in the
      belief that these elements prevent muscle damage is very established. Most studies in
      athletes supplemented with antioxidant nutrients revealed no significant effects on physical
      performance, but it has shown that supplements protect against tissue damage induced by
      exercise. Recent studies have reported that over 35% of the Spanish people eat diets low or
      very low quality, which is clearly shown that over 10% of Spaniards have poor intakes (&lt;2/3
      IDR) riboflavin (men) , folate (women), vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin E.

      The overall objective of the study is to establish situations improving athletic performance
      and study the oxidative balance by manipulation of feeding patterns and consumption of
      nutritional supplements and investigate the involved mechanisms. The aim of this study is to
      establish scientific basis for design functional foods improving athletic performance and
      health and avoiding the negative consequences of the oxidative damage induced by
      overexertion.

    <description>Nine soccer players (19 and 22 years old) took 1 liter/day of one experimental beverage (containing 0.2% olive oil + 0.6% DHA-S Martek). Follow-up 8 weeks. At week 8 an acute exercise season was programed.
One blood sample was taken in resting conditions at beginning of the nutritional intervention (week 0, baseline). Another two blood samples were taken at the end of the nutritional intervention, in resting (week 8, pre-exercise) and post-exercise conditions (week 8, post-exercise). Biochemical measures, oxidative damage markers on lipids, proteins and DNA, antioxidant capabilities (enzyme activities and quantity of enzyme protein and gene expression) and inflammatory markers were measured in serum, plasma, erythrocytes, neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</description>
