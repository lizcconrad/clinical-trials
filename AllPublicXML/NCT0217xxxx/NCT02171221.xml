  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open label, single arm, sequential dose escalation and expansion
      study of oral DFP-11207 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I dose escalation portion of the study has been completed. The maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been determined. The study will now evaluate
      the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of DFP-11207.

      The food effect study is a two-step, two-way crossover design to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of oral DFP-11207 capsules. During Cycle 1, oral
      DFP-11207 capsules are to be taken daily (as a single dose or twice-daily [approximately 12
      hours apart]) under fed/fasted conditions. After Cycle 1, the food effect study will be
      completed and patients will continue to take oral DFP-11207 capsules twice-daily
      (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 days of a 28-day treatment cycle.
