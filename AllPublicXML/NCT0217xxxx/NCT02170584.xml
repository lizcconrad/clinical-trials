  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two substudies to assess (1) the tolerability of BIBR 953 ZW intravenous infusion at 0.1, 1
      and 5 mg BIBR 953 ZW and (2) the absolute bioavailability of 100mg BIBR 1048 administered as
      'acid free' tablet formulation (TF1) and (3) the bioavailability of the 100 mg tablet of BIBR
      1048 relative to the tartaric acid solution of 100 mg dose strength and (4) the absolute
      bioavailability of the 100 mg tartaric acid solution of BIBR 1048 MS.
