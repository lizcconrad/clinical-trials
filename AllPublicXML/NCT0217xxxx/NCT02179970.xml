  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers are difficult to treat using chemotherapy and
      immune therapies.Currently most patients are offered treatment with a standard chemotherapy
      drug depending on their cancer type. Recently, laboratory studies have shown that a drug
      called plerixafor may help the body to overcome resistance to immune therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if the study drug has the same effect on patients
      with advanced pancreatic, ovarian or colorectal cancer, as we have seen in our laboratory
      experiments, and find out the right dose of the study drug to give. This is a 'dose
      escalation study'. Patients will be recruited slowly and the study team will closely monitor
      the effect the drug has, until they find the best dose to give. As part of this study, blood
      and tumour samples will be collected and analysed in our laboratories and the patients cancer
      will be monitored using two imaging techniques, CT and FDG-PET scans.

      This is a prospective, non-randomised, open label, Phase I, dose escalation study of
      plerixafor (MozobilTM) in patients with histological documentation of advanced pancreatic,
      high grade serous ovarian or colorectal adenocarcinoma. We will investigate the feasibility
      of administering plerixafor in terms of safety, and will try to identify the proof of
      mechanism in patients.

      This study is required to establish whether relevant plasma concentrations of plerixafor can
      be achieved safely in patients with advanced pancreatic, high grade serous ovarian and
      colorectal cancer.

      Plerixafor (Mozobil) will be administered as a continuous 7 day intravenous infusion,
      starting at a dose of 20 ug/kg/hr, and subsequent dose levels of 40, 80 and 120 ug/kg/hr (as
      an inpatient for at least the initial 48 hours). 3 patients will be entered sequentially (at
      least 1 week apart), using a standard 3+3, Phase I trial design. Up to 28 patients will be
      recruited.
