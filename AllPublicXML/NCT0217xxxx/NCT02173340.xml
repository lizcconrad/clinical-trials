  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation during spinal anesthesia is very useful for patients' comfort. However, intermittent
      bolus of sedative frequently results in inappropriate sedation which comes with various side
      effects such as patients' discomfort and apnea. Therefore, it would be reasonable to use
      target-controlled infusion(TCI) to provide proper sedation without serious side effects.

      In this study, the investigators try to find the appropriate propofol target concentration
      with TCI device and build a pharmacodynamic non-linear mixed effect model between propofol
      target concentration and side effects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>sedation score</measure>
    <time_frame>every 5 minutes when the dose is adjusted up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Sedation score will be assessed with 'Modified Observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) score'. It has 5 scales from 1 to 5 as followed.
responds readily to name spoken in normal tone
lethargic response to name spoken in normal tone
responds only after name is spoken loudly and/or repeatedly
responds only after mild prodding or shaking
does not respond to mild prodding or shaking
After induction of spinal anesthesia, patient will be sedated with propofol via TCI device. The infusion dose will be adjusted every 5 minutes until the OAA/S score reaches 4. The patient's OAA/S score will be assessed overtime the infusion dose is adjusted during sedation. At the same time, airway obstruction score will be assessed and if the score reaches 4, the dose will be reduced.</description>
