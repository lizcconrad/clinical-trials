             protocol-required procedures.

          2. Target Population

             a) Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant deviation from normal
             in medical history, psychiatric history, physical examination findings, vital sign
             measurements, 12-lead ECG measurements, physical measurements, and clinical laboratory
             test results.

          3. Age and Reproductive Status

               1. Males and females, ages 25 to 55 years, inclusive.

               2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
                  (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to
                  the start of study drug.
