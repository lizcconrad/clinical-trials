  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether and to what extent the P-glycoprotein inhibitor (P-gp) verapamil
      affects the pharmacokinetic parameters of dabigatran with verapamil given at different
      dosages, in different formulations (immediate release (IR) and extended release (ER)), and in
      different intervals in relation to the dabigatran dose.
