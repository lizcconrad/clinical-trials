  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hyaluronic acid in the surgical treatment
      of periodontal pockets in people with gum disease.

      This research consists of clinical and radiographic studies. Participants should have
      symmetric periodontal pockets in the upper or lower jaw.

      Participants will be treated surgically using hyaluronic acid on one side of the jaw.

      Clinical indexes and radiographic cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) images will be taken
      for each participant before surgical treatment and 12 months after surgical treatment.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hyaluronic acid in the surgical treatment
      of infra-bony pockets in chronic periodontitis patients.

      This research consists of clinical and radiographic studies.

      1- The clinical study: is a randomized controlled trial with a split mouth technique.

      Chronic periodontitis patients with Infra-bony pockets will be collected from the Department
      of Periodontics in faculty of dentistry - Damascus university.

      Participants should have symmetric infra-bony pockets in the upper or lower premolar area
      with pocket probing depth more than 6 mm.

      Participants will be treated surgically using open flap curettage.

      Open flap curettage will be done for each patient in both sides of the jaw, but hyaluronic
      acid will be used in one of the two sides with random allocation of the site that in going to
      be treated with hyaluronic acid.

      Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, tooth mobility index, pocket probing depth
      and clinical attachment loss will be taken for each participant four times; before surgical
      treatment, 3 months, six months and 12 months after surgical treatment.

      Radiographic study: will be done using CBCT radiography technique. CBCT will be taken for
      each participant before and after 12 months of surgical treatment. Different distances,
      vertical bone fill and depth of infra-bony defect will be measured on CBCT images.

    <description>Vertical bone fill: it is the distance between the base of the infra-bony defect and cement-enamel junction before surgery minus the distance between base of the infra-bony defect and cement enamel junction after surgery.
It will be measured on CBCT images.</description>

    <description>Pocket Probing Depth (PPD): it is the distance from the gingival margin to the bottom of the pocket at four sites per tooth. PPD will be measured using a dental probe.</description>
