  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a chronic dose of a tryptophan-rich protein
      drink (lumiVida™) can improve cognitive function, emotional processing and sleep in
      middle-aged women. In addition, also genetic predictors of susceptibility to an increase of
      Trp levels will be investigated.

      lumiVida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is regulated like a food. The U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and dietary supplements. The investigators do
      not claim that this supplement is meant to treat any ailment

    <textblock>
      The treatment conditions are either placebo or lumiVida™ (N=30 per group) 0.5 g twice a day
      (total 1 g/ day). The first testing took place on the screening day (baseline). Subsequently,
      participants were supplied with supplements for 19 days intervention (sachets which had to be
      dissolved in 200-ml water). After 19 days, participants were tested again (same tests as on
      the baseline day). An additional facet was the completion of a 'sleep diary', which asks
      questions about sleep quality and latency, and bed-time mood, as well as allowing recording
      of timing of supplement taking.
