  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne is a prevalent disorder mostly witnessed in adolescents, but can be seen in adults.
      Early treatment is imperative to reduce acne scarring which can appear with atrophic lesions,
      and depending on the skin type, significant erythema (redness) or post-inflammatory
      hyperpigmentation. A multi-modality approach to treatment is necessary when dealing with the
      aforementioned types of lesions. Pharmacologic management is essential, but safe procedural
      therapies are also necessary specifically with darker skinned individuals.

      Percutaneous collagen induction therapy (PCIT) is a non-invasive treatment achieved by using
      a micro-needling device, which is safe and effective in causing &quot;micro-wounds&quot; into the
      dermis thereby initiating wound healing followed by collagen production. This is an ideal
      treatment for acne scarring, re-texturizing of the skin, and hyperpigmentation for all skin
      types . Currently there are very few studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      microneedling and chemical peels in skin types III-VI.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the combination of microneedling and
      chemical peel for the treatment of acne scars in skin types III-VI.

    <description>Microneedling: is a device for all skin types that creates micro &quot;injuries&quot; in the dermis (layer of the skin underneath the outermost layer) in an attempt to trigger new collagen (natural component of skin tissue) production for smoother, firmer and younger-looking skin.
For this protocol, the needle depth will be increased over the 3 sessions:
Forehead: 0.75 mm, 0.85 mm, 1.0 mm. Cheeks/Chin: 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm.
Each Session: Microneedling procedure on Day 1, followed by skin care regimen</description>
