      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine and its
      metabolites Lu AA34443 and Lu AA39835 following a single oral dose administration of
      vortioxetine 5 mg in participants with severe hepatic impairment compared to healthy
      participants.

      The drug being tested in this study is called vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested to
      assess how it moves throughout the body in people with severe hepatic impairment compared to
      people with normal hepatic function. This study looked at lab results in people who took
      vortioxetine.

      The study enrolled 12 participants. Participants were assigned to one of the two treatment
      groups based on their hepatic function (severe hepatic impairment vs. normal hepatic
      function). All participants in both groups will receive one vortioxetine 5-mg tablet.

      This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was up to 58 days. Participants made 2 visits to the clinic, including one
      12-day period of confinement to the clinic, and were contacted by telephone 30 days after
      last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
