    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is as follows:

      To determine the pharmacokinetics of micafungin given twice weekly in patients at risk for
      developing an invasive fungal disease (patients who are being treated for acute or chronic
      graft versus host disease; patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning for Stem Cell
      Transplant (SCT); receiving first remission induction chemotherapy for Acute Myeloid
      Leucaemia (AML)/MyeloDysplasticSyndrome (MDS)) compared to the pharmacokinetics of micafungin
      given daily.

      The secondary objective of this trial is as follows:

      To determine whether adequate exposure of micafungin is attained. To determine the safety of
      micafungin in this patient population

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Micafungin has been shown to be a reasonable option for treating invasive aspergillosis in
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients and has proven as effective as
      fluconazole for prophylaxis. Whilst micafungin has much to offer, little is known about its
      pharmacokinetic profile in specific patient populations, specifically concerning alternate
      dosing strategies with increased dosages over a prolonged dosing interval. Sufficient data
      are lacking up to now for twice weekly administration of micafungin as antifungal
      prophylaxis. Decreasing the dosing frequency to twice weekly seems a reasonable approach
      considering the long terminal elimination life (i.e. 10-17 h) and considering the data
      available from murine models that support the use of less frequent dosing with higher
      dosages.

      It will enable us to characterize both the pharmacokinetics of micafungin in the hematology
      cohort and directly compare the exposure to the alternate dosing strategy.
