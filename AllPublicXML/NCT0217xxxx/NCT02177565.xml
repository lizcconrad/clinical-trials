      Do mesenchymal stem cells accelerate new bone formation in persistent non-unions treated with
      carrier plus in vitro expanded autologous BMSCs or carrier alone (control). Secondary aims
      were to analyze predictors of union in these patients and describe adverse events at final
      follow-up.

    <measure>Radiological assessment of new callus and fracture bridging</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was formation of new callus and cortical bridging, assessed from pre-operative and multiple post-operative radiographs and CT-scans up to 12 months. These images were divided into early (0-3 months) and late (9-12 months) groups. Non-unions were assessed from anonymized slides by four independent reviewers (two radiologists and two orthopedic surgeons) blinded to the side of cell insertion. Each slide had a pre-operative radiograph for comparison but no indication of time since surgery, and showed a medial/ lateral or an anterior/ posterior view depending on the surgical approach . At first, each reviewer indicated the side with largest callus and most cortical bridging pre-operatively. Then each reviewer examined subsequent radiographs to indicate the side with the largest increase in new callus and cortical bridging.</description>

    <description>The non-unions of fractures were stabilized with internal or external fixation devices. The non-union site was clearly exposed and decorticated to introduce sub-periosteal bone graft. Depending on the surgical approach, the site was partitioned in either medial/lateral or anterior/posterior sides. The contents of each universal container were mixed individually with a carrier by the surgeon, who was blinded to the contents of the container</description>
