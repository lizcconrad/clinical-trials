    <textblock>
      Multicentric randomised trial. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) will help to decrease the rate of
      peritoneal carcinomatosis(PC) in patients with high risk of developing PC of colorectal
      cancer. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy(HIPEC) is a recently validated option for the
      treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal or ovarian origin. This therapeutic
      program demonstrated a significant improvement of overall survival of the disease. It is not
      yet known whether surgery followed by HIPEC is effective on decreasing the rate of peritoneal
      carcinomatosis(PC) in patients with high risk of developing PC of colorectal cancer.Patients
      with a high risk of developing colorectal Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (PC), defined by
      Colorectal Cancer With a Resected Minimal Synchronous PC or Ovarian Metastases, or identified
      T4 by intraoperative pathological diagnosis, or Tumour Rupture in the Abdominal Cavity. If
      patients with a high risk of developing PC identified by preoperative examination, they will
      be informed and will sign the consent. After complete resection of their tumor, they will be
      randomised to surveillance alone (control group) or HIPEC (experimental group). All patients
      will receive the current standard postoperative adjuvant treatment : 6 months of systemic
      chemotherapy (currently including FOLFOX4, mFOLFOX6, CapeOx or Capecitabine regimen which
      could be modified if the standard is modified). Then a work-up is done to find recurrence. If
      the recurrence occurs, the patient will be treated with the best known treatment.
