      Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lomitapide in Japanese Patients with Homozygous
      Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) on Concurrent Lipid-Lowering Therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate both the
      efficacy and long-term safety of lomitapide in Japanese patients with HoFH receiving
      maximally-tolerated, stable lipid-lowering therapy. This study is comprised of two phases: a
      primary 26-week Efficacy Phase followed by a 30-week Safety Phase.
