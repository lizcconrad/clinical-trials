             intrauterine devices; sterilised) and must have a negative urine pregnancy test

          -  All subjects must have a negative hepatitis B, C and HIV tests as well as a negative
             drug screening

          -  Prior to admission to the treatment after giving his/her informed consent (in

             will have his/her medical history taken and will receive a complete medical
             examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as well as 12-lead ECG
             within 14 days before the first administration of the test drug. Haematopoietic,
             hepatic and renal function tests will be carried out in the laboratory. The subject
             will fast for 12 hours before collection of specimens for all laboratory parameters

          -  Volunteers with disturbed micturition

          -  Volunteers who have taken a drug with a long half-life (&gt;= 24 hours) within ten
             half-lives of the respective drug before enrolment in the study

             medications (including vitamins, supplements and/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
