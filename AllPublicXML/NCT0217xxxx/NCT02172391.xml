        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  Male or female patients ≥ 40 years of age but ≤ 75 years old

          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten pack-years. A pack-year is
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for a year

          -  Patients must be able to perform all specified procedures and maintain records during
             the study period as required in the protocol

          -  Patients must be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler®

          -  All patients must sign a Patient Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the
             trial i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications

          -  Patients must be willing to attend an outpatient clinic on a regular basis

          -  Patients must be able to walk 164 feet (50 meters) during the Six Minute Walk Test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study

          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis test results, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion
             criterion

          -  Patients with a serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) ≥1.5 x Upper Limit of
             Normal Range (ULN), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≥1.5 x ULN, bilirubin
             ≥1.5 x ULN or creatinine ≥ 1.5 x ULN regardless of the clinical condition

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., three years or less) of heart failure, pulmonary
             edema or patients with any cardiac arrhythmia (with or without symptoms)

          -  Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy

          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis

             basal cell carcinoma are allowed

          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis

          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history or a thoracotomy for other reason should be evaluated as per exclusion
             criterion no. 1

          -  Patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the past six weeks prior to the
             Screening Visit or during the baseline period

          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma

          -  Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium

          -  Patients who are being treated with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists) or
             antileukotrienes and are not able to stop these medications 1 month before visit 1

          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception

          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a total
             blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3

          -  Patients with history of (past five years or less) and/or active alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives
             (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Period (Visit 1)

          -  Patients who have participated in any pulmonary rehabilitation program for COPD within
             6 weeks prior to Visit 1 or throughout the study

          -  Limitation of exercise performance as a result of factors other than fatigue or
             exertional dyspnea such as arthritis in the leg, angina or claudication
