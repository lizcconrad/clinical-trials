  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was the assessment of safety of BIBW 2992 as assessed by the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives were collection of overall safety data, antitumor
      efficacy data, as well as the determination of pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic
      modulation of biomarkers by BIBW 2992.
