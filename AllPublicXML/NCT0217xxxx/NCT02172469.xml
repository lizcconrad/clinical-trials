    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease according to the
             following criteria:

               -  Patients had relatively stable airway obstruction with an FEV1 less than or equal
                  to 65% of predicted normal and FEV1 less than or equal to 70% of FVC.

               -  Predicted normal values were based on the guidelines for standardised lung
                  function testing in the Philippines.

          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.

          -  Patients had a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A pack-year is defined as
             the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for a year.

          -  Patients performed pulmonary function tests as required in the protocol.

          -  Patients were able to inhale medication from the Handihaler device and had a good
             technique of inhaling aerosol administered from an MDI.

          -  All patients signed an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial i.e.,
             prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD were excluded. A significant
             disease was defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator could either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which could
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study.

          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis, if the abnormality defined a disease listed as an exclusion criterion,
             were excluded.

          -  All patients with a serum glutamate oxalacetate transaminase (SGOT) and serum
             glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) twice the normal range, bilirubin 150% or
             creatinine 125% of the normal range were excluded regardless of the clinical
             condition. Repeated laboratory evaluations were not conducted in these subjects.

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e. one year or less) of myocardial infarction were
             excluded.

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e. three years or less) of heart failure or patients
             with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy were excluded.

          -  Patients on regular use of daytime oxygen therapy were excluded.

          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis were excluded.

          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years were excluded. Patients
             with treated basal cell carcinoma were allowed.

          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis were excluded.

          -  Patients who have undergone pulmonary resection or a thoracotomy for any reason were
             excluded.

          -  Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection in the past 6 weeks prior to the
             screening visit (=visit 1) or during the baseline period of 2 weeks (run-in period)
             were excluded.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other
             component of the inhalation capsule delivery system or the MDI were excluded.

          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction were
             excluded.

          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma were excluded.

          -  Patients who were being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium were
             excluded.

          -  Patients who were being treated with antihistamines were excluded.

          -  Patients who were using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable (i.e. less than 6
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent 10 mg of prednisone
             per day or 20 mg every other day were excluded

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential who were not using a
             medically approved means of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptives, intrauterine
             devices, or diaphragm) were excluded.

          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who had a blood total
             eosinophil count more or equal to 400 per μl (males) or more or equal to 320 per μl
             (females) were excluded. Repeated eosinophil counts were not conducted in these
             patients.

          -  Patients with a history and/or active alcohol or drug abuse were excluded.

          -  Patients who had taken an investigational drug one month or six half-lives (whichever
             is greater) prior to the screening visit (=visit 1) were excluded.
