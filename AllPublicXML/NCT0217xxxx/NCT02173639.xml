  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to assess the relative bioavailability of a pilot scale linagliptin 2.5 mg
      / metformin 1000 mg fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet in comparison with single tablets of
      linagliptin 2.5 mg and metformin 1000 mg administered together.
