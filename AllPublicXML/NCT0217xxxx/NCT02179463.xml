      RATIONALE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been proved effective for locally advanced gastric
      cancer, yet the best pattern of response evaluation remain unknown.

      PURPOSE: Compare different pattern of response evaluation for Gastric Cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Find the best pattern for response evaluation for gastric cancer. II. Assess
      the factor associated with this pattern.

      OUTLINE: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 150 patients will be accrued over approximately 2 years.
