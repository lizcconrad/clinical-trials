      The research project is a component of a mentored research career enhancement award. The
      purpose of the award is to help the PI and his collaborators prepare for future research
      grant opportunities through the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The
      research project is a feasibility study with the following specific aims; 1) to assess
      outcomes associated with a personalized health plan for frequent headaches; 2) to identify
      measurable outcomes that are meaningful to patients with frequent headaches; and 3) to create
      a patient stakeholder group to inform patient-centered outcomes research for frequent
      headaches. Specific Aim #1 will be achieved by recruiting and enrolling 40 established
      patients at the Duke Family Medicine Center who have frequent headaches. The intervention
      consists of 3 study visits with the PI, 2 clinical consultations with subjects' established
      primary care provider at the Duke Pickens Family Medicine Center, and participation in 2
      focus groups. Personalized health plans might consist of a combination of medical management,
      lifestyle changes, nutrition counseling, or other therapeutic modalities as appropriate. Data
      analysis will be descriptive; no formal hypotheses will be tested.
