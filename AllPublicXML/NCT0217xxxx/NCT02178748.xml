  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is a pathogen with worldwide distribution which infects
      humans causing tuberculosis (TB), a transmissible disease resulting in very high mortality
      and morbidity; development of an effective vaccine is a global health priority.

      Over a billion people worldwide are infected with one or more helminths. Helminths are
      parasitic worms, of which Schistosoma mansoni is one species. There is some evidence that
      helminth infection may affect a person's response to a vaccine. In this trial the
      investigators hope to investigate whether Schistosoma mansoni infection affects adolescents'
      responses to a candidate TB vaccine called MVA85A, as adolescents are a crucial target group
      for an effective TB vaccine.

          -  Resident in the study area for the duration of the study period

          -  Confirmation of prior vaccination with BCG not less than 6 months prior to projected
             study vaccination date (by visible BCG scar on examination or written documentation)

          -  No relevant findings in medical history or on physical examination

          -  Written informed consent by parent or guardian

          -  Written informed assent by subject

          -  Refrain from blood donation during the trial

          -  Agree to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the trial (female only)

          -  Able and willing (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with all the study
             requirements

          -  Stool sample negative for S. mansoni (group 1) or positive for S. mansoni infection
             (group 2), based on the results of the Kato Katz stool analysis

          -  Willing to delay treatment for schistosomiasis for at least one month (group 2)

        Exclusion Criteria

        Participants may not enter the trial if ANY of the following apply:

          -  Clinical, radiological, or laboratory evidence of current active TB disease

          -  Laboratory evidence at screening of latent M. tb infection as indicated by a positive
