  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyethylene wear and osteolysis remain a concern with the use of modular, fixed bearing
      total knee arthroplasty. A variety of highly cross-linked polyethylenes have been introduced
      to decrease this problem, but there is little data on the results and complications of this
      polyethylene in posterior-stabilized knee prosthesis. The investigators asked the following
      questions: (1) Are there any differences in the clinical and radiographic results when a
      highly cross-lined polyethylene is compared to a standard liner? (2) What is the frequency of
      reoperation in these two groups and are there any specific complications related to highly
      cross-linked polyethylene liners.

      This prospective, randomized study will seek to enroll patients undergoing primary total knee
      arthroplasty. Preoperative evaluation will include a detailed history and physical exam with
      clinical data collection (SF-36, WOMAC, and Knee Society Scores), a complete description of
      the procedure, a demonstration of the actual types of implants and tibial inserts, and an
      outline of the study protocol and informed consent. Intraoperatively, the patient will
      undergo a total knee arthroplasty utilizing standard operative procedures. Each patient will
      receive a Zimmer NexGen posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty. During the procedure or
      preoperative visit, the patient will be randomized by sealed envelope to receive either a
      standard Zimmer UHMWPE tibial insert or a Zimmer highly cross-linked UHMWPE tibial insert.
      Both surgeon and patient will be blinded to the type of implant used. there will be no
      variations in surgical technique and hospital management of the patients throughout the
      course of the study. Postoperatively, the patient will be seen for routine follow-up at six
      weeks, 6 months, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Radiographs will be obtained at each visit.
      Clinical data forms will be completed at each visit. At the conclusion of the study
      radiographs will be assessed for signs of polyethylene wear, osteolysis and component
      loosening. the preoperative and postoperative knee scores will be calculated for each patient
      and compared between the patient groups with standard statistical analysis.
