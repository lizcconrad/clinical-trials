  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke and heart attack, have been shown to vary by
      ethnic group. However, less is known about differences between ethnic groups and a wider
      range of cardiovascular diseases. This study will examine differences between ethnic groups
      (White, Black, South Asian and Mixed/Other) and first lifetime presentation of twelve
      different cardiovascular diseases. This information may help to predict the onset of
      cardiovascular diseases and inform disease prevention strategies.

      The hypothesis is that different ethnic groups have differing associations with the range of
      cardiovascular diseases studied.

    <textblock>
      There is evidence from epidemiological studies that different ethnic groups are associated
      with increased incidence of specific cardiovascular diseases. However, the majority of
      existing studies have examined associations with one or two acute conditions such as stroke
      or coronary heart disease or focused on a particular ethnic group.

      The aim of this study is to examine the differing associations between four ethnic groups and
      the initial lifetime presentation of a broad range of cardiovascular diseases, including
      chronic presentations such as stable angina. The hypothesis is that there will be
      heterogeneity of associations between the different ethnic groups and the full range of
      cardiovascular diseases studied.

      The study will use data from the CALIBER data set of clinically collected electronic health
      record data from England.

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the National Institute for
      Health Research (NIHR) and Wellcome Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is
      linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care
      (Clinical Practice Research Datalink - CPRD) and other resources. The overarching aim of
      CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary phenotypes
      across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER data set).
