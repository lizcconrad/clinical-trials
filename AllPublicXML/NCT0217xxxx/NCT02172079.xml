  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of manual therapy techniques for the
      management of impingement syndrome. However, no adequately powered clinical trials have
      examined the effects of mobilization-with-movement. The purpose of the current study was to
      perform a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of real MWM to a group receiving
      a sham intervention on shoulder pain at different moments and active shoulder range of motion
      in an adequately powered sample of patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.

    <description>Participants were asked to rate the intensity of their pain using an 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS; 0: no pain; 10: maximum pain) for 3 scores of perceived pain: 1, the intensity of shoulder pain experienced in the last 24h; 2, the intensity of shoulder pain at night; 3, the intensity of shoulder pain during shoulder flexion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in shoulder range of motion before and after the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one week after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A universal goniometer was used to assess the participant's shoulder range of motion in the following motions:
Pain-free and maximum (painful) range of motion in shoulder flexion
Pain-free range of motion in shoulder extension
Pain-free range of motion in shoulder abduction
Pain-free range of motion in shoulder external rotation
Pain-free range of motion in shoulder medial (internal) rotation</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Real mobilization-with-movement (MWM)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>For the MWM group, an accessory posterior-lateral gliding movement in the humeral head combined with a movement of active shoulder flexion will be applied. One hand will be placed over the scapula posteriorly while the thenar eminence of the other hand will be placed over the anterior aspect of the head of the humerus</description>

    <arm_group_label>Sham mobilization-with-movement (MWM)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The sham condition will replicate the treatment condition except for the hand positioning. The therapist locates one hand over the belly of the pectoralis major muscle and the other over scapula without applying any pressure. The patient will be asked to move the arm in a similar manner as in the MWM group</description>
