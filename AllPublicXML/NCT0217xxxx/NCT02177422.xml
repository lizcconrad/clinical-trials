  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of telmisartan 80
      mg during open-label, long-term treatment. An additional objective was to assess the efficacy
      and safety of concomitant administration of telmisartan 80 mg and HCTZ (Hydrochlorothiazide)
      and/or any other therapies commonly used in the treatment of hypertension.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have met the inclusion criteria for the preceding clinical trial of
             telmisartan. All patients must give a separate written informed consent for
             participation in the open-label follow-up.

               -  Mild-to-moderate essential hypertension defined as a mean seated diastolic blood
                  pressure measurement of ≥ 95 mmHg measured by manual cuff sphygmomanometer

               -  Mean seated systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, measured my manual cuff

               -  A 24-hour mean diastolic blood pressure, measured by ABPM (ambulatory blood
                  pressure measurement), of ≥ 85 mmHg

               -  Age 18 or older

               -  Patient's written informed consent in accordance with GCP (Good Clinical
                  Practice) and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a clinically significant change in ECG from baseline that was reported
             as an adverse event during the preceding clinical trial

          -  Patients who have developed a medical condition during the preceding clinical trial
             that, in the investigator's opinion, may be worsened by treatment or may compromise
             the safety evaluation of telmisartan

          -  Patients who discontinued the preceding telmisartan clinical trial due to an adverse
             event

          -  Any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not
             allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of telmisartan
