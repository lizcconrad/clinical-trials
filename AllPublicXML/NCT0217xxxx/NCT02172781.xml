    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants in the study should be healthy males, ranging from 40 to 65 years of age
        and within ±20% of their normal weight (Broca-Index)

        Each subject will have his medical history taken and will receive a complete medical
        examination (including blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as well as a 12-lead
        ECG.

        Haematological, hepatic and renal function tests will be carried out in the laboratory
        (Bioscentia GmbH, FRG). The subjects will fast for 8 hours before collection of specimens
        for all laboratory evaluations. The above mentioned examinations will be performed within
        14 days before the first drug administration.

        In accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation all subjects will
        have given their written informed consent prior to admission to the study.

        Following inclusion criteria were of special interest for this study:

          -  Normal spirometry as evidenced by a baseline FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted normal value for
             age, height and sex. Predicted normal values will be calculated according to European
             Community of Coal and Steel (ECCS)

          -  Ability to perform technically satisfactory pulmonary function tests.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             deviating from normal and of clinical relevance.

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders.

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or
             neurological disorders.

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections.

          -  History of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) which is deemed relevant
             to the trial as judged by the investigator.

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (≥ 24hours) within at least one month or less
             than ten half-lives of the respective drug before enrolment in the study or during the
             study.

          -  Use of any drugs which might influence the results of the trial up to seven days prior
             to enrolment in the study or during the study, among these all non-selective beta
             blockers, oral beta adrenergics or long-acting beta-adrenergics such as salmeterol and
             formoterol, and anticholinergic drugs including ATROVENT ®(ipratropium) by oral
             inhalation and ATROVENT® Nasal Spray.

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug (≤ two months prior to
             administration or during trial).

          -  Smoker (&gt; 10 cigarettes or &gt; 3 cigars or &gt; 3 pipes/day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on trial days.

          -  Alcohol abuse (&gt; 60g/day)

          -  Drug abuse

          -  Blood donation (≥ 100 ml within four weeks prior to administration or during the
             trial)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the clinically accepted reference range.

          -  Excessive physical activities (within the last week before and during the study)

        Following exclusion criteria are of special interest for the study:

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs.

          -  Subjects with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction

          -  Subjects with known narrow-angle glaucoma
