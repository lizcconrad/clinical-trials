  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of ascites in the natural history of cirrhosis heralds a worsening of the
      prognosis to 50% survival at 2 years, and this deteriorates to 30-50% at 1 year when the
      ascites becomes refractory to medical therapy. Hemodynamic alterations and their relation to
      neurohumoral systems are essential in pathophysiology of ascites formation. The theory that
      best explain the ascites formation and sodium retention in cirrhotics is portal hypertension
      leading to splanchnic arterial vasodilatation leading to underfilling of arterial circulation
      which is sensed by the arterial and the cardiopulmonary receptors leading to sympathetic
      nervous system activation and activation of the anti-natriuretic factors (RAAS and arginine
      vasopressin), resulting in sodium and water retention. The therapeutic options available for
      patients with refractory ascites are serial therapeutic paracentesis, liver transplantation
      and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts.Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists
      antagonize the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin at the V2 receptor located in the renal
      collecting duct, they increase free water clearance, and thus may be helpful in mobilizing
      excess water in conditions associated with water retention including cirrhosis. The use of V2
      receptor antagonists in cirrhosis with ascites has been shown to be safe and efficacious.
      Midodrine, an alpha adreno receptor agonist by causing splanchnic vasoconstriction has been
      used in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and for control of ascites in patients with refractory or
      recurrent ascites. It is possible that vasoconstrictors and aquaretics (V2 receptor
      antagonists) by acting at different sites in combination may reverse some of the pathogenic
      events that results in refractory or recurrent ascites.There are no reports on the use of
      combination of midodrine and tolvaptan in the patients with cirrhosis with ascites.
      Therefore, we plan to study the role of midodrine, tolvaptan and their combination on
      systemic hemodynamics, renal functions and control of ascites in patients with cirrhosis and
      refractory or recurrent ascites.
