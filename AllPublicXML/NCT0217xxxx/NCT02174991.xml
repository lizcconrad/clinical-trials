      A. To evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of the rho-kinase Inhibitor (AR-12286 0.5% and
      0.7%) ophthalmic solutions in open-angle glaucoma patients with uncontrolled IOP who are
      facing surgical intervention. Patients will be treated for 6 months in this initial trial.

      B. To evaluate the efficacy of AR-12286 in enabling treated patients to delay or avoid the
      necessity of surgical intervention.

    <description>AR-12286 is a novel Rho-kinase inhibitor developed by Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ. It is a potent Rho-kinase inhibitor with single-digit nanomolar inhibitory activity against Rho-kinase in enzymatic inhibition assays (deLong MA, et al. IOVS 2009; 50: ARVO E-abstract 4058). Mechanism-of action studies in monkeys demonstrate that AR-12286 lowers IOP primarily by increasing aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork (Wang RF, et al. IOVS 2009; 50:ARVO E-abstract 1465). Rho-kinase AR-12286 is well tolerated and produces clinically and statistically significant ocular hypotensive efficacy in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. It is well tolerated by most of patients and the only side effect was ocular hyperemia in a minority of subjects (Williams, Novack, Van Haarlem, &amp; Kopczynski, 2011). It is currently in phase II testing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with open-angle glaucoma.

          2. IOP above the target range or visual field progression with use of maximum standard
             drug therapy.

          3. Have given written informed consent, prior to any investigational procedures.

          4. Ability to attend for the 6-month duration of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Angle-closure glaucoma

          2. Eyes having had previous incisional glaucoma surgery

          3. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation (benzalkonium chloride,
             etc.), or to topical anesthetics.

          4. Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of base-line visit, with the exception of

          7. Participation in any investigational study within the past 30 days.

          8. Inability to perform reliable visual field testing.

          9. Unwilling to sign the consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of
