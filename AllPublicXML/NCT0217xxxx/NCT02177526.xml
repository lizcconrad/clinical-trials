  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of prostatic carcinoma varies according to stage of disease. Trans-rectal
      ultrasound guided biopsy is known to underestimate the degree of tumor due to undersampling
      and random non-targeted technique. Methods to improve pre-operative tumor localization and
      grading, including multi-parametric (MP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an active area
      of research but requires further validation.

      High grade tumors can undergo comedo-type necrosis with malignant calcifications which only
      occurs in Gleason pattern 5 tumors and which we hypothesize can be reliably detected using
      computed tomography (CT) and/or MRI.

      Detection of malignant calcification within tumor foci will improve the accuracy of
      localization and grading in prostatic carcinoma.

      High grade (Gleason pattern 5) tumors can undergo comedo-type necrosis producing malignant
      calcifications which we hypothesize can be reliably detected using computed tomography (CT)
      and/or MRI. Detection of malignant calcifications in areas of Gleason pattern 5 tumor will
      improve the accuracy of pre-operative localization and grading in prostatic carcinoma.

    <description>Two radiologists will review the MRI and CT examinations separated by a 4 week interval to decrease recall bias. Further, readers will review the 3 additional gradient echo pulse sequences independently at 3 different MRI reading sessions, also separated by 4 weeks, in order to compare the accuracy from each pulse sequence and to reduce recall bias.</description>
