  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no question that combat and domestic attacks can be stressful, and can have effects
      that last for months or even years, including reliving some of the events through nightmares
      or flashbacks, wanting to avoid anything that is a reminder of combat or domestic attack such
      as movies or the nightly news, or being jumpy and concerned about security. When someone has
      a lot of these symptoms they might be told they have PTSD, but even when that person doesn't
      have the full condition, just having some symptoms can affect their ability to function at
      the highest level at home, work, or in social settings, and puts you at greater risk for
      developing full PTSD. While someone who went through a significant stressful event might not
      need a long course of therapy if they don't have full PTSD, the investigator of this study
      thinks that working with them from a distance through their smart phone over time may
      decrease their symptoms, help them feel better, and prevent full PTSD. Thus the purpose of
      this study is to assess how a brief, relatively simple resiliency enhancement strategy,
      provided mostly through smart phones, affects someone with stress-related symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been identified in 10-20% of U.S. military service
      members (SMs) returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, and is associated with impaired physical
      health, mental health, and overall functional status. Resilience has often been spoken of,
      yet proven methods for promoting resilience, and protecting SMs from PTSD, have yet to be
      established. One easy and effective way of identifying those at higher risk for development
      of PTSD is through the one-page, 17-item self-administered PTSD Checklist (PCL). The total
      score can range from 17 to 85, and a score of 50 is the best cut-off for making a diagnosis
      of PTSD, but there are many military SMs who have impaired function associated with scores
      below this level. There have also been some high-profile fatal shootings on military
      installations in recent years, including Fort Hood, TX, and the Washington Naval Yard in the
      District of Columbia, and such incidents tend to be followed by persistent symptoms in many
      individuals who were in the vicinity at the time. There is limited recent evidence to suggest
      that lower intensity intervention might be effective in those with subthreshold PTSD, even
      though it does not necessarily successfully treat fully developed PTSD. We will therefore
      conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial involving 144 individuals who are eligible for
      care in the military healthcare system who report subthreshold PCL scores (28 to 49), either
      within five years after their return from Afghanistan or Iraq, or after being affected in
      some significant way by a terrifying incident such as a bombing or shooting, or a major
      natural disaster that results in significant loss of life such as a hurricane, tornado, or
      earthquake. Seventy-two participants will be assigned to the resilience enhancement group,
      which will be initiated with a single 90-minute introduction to both cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) techniques and the use of smart-phone based applications (apps) that promote
      increased resilience through relaxation, biofeedback, psychoeducation and other techniques.
      Over the subsequent 6 weeks, daily text messages to all participants will accentuate the
      positive, including providing recommendations on beneficial activities, fostering behavioral
      changes, and in particular encouraging the completion of smart phone-based applications
      (apps). The control group (n=72) will be provided with an initial informational session
      providing them with details of where they can get help if they have worsened symptoms over
      time. They will receive daily texts with aphorisms for 6 weeks. Symptoms will be re-assessed
      with the PCL by personal computer (PC), tablet or smartphone based access to the NIH Clinical
      Trials Survey System (CTSS) for both the resilience enhancement and control groups at the end
      of each week in the 6-week training period. In addition the GAD, PHQ-9, and PCL will be
      assessed at baseline and 6weeks and at 3, 6 and 12 months. We anticipate that this relatively
      inexpensive resilience enhancement program will reduce the incidence of PTSD over the initial
      6 weeks by 20% compared to the control group, and that this improvement will be maintained
      over the subsequent year. We further expect that the training program will be associated with
      a reduction in the incidence of PTSD by at least 10% over the follow-up period. Our power
      estimates indicate that with 72 participants each in the resilience enhancement and control
      groups, we will have 90% power to identify a significant difference between the two groups
      with 95% confidence (p &lt; 0.05). For approximately 20% of participants (n=30; 15 in each
      group) we will perform psychophysiologic measures and functional MRI of the brain using the
      Affective Stroop paradigm at baseline and again 3-6 months later to assess for changes with
      resilience enhancement.

    <description>The PCL is a self-administered screen for PTSD (used both as a brief initial screen to confirm eligibility, and to provide a brief alternative in case some participants are unable to complete the more cumbersome CAPS at one or more follow-up intervals; demonstrates); a recent assessment of its psychometric properties in male veterans found very high internal consistency and convergent validity with the gold-standard CAPS (correlation, r=0.79). It should be noted that there is a military version of the PCL which we have used in prior studies that have involved solely military service members, the only difference between the military version and the more generalizable &quot;civilian&quot; version is the inclusion of the word &quot;military&quot; prior to &quot;stressful experience&quot; for 6 of the 17 items, so that there should not be a significant difference in the responses of service members who complete the civilian version, whereas the military version would not make sense for civilian participants</description>

    <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief screening instrument that is widely used to screen for and monitor the severity of depression. The GAD-7 provides similar validate efficacy in the screening and monitoring of anxiety spectrum disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, panic, social anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Both are elements of the PHQ, which was initially validated in 3000 primary care patients, including 500 at Walter Reed, where the PI of this protocol was the site PI.</description>

    <measure>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a potent, relatively novel method for objectively assessing the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder on the central nervous system. There are several variants of fMRI, but the most widely used, best studied method is known as BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent). Exposure to sensory stimuli results in neuronal activation in corresponding areas of the brain, which increases oxygen uptake in these areas. This results in a transient (3-6 seconds) decrease in blood oxygen levels in these areas, but there is a prompt response to increase blood flow to these areas, resulting in a more sustained increase in oxygenation which overwhelms the initial increase in extraction from these areas. T2-weighted images on fMRI show greater intensity in areas of increased oxygenation.</description>

The conditioning procedure will be used in which one of two conditioned stimuli (CS) will be paired with an aversive stimulus. Aversive stimuli will consist of airpuffs. There will be three phases: habituation, acquisition, and extinction. In the habituation phase, the CS will be presented without aversive stimuli. In the acquisition phase, the CS+ but not the CS- will be reinforced with an aversive stimulus. In the extinction phase, the two CS will not be reinforced.</description>

    <description>The resilience enhancement group will begin with a 90-minute session with the study psychologist, which will include a brief introduction to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but focus primarily on psychoeducational, relaxation techniques and planning positive activities. The majority of the time will be focused on reviewing techniques that promote stress management. Emphasis will be placed on relaxation approaches such as controlled breathing, meditation and yoga. Focus will also be aimed at reviewing how engagement in positive activities may help prevent avoidance, promote social support and wellness. Over the subsequent 6 weeks, daily text messages to all participants will accentuate the positive, including providing recommendations on beneficial activities to engage in, encouraging such activities including in vivo exposure, and fostering behavioral changes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must have had a deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan or exposure to a
             stressful event such as a domestic terrorist incident or natural disaster.

          2. Participants must be in the United States and have an I-phone or Android platform
             smart phone and a service plan that includes the ability to receive text messages.

          3. PTSD Checklist (PCL) score must be in the range of 28 to 49 at baseline.

          4. No active suicidal ideation, as manifest by a response of &quot;not at all&quot; to the PHQ-9
             question, &quot;Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by thoughts that
             you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?&quot; .This will be
             assessed after written informed consent is attained.

          5. No active PTSD diagnosis. This will be assessed by asking the participant and
             confirmed by the screening PCL and the baseline PCL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All participants must adhere to the above inclusion criteria. However for those wishing to
        taking part in the on-site assessment, the following additional exclusion criteria will
        prevent them from taking part in the on-site fMRI and physiologic assessments, though they
        will still be able to take part in the GETSmart resilience enhancement vs. control groups:

          1. Pregnancy: urine pregnancy tests will be performed on all females prior to the conduct
             of imaging studies both at baseline and follow-up assessments; women with positive
             tests upon baseline assessment will be excluded from the on-site assessment element;
             if a positive pregnancy test is identified at the follow up in-person assessment, the
             physiologic element will still be conducted but the MRI will not be performed.

          2. Individuals with shrapnel, body piercings that cannot be removed, or other imbedded
             metal resulting from either trauma or surgical procedures will be excluded from the
             in-person assessments due to the risk or displacement of metal with magnetic resonance
             imaging;

          3. Those with significant claustrophobia, including but not limited to intolerance of
             magnetic resonance imaging in the past, will be excluded from the in-person
             assessments, as we cannot provide sedating medications with the scans due to the
             potential impact of the medications on interpretation of scan results.

          4. Individuals who are on calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, nifedipine) or alpha
             blockers (e.g., prazosin, terazosin) who are unable to hold these medications for a
             24-hour period prior to scanning, will be excluded from the in-person assessments due
             to the impact of these medications on the interpretation of fMRI imaging.

          5. Those who are not eligible for care in the military healthcare system (DEERS-eligible)
             will be excluded from the in-person assessments.
