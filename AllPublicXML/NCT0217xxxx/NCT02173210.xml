      This project is examining genetic and metabolic markers for the use of 17 hydroxyprogesterone
      caproate (17OHPC) in pregnant women with a history of preterm birth (PTB). 17OHPC has been
      associated with a 30-35% reduction in repeat PTB in women carrying a singleton gestation.
      However, it is not well known why it works for some women but not for others. There are
      limited available interventions for the prevention of recurrent PTB. This study will enroll
      150 women at risk for PTB and eligible to receive 17OHPC, and expect that 80% will use 17OHPC
      and 20% will decline use. We will obtain blood samples and samples of cervical cells and
      cervical vaginal fluid. The objective of the study is to identify genetic, microbial and
      molecular markers that help to identify which women at risk for recurrent preterm birth will
      respond to 17OHPC and which women will not. The ultimate goal is to develop a personalized
      screening test based on these markers.

      Women with a prior preterm birth will be recruited between 16 and 22 weeks gestation. At this
      initial time point, samples of cervical epithelial cells and cervicovaginal fluid will be
      collected. Approximately 8 weeks later, those samples will be collected a second time, along
      with a blood sample. Outcome data will be collected after delivery.
