  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adequate level of bowel preparation is crucial for the efficacy and safety of colonoscopy.
      Strong evidences suggest that bowel-preparation quality shows an inverse correlation with
      length of the interval between the end of cleansing agent intake and the start of colonoscopy
      (shorter intervals are associated with better preparation levels). Accordingly, the use of a
      split-dose administration regimen has been demonstrated to significantly improve the quality
      of preparation, besides patient acceptability, as compared with standard administration the
      day before colonoscopy. All randomized controlled trials comparing split versus standard
      preparations were primarily aimed at assessing the quality of colon cleansing, by means of
      either validated or not-validated colon cleansing scales. The impact of a split dose regimen
      on objective colonoscopy performance measures such as adenoma detection rate (ADR) has never
      been specifically and prospectively evaluated.

      The present study is aimed at evaluating whether the split-dose preparation regimen is
      associated with an increase of adenoma detection.

      For this purpose, asymptomatic subjects aged 50-69, undergoing screening colonoscopy for
      positive immunologic fecal occult blood test are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      low-volume (2L) PEG plus ascorbic acid solution either in a split-dose (study arm) or in a
      full-dose regimen (control arm).

      Treatments are allocated using a computer-generated, randomized code list. The treatment
      allocation is concealed and is accomplished at the screening visit through non-research
      personnel who is not involved in the study. To ensure masking, the endoscopists who perform
      the colonoscopies are not involved in the randomization process and in the pre-procedure data
      collection.

      In this study the the primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with at least
      one adenoma (Adenoma Detection Rate) in each harm. Data on bowel cleansing, patient
      compliance, tolerability and acceptability were also collected.

      A sample size of at least 514 patients (257 in each arm) was calculated, by hypothesizing a
      relative increase of 25% in the adenoma detection rate in the split dose preparation group,
      assuming a 40% prevalence of one or more adenoma in FIT-positive patients undergoing
      screening colonoscopy (significance level 0.05, 90% power).

  <detailed_description>

      All participants will receive the same low-volume (2L) PEG plus ascorbic acid solution
      (MOVIPREP®*, Norgine, Harefield, United Kingdom; each liter containing 100.0 g macrogol 3350,
      7.5 g sodium sulfate,2.7 g sodium chloride, 1.0 g potassium chloride, 4.7 g ascorbic acid,
      5.9 g sodium ascorbate, and lemon or orange flavoring).

      Patients allocated in the &quot;control arm&quot; will receive the whole preparation the day before
      colonoscopy, whereas, patient randomly allocated to the &quot;active treatment&quot; will take one
      liter of the bowel preparation the evening before the procedure and the remaining liter the
      day of the procedure.

      Participants will also receive a standardized low-fiber diet before the colonoscopy, avoiding
      fruit, legumes or vegetables for 3 days before the procedure. They will have a normal
      breakfast and a light lunch on the day before the procedure, but no solid food will be
      permitted since then. Liquid food (e.g., clear soup or yoghurt) will be permitted for the
      evening meal. Clear fluids can be taken at any time, until 2 hours before the procedure.

      Treatments are allocated using a computer-generated, randomized code list. The treatment
      allocation is concealed and is accomplished at the screening visit through non-research
      personnel who is not involved in the study. To ensure masking, the endoscopists who perform
      the colonoscopies are not involved in the randomization process and in the pre-procedure data
      collection.

      Data on patient compliance, tolerability and acceptability are collected on the morning of
      colonoscopy, immediately before the procedure, by a nurse questioned through a standardised
      questionnaire. The endoscopist is not allowed to take part in the questioning or to supervise
      the questionnaire.
