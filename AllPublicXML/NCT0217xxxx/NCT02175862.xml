  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In May 2010 the first danish physician-staffed Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (PS-HEMS)
      was implemented in Region Zealand and the Capital Region (excluding Bornholm) of Denmark.

      In relation to the introduction of PS-HEMS, a team of collaborators lead by Rasmus
      Hesselfeldt, conducted an observational study to investigate the possible effects on time to
      definitive care, secondary transfers and 30-day mortality in a &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; design.

      Results showed reduced time from first dispatch to arrival at the trauma centre from 218 min
      to 90 min. Secondary transfers to the trauma centre dropped from 50 % to 34 % and 30-day
      mortality significantly reduced from 29 % to 14 % in the year after implementation.

      The present study is an observational cohort study with long-term follow-up of the same
      trauma population as mentioned above. Patients were followed until may 1st, 2014.

      Primary outcome is early retirement and secondary outcomes are quality of life and mortality.

      The investigators hypothesize that a greater proportion of trauma patients in the &quot;after&quot;
      period will remain in occupation after approx. 3 to 4.5 years compared with trauma patients
      treated in the &quot;before&quot; period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients treated by a trauma team in the catchment area of PS-HEMS.

        For all labor market attachment analysis the investigators only include patients between 18
        to 60 years of age. For all other analysis (mortality and quality of life) there are no age
        limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients transported by private means or by the police.

          -  Patients who at the emergency department were categorized as non-trauma patients.
