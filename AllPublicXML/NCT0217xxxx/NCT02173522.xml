  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pre-operative prostate artery embolization
      (PAE) reduces intra-operative blood loss and improves surgical outcomes among prostate cancer
      patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP).

      Duration of study:

      This study will enroll 20 patients, with a target enrollment period of 18 months. Patients
      who undergo prostate artery embolization (PAE) will have follow-up visits 2 weeks and 6 weeks
      after PAE. All patients in the study will have post RALRP follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after surgery. All patients will continue to be
      followed according to the usual standard of care following the completion of the study.

      Study design:

      The first 10 patients who meet all study eligibility criteria and provide consent for
      participation in the study will receive PAE prior to RALRP. Control patients will be matched
      1:1 to PAE patients, according to risk score, and will receive RALRP without PAE. Control
      patients will be selected after all PAE patients have been enrolled, and need not meet all
      study eligibility criteria.

      The following assessments and evaluations are required for participation in this study:

      Physical exams, blood &amp; urine tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital rectal exams
      (DREs), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)
      questionnaires, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaires,
      robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP), and pad weight tests. All patients
      enrolled in the PAE arm of the study will undergo embolization of the blood vessels that feed
      the prostate.
