  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to explore the effect of multiple oral doses of itraconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of ASP1707 in healthy female subjects. This study will
      also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of ASP1707 alone and in
      combination with itraconazole.

             agree not to try to become pregnant during the study and for 28 days after the final
             study drug administration, must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Day -1 and, if
             heterosexually active, agree to consistently use two forms of highly effective form of
             birth control starting at screening and throughout the study period and for 28 days
             after the final study drug administration.

          -  Female subject must not be breastfeeding at screening or during the study period, and
             for 28 days after the final study drug administration.

          -  Female subject must not donate ova starting at screening and throughout the study
             period, and for 28 days after the final study drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subject who has been pregnant within 6 months prior to screening assessment or
             breast feeding within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Subject uses grapefruit (more than 3x 200 mL) or marmalade (more than three times) in
             the week prior to admission to the Clinical Unit until ESV, as reported by the
             subject.

          -  Subject is a vulnerable subject (e.g., subject kept in detention).
