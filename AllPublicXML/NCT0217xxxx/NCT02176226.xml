      This study will evaluate a Smartphone intervention for depression and anxiety that uses
      machine learning to tailor treatment for patients. The intervention, referred to as
      IntelliCare, delivers patient-specific treatment material and motivational messaging via a
      mobile phone, to help individuals with depression and/or anxiety. Information and data
      received from the patient will inform the tailored treatment approach through machine
      learning. The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary information on the feasibility
      and effectiveness of IntelliCare in improving symptoms of depression and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder, with up to 10.3% of the
      population experiencing the disorder in a given 12-month period. The relationship between
      depression and anxiety has been well documented. Depression is a significant predictor of
      future anxiety, and anxiety is a significant predictor of future onset of depression. Indeed,
      studies find that more than 50% of all individuals with MDD also have a current anxiety
      disorder. Although effective treatments have been developed over the years to address
      depression and anxiety, the lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs
      or preferences contributes to poor treatment adherence and outcomes.

      We are developing an intelligent treatment system that uses state of the art machine learning
      approaches within a mobile intervention application to treat MDD and anxiety. Machine
      learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that
      automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. The intervention, called
      IntelliCare, uses a mobile application to continuously collect patient data and adapt
      intervention content and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and
      user-responsive treatment system.

      During the pilot study, 200 participants with Major Depression and/or Anxiety will use
      Intellicare apps for up to 8 weeks and may be invited to provide feedback about their
      experience at two follow-up time points: weeks 4 and 8. All participants will first undergo
      initial assessments that will include a telephone interview and a series of online
      questionnaires about their mood. Eligible participants will receive up to 8 weeks of access
      to the IntelliCare system, which consists of apps with lessons and tools designed to teach
      skills for mood management. It is suggested that participants utilize the mobile phone tools
      every day. Each week, participants will receive a brief motivational intervention from a
      coach. This coach will also be available to participants via email throughout the 8 week
      study. We will use data from the pilot study to examine whether IntelliCare is a feasible and
      effective intervention. Data collected will also be used to develop and evaluate machine
      learning methods which will be used in the subsequent AIM trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets criteria for clinically significant symptoms of depression or anxiety using
             self-report measures used in screening for depression, as well as interviewer
             administered measures to ensure symptoms are not transitory and have been present for
             at least two weeks.

          -  Is familiar with the use of mobile phones

          -  Has any psychiatric condition for which participation in a clinical trial of
             psychotherapy may be either inappropriate or dangerous (e.g., psychotic disorders,
             bipolar disorders, dissociative disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, severe post
             traumatic stress disorder, etc.).

          -  Exhibits severe suicidality, including ideation, plan, and intent.

             changes for 2 weeks and do not intend to change the dose will be eligible. Those who
             have been on the antidepressant or anxiolytic for less than 2 weeks or intend to have
             their medication optimized will be asked to wait for screening until they meet the
