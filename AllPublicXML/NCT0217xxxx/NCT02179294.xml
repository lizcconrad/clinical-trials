  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childbirth can be an extremely painful and the provision of pain relief during labour is a
      vital component of a positive maternal experience. The majority of women who deliver in
      modern obstetric units choose a pharmacological method of pain relief, including Entonox, the
      injection of opioids or epidural placement. The commonest opioid used in labour is pethidine
      administered by intramuscular (im) injection. The effectiveness of pain relief provided by
      pethidine has long been challenged. Its shortcomings are more serious when set against known
      side effects including maternal sedation, nausea and potential transfer across the placenta
      to the foetus. More than a third of women who receive pethidine subsequently require an
      epidural due to inadequate pain relief. Epidurals provide highly effective pain relief, but
      increase the risk of a forceps or suction delivery resulting in prolonged hospital stay.
      Therefore, there is a clear need for a safe, effective, easy to administer analgesic
      alternative.

      Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) comprises drug administration into an intravenous drip
      with a small dose given each time a woman presses a button, giving her control over her own
      pain relief. The pump is programmed to ensure that the maximum dose allowable is within the
      safe range. This form of delivery of pain relief matches the drug dose to pain sensation
      within the relevant time frame, which is not possible using a single dose intramuscular
      injection. Whilst PCA is in widespread use for acute pain relief it has only a limited role
      in obstetrics. The most common drug given by PCA is morphine, however, since it has a long
      duration of action and crosses the placenta, the potential for accumulation in the foetus and
      consequent neonatal sedation at delivery restricts its utility (within obstetrics) to
      contexts where neonatal status is not relevant, such as intra-uterine foetal death or foetal
      abnormality incompatible with survival.

      Remifentanil is a novel synthetic opioid with a very rapid onset (blood-brain equilibration
      1.2-1.4 minutes) and short duration of action (context specific half-life 3 minutes), giving
      it an analgesic profile which potentially makes it ideal for providing pain relief over 1-2
      uterine contractions after a single intravenous dose. It is subject to rapid redistribution
      and metabolism by non-specific blood and tissue esterases negating the potential for
      accumulation in mother or foetus. Administration of remifentanil by PCA has been investigated
      in several small studies in comparison to pethidine and shown to provide useful, although not
      complete, pain relief in labour.10-12 Thus far, there is no evidence of detrimental neonatal
      effects in comparison to other opioids.
