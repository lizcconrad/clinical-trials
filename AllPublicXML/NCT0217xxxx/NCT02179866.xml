        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male participants, 35 to 64 years of age, inclusive

          -  For men with a female partner of child-bearing potential: Agreement to use two methods
             of contraception, including one barrier method e.g. condom, during the treatment
             period and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug

          -  Participants who do not intend to donate sperm until at least 3 months after the last
             dose of the study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic,
             broncho-pulmonary, neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, endocrinological,
             hematological or allergic disease, metabolic disorder, cancer or cirrhosis

          -  Any personal or familial history of seizures, epilepsy or other convulsive condition,
             previous significant head trauma, or other factors predisposing to seizures

          -  Any major illness within one month before the screening examination or any febrile
             illness within one week prior to screening and up to first dose administration

          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with, or treatment of which
             might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to a subject

          -  History or presence of any clinically relevant ECG abnormalities, cardiovascular or
             cerebrovascular disease

          -  History of myopathy or muscle disorder

          -  History or evidence of any medical condition potentially altering the absorption,
             metabolism or elimination of drugs

          -  Any CYP3A inhibitor within 2 weeks or within 5 times the elimination half-life,
             whichever is longer, prior to dosing

             whichever is longer, prior to dosing

          -  Infrequent bowel movements (less than once per 24 hours on average)
