  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to assess safety, pharmacokinetics and the effect of BIBR 953
      ZW on coagulation parameters of BIBR 953 ZW after oral single doses of the prodrug, BIBR 1048
      MS, in healthy male subjects. This was the first administration of this substance to humans.
