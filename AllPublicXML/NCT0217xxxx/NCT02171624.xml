    <textblock>
      Open-label, two-way crossover design with a quinidine sulfate run-in period followed by a
      randomised sequence of dabigatran etexilate plus quinidine sulfate or dabigatran etexilate
      alone to evaluate the safety of co-administration of dabigatran etexilate and quinidine. and
      the pharmacokinetic interaction between quinidine and dabigatran etexilate.
