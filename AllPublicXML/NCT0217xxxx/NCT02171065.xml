  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study has two components, an overall prospective observational study using
      multimodality imaging (PROSPECT II) that will examine the natural history of patients with
      unstable atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with the specific goal to establish the
      utility of low risk intracoronary imaging modalities, Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) and
      Near InfraRed Spectroscopy(NIRS), to identify plaques prone to future rupture and clinical
      events. Due to the difficulty of interpreting the IVUS images, this study will be, however,
      using Plaque Burden (PB) ≥65% as the primary threshold defining vulnerable plaques. However,
      sensitivity analyses will be run for patients and lesions with PB≥70%. The randomized
      PROSPECT ABSORB sub-study will examine whether treatment of vulnerable plaques with the
      ABSORB Bioresobable Vascular Scaffold (BVS) plus Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT)
      safely increases the Minimal Lumean Diameter (MLA) at 25 month compared with GDMTalone.

        PROSPECT II

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Troponin positive ACS (STEMI &gt;12 h or NSTEMI) occurring within the prior 2 weeks of
             enrollment, with symptoms consistent with acute ischemia lasting &gt;10 minutes, intended
             for angiography and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) if appropriate.

          2. Patient must have one-vessel, two-vessel or three-vessel disease in native coronary
             arteries requiring PCI.

          3. Successful PCI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min.

          2. Cardiogenic shock, decompensated hypotension or heart failure requiring intubation,
             inotropes, intravenous diuretics or a hemodynamic support device.

          3. Patient has a known hypersensitivity, allergy or contraindication to any of the
             following: aspirin, both heparin and bivalirudin, all 3 of clopidogrel, prasugrel and
             ticagrelor, or to contrast that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          4. Refractory ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation)
             requiring either intravenous pharmacologic treatment or defibrillation during the
             index PCI procedure.

          5. Persistent acute conduction system disease requiring temporary pacemaker insertion
             during the index PCI procedure.

          6. Prior Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) at any time or planned CABG.

          7. PCI is required of the left main coronary artery, or a left main stenosis is present
             with a visually estimated angiographic Diameter Stenosis (DS) of &gt;30%.

          8. Angiographic evidence of severe calcification and/or marked tortuosity of the target
             (culprit) or a non-culprit vessel is present that would preclude the feasibility of
             safe imaging of at least the proximal 6 cm of all vessels.

          9. The presence of a chronic total occlusion of a major epicardial coronary vessel that
             is not successfully recanalized during the PCI procedure, and thus would preclude
             intravascular imaging.

        PROSPECT ABSORB

        Inclusion Criteria:

        if one or more eligible lesions are identified which meet all of the following angiographic
        criteria:

          1. The lesion is a de novo lesion (may be located in either the target or non-target
             vessel)

          2. The lesion has an angiographic diameter stenosis &lt;70%, and is not intended for
             revascularization based on angiographic criteria and Fractional Flow
             Reserve/Instantaneous wave-free ratio (FFR/iFR).

             Note: FFR/iFR should be performed on all noncritical lesions of greater than 40%
             visually estimated angiographic stenosis that are candidates for the ABSORB substudy.

          3. The lesion has a site-determined IVUS plaque burden in at least one frame ≥70%. Note:
             Such a lesion may or may not be angiographically evident; i.e. the visually estimated
             angiographic diameter stenosis may range between 0% - &lt;70%.

          4. The reference vessel diameter of an eligible lesion is ≥2.5 mm - ≤4.0 mm (visually
             estimated) capable of being treated with a 2.5 mm, 3.0 mm, or 3.5 mm diameter BVS.

          5. The lesion length of an eligible lesion is ≤50 mm (visually estimated), capable of
             being treated by no more than two BVS (maximum length of each BVS 28 mm), allowing for
             2 mm BVS overlap and 2 mm of &quot;normal&quot; reference segment treatment at each edge.

          6. The lesion must be at least 10 mm from a previously implanted stent/scaffold and an
             intervening 10 mm segment must not have plaque burden (PB) &gt;50%

          7. A bifurcation lesion may be enrolled only if the side branch is a) ≤2.5 mm in
             reference vessel diameter, AND b) has either no lesion requiring treatment, or
             atherosclerotic disease limited to within 5 mm of its origin from the parent vessel
             such that the operator believes that the side branch can be successfully treated with
             balloon angioplasty only (without a stent). If a stent subsequently becomes necessary,
             only a metallic drug-eluting stent (DES; XIENCE strongly recommended) may be used to
             treat the side branch with a T-stent technique.

          8. Randomization must occur immediately after the 3-vessel imaging run in the PROSPECT II
             protocol. If the patient randomizes to BVS, BVS placement must be performed
             immediately after randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The randomized lesion cannot be within 10 mm of a lesion previously treated by PCI .

          2. The randomized lesion may not be in the left main coronary artery.

          3. The randomized lesion may not be an ostial Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery
             (LAD) or ostial Left Circumflex Coronary Artery (LCX) lesion (defined as within 3 mm
             of the left main coronary artery).

          4. The randomized lesion may not be an ostial Right Coronary Artery (RCA) lesion (defined
             as within 3 mm of the aorto-ostium).

          5. Angiographic evidence of severe calcification and/or marked tortuosity of the target
             vessel and/or lesion intended for randomization is present that would make it unlikely
             that the BVS could be advanced to or across the lesion or be adequately expanded.
