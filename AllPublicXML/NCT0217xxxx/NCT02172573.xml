    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SND 919 (pramipexole)
      tablets administered in combination with L-dopa in patients with Parkinson's disease using
      placebo and bromocriptine tablets as comparators in a double-blind design (phase III
      comparative study).
