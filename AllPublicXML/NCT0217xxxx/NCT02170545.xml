  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Displaced, multi-part intracapsular, proximal humerus fractures represent a major challenge
      for patients and orthopedic surgeons. Proximal humerus fractures represent the third most
      common fracture after hip and distal radius fractures, and more than 20% of these fractures
      meet operative indications. Unfortunately, one of the major complications of these fractures
      is the development of avascular necrosis (AVN), or death of the bone as a result of the loss
      of blood supply to it. Currently, the ability to predict AVN is limited. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if computed tomography imaging can identify a quantifiable predictor of
      AVN following this type of humeral fracture.

      Current surgical treatment of humeral head fracture does not follow a universally accepted
      treatment algorithm. Treatment guidelines are lacking sufficient prospective controlled
      evidence to support any one option as doctrine. However, the generally accepted dogma
      regarding the surgical treatment of fractures considered high-risk for Avascular Necrosis
      (AVN), and also symptomatic avascular necrosis of the humeral head, is shoulder replacement
      (arthroplasty). This is a difficult scenario for younger patients where humeral head
      preservation is the priority, because of a expected lifespan that will require one, if not
      multiple, arthroplasty revisions. There is data suggesting no difference in functional
      outcome for complx humeral head fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation
      (ORIF), that late progress to AVN, and patients who undergo hemi-arthroplasty, because of
      risk of AVN. However, failure of surgery related to AVN remains a challenging problem often
      leading to secondary surgery, which is not without negative outcomes. This study is aimed at
      trying to come up with a predictor that can be applied to patients prior to initial humeral
      head fracture treatment.

      The specific aims of the study to help determine this predictor are:

        1. In patients who have humeral head fracture, evaluate the difference in fracture fragment
           enhancement in multi-part fractures, by comparing the fracture fragment attenuation on
           iodine map overlay to the non-traumatized, contralateral humeral head using Dual Energy
           Computed Tomography (DECT).

        2. In patients undergoing ORIF or joint replacement for humeral head fracture without known
           risk factors for AVN, identify the relationship between the attenuation due to iodine in
           the fractured humeral head, as measured preoperatively by DECT, with the presence of
           pulsatile blood flow in the humeral head intra-operatively, as measured with laser
           doppler.

        3. In patients undergoing joint replacement for humeral head fracture without other known
           risk factors for AVN, identify the relationship between the attenuation due to iodine in
           the fractured humeral head, as measured preoperatively by DECT, with the presence of AVN
           in humeral head pathology specimen.

        4. In patients who underwent ORIF for humeral head fracture without other known risk
           factors for AVN, identify the relationship between the attenuation due to iodine within
           the fractured humeral head, as measured preoperatively by DECT, with the incidence of
           radiographically apparent AVN after 2 years of clinical follow-up.

    <description>All patients who have humeral head fractures will have a dual energy CT examination performed with intravenous contrast to evaluate the fracture pattern to determine if the patient is a surgical candidate. The amount of contrast within the fractured humeral head will be measured on this CT scan as a surrogate for blood flow. After conservative (no surgery) or surgical (open reduction internal fixation) treatment, the patient will be followed in the orthopedics clinic for two years. During each twice yearly visit, shoulder radiographs will be obtained. Standardized criteria for radiograph assessment to determine AVN will be used: mixed lucent and sclerotic appearance of the humeral head, subchondral collapse as indicated by a &quot;crescent sign&quot; and/or loss of humeral head sphericity. AVN will be described as present or absent based on the radiographic findings. The incidence of AVN will be correlated with the amount of contrast within the humeral head as measured by dual energy CT.</description>

      For those patients who undergo shoulder replacement, the humeral head bone will be collected
      and processed for any evidence of avascular necrosis. Once processing and data collection is
      done, the bone will be disposed of.
