    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of OPT-80
      versus vancomycin in subjects with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel group study. The subjects who meet
      all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized, and will
      orally receive either OPT-80 twice daily or vancomycin powder four times daily for 10 days. A
      follow-up investigation will be performed 28 (±3) days after the completion of study drug
      administration.
