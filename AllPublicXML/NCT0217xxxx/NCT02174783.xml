    <textblock>
      Many metabolic complications can develop after liver transplant including: diabetes, high
      blood pressure, obesity, heart attacks and stroke. The goal of this study is to look at the
      safety and effect of 2 well known and established diet regimens on the people who had a prior
      liver transplant and investigate whether it helps with the control of these comorbidities.

    <textblock>
      The Mediterranean diet has been shown to be effective in improving hepatic steatosis, insulin
      sensitivity, diabetes control and reducing cardiovascular risk in adult patients, but there
      is no data available for patients who underwent liver transplant. The protein-sparing
      modified fast (PSMF) diet has been used for years at the Cleveland Clinic to treat adult
      patients with obesity-related medical problems, but its safety and efficacy has not been
      established in liver transplant recipients.
