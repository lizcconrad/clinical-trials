      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare group and
      individual CPT-C for the treatment of PTSD in OIF/OEF military personnel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estimates indicate that between 100,000 and 300,000 Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and
      Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans are at significant risk for chronic post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), which can become a chronic disorder that impacts all areas of a
      person's life. PTSD treatment programs are being developed throughout the Department of
      Defense (DoD) and the Veterans Affairs (VA), but because of the large number of Service
      Members returning from deployment with PTSD, it is often necessary to provide psychotherapy
      in groups. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an evidence-based treatment for PTSD, was
      originally developed as a group-based intervention. However, group-based CPT treatment has
      never been systematically compared to individual CPT treatment. The public policy
      implications of the results of this trial are significant. If both treatment formats are
      equivalent or if group treatment is better, then group treatment would be a more efficient
      and cost-effective therapy modality in most cases. On the other hand, if individual therapy
      is found to be superior, the investment of greater resources into individual therapy will be
      justified in order to provide the most effective treatment for PTSD to military personnel.
      The purpose of this study is to compare group-administered CPT-Cognitive-only version (CPT-C)
      to individual CPT-C for the treatment of PTSD in OIF/OEF military personnel. Three hundred
      (300) adult male and female active-duty OIF/OEF military personnel over 18 years of age will
      be enrolled into this study. Participants will be randomized between group and individual
      CPT-C.

    <description>The BDI-II is one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms. It consists of 21 items that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders. Each item is composed of four statements that reflect symptom severity. The statements are scaled from 0 (no disturbance) to 3 (maximal disturbance). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score.</description>
