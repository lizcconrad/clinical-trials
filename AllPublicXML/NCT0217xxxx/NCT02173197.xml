  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no studies that demonstrate that the intervention of Occupational Therapy
      (OT) in patients considered to be complex, regardless of diagnosis, could improve clinical
      and functional outcome for the patient.

      For this reason, we intend to undertake a study that will allow us to deepen the knowledge
      about the impact of the OT on in-hospital patients considered &quot;complex&quot; according to the
      assessment by the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale (RCS ).

      Our hypothesis is that the intervention of OT can improve their care by qualified and focused
      on the needs of the person interventions.

      We will therefore first af all to implement an observational pilot study, aimed at defining
      the characteristics and needs of the population in question, and the OT intervention
      &quot;protocol&quot;. This information will then be used to implement a subsequent randomized
      controlled trial designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the OT intervention on the
      basis of clinically relevant outcome measures.

    <description>Through the initial evaluation of the complex patients' needs, the OT will propose a targeted intervention to the needs emerged and decide which approach will use to achieve the goal (i.e. compensatory or restorative).
We will describe the characteristics of the population included and identify common needs and problems of the complex patients through the COPM.
The needs and problems identified will be grouped into macro-areas, and the OT will propose the appropriate treatment on the basis of the area identified, the patient's needs and the available resources regardless of the origin of the disease.</description>
