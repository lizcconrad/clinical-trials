    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well brief mindful mediation practice works in
      improving quality of life in patients with cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Brief mindful
      mediation practice may improve the well-being and quality of life of patients with cancer who
      are undergoing radiation therapy by increasing levels of mindfulness and reducing stress,
      anxiety/depression, and fatigue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the feasibility of a clinical trial using a brief mindful meditation
      practice during radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the measurable changes in quality of life, fatigue, and mindfulness while using
      a brief mindful meditation practice during radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients use brief mindful meditation practice (sitting meditation in which the mind is
      guided to focus in the present, thinking of your existence, and allowing sensations to arise
      with an openness and curiosity) over 12 minutes daily for 14 days during radiation therapy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up 4-12 weeks after completion of radiation
      therapy.
