  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study of safety and immunogenicity of an A/H5N1 inactivated whole
      cell vaccine manufactured by the IVAC in Vietnam when given in two injections in two doses
      (low and high) compared to a placebo in 76 healthy adult subjects in Vietnam.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Seventy-six healthy
      male and female adults, 18 to 30 years of age, will be enrolled into the trial. Subjects will
      be randomized to one of three treatment allocations: 32 subjects to 7.5 mcg/dose vaccine (low
      dose), 32 subjects to 15 mcg/dose vaccine (high dose) and 12 subjects to placebo. This sample
      size was selected to enable at least 30 evaluable subjects in each of the groups receiving
      active vaccine. The study will utilize a &quot;block randomization&quot; to assure a balance of 8:8:3
      vaccine and placebo when all subjects are enrolled. The study will be double blinded, meaning
      the study subjects, investigators, and the sponsor will be unaware of the treatment allocated
      to each subject until the clinical trial database is declared final and locked.

      Since this is a first-in-human study, all injections of study product will be sequential and
      staggered and there will be a safety evaluation between a sentinel cohort of 19 subjects and
      the remaining 57 study subjects for both the 1st and 2nd doses in the study.

      A sentinel group of 19 participants' enrollment and vaccination will precede the remainder of
      the study group by approximately 2-3 weeks.

      Product administration for both injections of vaccine or placebo will be sequential and
      staggered.

    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity will be measured by anti-influenza serum testing done from 3 separate visits in the study: Screening (for baseline) and after each injection. Measurements include:
The proportion of subjects achieving a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer â‰¥ 1:40 after each dose;
the proportion of subjects achieving a four-fold rise in HAI between doses or from baseline to post-Injection 2;
the proportion of subjects achieving a four-fold rise in neutralizing antibody titer between doses or from baseline to post-Injection 2;
the geometric mean titer (GMT) of HAI after each dose;
the geometric mean titer of neutralizing antibody after each dose;
the geometric mean titer ratio of HAI antibody between doses or from baseline to post-Injection 2; and
the geometric mean titer ratio of neutralizing antibody between doses or from baseline to post-Injection 2.</description>
