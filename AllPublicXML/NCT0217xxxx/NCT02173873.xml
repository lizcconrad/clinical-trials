    <textblock>
      Aflibercept is FDA approved and the same molecule is available as hyperosmolar for oncology
      (cost 800 USD for 4ml) and isoosmolar for Ophthalmology (cost 1,770 USD for 0.05ml
      injection). The 4ml bottle can be fractionated to be used in 40 patients hence the 0.05 ml
      injection would cost 20 USD for patients. Animal studies showed the injection is safe,
      knowing that the rabbit vitreous volume is 3-4 times smaller than the human eye. Our pilot
      study is to ascertain if the approved molecule for oncology when injected in the eye is safe
      as it is diluted into 5ml vitreous (100 times dilution). If this is so then we can save the
      patient 100 times for the most efficient antiVEGF that is used for maculopathy in various
      diseases (AMD, DME, CRVO, etc..)

      Protocol Inject 0.05 ml of zaltrap coumpounded in a sterile way into the vitreous of blind
      eyes (vision less than 20/100) with various diseases of the retina that require antiVEGF
      therapy after patient consent. Vision will be monitored 15 minutes, 1 day and 1 week after
      injection. SD-OCT will be performed before and after 1 week to look for possible side
      effects.

      The safety and efficacy of Eylea in the treatment of macular edema following CRVO3,4 were
      assessed in 2 randomized, multicenter, double-masked, sham-controlled studies: COPERNICUS and
      GALILEO. A total of 358 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with Eylea) in
      the two studies. In both, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg Eylea
      administered every 4 weeks, or sham injections (control group) administered every 4 weeks for
      a total of 6 injections. After 6 monthly injections, patients continued to receive Eylea
      treatment during weeks 24 to 52 only if they met pre-specified retreatment criteria (PRN),
      except for patients in the sham control group in the GALILEO study who continued to receive
      sham injections through week 52. In the COPERNICUS study, after 6 months, 56% of patients
      receiving Eylea 2 mg monthly gained at least 15 letters of BCVA from baseline, as measured by
      ETDRS, compared to 12% of patients receiving sham injections (p&lt;0.01), the primary endpoint
      of the study. Patients receiving Eylea 2 mg monthly gained, on average, 17.3 letters of
      vision compared to a mean loss of 4.0 letters with sham control injections (p&lt;0.01), a
      secondary endpoint.

      Ziv-aflibercept or zaltrap6 (Sanofi-Aventis US, LLC, Bridgewater, NJ/Regeneron
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Tarrytown, NY) is FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic
      colorectal cancer. During Bascom Palmer Eye Institute's Angiogenesis, Exudation, and
      Degeneration February 2014 conference, Michel Eid Farah, Jo√£o R. Dias, Fernando M. Penha, and
      Eduardo B. Rodrigues investigated the safety of ziv-aflibercept in vitro and in vivo. In
      vitro toxicity was verified using ARPE-19 cultured cells exposed to anti-angiogenic vs
      balanced salt solution (BSS) for 10 minutes. Viability was assessed by
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which evaluates
      cell viability by mitochondrial activity. No signs of cell toxicity were observed, and cell
      viability was similar for ziv-aflibercept, aflibercept, and BSS. For the in vivo study, they
      tested 1 injection of 0.05 mL ziv-aflibercept vs aflibercept in the right eyes of 18 rabbits,
      9 eyes in each group. BSS was injected in the fellow eyes and served as control. After the
      injections, all animals were examined by funduscopy, SD-OCT), and ERG at baseline, 24 hours,
      and 7 days. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were collected at baseline, 24 hours, and 7
      days for pH and osmolarity analysis. The animals were sacrificed and the eyes were enucleated
      for morphologic study by light and electron microscopy. No abnormalities were found at 24
      hours or 7 days after intravitreal injection of either drug when assessed by fundus exam and
      SD-OCT, ERG, and histology as well as transmission microscopy. There were also no changes in
      osmolarity in the aqueous humor or vitreous samples in any group after 24 hours and 1 week.
