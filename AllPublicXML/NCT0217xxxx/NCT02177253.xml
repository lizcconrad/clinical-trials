  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare the long-term (12-week) bronchodilator
      efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / salbutamol combination administered by the
      Respimat® 40 mcg / 200 mcg (one inhalation q.i.d.) to COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (two
      inhalations q.i.d.), ipratropium bromide Respimat® (one inhalation q.i.d.) and Placebo
      formulations of each in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). An
      additional objective was to show the superiority of Combivent Respimat as compared to
      ipratropium bromide (40 mcg) Respimat. Steady state pharmacokinetics over one dosing interval
      following four weeks of therapy were also characterized.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and the following spirometric criteria:

               -  Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2: Patients must have relatively stable, moderate
                  to severe airway obstruction with an FEV1 ≤65% of predicted normal and FEV1 ≤70%
                  of FVC

          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older

          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than ten pack-years. A pack-year is
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year

          -  Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests and maintain records during
             the study period as required in the protocol

             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may

             study

          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or

          -  Patients who have a total blood eosinophil count ≥600/mm3

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., one year or less) of myocardial infarction

             cystic fibrosis or clinically evident bronchiectasis

          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history of a thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion
             criterion No. 1

          -  Patients with a history of asthma or allergic rhinitis

          -  Patients with a history of and/or active alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis

          -  Patients with an upper or lower respiratory tract infection or COPD exacerbation in
             the 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period

          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction

          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma

          -  Patients with current significant psychiatric disorders

             in the investigator's opinion will be unable to abstain from the use of oxygen therapy

          -  Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium

          -  Patients who are being treated with antihistamines for any excluded allergic
             conditions

          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than 6
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day

          -  Patients who initiated use of an inhaled steroid or changed doses less than 6 weeks
             prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period

          -  Patients who are being treated with beta-blocker medications, MAO (monoamine oxidase)
             inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. Beta blocker eye medications (e.g., Betoptic)
             for treatment of non-narrow angle glaucoma are allowed

          -  Patients who have had changes in their therapeutic plan within the last 6 weeks prior
             to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs or any component of the
             ipratropium bromide/salbutamol Respimat® solution (including BAC (Benzalkonium
             chloride) and EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)) or the ipratropium
             bromide/salbutamol MDI components
