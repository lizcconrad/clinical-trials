  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tocilizumab works in treating chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) in patients that have not responded to treatment after at least two prior
      therapies. Tocilizumab blocks a protein that stimulates the body's immune system. By blocking
      this protein, the investigators may reduce the symptoms of chronic GVHD.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Efficacy will be determined by the proportion of patients with failure free survival (FFS)
      at 6 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at 6 months based on
      clinician judged response.

      II. Patients achieving a CR or PR by objective response measures at 6 months.

      III. Failure-free survival (FFS) at 1 year.

      IV. Change in steroid dose from enrollment to 6 months (mo).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Biologic studies will be done to determine possible mechanisms of response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tocilizumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 12 weeks (weeks
      1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) and then every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (weeks 13, 17, and 21).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
