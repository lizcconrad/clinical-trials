    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study of patients, treated with one daily dose of Zomacton or one daily
      dose of Genotropin in the previously completed FE 999905 CS07 trial, who had presence of
      anti-hGH antibodies at any post-dosing visit during the 12-month treatment period. No
      investigational medicinal product will be administered in connection with this follow-up
      study. Eligible patients will attend one visit in this follow-up study.
