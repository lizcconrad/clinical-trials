    <textblock>
      Regeneration of mature cells that produce functional insulin represents a major focus of
      current diabetes research aimed at restoring beta cell mass in patients with most forms of
      diabetes. The capacity to adapt in response to diverse physiological conditions during life
      and the consequent ability to cope for increased metabolic demands is a distinctive feature
      of the endocrine pancreas in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Both beta and alpha cells
      are dynamically regulated to continually maintain a balance between proliferation,
      neogenesis, and apoptosis. In this proposal, the investigators will focus on exploring key
      mechanism(s) that potentially regulate islet cell plasticity in altered glucose metabolic
      states.

      Investigators will explore in a unique cohort of individuals who undergo duodenal
      pancretectomy. Prior to their surgery will be performed in vivo studies (Hyperglycemic clamp,
      Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic clamp and Mixed Meal Tests) to accurately assess glucose
      homeostasis parameters to classify each individual into metabolic phenotypes. Then exploit
      the opportunity to collect pancreas samples from these patients who will be evaluated again
      after surgery, the investigators will determine the ability of the remnant pancreas to
      compensate for the acute reduction in islet mass and perform correlations between ex vivo and
      in vivo parameters.

      Specifically, the patients will be subjected to incretin secretion (mixed meal), metabolic
      status (OGTT), insulin secretion characteristics (first and second phase responses), β-cell
      insulin content evaluation (arginine bolus). Subsequently, pancreas samples will be evaluated
      for morphometry, and proteomics and gene expression analyses of islet cell samples obtain by
      laser capture will allow a detailed investigation of mechanisms that contribute to islet
      plasticity. The overall goal of this project is to investigate key mechanisms driving the
      ability of islet mass to adapt to diverse metabolic states. We aim to explore modifications
      in gene expression and proteomics and correlate them with specific metabolic phenotypes, in
      order to determine key regulators of islet morphology.

        Patients scheduled for elective pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary neoplasms will be
        enrolled in the study. Indications for surgery will be periampullary neoplasms, i.e.

        tumors of the Vater's ampulla, distal CBD and periampullary duodenum. Patients with
        pancreatic cancer will be excluded from the study. The metabolic features of all patients
        will be assessed before and after surgery. The patients will visit the Division of
        Endocrinology for studies at least 1 week before surgery. Only patients with normal
        cardiopulmonary and kidney functions, as determined by medical history, physical
        examination, screening blood tests, electrocardiogram and urinalysis, and not on any
        antidiabetic medications will be enrolled for metabolic assessments before and after
        surgery. Each subject will undergo, on separate days, a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp,
        a hyperglycemic clamp and a mixed meal test one week before and after a variable period of
        recovery from the surgical procedure.
