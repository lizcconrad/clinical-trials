      Rationale: The PneumRx RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coil (RePneu LVR-coil) is a bronchoscopic
      lung volume reduction treatment designed to compress the areas of lung parenchyma most
      damaged by emphysema. The LVRC treatment was found to be feasible, safe and effective in
      previous studies. However, patient-based outcomes besides quality of life questionnaires are
      hardly measured after intervention treatments for COPD. Furthermore, the exact underlying
      physiological mechanism of the LVR-coil treatment is unknown. Another aspect of the treatment
      which we to date do not fully understand is which group of patients benefit of the treatment
      and which group of patients do not, this knowing that the responder rate is already about
      60%.

      Objective: The objectives of the study are to gain more knowledge on 1) the effect of the
      LVRC treatment on patient-based outcomes like physical activity, 2) the underlying
      physiological mechanism of the treatment, 3) the predictors of response to the treatment at
      baseline, and 4) on a targetted treatment number of coils to be placed per lung using lung
      compliance.

      Study design: This study is a non-randomised open label multi-center intervention study.

      Study population: The study population exists of adult patients with severe emphysema with no
      other treatment options left besides surgical procedures.

      Intervention: Bilateral bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment with RePneu coils.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study endpoint is the change in physical activity
      between baseline and 3 months follow-up after the second treatment. The secondary endpoints
      are the changes between baseline and 3 months follow-up after the second treatment in:
      patient reported outcomes of the treatment, dynamic lung hyperinflation, static lung volumes,
      lung compliance, diaphragm function, lung perfusion, systemic inflammation and small airways
      function.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The LVR Coil has been designed to be as safe as possible. It was shown that the
      risks associated with the LVRC system are largely attributable to the bronchoscopic procedure
      itself rather than to the device per se. Therefore, it appears that the LVRC device itself
      does not appreciably increase the risk of serious adverse events beyond the risk of
      undergoing a bronchoscopy procedure or simply having emphysema. Currently, this treatment is
      not commercially available in the Netherlands and study participants will have to visit the
      hospital multiple times. Previous studies have shown that the treatment has beneficial effect
      for the patient, however not all patients respond. Part of this new study is to try to
      identify which group of patients respond to the treatment and which patients do not.
      Therefore, it is possible that a patient will not receive any benefits from the treatment.
