        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients with confirmed diagnosis of advanced, non-resectable and / or

             are amenable to docetaxel, preferably patients with breast, prostate, or non-small
             cell lung cancer. Patients must have failed prior standard therapies associated with
             clinical benefits, including survival benefits, if such therapies are available. If
             docetaxel administration is standard therapy associated with clinical benefits,

             participation in another clinical study within the past four weeks before start of
             therapy or concomitantly with this study

          -  Treatment with an EGFR- or HER2 inhibiting drug within the past four weeks before
             start of therapy or concomitantly with this study (8 weeks for trastuzumab)

          -  Patients unable to comply with the protocol

          -  Active alcohol or drug abuse

        patient will not be eligible if any of the following conditions are met:

          -  If patients' latest X-ray, CT or MRI reveals progressive disease, or if clinical
             assessment reveals signs of disease progression

          -  Cardiac left ventricular function CTC Grade ≥ 2 at any time during the previous course

          -  Patients fulfilling any of the Exclusion Criteria listed before as determined before

          -  Patient not recovered from any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 14 days after onset.
             Recovery is defined as a return to baseline level or CTC Grade 1, whichever is higher
