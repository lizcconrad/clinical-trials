      This study is to analyze the relationship between brain structure, the heart rate variability
      and the serum fatty acid component of the irritable bowel syndrome patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies showed that the gray matter and white matter of the brain related to the
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome patients.

      The investigators study is to analyse the relationship between thickness of cortex of
      irritable patients, the sympathetic tone and the serum fatty acid component of the irritable
      bowel syndrome patients. It is to clarify the mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome, whether
      the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are related to the thickness of cortex or
      inflammation status of the body.
