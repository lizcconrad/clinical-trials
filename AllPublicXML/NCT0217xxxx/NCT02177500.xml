      An eight week study to compare the effect of a fixed dose combination of Telmisartan 40 mg
      plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg to Telmisartan 40 mg alone on diastolic and systolic
      blood pressure in patients who fail to respond adequately to telmisartan monotherapy.

             medications allowed by the protocol

          -  Patients receiving any investigational therapy within one month of signing the
             informed consent form. Patients who have participated in previous telmisartan (except
             if they were on the fixed dose combination in the 502.261 study or enrolled in the
             502.321 open-label extension study) studies may participate in this study provided
             there has been at least one month between discontinuing the previous study and signing
