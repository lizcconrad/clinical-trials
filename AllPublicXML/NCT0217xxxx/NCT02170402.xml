    <measure>Percentage of reduction in annualized bleed rate (ABR) during prophylactic treatment compared to ABR during on demand treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Computed as:
{[median ABR on-demand - median ABR prophylaxis]÷[median ABR on-demand]}*100%
The ABR, will be assumed to have a negative binomial distribution. The 2 treatment regimens (on-demand and prophylaxis) will be compared in terms of mean ABR within a generalized linear model framework (with a logarithmic link function which is the default for the negative binomial distribution), accounting for the fixed effect of study arm and the follow-up time (in years) as an offset. Ratios between treatment means (95% CI) will be estimated within this model.</description>
