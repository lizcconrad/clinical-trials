  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, open-label study to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and
      regimen for the orally administered lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor
      GSK2879552. The recommended dose and regimen will be selected based on the safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles observed after the treatment of
      subjects with relapsed/refractory AML. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 will identify
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D using a dose-escalation procedure. Dose
      escalations will be guided by the Neuenschwander-continual reassessment method (N-CRM). PK/PD
      expansion cohorts will also be included in Part 1 to characterize the range of biologically
      effective doses by assessing PD markers and obtain additional PK data. Part 2 will explore
      further the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK2879552 at the RP2D in subjects
      with AML.
