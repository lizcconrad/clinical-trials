        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females at least 30 years of age with a diagnosis of symptomatic, idiopathic
             Parkinson disease, stage 1-4 on the Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale

          -  Females either surgically sterile or at least 2 years postmenopausal, or using a
             reliable method of contraception for at least 2 months prior to study entry

          -  Females of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at the screening
             visit and not nursing

          -  Patients with at least 3 of the 4 cardinal signs of Parkinson disease (i.e., rigidity,
             bradykinesia, resting tremor, postural instability) and without any other known or
             Suspected cause for their Parkinsonism

          -  Patients on levodopa therapy who show a good response to levodopa and be on a stable
             dosage of levodopa for least 1 month prior to study entry

          -  Patients able to take oral medication

          -  Patients must give voluntary written consent for study participation and must sign a
             Patient Informed Consent Form at the screening visit, prior to initiation of any
             study-related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Atypical parkinsonian syndromes secondary to drugs (e.g., metoclopramide,
             flunarizine), metabolic disorders (e.g., Wilson disease), encephalitis, or
             degenerative diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple-system atrophy)

          -  Dementia that could impair compliance with medication and/or preclude giving informed
             consent (i.e., Mini-Mental Status Examination score ≤22)

          -  History of psychosis

          -  History of active epilepsy (e.g., occurrence of a seizure) within 1 year prior to
             screening

          -  Second or third degree atrioventricular block or sick sinus syndrome, resting heart
             rate below 50 beats per minute, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association
             functional Class III or IV), myocardial infarction within 6 months of randomization,
             or other clinically significant heart conditions (e.g., coronary artery disease) that
             might negatively affect the possibility of the patient completing the study

          -  Clinically significant liver disease that may prevent the patient from completing the
             study and/or elevation in total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase
             (LDH), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), or serum glutamate oxaloacetate
             transaminase (SGOT) of &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal values

          -  Clinically significant renal disease that may prevent the patient from completing the
             study and/or elevation in serum creatinine of &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal
             values

          -  Presence of active neoplastic disease

          -  Surgery within 6 months of the baseline/randomization visit which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, might negatively impact the patient's participation in the study, or
             any history of stereotaxic brain surgery (e.g., thalamotomy, pallidotomy, or any other
             deep brain stimulation for reduction of parkinsonian symptoms)

          -  Supine systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg or evidence of a ≥20-mm Hg decline
             in systolic blood pressure at 2 minutes after standing, compared with the previous
             supine systolic blood pressure obtained after 5 minutes of quiet rest, if the decline
             in blood pressure upon standing is associated with symptoms (i.e., symptomatic
             orthostatic hypotension)

          -  Use of dopamine agonist medications (e.g., bromocriptine, pergolide) in the 2 months
             prior to study entry (allowed medications: selegiline, anticholinergics, and
             amantadine therapy at a stable dosage for 60 days prior to study entry and remaining
             stable throughout the study)

          -  Use of neuroleptics, alpha-methyldopa, or flunarizine within the past 6 months

          -  Use of any of the following drugs within 3 months of study entry: methylphenidate,
             cinnarizine, reserpine, amphetamine, and monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors (e.g.,
             pargyline, phenelzine, or tranylcypromine)

          -  Use of pramipexole within the past 3 months or a history of adverse reaction or
             allergy to pramipexole

          -  Unstable dosage of centrally active therapies (e.g., hypnotics, antidepressants,
             anxiolytics) within the past 60 days

          -  Electroconvulsive therapy within 90 days of the baseline/randomization visit

          -  Participation in other investigational drug studies or receipt of other
             investigational drugs within 30 days prior to baseline/randomization. Investigational
             drugs for Parkinson disease must have been discontinued for 90 days prior to
             baseline/randomization. Additionally, patients previously randomized into this study
             and who then discontinued study participation are not to be re-entered into the study
