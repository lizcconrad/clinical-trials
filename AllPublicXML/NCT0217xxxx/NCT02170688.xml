  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several different methods that can be used to determine the dose of iodinated
      contrast material for a CT scan. These include a standard fixed dose, a dose based on total
      body weight, a dose based on body mass index, a dose based on lean body weight, and a dose
      based on estimated lean body weight. The fixed dose method uses a predetermined amount of
      contrast material for all patients having a CT scan of the abdomen regardless of size. This
      is the standard procedure currently used at Duke. The other methods use the patient's weight,
      either the total body weight or lean body weight, to determine the amount of contrast
      necessary for the CT exam. For this study, the investigators will use the fixed dose, total
      body weight, the lean body weight, and estimated lean body weight methods. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate these five methods of determining the IV contrast volume and which
      may be best for abdominal CT scanning.

    <description>25 subjects will receive contrast media dose based on the estimated lean body (eLBW) weight. Estimated lean body weight will be determined by using a unique software program which measures the sum of the posterior to anterior attenuation from the digital scout radiograph (abbreviated as sqrt PA) obtained during the standard planning scan of the abdominal/pelvic CT. Men will receive a dose of 0.86 gmI / kg eLBW (2.32 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.074 mL/sec/kg) or 0.39 gmI/lb eLBW (1.05 mL of Isovue 370/lb at 0.034 mL/sec/lb).

          <title>Estimated Lean Body (eLBW) Weight</title>
          <description>25 subjects will receive contrast media dose based on the estimated lean body (eLBW) weight. Estimated lean body weight will be determined by using a unique software program which measures the sum of the posterior to anterior attenuation from the digital scout radiograph (abbreviated as sqrt PA) obtained during the standard planning scan of the abdominal/pelvic CT. Men will receive a dose of 0.86 gmI / kg eLBW (2.32 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.074 mL/sec/kg) or 0.39 gmI/lb eLBW (1.05 mL of Isovue 370/lb at 0.034 mL/sec/lb). Women will receive a dose of 0.92 gmI/kg eLBW (2.49 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.080 mL/sec/kg) or 0.42 gmI/lb eLBW (1.13 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.036 mL/sec/kg).
Isovue 370: All contrast media doses administered for this study are within the FDA approved dose range in the package insert.

          <title>Fixed Dose</title>
          <description>50 subjects will receive contrast media based on a fixed dose. Each will receive 125 mL of Isovue 370 (370 mg of iodine/mL) administered at 4 mL/sec (1.48 gmI/sec for 31.25 sec).
Isovue 370: All contrast media doses administered for this study are within the FDA approved dose range in the package insert.</description>

          <title>Total Body Weight</title>
          <description>25 subjects will receive contrast media dose based on the total body weight. Total body weight will be determined. Both men and women will receive contrast media at a dose of 0.7 gmI/kg (1.78 mL of Isovue 370/kg) or 0.30 gmI/lb (0.81 mL of Isovue 370/lb). The injection rate will be 0.058 mL/sec/kg (0.026 mL/sec/lb).

          <title>Calculated Lean Body Weight</title>
          <description>25 subjects will receive contrast media dose based on the calculated lean body weight. Total body weight and height will be determined. From this data the lean body weight will be calculated.
Men will receive a dose of 0.86 gmI / kg LBW (2.32 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.074 mL/sec/kg) or 0.39 gmI/lb LBW (1.05 mL of Isovue 370/lb at 0.034 mL/sec/lb). Women will receive a dose of 0.92 gmI/kg LBW (2.49 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.080 mL/sec/kg) or 0.42 gmI/lb LBW (1.13 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.036 mL/sec/kg).

          <title>Measured Lean Body Weight</title>
          <description>50 subjects will receive contrast media dose based on the measured lean body weight. Lean body weight will be determined using the Tanita body composition/analyzer scales. From this data the lean body weight will be calculated.
Men will receive a dose of 0.86 gmI / kg LBW (2.32 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.074 mL/sec/kg) or 0.39 gmI/lb LBW (1.05 mL of Isovue 370/lb at 0.034 mL/sec/lb).

          <title>Estimated Lean Body (eLBW) Weight</title>
          <description>25 subjects will receive contrast media dose based on the estimated lean body (eLBW) weight. Estimated lean body weight will be determined by using a unique software program which measures the sum of the posterior to anterior attenuation from the digital scout radiograph (abbreviated as sqrt PA) obtained during the standard planning scan of the abdominal/pelvic CT. Men will receive a dose of 0.86 gmI / kg eLBW (2.32 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.074 mL/sec/kg) or 0.39 gmI/lb eLBW (1.05 mL of Isovue 370/lb at 0.034 mL/sec/lb). Women will receive a dose of 0.92 gmI/kg eLBW (2.49 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.080 mL/sec/kg) or 0.42 gmI/lb eLBW (1.13 mL of Isovue 370/kg at 0.036 mL/sec/kg).
