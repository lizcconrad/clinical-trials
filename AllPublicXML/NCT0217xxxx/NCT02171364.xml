      Radiofrequency catheter ablation is highly effective in the treatment of patients with
      persistent atrial fibrillation. In order to decrease the recurrence rate after catheter
      ablation, the investigators propose to apply 'virtual' ablation on patient-specific atria by
      simulating 3D atrial computer model. The investigators will test with five different set of
      ablation methods and find successful methods for a specific patient. Then, this result will
      be compared to empirical catheter ablation result by randomly controlled trial.
