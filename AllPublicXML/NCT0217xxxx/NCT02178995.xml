  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methylphenidate (MPH) has long been used to improve attention and cognitive difficulties
      associated with ADHD, including in children with ADHD and epilepsy (Torres et al., 2008).
      Methylphenidate (MPH) is also helpful in treating attention and other cognitive difficulties
      in a variety of other neurological and medical conditions (Kajs-Wyllie, 2002; Prommer, 2012).
      We seek to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of this medication in treating
      attention deficits, as well as other cognitive difficulties, experienced by adult patients
      with epilepsy.

      To our knowledge, there are currently very few studies which explicitly examine the impact of
      MPH on measureable attention deficits and other cognitive deficits in adult patients with
      epilepsy. We hope to quantify what impact, if any, methylphenidate has on attention, in
      addition to other specific measureable cognitive functions, in patients with cognitive
      complaints and epilepsy, and contribute to a growing body of evidence which supports the
      safety of methylphenidate's use for attention deficits in patients with epilepsy. As other
      effective treatments for attention and other cognitive difficulties in patients with epilepsy
      are not currently available, MPH could represent an important option in the treatment of such
      patients.

      Prospective participants with seizures will be identified primarily through the Stanford
      Neurology and Neuropsychiatry clinics and Stanford Medical Center, with the assistance of
      clinic staff and providers. Participants may also be identified and referred by their
      physicians in the community as well. Informational fliers will be distributed to these
      clinics and throughout Stanford Medical Center and Stanford campus in order to identify
      participants with epilepsy as well as healthy volunteers. Prospective participants may also
      contact study staff directly via contact information listed on the flier or provided to them
      by their providers. Those identified will be contacted, either in person or by telephone, by
      study staff.

      A telephone or in-person pre-screening will occur, expected to last approximately 20-30
      minutes, in order to determine eligibility for the study, interest in participating, and any
      questions related to the study. A brief summary of study procedures and goals will be
      reviewed during this pre-screening. Participants who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria may
      take part in an initial in-person visit at Stanford Medical Center, where informed consent
      will be obtained and signed (see attached informed consent form). Any additional history
      needed in order to confirm a participant's eligibility will be reviewed at this visit. If the
      individual chooses to proceed, the participant's blood pressure and heartrate will be
      measured, and if necessary (because a recent physical exam including cardiac auscultation is
      not available), a brief physical exam will be performed by a licensed physician. If vital
      signs and exam (if necessary) are normal, participants will be asked to complete
      neuropsychiatric questionnaires, self-report questionnaires, a quality-of-life questionnaire,
      and a seizure diary. The full 40-minute neurocognitive battery will be performed, and
      baseline scores obtained.

      Participants will be asked to complete the seizure diary once per week, either in-person at
      their visits or at home. Thereafter, the participant will be asked to attend at least three
      additional 2-hour sessions at Stanford Medical Center. The participant will be asked to avoid
      taking any non-routine sedating medications within 24 hours of his/her scheduled visit, and
      to refrain from eating, drinking caffeine, or smoking for 2 hours prior to his/her visit.
      When the participant arrives, they will be given either a placebo, 20mg of methylphenidate,
      or 10mg of methylphenidate (randomized and blinded by the research pharmacy), and asked to
      remain within the hospital for 1 hour prior to testing to allow the medication to enter their
      system. Both study staff and the participant will be blinded to whether they are receiving
      active medication or placebo. During this time, the participant will complete self-report
      questionnaires reporting any medication changes, medical events, or significant adverse
      events, and their seizure diary will be reviewed and kept by study staff. After this, the
      full neurocognitive battery will be completed. Following the completion of neurocognitive
      testing, the participant's next visit will be scheduled for approximately the same time of
      day in approximately one week, and payment will be provided. This procedure will be repeated
      for the next two visits. Participants will not receive any additional study drug during this
      period other than the single dose they receive in-person.

      At the participant's fourth visit, they will be asked to repeat the neuropsychiatric
      questionnaires from visit #1, as well as the usual self-report forms and seizure diary.
      Heartrate and blood pressure will be obtained again prior to the administration of the
      neurocognitive battery. At the end of the fourth visit, participants will be asked if they
      wish to take part in the four-week open-label phase of this study, designed to evaluate the
      ongoing efficacy and safety of methylphenidate for use in patients with epilepsy. Regardless
      of their answer, payment will be provided for their fourth visit.

      Those participants who are interested in participating in the open-label trial will be
      provided with a prescription for two weeks of methylphenidate 10mg PO BID, followed by two
      weeks of methylphenidate 20mg PO BID. Participants will be provided with copies of the
      seizure diary and asked to complete it weekly. Participants will be able to contact the
      protocol director by phone to report any significant side effects or adverse events during
      this trial. At the protocol director's discretion, in keeping with standard of care for this
      medication, the dosage of the medication may be lowered (minimum dose 5mg PO BID) in response
      to any side effects experienced by participants during this period.

      Participants in the open-label trial will be asked to return after four more weeks for a
      fifth and final visit. Participants will again be asked to refrain from eating, caffeine, and
      nicotine for 2 hours prior to their visit, and will take their prescribed methylphenidate
      upon arriving at Stanford Medical Center. Participants will wait 1 hour for the medication to
      enter their system, during which time they will complete neuropsychiatric and self-report
      questionnaires as before, their seizure diaries will be reviewed, and their heart rate and
      blood pressure will again be measured. The cognitive battery will be administered again.
      Afterwards, any participant questions will be answered and final financial compensation will
      be provided, and the participant's involvement has ended. Data will remain blinded until the
      completion of the study. Participants wishing to receive the active medication following the
      termination of the open-label phase of the study may do so at the discretion of their
      physicians.

    <time_frame>difference in scores on specific variables between MPH 20mg, 10mg, and placebo (randomized to administration at weeks 2, 3, or 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Scores on this test measure attentiveness/vigilance and response time. Primary measures are: D', HRTSD D' represents 'detectability,' and is a derived statistic which measures a participant's ability to distinguish target stimuli from non-target stimuli, and incorporates response time and accuracy factors. The equation for deriving it is proprietary to the test which markets the CPT. A higher, or less negative, score is considered WORSE.
HRTSD represents the standard deviation of participant hit reaction time data, as measured for a variety of different stimuli types across the trial. It is a measure of the participant's ability to maintain attention across the trial. A higher score represents more variability and is considered WORSE.</description>

    <measure>QOLIE-89 Aggregate Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of methylphenidate open label treatment (end month 2)</time_frame>
    <description>QOLIE-89 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life and subjective cognitive effects. The aggregate score is the overall calculated score. Note: most of its questions are specific to patients with epilepsy, and therefore the questionnaire cannot be validly completed by healthy controls. Therefore, only participants with epilepsy completed the questionnaire.
QOLIE aggregate scores and subscale scores are calculated based on individual patient responses throughout the survey, and according to scoring rules as determined by the creator of the questionnaire. Scores are rated 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

    <description>Secondary variables in CPT: hits, omissions, commissions
&quot;Hits&quot; represents the raw number of accurate responses to target stimuli, out of a maximum of 288. A higher number is better.
&quot;Omissions&quot; are errors committed when a target stimuli is not appropriately responded to. A higher number is worse. Theoretically, the maximum number of omissions would be 288. A lower number is BETTER.
&quot;Commissions&quot; are errors committed when a participant responds to a non-target stimuli. Because a participant may make multiple such errors for a given stimuli, there is no raw maximum. A lower number is BETTER.</description>

    <description>This is a side-effects reporting scale for anti-epileptic medications. Because it encompasses cognitive and non-cognitive side effects, it was not considered one of our main cognitive/quality of life outcomes of interest. It is used in other studies of AED side effects, however, so was included.
The scale consists of 19 symptoms rated 1 (Never a problem) to 4 (Always or often a problem). Minimum score is 19, maximum score is 76. A higher score is WORSE.</description>

    <description>Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale. These were not primary or secondary variables of interest given methylphenidate's primary expected action being on cognition. Included given one author's interest, as other studies suggesting psychiatric improvements (particularly apathy and depression) with methylphenidate.
BDI is a common clinical and research measure of depression. It has 21 questions and is scored 0 (no depression) to 63 (most severe depression). A higher score is worse.
BAI is a measure of anxiety, which also has 21 questions and is scored 0 (no anxiety) to 63 (most severe anxiety). A higher score is worse.
AES is a measure of clinical apathy, and is an 18-item scale. It rates symptoms as &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;slightly,&quot; &quot;somewhat,&quot; or &quot;a lot,&quot; which are then converted to numerical values 1 (least apathy) to 4 (most apathy). Scores range from 18 (no apathy) to 72 (most apathy).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were enrolled primarily through the Stanford Neurology and Neuropsychiatry clinics between August 2014 and July 2015.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>4 participants signed their consent form, but did not complete any study visits and therefore produced no study data. Therefore, 55 participants are 'enrolled,' but only 51 actually participated in the study flow.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Participants With Epilepsy (Open-label)</title>
          <description>Following the final randomized visit, interested participants were prescribed 10mg of methylphenidate twice daily, increased to 20mg of methylphenidate twice daily as tolerated. After a four week treatment trial, their scores on the batteries and questionnaires were again assessed.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Healthy Controls</title>
          <description>Healthy controls completed the same neurocognitive batteries and neuropsychiatric questionnaires as individuals with epilepsy, but were not exposed to study medication.
Healthy controls were included primarily for use in the open-label comparison. They did not receive blinded medication during the 'double-blind' portion and their data was not used in the 'double-blind' comparison. In order to control for test/re-test variables, they completed testing during the 'double-blind' portion, so that they completed testing an equivalent number of times to the epilepsy patients in the 'open-label' portion.</description>

          <description>Participants received three single doses in randomized order of blinded medication, either a placebo, 20mg of methylphenidate, or 10mg of methylphenidate, and completed cognitive testing and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. This single-dose phase was followed by an open-label 4-week treatment trial of methylphenidate.
Methylphenidate: Participants with epilepsy first received blinded, single-dose capsules which contained either:
Placebo 20mg of methylphenidate or 10mg of methylphenidate.
At each visit, they received one capsule and then completed the neurocognitive batteries and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. There was no medication administered between visits during this time.</description>

          <description>This study was originally intended to use 40mg, 20mg, and placebo doses rather than 20mg, 10mg, and placebo. This individual developed tachycardia (see adverse events) on the 40mg dose, and was withdrawn from the double-blind portion as a result. We removed the 40mg doses from this study and replaced them with 10mg doses. No other participant received a 40mg dose. This participant rejoined the open-label portion after consultation with his PCP due to significant perceived benefit from the MPH dose.</description>

          <description>Participants received three single doses of blinded medication, either a placebo, 20mg of methylphenidate, or 10mg of methylphenidate, and completed cognitive testing and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. This single-dose phase was followed by an open-label 4-week treatment trial of methylphenidate.
Methylphenidate: Participants with epilepsy first received blinded, single-dose capsules which contained either:
Placebo 20mg of methylphenidate or 10mg of methylphenidate.
At each visit, they received one capsule and then completed the neurocognitive batteries and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. There was no medication administered between visits during this time. Following the final randomized visit, interested participants were prescribed 10mg of methylphenidate twice daily, increased to 20mg of methylphenidate twice daily as tolerated. After four weeks, their scores on the batteries and questionnaires were again assessed.</description>

        <description>Scores on this test measure attentiveness/vigilance and response time. Primary measures are: D', HRTSD D' represents 'detectability,' and is a derived statistic which measures a participant's ability to distinguish target stimuli from non-target stimuli, and incorporates response time and accuracy factors. The equation for deriving it is proprietary to the test which markets the CPT. A higher, or less negative, score is considered WORSE.
HRTSD represents the standard deviation of participant hit reaction time data, as measured for a variety of different stimuli types across the trial. It is a measure of the participant's ability to maintain attention across the trial. A higher score represents more variability and is considered WORSE.</description>

        <description>Symbol-digit matching test is a measure processing speed and working memory. The task involves matching nonsense symbols with numbers based on a key as quickly as possible within 90s. Score represents the number of correct responses within the time frame. Minimum score is 0. There is not a meaningful 'maximum' score, as there are too many symbols for a participant to successfully complete within the allotted time. A higher score is better.</description>

D' represents 'detectability,' and is a derived statistic which measures a participant's ability to distinguish target stimuli from non-target stimuli, and incorporates response time and accuracy factors. The equation for deriving it is proprietary to the test which markets the CPT. A higher, or less negative, score is considered WORSE.
HRTSD represents the standard deviation of participant hit reaction time data, as measured for a variety of different stimuli types across the trial. It is a measure of the participant's ability to maintain attention across the trial. A higher score represents more variability and is considered WORSE.</description>

The task involves matching nonsense symbols with numbers based on a key as quickly as possible within 90s. Score represents the number of correct responses within the time frame. Minimum score is 0. There is not a meaningful 'maximum' score, as there are too many symbols for a participant to successfully complete within the allotted time. A higher score is better.</description>

        <description>QOLIE-89 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life and subjective cognitive effects. The aggregate score is the overall calculated score. Note: most of its questions are specific to patients with epilepsy, and therefore the questionnaire cannot be validly completed by healthy controls. Therefore, only participants with epilepsy completed the questionnaire.
QOLIE aggregate scores and subscale scores are calculated based on individual patient responses throughout the survey, and according to scoring rules as determined by the creator of the questionnaire. Scores are rated 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

Hits” represents the raw number of accurate responses to target stimuli, out of a maximum of 288. A higher number is better.
Omissions” are errors committed when a target stimuli is not appropriately responded to. A higher number is worse. Theoretically, the maximum number of omissions would be 288. A lower number is BETTER.
Commissions” are errors committed when a participant responds to a non-target stimuli. Because a participant may make multiple such errors for a given stimuli, there is no raw maximum. A lower number is BETTER.</description>

        <description>Omissions, commissions, and hits
Hits” represents the raw number of accurate responses to target stimuli, out of a maximum of 288. A higher number is better.
Omissions” are errors committed when a target stimuli is not appropriately responded to. A higher number is worse. Theoretically, the maximum number of omissions would be 288. A lower number is BETTER.
Commissions” are errors committed when a participant responds to a non-target stimuli. Because a participant may make multiple such errors for a given stimuli, there is no raw maximum. A lower number is BETTER.</description>

Healthy controls were included primarily for use in the open-label comparison. They did not receive blinded medication during the 'double-blind' portion and their data was not used in the 'double-blind' comparison. In order to control for test/re-test variables, they completed testing during the 'double-blind' portion, so that they completed testing an equivalent number of times to the epilepsy patients in the 'open-label' portion.</description>

          <description>Omissions, commissions, and hits
Hits” represents the raw number of accurate responses to target stimuli, out of a maximum of 288. A higher number is better.
Omissions” are errors committed when a target stimuli is not appropriately responded to. A higher number is worse. Theoretically, the maximum number of omissions would be 288. A lower number is BETTER.
Commissions” are errors committed when a participant responds to a non-target stimuli. Because a participant may make multiple such errors for a given stimuli, there is no raw maximum. A lower number is BETTER.</description>

        <description>This is a side-effects reporting scale for anti-epileptic medications. Because it encompasses cognitive and non-cognitive side effects, it was not considered one of our main cognitive/quality of life outcomes of interest. It is used in other studies of AED side effects, however, so was included.
The scale consists of 19 symptoms rated 1 (Never a problem) to 4 (Always or often a problem). Minimum score is 19, maximum score is 76. A higher score is WORSE.</description>

This single-dose phase will be followed by an open-label 4-week treatment trial of methylphenidate.
Methylphenidate: Participants with epilepsy will first receive blinded, single-dose capsules which contain either:
Placebo 20mg of methylphenidate or 10mg of methylphenidate.
At each visit, they will receive one capsule and then complete the neurocognitive batteries and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. There will be no medication administered between visits during this time. Following the final randomized visit, interested participants will be prescribed 10mg of methylphenidate twice daily, to be increased to 20mg of methylphenidate twice daily.

        <description>Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale. These were not primary or secondary variables of interest given methylphenidate's primary expected action being on cognition. Included given one author's interest, as other studies suggesting psychiatric improvements (particularly apathy and depression) with methylphenidate.
BDI is a common clinical and research measure of depression. It has 21 questions and is scored 0 (no depression) to 63 (most severe depression). A higher score is worse.
BAI is a measure of anxiety, which also has 21 questions and is scored 0 (no anxiety) to 63 (most severe anxiety). A higher score is worse.
AES is a measure of clinical apathy, and is an 18-item scale. It rates symptoms as &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;slightly,&quot; &quot;somewhat,&quot; or &quot;a lot,&quot; which are then converted to numerical values 1 (least apathy) to 4 (most apathy). Scores range from 18 (no apathy) to 72 (most apathy).</description>

            <description>Healthy controls completed the same neurocognitive batteries and neuropsychiatric questionnaires as individuals with epilepsy, but were not exposed to study medication.
Healthy controls were included primarily for use in the open-label comparison. They did not receive blinded medication during the 'double-blind' portion and their data was not used in the 'double-blind' comparison. In order to control for test/re-test variables, they completed testing during the 'double-blind' portion, so that they completed testing an equivalent number of times to the epilepsy patients in the 'open-label' portion.</description>

          <description>Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale. These were not primary or secondary variables of interest given methylphenidate's primary expected action being on cognition. Included given one author's interest, as other studies suggesting psychiatric improvements (particularly apathy and depression) with methylphenidate.
BDI is a common clinical and research measure of depression. It has 21 questions and is scored 0 (no depression) to 63 (most severe depression). A higher score is worse.
BAI is a measure of anxiety, which also has 21 questions and is scored 0 (no anxiety) to 63 (most severe anxiety). A higher score is worse.
AES is a measure of clinical apathy, and is an 18-item scale. It rates symptoms as &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;slightly,&quot; &quot;somewhat,&quot; or &quot;a lot,&quot; which are then converted to numerical values 1 (least apathy) to 4 (most apathy). Scores range from 18 (no apathy) to 72 (most apathy).</description>

            <description>Participants will receive three single doses of blinded medication, either a placebo, 20mg of methylphenidate, or 10mg of methylphenidate, and will complete cognitive testing and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. This single-dose phase will be followed by an open-label 4-week treatment trial of methylphenidate.
Methylphenidate: Participants with epilepsy will first receive blinded, single-dose capsules which contain either:
Placebo 20mg of methylphenidate or 10mg of methylphenidate.
At each visit, they will receive one capsule and then complete the neurocognitive batteries and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. There will be no medication administered between visits during this time. Following the final randomized visit, interested participants will be prescribed 10mg of methylphenidate twice daily, to be increased to 20mg of methylphenidate twice daily. After four weeks, their scores on the batteries and questionnaires will again be assessed.</description>

        <title>Remaining CPT Variables (Open-label)</title>
        <description>These are automatically-calculated CPT variables which were not pre-specified variables of interest or intentional post-hoc analyses. They are included ONLY for completeness of data. They include hit reaction time (HRT), variability (VAR), and perseverations (PRS).
Hit reaction time represents to the average number of milliseconds required for a participant to respond to target stimuli. There are no meaningful absolute minimum or maximum scores, though 101ms is the current fastest verified response time per our review. A higher score is WORSE.
Variability refers to variations in response time across individual blocks of time within the trial. It differs from HRTSD in that HRTSD measures variability across the entire trial. Minimum is 0. There are no absolute maximums. A higher score is WORSE.
Perseverations are errors made either faster than physiologically possible (&lt;100ms). Minimum is 0, there is no maximum. Higher scores are WORSE.</description>

Healthy controls were included primarily for use in the open-label comparison.

In order to control for test/re-test variables, they completed testing during the 'double-blind' portion, so that they completed testing an equivalent number of times to the epilepsy patients in the 'open-label' portion.</description>

Hit reaction time represents to the average number of milliseconds required for a participant to respond to target stimuli. There are no meaningful absolute minimum or maximum scores, though 101ms is the current fastest verified response time per our review. A higher score is WORSE.
Variability refers to variations in response time across individual blocks of time within the trial. It differs from HRTSD in that HRTSD measures variability across the entire trial. Minimum is 0. There are no absolute maximums. A higher score is WORSE.
Perseverations are errors made either faster than physiologically possible (&lt;100ms). Minimum is 0, there is no maximum. Higher scores are WORSE.</description>

Methylphenidate: Participants with epilepsy will first receive blinded, single-dose capsules in the following order:
Placebo, 10mg of methylphenidate, 20mg of methylphenidate.
At each visit, they will receive one capsule and then complete the neurocognitive batteries and neuropsychiatric questionnaires. There will be no medication administered between visits during this time. Following the final randomized visit, interested participants will be prescribed 10mg of methylphenidate twice daily, to be increased to 20mg of methylphenidate twice daily. After four weeks, their scores on the batteries and questionnaires will again be assessed.</description>

          <description>This study was originally intended to use 40mg, 20mg, and placebo doses rather than 20mg, 10mg, and placebo. This individual developed tachycardia (see adverse events) on the 40mg dose, and was withdrawn from the double-blind portion as a result. We removed the 40mg doses from this study and replaced them with 10mg doses. No other participant received a 40mg dose. This participant rejoined the open-label portion after consultation with his PCP due to significant perceived benefit from the MPH dose.</description>
