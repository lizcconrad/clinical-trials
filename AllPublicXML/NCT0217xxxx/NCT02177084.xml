  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS)
      associated with conservative therapy (arm A) for the treatment of low anterior resection
      syndrome (LARS) compared with only conservative therapy (arm B).

      The secondary aims are the evaluation of the following parameters:

        -  Effect of PTNS on manometric parameters

        -  Effect of PTNS on quality of life

        -  Effect of PTNS on the severity of fecal incontinence and / or obstructed defecation

        -  Safety of PTNS
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized clinical trial that compares two treatments in patients
      with LARS:

      Arm A: PTNS + conservative treatment (based on predominant symptom) Arm B: only conservative
      treatment

      The study is divided into two phases:

        1. PRETREATMENT PHASE

           The patients with LARS score ≥ 21 after anterior resection of the rectum with
           sphincter-saving surgery for rectal cancer, will be submitted during the first visit of
           the study to :

             -  Collection of personal data

             -  Collection of medical records

             -  Collection of data relating to the intervention of anterior resection of the rectum

             -  Verification of the criteria for inclusion / exclusion

             -  Collection of informed consent

             -  Administration of the questionnaires European Organisation for Research and
                Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire Cancer 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30),
                European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life
                Questionnaire Colorectal 38 (EORTC QLQ-CR38), Faecal incontinence severity index
                (FISI); Fecal incontinence quality of life questionnaire (FIQL), Obstructed
                defaecation syndrome (ODS) score questionnaire and Constipation-related quality of
                life questionnaire (CRQoL)

             -  Endoanal ultrasound

             -  Anorectal manometry

        2. PHASE OF TREATMENT During the treatment phase, data related to the treatment and any
           treatment related-complications will be recorded on a special form Bowel function and
           quality of life will be assessed using the same questionnaires at the end of treatment.
           Even anorectal manometry will be repeated at the end of treatment.

      It is expected to enroll approximately 12 patients.

No LARS: a score between 0 and 20

    <description>PTNS consists in the insertion of a small electrode above the medial malleolus adjacent to the posterior tibial nerve. An adhesive surface electrode is placed under th arch of the foot. Both electrodes are connected to the neurostimulator that generates electricity. A neuromodulation session lasts 30 minutes.
The treatment plan includes 12 weekly sessions, followed by two sessions at 2-week intervals and the last one after one month. Two additional sessions of reinforcement (top-up) are provided at intervals of 6 months or earlier in case of worsening of symptoms</description>
