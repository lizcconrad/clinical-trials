  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of motivational interviewing and skill building
      compared to usual care to improve self-care in heart failure (HF) patients. The target
      population is HF patients recruited from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania after
      an in-patient admission. Patients in the intervention arms will receive one home-visit from a
      nurse who does a self-care intervention followed up by 3 follow-up phone calls.

    <textblock>
      MITI-HF is a prospective, single blinded, pilot randomized single-site trial. The target
      sample size was 65 participants; however, to account for an estimated 35% attrition rate, the
      target number for recruitment was 100 participants. We calculated the target sample size
      based on a 2:1 randomization (intervention: control) with 90% power (5% alpha) to detect a
      difference of 80% versus 50% (intervention and control group) of scoring over 70, which is
      the cut-off for adequate self-care at three months between the two groups. The power analysis
      was performed using G*Power and confirmed with PASS. Randomization to the intervention or
      usual care group occurred after the informed consent form was signed and New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) Functional Class was scored. To achieve balance in both arms of the study,
      the Minim randomization program was used to minimize prognostic factor differences between
      groups. Minim stratified participants based on NYHA class and gender to one of two arms in a
      2:1 ratio (intervention: control). The research assistants were blinded to group assignment
      until all study data was collected. All eligible patients were screened for health literacy
      using a three-question health literacy questionnaire, cognitive impairment using a six-item
      screener derived from the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), baseline self-care using the SCHFI
      (v.6.2), and NYHA functional class using the Central Assessment of NYHA Functional Class. A
      single board-certified cardiologist scored all of the NYHA functional class scores. Medical,
      socio-demographic, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), and Heart Failure Somatic
      Perception Scale (HFSPS) data were collected at baseline via phone call by blinded research
      assistants (RA) approximately two weeks after hospital discharge. Socio-demographics were
      assessed using a questionnaire that inquires about gender, age, marital/partnership status,
      ethnicity/race, and employment. Follow-up data were collected at 90 days by the blinded RAs.
      If the first call was unsuccessful, the RA would try every 3 to 5 days for up to 60 days. If
      there was no contact with the participant after 60 days from the expected follow-up date, the
      participant was considered lost to follow-up. During the follow-up phone call, participants
      completed the SCHFI, KCCQ, HFSPS and self-reported clinical events within the study period.
      Self-reported clinical events were verified with a review of the electronic medical record to
      confirm any hospitalizations, emergency room visits, or outpatient heart failure related
      visits that occurred within the study period.

    <description>Self-Care will be self-reported and measured using the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI). Items measuring self-care maintenance address treatment adherence and self-monitoring, while management focuses on decision-making in response to symptoms. Higher scores reflect better self-care maintenance. Each scale is scored separately; the total possible score for each scale is 100.</description>

    <description>Self-Care management will be self-reported and measured using the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI). Self care management is a patients ability to recognize symptoms when they occur; independent and interdependent self-care treatments implemented by the patient (e.g., take an extra diuretic for shortness of breath) and ability to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments implemented. Higher scores reflect better self-care. Each scale is scored separately; the total possible score for each scale is 100.</description>

    <description>The MI intervention was provided by a heart failure specialist nurse. The nurse conducted a home-based motivational interviewing intervention followed up by three phone calls over the course of 90 days. The intervention began with a conversation about the participant's self-identified goals. In the home intervention, the nurse focused on self-care areas that the participant identified as high priority. During the home-based intervention, the participant also set specific goals, which the nurse followed up with and reinforced over the follow-up phone calls.</description>

    <intervention_name>Motivational Interviewing tailored intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>MI is grounded in client-centered counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and social cognitive therapy. MI integrates the concepts of relationship building from humanistic therapy with active strategies oriented towards stages of change.The main characteristics of motivational interviewing are: expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy. The interviewer maintains a nonjudgmental approach and allows the patient to determine the need for behavioral change, rather than offering unsolicited advice on the need for change. The interviewer only explores ways to implement change once the patient expresses the desire and confidence to change. The goal of MI is to help individuals work through inherent ambivalence present in problematic or unhealthy behaviors and to help them verbally express reasons for or against change using a nonjudgmental, empathetic and encouraging tone.</description>
