  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to determine the accuracy of using anatomic and physiologic information
      measurable by computed tomography features of stenosis, plaque, fractional flow reserve-CT
      and to compare this measure to stress testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia
      against the gold standard of cardiac catheterization with fractional flow reserve. The
      hypothesis of this proposal is that integrating anatomic plaque features with physiologic
      fractional flow reserve-CT will optimize identification of coronary lesions that are
      ischemia-causing by computed tomography .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CREDENCE trial will be a prospective multicenter cross-sectional study of 618 individuals
      (n=309 [derivation cohort]; n=309 [validation cohort]) who will undergo stress test, computed
      tomography, cardiac catheterization and fractional flow reserve. For the purposes of the
      study, either stress test or computed tomography will have been performed for clinical
      purposes, with the other test being performed as part of trial procedure. Study analyses will
      focus on the diagnostic performance of the information derived by stress test versus computed
      tomography against an invasive gold standard of cardiac catheterization and fractional flow
      reserve for an endpoint of vessel territory-specific ischemia. In keeping with prior studies,
      vessel territories will be comprised of the left anterior descending artery (and diagonal
      branches), the left circumflex artery (and obtuse marginal branches) and the right coronary
      artery (and posterolateral branch and posterior descending artery).

      To date, the relative performance of traditional stress imaging testing compared to the
      entirety of information proffered by CT has not been assessed compared to an unbiased gold
      standard. The study proposed herein will directly address this unmet need.
