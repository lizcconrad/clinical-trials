    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of oral auranofin, a gold compound,
      in patients with HIV infection whose viral load has been suppressed by antiretroviral therapy
      for no less than 3 years and have a CD4+ cell count over 500 cells/uL

      The investigators proposed a novel approach in order to reduce the HIV viral reservoir. This
      approach exploits the effects of auranofin, a gold based compound which has been used in the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Auranofin induces partially selective apoptosis and
      differentiation towards short-lived phenotypes of the T lymphocyte memory subsets that
      encompass the main viral reservoir in patients. The hypothesis is that the targeted memory
      cells would either die or decrease their persistence in the body, with the associated latent
      viral reservoir being reduced.

      The study will be conducted in two phases: A sequential dose-escalation phase to evaluate two
      doses of auranofin, followed by an expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A total of
      20 patients are to be treated at the MTD. Auranofin treatment is administered for 12 weeks.

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by repeated laboratory panel and physcial
      examination during the 12 weeks of auranofin therapy and 8 for weeks thereafter. The latent
      reservoir will be measured by assessment of the inegrated viral DNA in CD4+ cells in the
      circulating blood and in gut biopsies.

             study.

          -  Male or female, between 18 and 55 years of age.

          -  Stable dose of ART (defined as at least 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase
             inhibitors plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, integrase inhibitor,
             or a protease inhibitor) for at least 2 years from study consent and with no
             modifications expected during the study.

          -  HIV plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/ml for at least 3 years with several measurements per
             year and most recent viral load within 3 months of screening.8

          -  No previous failure of ART, understood as a rebound in viral load that can be detected
             after having reached undetectable levels. Low-grade increases (&lt;200 copies of HIV
             RNA/mL) and transitory increases (blips) resolved without modifying ART are
             acceptable.
