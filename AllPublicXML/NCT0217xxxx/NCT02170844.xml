  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate and compare safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BIBR 1048 MS
      following oral administration of single rising doses from 50 mg to 350 mg in healthy male
      subjects of Japanese and Caucasian origin. This was the first administration of this
      substance to subjects of Japanese origin.
