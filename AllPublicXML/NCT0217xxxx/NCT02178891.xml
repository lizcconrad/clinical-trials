    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject should be at least 18 years of age and have passed secession of growth

          -  The subject should be in need of an implant-supported restoration in the posterior
             region of the mouth (maxilla: first premolar to third molar, mandible: first premolar
             to second molar, not third molar due to mobile gingiva), where at least 2 implants are
             needed of which at least one should be an Extra Short Implant

          -  Obtained informed consent from the subject

          -  The subject must be in such a physical and mental condition that a 5-year follow-up
             period can be carried out without foreseeable problems

          -  The subject should have a severely resorbed posterior mandible and/ or maxilla.

          -  Implants are only to be placed in healed sites, defined as a site with minimum 6
             months of healing following tooth extraction

          -  At least 6 mm residual bone width, between 4-7 mm residual bone height in the maxilla
             and between 6-9 mm residual bone height in the mandible

          -  At implant installation the implant should be stable; final tightening torque of the
             implant about 25 Ncm or higher, preferably not exceeding 45 Ncm

          -  The subject should be healthy and compliant with good oral hygiene

          -  Favorable and stable occlusal relationship

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is not able to give her/his informed consent of participating

          -  Health conditions, which do not permit the surgical treatment

          -  Reason to believe that the treatment might have a negative effect on the subject's
             total situation (psychiatric problems), as noted in subject records or in subject
             history

          -  Any disorders in the planned implant area such as previous tumours, chronic bone
             disease or previous irradiation

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse as noted in subject records or in subject history.

          -  Heavy smoking (&gt;10 cigarettes/day)

          -  Intake of medication containing bisphosphonates

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes, i.e. a subject with diagnosed diabetes that has a history of
             neglecting doctor's recommendations regarding treatment, food and alcohol intake

          -  Severe bruxism or other destructive habits

          -  Immediate insertion (i.e. placement of the implant immediately after extraction)

          -  Bone augmentation procedures before or at implant installation is not allowed

          -  Deviation from stated drilling protocol, utilizing osteotomes, is not allowed

          -  Lack of opposing dentition

          -  Single crown restorations are not to be performed in the study
