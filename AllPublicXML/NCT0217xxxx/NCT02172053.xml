      Studies show that exercise resistance in workplace can reduce the symptoms of induced labor,
      however, the effectiveness of such programs depends on the characteristics of the training
      fatigue. Thus, it is expected that this study the intervention group with training heavy
      using progressive resistance exercise protocol will be better in reducing fatigue when
      compare with light training group.

      Background: This study is randomized clinical trial with double-blinded. The aim is evaluate
      the effectiveness the training heavy with resistance exercise program in the muscle fatigue
      control. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial by cluster, in which workers who
      participate in the intervention group will perform resistance exercise protocols; and workers
      in the comparative group held only stretching exercises and light resistance training with
      elastic bands. Expected results: strong evidence that fatigue reducing after ten weeks in
      workers and improve in others outcomes. Not found in literature studies in occupational
      evaluating this aspect of training.
