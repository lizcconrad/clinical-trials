      This is a Phase I/IIa, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of INO-3112 [VGX-3100 and INO-9012] delivered intramuscularly by
      electroporation in approximately 30 female subjects with biopsy-proven, Stage IB-IVB
      inoperable invasive cervical carcinoma associated with HPV 16 and/or 18 who have completed
      treatment with standard chemoradiation therapy with curative intent (Cohort 1) or in subjects
      with persistent and/or recurrent cervical cancer associated with HPV 16 and/or 18 following
      salvage therapy (Cohort 2).
