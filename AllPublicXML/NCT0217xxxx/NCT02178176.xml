    <textblock>
      The burden of diabetes is anticipated to grow yet the proportion of adults whose diabetes is
      controlled is decreasing over time. This project can have a significant public health impact
      because we are refining and pilot testing a primary-care based intervention aimed at
      improving patient engagement and function which are critical components of diabetes care and
      are associated with improved glycemic control, lower disease-related health-care
      expenditures, and reduced mortality.

    <description>Patients will identify factors involved in nonadherence. For each factor influencing adherence, the interventionist will engage the patient in a 4-step problem solving process.
We will recognize patients' social and cultural context by addressing health-related priorities identified by the patient. The goal will be to identify those priorities which are likely to influence engagement in care and adherence to treatment. We will assess both biomedical (physical symptoms, diet and exercise) and nonbiomedical (financial, social and emotional) needs patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and depressive symptoms may wish to discuss in the context of their health. After the patients complete the card sort, interventionists will engage the patient in the 4-step problem solving process.</description>
