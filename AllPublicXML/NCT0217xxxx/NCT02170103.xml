  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the effectiveness of a technique that uses a modified
      commercially available ultrasound system used for cardiac imaging, and a commercially
      available ultrasound contrast agent (microbubbles) to break up the blood clots that cause
      heart attacks. The ultrasound and microbubbles will be applied as soon as possible to
      patients presenting to the emergency department, after an EKG confirms that a heart attack is
      ongoing. Patients who provide emergent consent will be randomized to either conventional
      therapy for a heart attack, or conventional therapy and ultrasound with microbubbles. The
      ultrasound will be applied both before and after emergent heart catheterization, in order to
      break up the blood clots that are not only in the artery supplying the heart muscle, but also
      in the small branches (capillaries) that are fed by this artery. Following the randomized
      treatment, patients will be followed for the development of any complications (recurrent
      heart attack, heart failure, or need for defibrillator placement) as well as by echo and
      cardiac MRI to determine how much heart muscle was salvaged by the treatment. A total of 250
      patients will be enrolled and followed at two different sites. Randomization will be
      stratified at each study site. The initial site enrolling patients will be University of Sao
      Paulo Medical School. Wilson Mathias, MD, will serve as the principal investigator for this
      site. The other is VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, where Otto Kamp, MD, will serve
      as the principal investigator.

    <description>The agents will be divided into two separate doses (two vials per study), and mixed with approximately 29 milliliters of saline (approximately a 2.0-4.0% infusion). The first dilution will be administered pre PCI therapy, and the second dilution infused immediately post PCI. Since Optison is less stable in saline, an alternative approach will be to give the Optison as intermittent 0.1 milliliter boluses followed by 3-5 saline flushes over 10 seconds. The entire duration of each treatment before PCI will be up to 30 minutes depending on time constraints in getting to the catheterization laboratory, while the duration of treatment immediately after PCI will be 30 minutes.</description>
