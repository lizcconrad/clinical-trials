      The main purpose of this study is to determine if ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection can
      be eliminated in communities in Nepal following mass antibiotic distributions with
      azithromycin. The investigators will study both clinical trachoma and ocular C. trachomatis
      infection. The overall objective is to determine if the current World Health Organization
      (WHO) treatment strategy results in elimination of trachoma and infection.

        1. The investigators hypothesize that 24 communities in Kanchanpur, Kailali, and Achham
           districts of Nepal which receive mass antibiotic treatments will achieve elimination of
           trachoma as a public health problem (clinical disease &lt;5% in children 1-9 years old)
           more frequently than communities which have not received antibiotic treatments.

        2. The investigators hypothesize that infection with C. trachomatis will be undetectable in
           all members within a community following mass treatment as determined by the most highly
           sensiti1. The investigators hypothesize that 24 communities in Kanchanpur, Kailali, and
           Achham districts of Nepal which receive mass antibiotic treatments will achieve
           elimination of trachoma as a public health problem (clinical disease &lt;5% in children 1-9
           years old) more frequently than communities which have not received antibiotic
           treatments.

      2. The investigators hypothesize that infection with C. trachomatis will be undetectable in
      all members within a community following mass treatment as determined by the most highly
      sensitive nucleic acid amplification testing available (mRNA-based APTIMA and DNA-based
      AMPLICOR PCR).ve nucleic acid amplification testing available (mRNA-based APTIMA and
      DNA-based AMPLICOR PCR).

      Here we evaluate whether ocular chlamydia infection and clinical trachoma are eliminated from
      24 communities in western Nepal following a mass antibiotic distribution program. It is
      unknown if repeated treatments should continue or can be stopped thereby minimizing side
      effects and the high cost of medicine distribution. The investigators plan to randomize
      individuals to two groups to study the effects of a mass antibiotic distribution program: 1)
      treatment of antibiotics and 2) delayed treatment of antibiotics (after 4-6 months).
