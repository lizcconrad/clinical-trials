    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients had to have a diagnosis of COPD. Patients had to meet the following
             spirometric and static lung volume criteria:

               -  Patients had to have relatively stable, mild (stage I according to the criteria
                  of the American Thoracic Society (ATS); original trial protocol: moderate) to
                  severe airway obstruction with an FEV1 less than or equal to 65% of predicted
                  values. All patients had to have presence of lung hyperinflation as demonstrated
                  by thoracic gas volume (TGV) / functional residual capacity (FRC) greater than or
                  equal to 120% of predicted value as determined by body plethysmography at Visit 1
                  (day -15).

          -  Male or female patients ≥ 40 but ≤ 70 years old.

          -  Patients had to have a cigarette smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A
             pack-year was defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for
             a year.

          -  Patients had to be able to perform all specified procedures and maintain records
             during the study period as required in the protocol.

          -  Patients had to be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler®.

          -  All patients had to sign an Informed Consent Form in accordance with Good Clinical
             Practice (GCP) and local legislative requirements prior to participation in the trial
             . i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD were to be excluded. A significant
             disease was defined either as a disease, which in the opinion of the investigator
             might have put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease,
             which might have influenced the results of the study or the patient's ability to
             participate in the study.

          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis. If the abnormality defined a disease listed as an exclusion criterion, the
             patient was to be excluded.

          -  All patients with a serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT or AST) ≥ 1.5 of the
             upper limit of normal range (x ULN), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT or ALT)
             ≥ 1.5 x ULN, bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN, or creatinine ≥ 1.5 x ULN were excluded regardless
             of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation was not to be conducted in
             these subjects.

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., 1 year or less) of myocardial infarction.

          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e., 3 years or less) of heart failure, pulmonary
             edema, or patients with cardiac arrhythmia (with or without symptoms) or any
             contraindication to exercise as indicated in Protocol Appendix four (see Section 9.5.1
             and Appendices 16.1.1.1 and 16.1.1.2).

          -  Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy. (In centers with significantly
             decreased barometric pressure, exercise tests can be done with inhaled oxygen).

          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis.

          -  Patients with a history of cancer within the last 5 years. Patients with treated basal
             cell carcinoma were allowed.

          -  Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis.

          -  Patients who had undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history of thoracotomy for other reason were to be evaluated as per exclusion
             criterion No. 1.

          -  Patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the past 6 weeks prior to the
             Screening visit (Visit 1, day -15) or during the run-in period.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other
             components of the inhalation capsule delivery system.

          -  Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction.

          -  Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma.

          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a total
             blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3. A repeat eosinophil count was not to be conducted in
             these patients.

          -  Patients who were being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium had to stop
             these medications 1 month before Visit 1 (day -15).

          -  Patients who were being treated with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists) or
             antileukotrienes had to stop these medications 1 month before Visit 1 (day -15).

          -  Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than 6
             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm or Norplant®).

          -  Patients with history or active alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Patients who had taken an investigational drug within 1 month or 10 half lives
             (whichever was greater) prior to Screening visit (Visit 1, day -15).

          -  Limitation of exercise performance as a result of factors other than fatigue or
             exertional dyspnea such as arthritis in the leg, angina or claudication.

          -  Patients who participated in any rehabilitation program for COPD within 6 weeks prior
             to Visit 1 (day -15).
