  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel blood metabolic biomarker, AminoIndexTM (gynecological), was developed for
      gynecological cancers from over 400 Japanese patient's plasma free amino acid profiles
      (PFAAs) by a rapid and sensitive LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry), followed
      by multivariate statistical analyses. However, further studies to assess whether this
      biomarker demonstrates the same performance characteristics in non-Japanese populations for
      cancer is yet to be determined.

      &quot;AminoIndex Technology&quot; was developed based on high-throughput and absolute quantitative
      analysis method of amino acids and amines using UFLC-MS, and creating a clinical database to
      search for amino acid patterns across different diseases including cancer. &quot;AminoIndex
      Technology&quot; can evaluate certain health conditions and the possibility of diseases by
      analyzing the balance of plasma amino acids. Multicenter studies in Japan were conducted to
      develop an blood based biomarker panel for cancer.

      This study wil be conducted to evaluate the performance of AminoIndexTM (gynecological)
      biomarker based on &quot;AminoIndex Technology&quot; for gynecological cancers in US populations. This
      will be done by analyzing plasma metabolites including amino acids, from endometrial and
      ovarian cancer patients, from patients with benign gynecological disease, and healthy
      subjects using Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Liquid Chromatography
      - Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants in this study will be patients with Primary endometrial and ovarian cancer,
        benign gynecological diseases (such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, dysplasia, and
        benign ovarian tumors), and healthy subjects that meet the following criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 20 years (no data is currently available on use of AminoIndexTM in patients
             under 20 years of age or over 80 years of age)

          -  Willing to follow fasting and clinic visit requirements

          -  Ability to understand and consent to participate in study.

        Women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women will be excluded from study participation for the following reasons:

          -  An inability to fast (no food or drink other than water) for 8 hours prior to the
             pre-surgery sample collection.

          -  Are known to be positive for HIV/HCV/HBV

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding (Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this
             study because amino acid levels are known to differ in pregnancy).

          -  Currently receiving investigational agents.

          -  History of any drug therapy or surgery for treatment of gynecological cancer

          -  Unable to come for the blood sample collection between 6:00 AM and 12:00 Noon
