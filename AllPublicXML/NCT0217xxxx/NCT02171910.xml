  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation is needed in order to complete endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
      to alleviate discomfort and pain during the procedure. This is usually achieved with use of
      opioids and/or sedative agents such as benzodiazepines or propofol. Traditionally
      benzodiazepines have been used but nowadays propofol is becoming the drug of choice for
      sedation during ERCP.

      The problem with propofol sedation is the fact that it may case cardiorespiratory depression
      and there is no antidote for this like there is for benzodiazepines. Cardiovascular
      depression can usually be easily counteracted with drugs that are used to raise blood
      pressure or heart rate during general anesthesia but respiratory depression remains a
      problem.

      The aim of this study is to try to counteract the respiratory depression caused by propofol
      sedation using an old respiratory stimulant doxapram as opposed to placebo using a double
      blind randomized protocol.

      The investigators hypothesis is that boluses and an infusion of doxapram will alleviate the
      respiratory depression caused by propofol sedation.
