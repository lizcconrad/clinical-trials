    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial compares vigorous or moderate exercise in enhancing
      active surveillance in patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to nearby lymph
      nodes or to other parts of the body. Active surveillance involves watching the patient's
      condition but not giving any treatment unless test results show that the patient's condition
      is getting worse. Exercise may improve fitness, quality of life, brain health, and blood
      biomarkers in patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance. It is not yet known
      whether vigorous or moderate exercise works better in enhancing active surveillance in
      patients with localized prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of performing vigorous intensity aerobic exercise using
      progressive, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with standard stationary cycling and
      'cybercycling' compared to moderate intensity aerobic exercise with standard stationary
      cycling in prostate cancer (PCa) survivors on active surveillance (AS).

      II. To explore the potential effects of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (HIIT) using
      standard cycling and 'cybercycling' compared to moderate intensity standard cycling on
      changes in quality of life (QoL), cognition, fitness circulating inflammatory biomarkers and
      PCa-specific markers of progression (prostate specific antigen [PSA], time to AT) in PCa
      survivors in active surveillance (AS); and, to explore if these effects may be mediated by
      changes in body fat.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients perform moderate intensity exercise on a stationary bike for 20-50 minutes,
      three days a week for 16 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients perform HIIT exercise on a standard stationary bike, three days a week for
      16 weeks.

      ARM III: Patients perform HIIT exercise on a cybercycle using racing or other games, three
      days a week for 16 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 months.
