  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives were to collect information on vital status and pulmonary medication use at
      the predicted exit date for patients who participated in two one-year trials and withdrew
      prematurely. The primary objective was to ascertain the vital status (dead or alive) of these
      patients in the time interval between the patients' withdrawal from the trial and their
      predicted exit date (i.e: 48 weeks from first intake of randomised treatment + 30 days). The
      secondary objective was to collect information on classes of pulmonary medication and some
      other specified pulmonary interventions used by these prematurely discontinued patients at
      the time of their predicted exit date (i.e 48 weeks from the first intake of randomised
      treatment + 30 days) or at date of death (if this occurred during the time interval of
      interest, i.e 48 weeks from the first intake of randomised treatment + 30 days).
