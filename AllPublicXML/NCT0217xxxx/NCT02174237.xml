  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is first in human, Phase 1 study. Primary purpose is to assess safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic of the LNP1892. Study will be conducted in healthy human
      subjects. Pharmacokinetic will be studied in the subjects after administration of single and
      multiple doses.
