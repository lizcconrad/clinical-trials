  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is still unclear but several peptides have been
      indicated in the etiological factors in FD. Ghrelin and leptin are involved in regulation of
      appetite and gut motility and serotonin is a typical neurotransmitter related with sensory
      and motor functions of gut. On the other hand, transient receptor potential vanilloid
      receptor 1 (TRPV1) has been proposed to be involved with functional gastrointestinal
      disorder, and expression of this receptor could be regulated by nerve growth factor (NGF) or
      glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). The investigators aimed to determine
      whether expressions of ghrelin,leptin, serotonin,TRPV1,GDNF and NGF in blood or gastric
      mucosa of FD patients are different from those in healthy controls, and whether some changes
      of their expression correlate with certain dyspeptic symptoms. The investigators also
      investigated the effect of H. pylori infection by comparing their expressions before and one
      year after H. pylori eradication.

      Blood sample (plasma and serum), samples with DNA and paraffin-embedded tissue. During the
      endoscopic examination, one pair of biopsies was obtained from the greater curvature of high
      body. Biopsies are taken using standard biopsy forceps.

        Patients who had epigastric pain or discomfort with normal upper endoscopy and no evidence
        for explaining these symptoms were prospectively enrolled in Seoul National University
        Bundang Hospital. All participants underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. During endoscopy,
        biopsies were taken from both antrum and body for histological evaluation, determining H.
        pylori infection status.

        Participants were divided into control and patients according to the Rome III criteria.
        Patients group were subclassified into 3 categories; PDS (postprandial distress syndrome),
        EPS(epigastric pain syndrome) or mixed (PDS+EPS)
