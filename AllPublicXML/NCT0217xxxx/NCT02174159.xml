  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiretroviral
      activity of a single dose of MK-8507 in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, HIV-1 infected
      participants. The hypothesis tested in the study is that at a safe and well-tolerated dose,
      MK-8507 has superior antiretroviral activity to a historical placebo control, as measured by
      change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) at 168 hours postdose.
