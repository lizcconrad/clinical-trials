      The purpose of this study is going to determine the odds ratio of metabolic syndrome (MS),
      the habit of areca nut chewing, antioxidant, and inflammatory status in oral and esophageal
      patients. The current study was designed as a case-control study. Patients proved to be oral
      and esophageal cancer and had the habit of areca nut chewing are defined as case group.
      Patients proved to be oral and esophageal cancer and did not have the habit of areca nut
      chewing are defined as control group. The participants' age, blood pressures, and smoking
      habits will be recorded. Body weight, height, waist, and hip circumferences will be measured.
      Fasting venous blood samples will be obtained to determine hematological parameters [i.e.,
      serum creatinine, total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol,
      high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, glutathione
      peroxidase, catalase, and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, and interleukin-6)]. Logistic regression analyses are going to perform to
      examine the relationship between areca nut chewing and MS in this population. If we can make
      sure the relationship between areca nut chewing and MS, the clinicians and nutritionists can
      teach people to quit areca nut chewing in order to avoid the possibility of developing
      metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.
