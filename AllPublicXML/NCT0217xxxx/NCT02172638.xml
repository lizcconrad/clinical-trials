  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of Fast-trak or Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS) represents a new approach
      to the management of patients undergoing major surgery that re-examine traditional practices,
      replacing them if necessary with the best evidence based practices, creating a multimodal
      perioperative care pathway designed to achieve early recovery. In Colorectal Cancer Surgery ,
      as well as in a number of other procedures it has been shown to reduce Hospitalization by
      more than 30% without increasing the rate complications or readmissions.

      However information on the results of Fast-track protocols when applied to Gynecological
      patients is sparse, being especially notorious the lack of data regarding the efficacy of
      Fast-track in the management of Advanced Gynecological cancer.

      Hypothesis: the application of a Fast-Track protocol in the management of patients with
      advanced Ovarian Cancer( Stage III, IV and relapses) may improve the postoperatory recovery
      of these patients allowing for an early discharge and significant cost reduction, when
      compared with de usual management, without increasing the number readmission or surgery
      related complications.

    <description>Patients in this group will be managed according to an specifically designed FAST-TRACK protocol which will include: Preoperatory nutritional management and coaching by surgeon, anesthetist, nutritionist and specifically trained nurse personnel, reduced preoperatory fasting, avoiding use of intraabdominal drainages, specific anesthetic management to reduce intraoperative stress, avoiding use of Nasogastric tube, avoiding the need for major opioid in postoperatory analgesia and use of an standardized postoperatory management protocol directed to obtain an early oral intake and mobilization with a the goal of normal diet and deambulation in the 3rd day after surgery.</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to this group will receive the standard management preformed in our center until now. This management includes a preoperatory control exclusively by the surgeon and anesthetist, minimum of 8h fasting previous to surgery, loose use of intraabdominal drainage , systematic use of nasogastric tube whenever rectum resection or omentectomy is performed, Postoperative analgesia following standing Vall d'Hebron protocols for Moderate-severe postoperative pain, which include use of combined analgesia with non opioids drugs and major Opioids, and usual flexible, non standardized postoperatory management with mobilization and oral intake progression depending on perceived evolution by attending surgeon.</description>
