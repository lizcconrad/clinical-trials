  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to compare the natriuretic effect of telmisartan to placebo in mild-to-moderate
      hypertensive patients on a controlled sodium diet as well as to explore the effects of
      telmisartan on norepinephrine, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone, urine
      potassium, creatinin, chloride, bicarbonate and uric acid excretion. Additionally it was
      assessed whether the natriuretic effect disappears after treatment when telmisartan is
      stopped. The effects of telmisartan on seated clinic blood pressure and the relationship
      between urine sodium loss and decrease in ambulatory blood pressure after the first dose were
      assessed descriptively. Assessment of safety was also considered.
