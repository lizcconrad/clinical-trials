    <textblock>
      This protocol will evaluate Tacrolimus and MMF after conditioning with fludarabine and
      low-dose TBI in patients who are not candidates for conventional allografting. A novel
      approach to immunosuppression will be tested incorporating an early but extended taper of
      Tacrolimus starting on day +80 or in the case of relapse. The goal is to induce early
      immunity and GVT effects without compromising GVHD control. The anti-metabolite MMF will be
      re-introduced on day +100 to try and induce tolerance and block chronic GVHD during the taper
      of the Tacrolimus. DLI may be given in the presence of disease progression but not for mixed
      chimerism as in previous protocols.

      OBJECTIVES

      Major Objectives A. To determine whether stable allogeneic hematopoietic engraftment can be
      safely established in patients receiving a non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT from an
      HLA-Identical or non-identical family donor or unrelated donors, with fludarabine and
      low-dose TBI, with immunosuppression utilizing tacrolimus and MMF.

      B. To evaluate the incidence of grade II-IV GVHD associated with this treatment.

      C. To evaluate the engraftment when donors who are not HLA-identical family members are
      utilized for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      D. To evaluate the incidence of GVHD using three times per day MMF after unrelated donor stem
      cell transplants or two times per day MMF after family donor stem cell transplant.

      Minor Objectives A. To evaluate the incidence of chronic GVHD utilizing Tac/MMF with
      peripheral blood stem cells from matched or mis-matched allogeneic donors.

      B. To evaluate disease responses and survival after Flu/TBI allogeneic SCT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with AML, ALL, CML, CLL, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), NHL, Hodgkin's
             disease (HD), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), hypoproliferative dysplasia
             with or without increased blasts, or myeloma, who are at significantly higher than
             usual risk for mortality from conventional myeloablative allogeneic SCT due to age or
             comorbidities:

          -  Age ≥ to 50 years with AML or ALL in complete remission or with &lt;18% blasts in bone
             marrow

          -  Age ≥ to 50 years with MDS or CML.

          -  Age 16 to 75 years with lymphomas or myeloma, who have failed chemotherapy and are not
             candidates for an autologous transplant, or who have failed a prior autologous SCT.

          -  Patients of any age with CLL or low-grade NHL. Patients with CLL and low-grade NHL
             need to have failed at least first-line treatment, with an alkylating agent,
