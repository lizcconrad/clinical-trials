  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a hospital-based violence intervention programs
      can make sustainable behavior changes in at-risk youth using two key components, brief
      intervention at the hospital bedside and case management.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Youth presenting to the emergency
      department with an intentional injury (gunshot wound, stab wound, or assault) will be given a
      behavioral assessment. Participants will be categorized according to risk (low, moderate,
      high). Only moderate or high youth will continue in the study and be randomized. Low risk
      youths will receive the medical standard of care and be re-assessed at 18 months.

      Randomization will place participants in one of two arms. Arm 1 will receive the standard of
      care PLUS a brief intervention with AIM outreach workers. Arm 2 will receive standard medical
      care PLUS a brief intervention PLUS case management.

      Every randomized youth will be assessed for risk and protective factors and have have data
      collected at 6-month intervals (0, 6, 12, 18 months).

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm will include all interventions in Standard Medical Care + Brief Intervention Arm. Case management will also be given to this arm. General needs based assessments will be conducted by the outreach worker. These assessments will be done at the hospital or at the youth's home, whichever they prefer. This assessment tool addresses education, vocational training, employment, housing, medical insurance, follow-up care and pro-social activities. Although each youth in this arm will receive the same needs-based assessment, individual youth will have variable needs, which will guide each unique and individualized case management plan.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Brief Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Goals of the bedside intervention will be to help the patient understand their risky behaviors that resulted in the injury and to assess and deescalate any threat of retaliatory violence by the patient. The outreach worker will: (1) develop a rapport with the patient by introducing themselves and describing their (outreach worker's) background and reason for the bedside visit; (2) assess the emotional response to the current injury; (3) ensure the patient and/or family understand the nature of the injury and ED course; (4) address any immediate concerns of the patient; and (5) develop a plan for staying safe following discharge.</description>
