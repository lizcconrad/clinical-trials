  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical models show that a daily antiangiogenic regimen at low-dose may be effective
      against chemotherapy-resistant tumors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      maintenance therapy with continuous oral cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in patients with
      high grade, operable, metastatic osteosarcoma (OST) of the extremities. The primary end point
      is event-free survival (EFS) from randomization

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design includes backbone of 10 weeks of preoperative therapy using MAP (high-dose
      methotrexate, cisplatin, doxorubicin and dexrazoxane). Metastatic patients were randomized to
      high-dose chemotherapy for 31 weeks (arm 1) or concomitant metronomic therapy (MTX plus
      cyclophosphamide) such as 31 weeks of high-dose chemotherapy, followed by 73 weeks of
      metronomic therapy after completion of high-dose chemotherapy, totaling 104 weeks of
      metronomic therapy (arm 2).
