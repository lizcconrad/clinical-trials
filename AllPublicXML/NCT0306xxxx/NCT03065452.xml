  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar stenosis (LSS) is the most frequent degenerative lumbar disease and is the most
      frequent indication for spinal surgery. When non-invasive treatments fail, decompression
      surgery is the gold standard therapy for the majority of patients and generally improves
      symptoms.

      However, few studies have investigated the improvement in posture (radiological parameters)
      after surgery. In lumbar stenosis, patients may present a forward leaning posture (to relieve
      pain), which is responsible for sagittal imbalance.

      The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the repercussions of decompression surgery
      on sagittal balance and to compare these with aux clinical results. investigators included
      patients operated on for isolated lumbar canal stenosis.
