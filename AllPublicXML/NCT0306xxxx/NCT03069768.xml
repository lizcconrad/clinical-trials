  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to conduct a 60-patient feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy study of mSMART (Mobile App based Personalized Solutions and Tools for
      Medication Adherence of Rx Pill), a smartphone application (&quot;app&quot;) for improving medication
      adherence among substance users. The investigators will compare 2 groups of cigarette smokers
      undergoing a quit attempt with varenicline (Chantix): a) an experimental group using the
      mSMART app on their smartphone and a MEMS Cap (Medication Event Monitoring System, a smart
      pillbox that will a record a date and time-stamped medication event whenever pill box is
      opened and closed, and thus allow for primary measurement of medication adherence) and b) a
      control group using the MEMS Cap and mobile web-based surveys on their smartphone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor medication adherence (a) results in poorer treatment outcome and (b) accounts for $100
      to $290 billion in U.S. healthcare costs annually. Therefore, interventions that target
      medication adherence are increasingly crucial for patient care and cost-effectiveness. Mobile
      technologies such as smartphones are increasingly ubiquitous and affordable in the U.S., and
      can be integrated to augment medication adherence. mSMART is a smartphone application that
      targets medication adherence in substance users. The study team has developed and assessed
      mSMART in a Stage Ia trial among 9 non-treatment seeking cigarette smokers. mSMART provides
      psychoeducation about medication (e.g., dosage, benefits, side-effects), assessment of
      medication compliance and characteristics associated with substance use, provides reminders
      to take medications, and conducts real-time medication event feedback intervention. The aim
      of the current study is to extend findings from the Stage Ia trial assessing preliminary
      feasibility and acceptability of mSMART for cigarette smokers. In the proposed study, the
      investigators will conduct a Stage Ib for the continued development of mSMART in an
      occupational wellness setting. This will also include a study of the feasibility,
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of mSMART for treatment seeking cigarette smokers
      undergoing a quit attempt. A sample of 60 cigarette smokers will be given varenicline
      (Chantix) and randomized to either a control condition (i.e., use of MEMS Cap, a smart
      pillbox that records instances that the pill bottle is opened) or treatment condition (i.e.,
      use of MEMS Cap and mSMART) over a 12 week treatment period. The primary hypothesis is that
      the treatment group will achieve higher levels of medication adherence assessed via MEMS Cap.
      The secondary hypothesis is that the treatment group will also yield lower levels of salivary
      cotinine at week 12 assessment, indicating higher rates of smoking abstinence relative to the
      control group. Findings from the current study will inform the continued development of
      mSMART as an intervention to enhance substance use treatment outcome, including other forms
      of substance use besides cigarette smoking.

    <description>Acceptability of mSMART will be based on responses to an exit interview at the end of the study (Visit 2). Questionnaire asks for agreement with statements relating to acceptability of the app. Response options will be quantified on a Likert scale (1 = not at all, 2 = somewhat, 3 = moderately, 4 = extremely). Example question: What was your overall satisfaction with mSMART?</description>
