      &quot;Remote Ischaemic PreConditioning&quot; (RIPC) is performed prior to partial nephrectomy.
      Postoperative calprotectin dynamics and Blood Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) MRI are used to
      to demonstrate the potential renoprotective effect of RIPC

    <textblock>
      Partial nephrectomy represents the gold standard in organ sparing kidney surgery. Cold
      ischaemia prevents major bleeding but can yet be associated with impaired kidney function due
      to reperfusion injury to the tubuli.

      Patients undergoing partial nephrectomy (any surgical technique, open, retroperitoneoscopic,
      transperitoneal, Da Vinci assisted) will be treated with &quot;Remote Ischaemic PreConditioning&quot;
      (RIPC). RIPC is delivered with a standard blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm and
      another standard blood pressure cuff placed on the upper thigh. The cuffs are then
      simultaneously inflated to 200 mm HG and left inflated for 5 minutes, then deflated to 0 mmHG
      and left uninflated for 5 minutes. This cycle is repeated twice, so that the RIPC protocol
      takes 20 minutes in total. If the systolic blood pressure is &gt; 185mm HG the cuffs are
      inflated to 15 mmHG above that level. Several studies already demonstrated the reno- and
      cardioprotective potential of &quot;Remote Ischaemic PreConditioning&quot; (RIPC). It was shown that
      urinary calprotectin can be used to monitor tubular damage after nephron sparing surgery.
      Postoperative calprotectin dynamics will be monitored in order to demonstrate the potential
      renoprotective effect of RIPC. Additionally a BOLD MRI will be performed to to visualize
      ischemia/reperfusion injury.
