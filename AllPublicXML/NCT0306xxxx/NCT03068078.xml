      Further studies are needed to establish the optimal diet for treating T2D.

      The investigators wishes to investigate whether a low carbohydrate diet, high in
      monounsaturated fats (LCD) will affect cardiovascular function, metabolism and the liver.

      135 participants with T2D, will be following either a LCD, or a regular diabetes diet (RDD)
      for 6 months. Measurements and investigations will be performed at baseline and after 6
      months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an increasing global problem, especially in developing countries.
      T2D is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), where hyperglycemia
      is especially important for microvascular damage.

      Previous studies in T2D on reduced carbohydrate intake has shown beneficial effects on
      glycemic control, indicated by reduction in HbA1c, fasting insulin and 2h-glucose (OGTT)
      values. However further studies are needed to establish the optimal diet for treating T2D.

      The investigators wishes to investigate whether a low carbohydrate diet, high in
      monounsaturated fats will:

        1. Improve glycemic control, dyslipidemia and metabolic markers in T2D despite unchanged
           anti-diabetic treatment.

        2. Improve endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in the
           brachial artery as well as microvascular damage assessed by retinal scan, urine
           albuminuria and minimal forearm vascular resistance (MFVR).

        3. Improve Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) assessed by a reduction in NAFLD
           Activity Score on liver biopsy and markers of inflammation and fibrogenesis.

        4. Improve quality of life

        5. Improve gut dysbiosis

      The study will be conducted through a 6 month randomized controlled trial with 135
      participants with type 2 diabetes. 90 participants will be randomized to the intervention
      group, following a LCD, and 45 participants will be randomized to the control group (regular
      diet for diabetes, RDD). The below described measurements will be conducted before baseline
      and after 6 months, and the participants will fill out a QoL questionnaire at 0, 3 and 6
      months.

      Planned examinations are ultrasound assessment of flow-mediated vasodilation, Dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA-scan), retina scan, liver biopsy, liver-scans, blood, urine, hair,
      saliva and feces. Accelerometers will be applied before, during and after the study to
      evaluate compliance in unchanged exercise pattern. Compliance with diet will be evaluated by
      a clinical dietitian and through food diaries.
