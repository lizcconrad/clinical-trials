  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ROSSTAR trial is a pragmatic trial that will directly compare the strategies of routine
      and selective stress imaging testing (with radionuclide imaging (RNI)) late after PCI or CABG
      in asymptomatic patients. The study will be a single center trial based at the Jewish General
      Hospital (JGH), a McGill University teaching hospital (Montreal, Quebec). A total of 1100
      patients who are either &gt;5 years post-CABG or &gt;2 years post-PCI will be randomized. Half of
      the patients will be randomized to a routine RNI testing, and the other half to selective RNI
      testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus in current guidelines regarding the role of stress imaging testing late
      after revascularization. The issue to be resolved by the trial is whether routine stress
      imaging testing (stress test with nuclear perfusion imaging) benefits patients late after
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

      What are the principal research questions to be addressed?

        1. Is a strategy of routine stress imaging testing late after PCI or CABG associated with
           lower clinical event rates than a strategy of selective stress imaging testing?

        2. Is a strategy of routine stress imaging testing late after PCI or CABG associated with
           better quality of life than a strategy of selective stress imaging testing?

        3. What are the resources utilization associated with routine vs. selective stress imaging
           testing?

      What is the primary hypothesis? The primary hypothesis is that routine stress imaging testing
      late after PCI or CABG is associated with lower clinical event rates than a strategy of
      selective stress imaging testing.
