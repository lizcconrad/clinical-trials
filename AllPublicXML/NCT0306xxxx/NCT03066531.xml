  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to compare an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
      group intervention and a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) group in a sample of obese
      individuals with respect to mid-term outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective weight-management programs often include a combination of physical activity, diet,
      and psychological intervention, in particular Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The effects
      of these programs are frequently not stable, and usually the maintenance of achieved
      weight-loss lasts only for a short period of time. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, ACT,
      keeps on gaining recognition in obesity treatment. The purpose of the study is to compare
      weight loss and indicator of psychological functioning in a population of obese subjects
      belonging to three different diagnostic categories: without ED, with ED NAS and with BED.
      Participants were exposed respectively to a CBT or an ACT treatment and were assessed three
      times: pre intervention, post intervention and follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that
      CBT and ACT are both effective in the post-intervention. ACT intervention should be more
      effective in the follow-up both for weight and psychological functioning, due to its focus on
      the flexible managing of the global context instead of the focus on the pathology itself,
      more typical in standard CBT treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline - Post-Treatment (one month in-patient rehabilitation intervention) - FollowUp at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the score of CORE-OM measured in three time points, before treatment (baseline), post treatment (after one month in-patient rehabilitation program) and at 6 months Follow-Up. CORE-OM (Italian version by Palmieri et al., 2009) is a self-report measure designed for use as a baseline and outcome measure in psychological therapies and after its conclusion. It assesses the subjective experience of a person, as well as the way he or she functions in the world. It is composed by 34 items on a 5-points likert-scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Low scores correspond to high wellbeing. The CORE-OM provided 5 scales: wellness, symptoms, functioning, risk and total. The investigator involved in administering and interpreting the CORE-OM were blinded to treatment assignment.</description>

    <measure>AAQ-II</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - Post-Treatment (one month in-patient rehabilitation intervention) - FollowUp at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the score of AAQ-II measured in three time points, before treatment (baseline), post treatment (after one month in-patient rehabilitation program) and at 6 months Follow-Up.The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ; Hayes et al., 2004) is the most widely used measure of experiential avoidance and psychological inflexibility. We used the 7-item Italian (7-points likert-scale from 0-never true to 7-always true) version of AAQ-II (Pennato, Berrocal, Bernini &amp; Rivas, 2013) that shows adequate indexes of validity and reliability with a single-factor structure. In the case of AAQ-II higher scores indicate greater psychological flexibility.</description>
