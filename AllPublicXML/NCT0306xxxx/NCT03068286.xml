      SilverCloud provides internet-delivered interventions for depression and anxiety in NHS
      Mental Health Services. The interventions have proved successful in the management of
      depression and anxiety for clients presenting to mental health services, with recovery rates
      exceeding the national standard. Recently SilverCloud has embarked on tailoring the
      interventions for patients with long-term conditions including COPD, pain and diabetes. The
      purpose of the customisation is to make the interventions more meaningful and relevant to
      patients with LTCs, but all the while having the same goal of addressing depression and
      anxiety disorders. In doing so it would be expected that individuals might be in a better
      position to effectively self-manage their LTC. The current study, therefore, seeks to assess
      the possible effectiveness of implementing customised internet-delivered interventions for
      depression and anxiety for people with long-term conditions presenting to NHS mental health
      services.

    <textblock>
      iCBT is the delivery of a tailored structured cognitive and behaviour therapy based
      programme, with support, to individuals with mild to moderate symptoms of depression and
      anxiety. There is now a substantial body of research evidence that supports the efficacy and
      effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for depression and anxiety
      (Richards &amp; Richardson, 2012; Andersson and Cuijpers, 2009). Historically, a number of iCBT
      interventions have been used in clinical practice in IAPT services. However, they have often
      suffered from poor engagement and consequently poor clinical outcomes. More recent
      developments in the field have produced more robust technological platforms, where content is
      delivered through a variety of media that enhance productivity, increase engagement and
      produce better clinical outcomes. The SilverCloud intervention has been demonstrated to be a
      clinical effective evidence-based cognitive behavioural treatment option (Richards et al.,
      2015).

      Chronic illnesses can have profound effects on well-being, functional capacity and quality of
      life. Psychological comorbidities with an LTC can further contribute to the distress that is
      caused by these symptoms. Patients with comorbid depression and anxiety disorders and a
      long-term condition are associated with significantly higher health care utilisation, poorer
      outcomes from treatment and increased costs of care (Moussavi et al., 2007; Naylor et al.,
      2012). The IAPT programme in the UK provides effective treatments for depression and anxiety
      but these have been underutilized by people with LTCs and partially this is due to an
      underrecognition; one reason for this has been the traditional precedence set on managing the
      physical aspects of any LTC and effectively paying little attention to psychological
      comorbidity (Coventry et al., 2011).

      Several pathfinders sites are currently involved in providing psychological treatment for
      long-term conditions, but to date, results have been limited due to several factors, such as
      delays in commencing programmes and funding issues. To this extent, SilverCloud wishes to
      implement their tailored &quot;Space from…&quot; series of programmes for long-term conditions -
      chronic pain, COPD and Diabetes. The purpose of the tailoring is to make the interventions
      more meaningful and relevant to patients with LTCs, but all the while having the same goal of
      addressing depression and anxiety disorders. In doing so it would be expected that
      individuals might be in a better position to effectively self-manage their LTC. The current
      study, therefore, seeks to assess the clinical feasibility of implementing customised
      internet-delivered interventions for depression and anxiety for people with LTCS presenting
      to IAPT services.

    <measure>Depression (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9;(Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001; Spitzer, Kroenke, &amp; Williams, 1999) is a self-report measure of depression that has been widely used in screening, primary care, and research. The PHQ-9 items reflect the diagnostic criteria for depression outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition - Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000). Summary scores range from 0-27, where larger scores reflect a greater severity of depressive symptoms. The PHQ-9 has been found to discriminated well between depressed and non-depressed individuals using the clinical cut-off of total score ≥10, with good sensitivity (88.0%), specificity (88.0%) and reliability (.89) (Kroenke et al., 2001; Spitzer et al., 1999).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety (as measured by the 7 item Generalised Anxiety Disorder inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Löwe, 2006) GAD-7 comprises 7 items measuring symptoms and severity of GAD based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for GAD. The GAD-7 has good internal consistency (α = .92) and good convergent validity with other anxiety scales (Spitzer et al., 2006). Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms. The GAD-7 has increasingly been used in large-scale studies as a generic measure of change in anxiety symptomatology, using a cut-off score of 8 (D. A. Richards &amp; Suckling, 2009).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes Distress (As measured by the Diabetes Distress Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS; Polonsky et al., 2005; Fisher et al., 2008) is a 17-item measure that focusses on 4 aspects of distress associated with diabetes: emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress and physician distress. The measure and its 4 subscales have demonstrated good internal consistency (α &gt; .87) and convergent validity with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, meal planning, exerecise and total cholesterol (Polonsky et al., 2005).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Acceptance (As measured by the Pain Acceptance Questionnaire - revised)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (Revised) (CPAQ-R; McCracken, Vowles &amp; Eccleston, 2004) is a 20 item measure used to assess acceptance of pain in chronic pain patients and contains two subscales - activity engagement and pain willingness. The measure has demonstrated good levels of internal consistency (α = .80)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical COPD Symptoms (As measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ; Reda et al., 2010; Molen et al., 2003) is a 10 item measure that incorporates three subscales - symptoms, functional state and mental state. Each item is graded on a 7-point likert scale, where lower scores are indicative of a better COPD health status. Internal consistency of the measure has been found to be good (α = .91) (Molen et al., 2003)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (As measured by the EuroQOL 5D5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol 5D5L (EQ5D5L) (Herdman et al., 2011) is a measure of health-related quality of life. The first part of the measure consists of 5 self-report items measuring the domains of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each item has a possible five responses, which rank in severity (no problems - extreme problems). From these results, a societal index can be obtained, allowing for further analysis. The second part of the measure records self-reported health state on a visual analogue scale (VAS), a vertical line where the best and worst imaginable health states score 100 and 0, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work and Social Adjustment (as measured by the Work and Social Adjustment Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0) and end of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Work and Social Adjustment (WASA; Mundt, Marks, Shear &amp; Greist, 2002) is a simple, reliable and valid measure of impaired functioning. It is a simple and reliable (α &gt;.75) 5-item self-report measure which provides an experiential impact of a disorder from the patient's point of view. It looks at how the disorder impairs the patient's ability to function day to day on five dimensions: work, social life, home life, private life and close relationships.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Experience (As measured by the Patient Experience Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment (week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Experience Questionnaire will be used to assess patient experience and satisfaction. This questionnaire forms a part of the IAPT minimum data set and is a national requirement in the UK. The PEQ contains several quantitative questions and open ended questions that are used to assess participant's views and satisfaction with service provision.</description>
