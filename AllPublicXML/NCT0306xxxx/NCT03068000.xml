  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be a three-month intervention with two groups: judo training and ball games, twice
      a week, for 50 minutes. The sample will consist of children and adolescents with low
      socioeconomic status, participants of a philanthropic institution, aged between 6 and 15
      years, who will be randomized in the two groups mentioned above. Motor skills, physical
      fitness, cardiovascular parameters and questionnaire assessing socioeconomic status, quality
      of life, physical activity level, screen time, sleep quality, back pain, food intake and body
      image dissatisfaction will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample will be of 66 participants, randomized into two groups 33 in judo and 33 in ball
      games. According to the sample calculation based on the study of Bala and Drid (2010) title
      &quot;Anthropometric and Motor Features of Young Judoists in Vojvodina&quot;, who analyzed motor skills
      in young judokas and untrained control, using the variable slalom with 3 balls (functional
      coordination and the age group from 11 to 13 years. In which the difference between the means
      was of 36.86 and the standard deviation of 53.78, with the power of the 80% test and
      significance of 5% in boys. In girls the sample calculation was the same number (33 for
      group) using the same variable slalom with 3 balls (functional coordination and the some age
      group from 11 to 13 years, the difference between the means was 10.45 and the standard
      deviation of 15.05, with the power of the 80% test and significance of 5%

      The present study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of FCT/UNESP (CAAE:
      26702414.0.0000.5402), with the number of opinion 549.549.

      Interventions

      Judo Training Judo intervention will take place twice a week, lasting 50 minutes per session,
      divided into general exercises: warm-up and stretching specific to the sport; Specific
      exercises of the sport: shock absorption, falls cushioning (Ukemi-waza), immobilization
      techniques (hon-kesa-gatame and tate-shiho-gatame) and projection (o-soto-gari, o-goshi,
      ashi-guruma, koshi-guruma, tai-otoshi and others); And fight simulation: randori.

      Ball Games The Ball Games will take place twice a week, with a duration of 50 minutes per
      session, divided into general exercises: heating and specific stretching with ball; Specific
      exercises of the sport: fundamentals of sports with ball, exercises with ball; And games:
      games will be given at the end of the lesson to work out all the fundamentals and specific
      exercises in general.

      Statistical Analysis We will perform the Shapiro-Wilks normality test, analysis of variance
      (ANOVA) of repeated measures and the effect size will be calculated by Eta Squared, all using
      SPSS Software version 13.0 and adopting a significance of 5%.
