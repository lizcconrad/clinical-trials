      The aim of this study is;

      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir based therapy
      for chronic hepatitis C with or without compensated cirrhosis in HCV treatment naïve patients
      receiving long-term haemodialysis through assessment of:

        1. The proportion of patients with a sustained virological response (HCV RNA &lt;25 IU/mL) 12
           weeks after the last dose of study drug (SVR12).

        2. To determine withdrawal rate related to side effects and /or adverse effects for
           patients receiving at least 1 dose of the study medication.

    <description>A total of 40 HCV treatment naïve patients with or without compensated cirrhosis on regular hemodialysis will be enrolled in the study.
These patients will receive intervention of '25 mg ombitasvir, 150 mg paritaprevir, and 100 mg ritonavir' (2 capsules Qurevo®) plus ribavirin 200 mg daily for 12 weeks.
Qurevo will be given once daily (on the day of dialysis, it will be given after dialysis session).
Ribavirin will be given once daily (on the day of dialysis, it will be given 4 hrs before dialysis session ).</description>
