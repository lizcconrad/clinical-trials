  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us understand how HIV and/or Anti-Retroviral Therapy
      (ART) may predispose individuals to Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). The traditional risk
      factors for OSA are weight and age. However, people living with HIV on ART seem to have OSA
      even when they are thin and young. The study involves a detailed physiological sleep study
      and an MRI of the head and neck to understand the underlying cause of OSA in those with and
      without HIV.

      Participants who have sleep apnea and are using positive airway pressure (PAP) with and
      without HIV will be enrolled if they otherwise meet all the inclusion criteria, and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      Subjects will undergo two overnight sleep studies (polysomnograms, PSGs) and a MRI scan of
      the upper airway. The first sleep study will evaluate the severity of sleep disordered
      breathing and will be identical to a clinical PSG. The second sleep study will measure the
      physiological traits most important for OSA, such as upper airway anatomy, control of
      breathing, sleep stability, and upper airway muscle activation. These measurements are
      performed while subjects sleep using PAP, but the PAP level is adjusted during the night, and
      the subject's response is measured. The MRI scan will be of the head and neck and will occur
      during the evening time. Subjects will be encouraged to sleep during this portion of the
      study, as well.
