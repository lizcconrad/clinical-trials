  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre, randomised controlled trial, conducted in the UK will recruit 180 subjects,
      randomised to receive either the Trigen InterTAN Nail or the Sliding Hip Screw.

      Subjects presenting at participating hospitals with AO/OTA 31-A1 or A2 fractures will be
      assessed against the eligibility criteria and approached for Informed Consent.

      Subjects who are considered eligible and who have provided Informed Consent will be
      randomised using iDataFax to one of the two treatment options.

      Subjects will be operated on according to standard procedure and the Instructions for Use.

      A daily inpatient assessment will record the subjects use of opioid pain medication.

      Subjects will be assessed at the time of discharge to record their residential and ambulatory
      status, Functional Independence Measure, Get Up and Go Test and opioid usage.

      At 8 weeks and 12 weeks post surgery, subjects will be contacted by telephone to confirm
      their residential and ambulatory status, Functional Independence Measure, modified Harris Hip
      Score and Euroqol-5D.

      At 6 months post surgery, subjects will attend an outpatient visit to have a follow up
      radiograph, Get Up and Go Test, residential and ambulatory status, Functional Independence
      Measure, modified Harris Hip Score and Euroqol-5D.

      At 12 months post surgery, subjects will be contacted by telephone to confirm their
      residential and ambulatory status, Functional Independence Measure, modified Harris Hip Score
      and Euroqol-5D.

      Adverse events, device deficiencies and reoperations will be recorded as and when they occur
      throughout the study.

    <description>The FIM instrument is a basic indicator of severity of disability. Comprises 18 items assessed against a seven point ordinal scale, where the higher the score for an item, the more independently the patient is able to perform the tasks assessed by that item. Total scores range from 18 to 126. The items are divided into 13 Motor items and 5 Cognitive Items. The rating scale designates major graduations in behaviour from dependence to independence. The scale provides for the classification of individuals by their ability to carry out an activity independently, versus their need for assistance from another person or a device. If help is needed the scale assesses the degree of that need.

    <measure>Modified Harris Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The HHS was developed to assess the results of hip surgery, first described in 1969 . A modified version (mHHS) is used in this study which records the subjects' experience of pain (worth a maximum of 44 points) and activities of daily living and gait (worth a maximum of 47 points). A higher score is associated with a better outcome. Questions include pain experienced, the distance the subject can walk, ability to put on socks and shoes, ability to use public transportation, supports needed, limp, ability to use stairs and any problems in sitting. Deformity and range of motion measurements are excluded from the standard HHS in order to allow remote completion.
This assessment is recorded by a clinician onto the CRF via interview with the subject.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measurement of health outcome. It consists of a descriptive system with 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) which are each assigned three levels (no problems, some problems, extreme problems) and a Visual Analogue Scale where subjects indicate a numerical value from 0-100 where 0 is the worst imaginable health state and 100 is the best imaginable health state.
The EQ-5D is a patient reported outcome.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>SHS is a generic term for a group of devices used for internal fixation of trochanteric hip fractures. Also known as Compression Hip Screw or Dynamic Hip Screw. All devices feature a lag screw inserted into the femoral neck and a side plate held in place by cortical screws inserted into the proximal femoral shaft.
Therapeutic effect is achieved by guided collapse, where the lag screw can slide in the barrel of the side plate which compresses the fracture as the patient begins to weight-bear.
Participating sites may use whichever brand of SHS is currently in use.

    <intervention_name>Post-Surgery Follow Up</intervention_name>
    <description>The current clinical trend is for minimal follow up post-surgery, unless indicated by complications. The study protocol indicated that follow up telephone visits are to be performed at 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 12 months post-surgery and an outpatient follow up visit at 6 months post-surgery. While most outcome measures are conducted via questionnaire, the increase in follow up means that subjects may be exposed to increased ionising radiation.</description>
