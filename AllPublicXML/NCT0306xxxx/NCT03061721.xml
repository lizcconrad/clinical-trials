  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in up to 104 patients with a
      diagnosis of NAFLD and/or NASH. The study will be conducted over a period of up to 22 weeks
      and will include an optional Prescreening, Screening (Days -35 to -7) Phase, a 16-week
      Treatment Phase following randomization on Day 1. Patients will be randomly assigned in a
      ratio of 1:1:1:1 to receive Saroglitazar Magnesium 1mg or 2 mg or 4 mg or matching placebo
      once daily in the morning before breakfast for 16 Weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is
      percentage change from baseline in serum ALT levels at Week 16 in the Saroglitazar Magnesium
      groups as compared to the placebo group.
