  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking to improve the safety of patients with chronic kidney disease via
      education provided on a mobile tablet. This study will additionally examine if electronic
      tools, such as mobile tablets, can help.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with CKD are at risk for adverse safety events, yet little is known regarding the
      utility of health information technology (IT) educational tools to reduce these events. The
      results of this project will be invaluable in gaining a better understanding of the
      limitations and potential for use of a patient-centered mHealth patient safety educational
      intervention in high-risk individuals with CKD.

      The study will evaluate the perceived eHealth literacy of patients with CKD and its relation
      to medication errors in the CRIC cohort. The hypothesis is that a novel mHealth-based patient
      safety curriculum designed to address a wide-range of e-literacy will be effective in
      attenuating the identified Digital Divide adversely affecting many CKD patients, and will
      reduce adverse safety events common in this population.

      Study Aims:

        1. Examine the association between surveyed perceived e-literacy and medication errors in
           individuals with CKD

           Hypothesis 1: Medication error rates will be higher among CRIC participants with low
           eHealth literacy.

        2. Assess the acceptance and feasibility of a novel mHealth-based patient safety curriculum
           to improve patient safety risk knowledge among individuals with CKD and determine its
           efficacy in increasing patient safety risk awareness.

      Hypothesis 2a: A low literacy mHealth patient safety curriculum will improve patient safety
      risk awareness among high risk individuals with CKD.

      Hypothesis 2b: Medication error rates will be higher among CRIC participants with low patient
      safety risk awareness.

    <description>A survey has been designed that evaluates CRIC participants' computer and mobile phone usage, and perceived e-health literacy.
There is also a mobile health-based (mHealth) patient safety educational curriculum that evaluates CRIC participants' knowledge of patient safety hazards in CKD. The mHealth patient safety curriculum tool is also known as eCRIC.</description>

    <description>The curriculum in the mHealth tool was derived in consultation with patient safety, informatics and adult educational curricula experts, and is comprised of clinical vignettes describing common patient safety themes in CKD and includes a pre- and post-test knowledge assessment. Topics of emphasis included NSAID risk awareness, hypoglycemia awareness, avoidance of volume depletion when ill (&quot;Sick Day Protocol&quot;) and avoidance of contrast-induced nephropathy.</description>
