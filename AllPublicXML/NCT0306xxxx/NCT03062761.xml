  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is universally accepted that the best nutrition for a new-born infant is breast milk.
      Breast milk provides a complete set of nutrients to support growth and development of
      children in early life, including components that have a beneficial effect on gut health and
      the body's ability to defend itself against infectious organisms and other invaders (immune
      system).However, it may occur that a mother is unable to breastfeed her child, or chooses not
      to breastfeed. In such cases, an infant formula inspired by breast milk is the best
      alternative. Research is done to optimize milk formula for infants. One of these formulas
      contains 'partially hydrolyzed' proteins instead of intact proteins, meaning the proteins in
      this formula are broken down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces of protein make the
      milk more suitable for consumption by infants at risk of developing cow's milk allergy. These
      types of partially hydrolyzed protein formulas have been on the market for several years, in
      particular for children with a family risk of allergy. So far, no safety related issues have
      been reported. It is also known that weight gain of infants receiving partially hydrolyzed
      proteins in general is appropriate according to the World Health Organisation growth
      standards.

      The main purpose of the TENUTO study is to demonstrate that infants who receive a specific
      partially hydrolyzed protein infant formula for the first 4 months of life have a similar
      weight gain compared to infants receiving standard infant formula with intact proteins. A
      group of infants who receive breast milk only is also included for comparison.
