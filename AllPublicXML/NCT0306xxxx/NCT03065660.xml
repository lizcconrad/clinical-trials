  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy. As many as 15-25% of pregnancies
      end in miscarriage, and the number of miscarriages in England is estimated to be
      approximately 125,000 per year. Miscarriage often brings not only physical pain, bleeding and
      risks of infection, but also psychological impacts on women and their families. This study
      will focus on women whose pregnancy sac remains inside the womb (known as a missed
      miscarriage) and opt for medical management of their miscarriage up to 13+6 weeks of
      pregnancy. NICE currently recommends that a drug called misoprostol (a vaginal pessary or
      oral tablet that makes the womb contract) should be used in the medical treatment of
      miscarriage. However, there is evidence to suggest that combining this drug with mifepristone
      (an oral tablet that reduces pregnancy hormones) may be more effective in treating
      miscarriage. Therefore, to test this in a clinical trial, participants will be allocated at
      random to receive either mifepristone followed by misoprostol, or a dummy drug (placebo)
      followed by misoprostol. Neither the participants nor the researchers will know what
      allocation is decided, which is necessary to test the treatments fairly. The main outcome of
      interest will be whether miscarriage is complete within 7 days of randomisation. If
      miscarriage is not complete then further treatment (more tablets or surgery) will be offered.
      A number of other key outcomes, such as the need for an operation, will also be assessed. We
      will also study the views and experience of the participants regarding the tablet treatment.

      We anticipate that 710 women will be required to take part in the study to answer this
      question with confidence. We estimate that we would be able to recruit this many women in two
      years.

      Aim: To investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MifeMiso combination (mifepristone
      and misoprostol) versus misoprostol alone in the management of missed miscarriage.

      Primary clinical objective: To test the hypothesis that treatment with mifepristone plus
      misoprostol is superior to misoprostol alone for the resolution of miscarriage within 7 days
      in women diagnosed with missed miscarriage by pelvic ultrasound scan in the first 13+6 weeks
      of pregnancy.

      Principal secondary objectives: To test the hypothesis that MifeMiso combination, compared
      with misoprostol alone improves secondary outcomes including: that the addition of
      mifepristone reduces the need for further doses of misoprostol; that the addition of
      mifepristone reduces the need for surgical intervention to resolve the miscarriage; that the
      addition of mifepristone improves patient satisfaction.

      Economic objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the combination of mifepristone and
      misoprostol in the medical management of missed miscarriage based on an outcome of additional
      cost per additional successfully managed miscarriage and additional cost per additional
      quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Using a model-based economic evaluation we will further
      explore the cost-effectiveness of the medical management of missed miscarriage, as explored
      in the proposed trial, with alternative management strategies, such as surgical and
      expectant, based on available secondary sources.

      Mixed-method evaluation objectives: To explore the satisfaction of patients who complete the
      trial protocol. The results of the satisfaction survey (CSQ-8) will act as a sampling frame
      to conduct semi-structured interviews to further investigate patient experiences and
      satisfaction with medical management of missed miscarriage.
