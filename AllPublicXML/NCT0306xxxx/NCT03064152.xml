  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a rotational thromboelastometry
      (ROTEM®)-based transfusion protocol during postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) after vaginal or
      cesarean delivery. Maternal transfusion requirement, quantitative blood loss (QBL), need for
      intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospital stay will be evaluated. The
      utilization of ROTEM® for transfusion management will identify patients who develop early
      coagulation changes such as hypofibrinogenemia or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Our
      hypothesis is that earlier identification and directed therapy of such coagulation changes
      will lower overall transfusion requirement (packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma,
      fibrinogen concentrate, cryoprecipitate, or other product), reduce the need for ICU
      admission, and shorten length of hospital stay. A cost analysis will be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage is increasing in incidence in the United States, renewing interest in
      targeted approaches to transfusion during cesarean delivery. ROTEM-based transfusion for PPH
      has been advocated as a mechanism to lower overall requirement of blood components transfused
      and lower the incidence of transfusion-associated pulmonary morbidity in a small study of
      women undergoing cesarean delivery. However, larger-scale randomized evaluation of this
      transfusion approach is warranted for women who experience hemorrhage after vaginal or
      cesarean delivery. A lower serum fibrinogen level (&lt; 200 mg/dL) at the onset of PPH has a
      positive predictive value of 100% for progression to severe PPH. However, serum fibrinogen
      testing has a turnaround time of one hour and is therefore not useful for acute management of
      PPH. ROTEM provides point-of-care results that have been validated as surrogate markers for
      serum fibrinogen, within 10 minutes. However, whether ROTEM data alters empiric management of
      acute PPH is unknown. A comparison of transfusion management decisions and costs incurred for
      transfused products and transfusion-related morbidity (duration of hospitalization, intensive
      care unit, respiratory complications) will be performed.

    <description>Patients who experience postpartum hemorrhage will receive standard of care for labor and delivery, cesarean delivery, and postpartum care. Transfusion will be based on standard of care utilizing clinical criteria of hemodynamics (noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, arterial line if deemed clinically useful) and coagulation labs (PT, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, complete blood count). In addition to standard of care, additional ROTEM blood assays will be performed at any time routine coagulation labs are sent. Providers in the control group will be blinded to ROTEM results.</description>
