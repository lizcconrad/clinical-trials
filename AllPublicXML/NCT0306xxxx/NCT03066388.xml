  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been well established that only 40 to 60% of the patients hospitalized for
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) positively respond to volume expansion (VE). The fluid
      responsiveness is usually estimated by assessing VE-induced change in stroke volume (SV). To
      guide prescriptions and possibly avoid deleterious effects of inappropriate VE, several
      clinical studies demonstrated that invasive dynamic indices based on heart-lung interactions
      permit an accurate prediction of the hemodynamic effects induced by VE.

      Mechanical ventilation induces cyclic changes in intrathoracic and transpulmonary pressures
      that transiently affect venous return, right and left ventricular preload, resulting in
      pronounced cyclic changes in SV in preload-dependent, but not in preload-independent
      patients. These cyclic changes in SV can be evaluated by the cyclic changes in arterial pulse
      pressure. Several studies have shown that pulse pressure variation is able to predict fluid
      responsiveness in patients in the operating room and intensive care unit (ICU).

      However, this technique requires percutaneous arterial catheterization, which is associated
      with several rare but serious complications (thrombosis, infections, pseudoaneurysm,hematoma,
      and bleeding).

      A method for assessing noninvasive arterial blood pressure using an electropneumatic control
      loop was introduced by Penaz in 1973. Briefly, the blood volume in a finger is measured and
      kept constant by applying corresponding external pressure. The continuously changing external
      pressure needed to keep the volume constant directly corresponds to the arterial pressure
      and, therefore can be used as continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure. Numerous
      studies evaluating the accuracy of this technology, e.g., Finapres™ (Ohmeda Monitoring
      Systems, Englewood, CO), and more recently of the Infinity CNAP™ SmartPod (Dräger Medical AG
      &amp; Co.KG, Lübeck, Germany).

      The basic operating principle of the CNAP™ is similar to the Finapres™, but CNAP™ uses
      multiple control loops. It has recently been shown that CNAP provides real-time estimates of
      mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) comparable with those measured by an invasive
      intraarterial catheter system during general anaesthesia.

      The accuracy of the measures and the respiratory variations in pulse pressure obtained with
      the CNAP system have not yet been studied in ICU.
