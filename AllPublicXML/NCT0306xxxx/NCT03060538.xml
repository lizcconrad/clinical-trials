  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending−dose study of
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of BFKB8488A
      in participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. A maximum of approximately 140 participants
      will be enrolled across multiple sites in the United States. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive study drug (active BFKB8488A or placebo). The study will consist of a
      screening period (up to 8 weeks), a 12-week treatment period, and a 6-week follow-up period.
      Participants may come to clinic for an optional pre-screening visit.
