    <textblock>
      To characterize the safety and tolerability of PDR001 and/or MBG453 in combination with
      decitabine in relapsed/refractory AML patients, de novo AML patients who are not candidates
      for standard induction therapy, or high risk MDS patients, and to identify recommended doses
      for future studies.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is comprised of three combination arms:
Evaluation of a fixed dose of the standard of care agent decitabine, in combination with fixed dose PDR001 (Arm 1)
Evaluation of a fixed dose of the standard of care agent decitabine in combination with escalating dose MBG453 (Arm 2)
Evaluation of a fixed dose of the standard of care agent decitabine in combination with fixed dose of PDR001 and escalating dose of MBG453 (Arm 3) The evaluation of decitabine with the combination of PDR001 and MBG453 (Arm 3) will start after Novartis and Investigator's review of the available safety and tolerability data from each of the first two cohorts in Arm 1 and Arm 2.</intervention_model_description>

          3. History of, or current drug-induced interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis grade ≥
             2.

          4. Patients who discontinued prior PD-1 or PD-L1 directed therapy due to a treatment
             related toxicity should not be included in the PDR001 containing arms of the study.

             for skin rash or with replacement therapy for endocrinopathies should not be excluded.

          5. Treatment with cytotoxic or targeted antineoplastics within 3 weeks of initiation of
             study treatment. For patients that received antibodies or immunotherapies, 4 weeks is
             indicated as the washout period. Systemic antineoplastic therapy (including cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, alphainterferon, kinase inhibitors or other targeted small molecules,
             and toxin-immunoconjugates) or any experimental therapy within 14 days or 5
             half-lives, whichever is shorter, before the first dose of study treatment.

          6. Systemic chronic corticosteroid therapy (≥ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or any
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days of first dose of study treatment. Topical,
