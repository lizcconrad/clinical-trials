      With rapid advances in research, clinicians are challenged to remain current on evolving
      treatment and supportive care guidelines for the management of Multiple Myeloma, particularly
      in older adults who present with various degrees of vulnerability to treatment complications.
      The global population is rapidly growing, and the number of people &gt;80 years is expected to
      quadruple between 2000 and 2050. According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG),
      more than 60% of multiple myeloma (MM) diagnoses and nearly 75% of deaths occur in patients
      over 65 years of age.1 Older patients experience more toxicity, especially with multidrug
      combinations, and historical treatment approaches for older adults with MM have included dose
      reductions or avoidance of treatment based on age and performance status alone, despite the
      poor predictive value of these variables for patient outcomes. Recent studies conclude that
      while chronological age is an important consideration when making treatment decisions for
      hematologic malignancies, functional status is more predictive of treatment outcomes. Thus it
      is important to factor variables beyond age into treatment for the older adult MM patient
      population, including functional and physical performance and comorbidity.

      The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a global health evaluation of older adults
      that extends beyond a disease-focused evaluation in order to identify unrecognized issues
      amendable to interventions that may prevent future problems.4 The CGA has been used to
      predict toxicity and survival in patients using the domains of comorbidities, function,
      cognition, polypharmacy, social support, and depression and/or psychological distress. Most
      of the studies are in patients with solid tumors and not those with hematologic malignancies.
      However, there is evidence to support the use of the CGA to predict risk for adverse events
      and prognosis.

      A modified Geriatric Assessment (mGA) tool that utilized age, functional status as determined
      by assessment of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily
      living (IADLs), plus comorbidity status was used to develop the Palumbo Frailty Index (FI).
      Frailty is a state of cumulative decline in many physiological systems that results in the
      diminished resistance to stressors. The FI categorizes patients into groups of fit,
      intermediate fit, and frail. In a retrospective analysis of data in 867 older adults with MM,
      toxicity, treatment discontinuation, and survival rates were correlated with the FI. To date,
      no studies have investigated the prospective ability of the Palumbo frailty index to predict
      toxicity and treatment outcomes in older adults with MM.

      As a result of this retrospective validation work, fit/frailty status can be evaluated for
      usefulness in the clinical setting by gathering information from a mGA and providing the data
      to the care provider to guide treatment decisions. The use of decision aids for care and
      treatment decisions is rapidly growing, given that such aids have been shown to reduce
      decisional conflict, improve patient-clinician communication, improve the alignment of values
      and choice, and reduce the use of low value interventions. Use of decision aids is of growing
      interest as we shift to value-based cancer care models. Value-based cancer care models
      require the engagement of patients to better understand patient goals and ensure patients are
      counseled on the risks and benefits of various treatment options.

      For older patients, GAs are not routinely performed because they are complex and
      time-consuming, the optimal tools for administering the GA accurately and efficiently have
      not been established, many clinicians lack knowledge about how to incorporate GA into
      decision-making and care of older adults, and integration of a GA into a Health Information
      System platform has not been adequately studied for feasibility and usage. Hurria and
      colleagues developed the Cancer Specific Geriatric Assessment (CSGA), a shorter assessment
      that specifically captures data from seven domains (functional status, comorbid medical
      conditions, psychological state, cognition, nutritional status, social support, and
      medications). This CSGA assessment took an average time of 27 minutes to complete.

      Two recent small studies evaluated feasibility of touchscreen computer based GA, with the
      majority of older adults in both studies able to complete the assessment. However, the
      assessment still took an average of 20-27 minutes to complete, which may not be feasible to
      incorporate into a typical clinical workflow. In one study, although the majority of
      assessment domains were patient reported, more than half of patients required assistance to
      complete the touchscreen questionnaires.12 A modified Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment
      (mCGA) was developed for use in this study to further improve upon feasibility of GA within
      typical clinical workflow. mCGA domains were chosen by a panel of gero-oncology expert
      consultants (Drs. Palumbo, Mohile, and Wildes) based on their predictive ability, their
      length, and the ability to be assessed via patient self-report. The Palumbo frailty index was
      chosen as the core of the mCGA tool to be used in this study given its development
      specifically in older adults with multiple myeloma. In addition to the 4 mGA measures
      comprising the Palumbo FI (age, comorbidity, ADL, and IADL), other GA variables were also
      added to the mCGA to be used in this study, chosen based on their strong predictive ability
      in determining toxicity and survival in cancer patients, as well as feasibility of collection
      in routine clinical practice. In particular, variables needed to complete the Cancer and
      Aging Research Group's (CARG) &quot;Chemotherapy Toxicity Calculator&quot;
      (http://www.mycarg.org/SelectQuestionnaire) will be collected in this study, given their
      strong predictive ability in older adults with solid tumors.

      Despite the suggestions that GA/frailty indices could be used to guide therapy selection, the
      ability to effectively incorporate the use of GA's in to a real-world clinic environment has
      not yet been established. Thus, in this study, we seek to describe the feasibility of using
      this shorter mCGA tool, administered via patient self-report on a touchscreen computer, as
      well as the real-time use and utility by clinicians and the impact of mCGA results on
      treatment decision-making. These data will be quantitatively assessed through review of
      patient records, Carevive platform extracts of treatment data, as well as a uniquely designed
      questionnaire to evaluate physician use and perceived utility of the GA as a part of the
      treatment decision-making process, and to gain insight on improving the utility and
      application of the GA in clinical practices.

      By streamlining a validated GA tool into the mCGA, including only those domains that have
      shown to be most predictive of outcomes (survival and toxicity), and incorporating its use at
      the point of care, the Carevive ePRO provides an opportunity to both gather richly
      contextualized data on patient experiences as well as address this gap in quality cancer
      care.

      This is a prospective single arm pilot intervention study, using a post-test only
      quasi-experimental study design. Patients and their providers will participate in the study
      intervention and then complete post-intervention questionnaires designed to evaluate the
      feasibility, usability/acceptability, and physician use and utility of the results of a
      modified Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (mCGA), administered via electronic tablet to
      older adults with multiple myeloma (MM) at a treatment decision-making time point, and
      displayed back to the clinician at a clinic visit where a treatment decision is being
      discussed. A combination of provider report and retrospective chart review will be used to
      assess actual treatment decisions made at time of intervention visit. Patient completion and
      then summary display of the mCGA to physicians is the main study intervention. To promote
      informed utilization of the mCGA results, clinicians will also participate in continuing
      education on the topics of a) treatment of MM in older adults, as well as b) use of mCGA to
      guide treatment decision-making and supportive care in older adults with cancer.

      The tool used for collection of patient-reported and clinical variables comprising the mCGA
      will be the Carevive electronic patient reported outcomes (Carevive ePRO) platform. This ePRO
      platform collects both ePRO and clinical data, which are processed by a rules engine that
      enables display of results back to clinicians in a dynamic summary. The mCGA will be used as
      both a method of determining frailty status of patients as well as to give a more global
      picture of the patients' functional and medical status, consistent with goals of geriatric
      assessment.

      Providers will complete post-test measures to evaluate feasibility of the intervention as
      well as, a) provider report of treatment recommendation made for each patient (rolling basis
      at each intervention visit directly on the Carevive Dashboard), b) the ways the mCGA results
      influenced treatment decisions for each patient (treatment decision making questionnaire,
      rolling basis following each intervention visit), and c) usability/acceptability
      (comprehensive post-test questionnaire, one-time following completion of patient enrollment)
      and use/utility (treatment decision making questionnaire, rolling basis following each
      intervention visit) of the mCGA-based intervention, using questions adapted from Cox and
      colleagues, Berry and colleagues, Mullen and colleagues and expanded with investigator
      developed questions. Provider questionnaires will be administered via surveymonkey.com, a
      survey hosting website, or paper.
