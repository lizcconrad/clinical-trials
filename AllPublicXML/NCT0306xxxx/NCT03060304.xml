  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryopreservation of embryos created during fresh IVF cycles provides a less expensive and
      time-intensive opportunity for pregnancy. Ideal endometrium thickness is the key point to
      optimization FET cycle. Researches show that when endometrial thickness is less than 7mm,
      pregnancy rate dropped significantly. Tamoxifen has been reported to be oestrogenic on the
      lower genital tract. Several study on intrauterine insemination or ovulation induction
      suggest that tamoxifen may be a promising alternative for patients with thin endometrium.
      Based on this ,we want to evaluate the effects of tamoxifen on endometrial thickness and
      pregnancy outcome in women who failed to develop an adequate endometrial thickness in
      previous frozen embryo transfer cycle twice or even more times and willing to have another
      attempt.

      Objective: To investigate the effects of tamoxifen on endometrial thickness and pregnancy
      outcome in women with thin endometrium undergoing frozen thawed cycle.

      Study design: This is a single center, randomize control clinical trial. We plan to recruit
      100 patients from Mar 2017 to Dec 2019, who failed to develop an adequate endometrial
      thickness in previous frozen embryo transfer cycle twice or even more times and willing to
      have another attempt, dividing into two group, one prepare the endometrium through ovulation
      induction with tamoxifen and progesterone(Study Group), the other is hormone replacement
      cycle (control group).

      Intervention: Study Group will give endometrial preparation with tamoxifen and progesterone,
      control group will prepared with estrogen and progesterone supplementation.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of the study was endometrium thickness and
      clinical pregnancy rate, the secondary outcomes are cycle duration, cycle cancellation rate,
      implantation rate, miscarriage rate, live birth rate.

    <description>Patients in study group will receive tamoxifen at a daily dose of 40 mg from day 3 to day 8. Follicle diameters are monitored by transvaginal ultrasound and serum levels of E2, P are tested on day 9. If there is a dominant follicle (almost 12 × 12 mm in diameter), endometrial thickness and endometrial pattern, as well as follicular diameters, were monitored daily or every other day till embryo transfer. Serum levels of E2, P are tested on the day before ovulation. If there isn't dominant follicle and intramuscular human menopausal gonadotropin at a dose of 75-150 IU was administered each day after day 12 if there follicle development was poor. The embryo transfer day is decided according embryo development.</description>

    <description>Patients in control group will receive estradiol valerate at a dose of 3 mg twice per day from day 3. Follicle diameters are monitored by transvaginal ultrasound and serum levels of E2, P are tested on day 9. If endometrial thickness &lt;7mm and E2＜100pg/ml, the dose of estradiol valerate can increase or combine other estradiol. Endometrial thickness and endometrial pattern, as well as follicular diameters, were monitored daily or every other day till embryo transfer. Serum levels of E2, P are tested on the day before endometrium transformation. The embryo transfer day is decided according embryo development. Serum levels of E2, P are tested on the day before embryo transfer.</description>
