  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is great variability in susceptibility from one person to another, and less than one in
      a hundred sexual exposures to HIV results in infection. In addition, some recent trial of
      methods to prevent HIV - including vaccines and microbicides - have actually increased HIV
      acquisition among trial participants for reasons that we do not fully understand. While we
      know that immune differences in the genital lining are an important determinant of whether a
      person is infected after a sexual HIV exposure, we don't know enough about these differences
      to be able to accurately assess a person's individual HIV risk. Therefore, the development of
      safe and non-invasive laboratory tests to estimate a person's susceptibility in the genital
      tract would be useful in clinical studies of new HIV prevention tools.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heterosexual intercourse is the most common mode of transmission of HIV, but the risk of HIV
      acquisition after exposure is so low that studies to assess HIV risk must have a huge sample
      size. The goal of this study is to assess the suitability of a prototype pseudovirus assay to
      identify early HIV target cells in the female genital tract, using cervical cytobrush samples
      collected from healthy women, and to optimize assay sensitivity.

      This novel HIV entry assay may overcome the need for a large sample size by directly
      measuring how susceptible a person is by using a sample similar to a PAP test. The assay is
      performed on immune cells obtained from a cervical cytobrush and enables assessment of HIV
      cell entry within 24 hours. If the assay works, this technique may have the potential to
      assess the impact of clinical parameters such as stage of menstrual cycle, or sexually
      transmitted infections and their treatment on HIV susceptibility in the female genital tract.
      Therefore, the assay may serve as an important monitoring tool in clinical trials of HIV
      prevention, serving as an invaluable intermediate endpoint to assess HIV acquisition risk,
      rather than relying on actual participant HIV seroconversion/infection.
