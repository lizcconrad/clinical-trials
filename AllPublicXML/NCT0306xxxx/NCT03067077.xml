  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo SMILE surgery in one eye and LASIK surgery in their other eye to
      correct myopia.

      Subjects will have a comprehensive eye examination once they express an interest in the
      study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated
      fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would
      exclude the subject from the study, then we will inform the patient and make an appropriate
      referral. if the subject is deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive
      examination included computerized videokeratography, then they can be enrolled. Subjects will
      undergo bilateral simultaneous eye surgery. Which eye is treated with the WFG-LASIK and which
      eye is treated with SMILE will be randomized so there is a 50% chance for either eye to
      receive one treatment. Subjects will be seen on the day of surgery, post op day one, one
      week, one month, three months, six months and one year. Subjects will receive topical
      antibiotics in each eye for one week following the procedure. Subjects will receive topical
      steroid ophthalmic drops for one week after treatment. Subjects will also receive topical
      antibiotic ophthalmic drops for four days after treatment. All of this is within the usual
      and customary standard of care for the treatment of subjects undergoing LASIK and SMILE
      surgery.
