  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the use of Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) for cardiac surgery there is an instant
      mixture of the patient's blood and the fluid needed to fill the extracorporeal circuit before
      use. This will change the composition of the body fluids. This study aims to plot these
      changes in regard to particle concentration (osmolality).

    <textblock>
      During the use of CPB for cardiac surgery there is an instant mixture of the patient's blood
      and the fluid needed to prime the extracorporeal circuit. Many studies have pointed to the
      benefits of using a hyperosmolar prime to counteract formation of tissue oedema. Rapid
      changes in osmolality may as a serious consequence lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome. At
      the Heart Centre of Umeå University Hospital, Sweden, there is a tradition of using a
      hyperosmolar prime. This study aims to explore changes in osmolality during coronary artery
      bypass grafting surgery by repeated measurements of osmolality and concentration shifts of
      sodium, glucose and urea in plasma.
