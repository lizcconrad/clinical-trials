    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test a newly developed app, firmly grounded in Cognitive
      Behavioural Therapy (CBT) theory of depression, to determine primarily if this app is
      clinically useful in decreasing moderate depressive symptoms when compared with an active
      placebo. Additionally, we are interested in the app's potential to contribute to the
      reduction of general negative affect, increasing positive affect, and boosting satisfaction
      with life. Last, but not least, we aim to verify if the usage of the tested app can modify
      depressogenic cognitions.

      Trial design This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, examining the effects of a
      CBT intervention in reducing depressive symptomatology for people with moderate symptoms.
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of the 3 arms of the trial: (1) CBT intervention;
      (2) placebo intervention (PI); and (3) delayed intervention (wait-list; WL). Major
      assessments are at baseline, post-treatment, and follow-up 12 weeks later. Participants
      randomized to the PI and WL trial arms are offered access to the online app upon completion
      of the study. Participants are blinded to hypotheses and the nature of the placebo
      intervention, but they are informed they have a 1 in 3 chance of being assigned to the
      placebo intervention.

      Participant timeline Potential participants will be assessed for eligibility through an
      initial assessment of depressive symptoms. The initial assessment phase consists of
      administration of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and a short screening telephone
      interview. Applicants who do not meet the inclusion criteria are informed via e-mail. They
      are given a summary score and interpretation for their PHQ-9 score and they are encouraged to
      discuss their problems with a professional, if necessary. Information on how to reach one - a
      clinical psychologist or psychotherapist - is also provided. Subsequent assessments consist
      of all the instruments presented in the Outcome measures section. After the initial
      assessment, the participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of
      the three conditions: active intervention condition (Group 1), the placebo intervention
      (Group 2), and the delayed-intervention condition (wait-list) (Group 3).

      The participants in the active intervention and active placebo conditions are assessed at
      pre-intervention (Time 1 - baseline), at mid-intervention (Time 2 - 3 weeks after baseline),
      at post-intervention (Time 3 - 6 weeks after baseline), and at 3-months post-intervention
      (Time 4). The participants in the delayed-intervention condition are assessed before the
      waiting period (Time 1 - baseline), at mid-waiting period (Time 2 - 3 weeks after baseline),
      and at post-waiting period (Time 3 - 6 weeks after baseline).

      Participants assigned to the active intervention condition will be given access to the online
      application along with explicit instructions regarding the use of all of its sections.
      Participants will be given 6 weeks to complete the intervention, during which time weekly
      messages will be sent out to them. Messages include regular assignments designed for a
      complete and thorough use of the application's courses and exercises, and encourage the
      review of materials whenever possible. However, participants are free to use the application
      at their own pace.

      Similarly, the participants in the active placebo condition will be given given access to a
      sham version of the app. During the 6-week intervention period they will be exposed to the
      same amount of online (i.e., in app messages) and therapist communication as the active
      intervention participants.

      After each week, participants' application use is evaluated (see the Application Use Scale
      described above). Similarly, after each week of using the application, the participants are
      required to complete the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R),
      for close monitoring of their depressive symptomatology and individualized feedback on their
      emotional state.

      Participants in the delayed intervention condition are placed on a wait-list for 6 weeks,
      after which they are given access to the app.

      Sample size A total number of 165 participants with moderate depressive symptomatology was
      estimated based on previous studies on the efficacy of mobile phone applications for
      depression that reported small to moderate between group effect sizes. An a priori sample
      size calculation was conducted with G*Power 3.1.9.2 for ANOVA (Repeated measures, between
      factors), assuming an alpha level of 0.05, a statistical power of 0.80, and a small to medium
      effect size (f = 0.2). Based on the fact that the current protocol has a therapist check-in
      component, a sample size recruitment target of n = 220 was set to allow for sample attrition,
      thus estimating a drop-out rate of approximately 30%.

      Recruitment Possible participants are approached through ads on a social network. Those
      interested in using the application are asked to access the study's website and follow the
      standard recruitment procedure. They are subsequently contacted via a telephone call, at
      which point the enrollment procedure is described.

      Assignment to study group The participants are randomly assigned to one of the three trial
      arms, using the software Randomizer.org. Randomization is performed by a research assistant
      using a simple (unrestricted) randomization sequence that assigns three unique numbers per
      participant; the number assigned is either 1, 2, or 3 according to the number of the
      experimental conditions. To conceal the allocation mechanism, the same research assistant
      will monitor the assessments and allow access to the application for the participants in the
      waitlist control group, after 6 weeks. The principal investigator and the statisticians
      running the data analysis will remain blinded to the study condition until the completion of
      the study.

      Monitoring study implementation. Three clinical psychologists, members of the study team,
      screen for the risk of unintended effects or harm to the participants (i.e., clinically
      significant increase in depressive symptomatology, as measured by the CESD-R). The
      psychologists also monitor the weekly online evaluations and clinically interpret the CESD-R
      score of every participant. If the participant does not complete the CESD-R evaluation, a
      telephonic contact follows. If necessary, the supervisor can decide to interrupt the
      participant's access to the application and make a further referral.

    <description>The CESD-R is a 20-item self-report instrument, which measures symptoms of depression in nine different groups: sadness (dysphoria), loss of interest (anhedonia), appetite, sleep, thinking/concentration, guilt (worthlessness), tired (fatigue), movement (agitation), and suicidal ideation. Participants rate each item on a five-point Likert scale, from 0 (not at all or less than one day) to 4 (nearly every day for 2 weeks) and refer to a time frame of a week or so. The Total CESD-R Score is calculated as a sum of responses to all 20 questions. The CESD-R exhibited good psychometric properties, including high internal consistency, strong factor loadings, and theoretically consistent convergent and divergent validity with anxiety, schizotypy, and positive and negative affect. CESD-R has been used previously on the Romanian population and was found to have adequate psychometric properties.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-intervention (3 weeks after baseline), post-intervention (6 weeks after baseline), Follow-up (3 months after post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) is a 20-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess mood. It consists of 10 items that address positive affect (PA) and 10 items that address negative affect (NA). Participants rate each item on a five-point Likert scale, from 1 (very slightly/not at all) to 5 (extremely). The PANAS can be used to assess mood on various time scales by altering the instructions. For the purposes of this study a two-week timeframe has been used. The validity and internal consistency of the PANAS are good, with test-retest reliability being the highest for the &quot;general&quot; temporal instruction. The PANAS has been used previously on the Romanian population and was found to have adequate psychometric properties.</description>

    <description>The Behavioural Activation for Depression Scale - Short Form (BADS-SF) is an instrument designed to be administered weekly to measure changes in avoidance and activation over the course of the Behavioral Activation (BA) treatment for depression. The BADS consists of 9 items grouped into two subscales (Activation and Avoidance/Rumination). Respondents rate each item on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (completely). The scale enjoys good psychometric properties. BADS-SF has been used previously on the Romanian population and was found to have adequate psychometric properties.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-intervention (3 weeks after baseline), post-intervention (6 weeks after baseline), Follow-up (3 months after post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with Life (SWL) is a five-item scale designed to measure global cognitive judgments of one's life satisfaction. Participants rate each of the 5 items using a seven-point scale that ranges from 7 (strongly agree) to 1 (strongly disagree). The SWL has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of life satisfaction, which can be used with a wide range of age groups. SWL has been used previously on the Romanian population and was found to have adequate psychometric properties.</description>

    <measure>The Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale Short Form (DAS-SF) (change from baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-intervention (3 weeks after baseline), post-intervention (6 weeks after baseline), Follow-up (3 months after post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>DAS was designed to measure the intensity of dysfunctional attitudes that, according to the cognitive theory of depression, contribute to vulnerability for depression. For the purpose of this study, the short form of this scale was used. The Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale-Short Form (DAS-SF) consists of two subscales: &quot;dependency&quot; (6 items) and &quot;perfectionism/performance evaluation&quot; (11 items). The 17 items are rated on a seven-point Likert scale, from 1 (total disagreement) to 7 (total agreement). DAS-SF possesses good psychometric properties in terms of model fit, reliability and convergent construct validity. DAS-SF has been used previously on the Romanian population and was found to have adequate psychometric properties.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-intervention (3 weeks after baseline), post-intervention (6 weeks after baseline), Follow-up (3 months after post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beliefs Scale (BS) measures irrational beliefs. It consists of 20 items and responders indicate the level of agreement/disagreement with each item using a five-point Likert scale that ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The BS shows good psychometric properties regarding construct and discriminant validity. This scale has been used previously on the Romanian population and was found to have adequate psychometric properties.</description>

    <measure>The Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ) (change from baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-intervention (3 weeks after baseline), post-intervention (6 weeks after baseline), Follow-up (3 months after post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>he Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ) is a 15-item self-report measure used to assess depression-related cognitions. Participants rate, on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 5 (almost all the time), the frequency of a given thought over the past week. A higher score shows a higher frequency of automatic thoughts. The psychometric properties of the ATQ have been adequately demonstrated in previous studies. The ATQ has been successfully used on the Romanian population before.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with the Application Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Mid-intervention (3 weeks after baseline), post-intervention (6 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with the Application Scale consists of 10 items that assess users' satisfaction with the application, its difficulty level, attractiveness, and subjective utility. The first 8 items are rated on a three-point scale, ranging from 0 to 2. Each response scale is personalized to the content of the item (e.g., How attractive did you find the exercises included in the application? - 0 = rather unattractive, 1 = attractive enough; 2 = very attractive). Item 9 assesses the application globally, with the participant being asked to give an overall grade between 1 (minimum) and 10 (maximum). Item 10 asks the participants if they would recommend the application to a friend (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer). This scale has been used previously by the same research team, in a study investigating the same mobile phone app.</description>
