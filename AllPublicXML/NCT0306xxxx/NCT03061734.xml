  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof -of-concept study compares ALLOD-2 to its individual components and to placebo.

      The investigational product (ALLOD-2), is a combination of two marketed drugs. Both drugs are
      used at a much lower doses than the doses used for the approved indications.

      The combination is a First-in-Class drug due to its new and unique mechanism of action.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening visit, at home treatment of a migraine attack with a single
      dose of the study drug within 8 weeks, and End-of-Study Visit 2-7 days after treatment of a
      moderate or severe migraine attack.
