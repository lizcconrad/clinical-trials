  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to pilot cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-RD) for 10
      individuals ages 10 and older who have rumination disorder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rumination disorder (RD; also known as &quot;rumination syndrome&quot;) is characterized by the
      repeated regurgitation of food during or soon after eating, which typically occurs at least a
      few times per week, frequently daily, with subsequent re-chewing, re-swallowing, or spitting
      out of the regurgitated material. Diaphragmatic breathing is a widely used technique for
      rumination as a competing response to the abdominal wall contraction hypothesized to trigger
      regurgitation. However, the efficacy of diaphragmatic breathing remains unknown and has
      mainly been delivered simply through a one-session instruction with an occasional follow-up.

      In the absence of evidence-based treatments for RD, Dr. Jennifer Thomas has contributed to
      the creation of a manualized treatment, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Rumination Disorder
      (CBT-RD) informed by published case reports and currently in use at the Eating Disorders
      Clinical and Research Program (EDCRP) at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Psychological
      Services Center at Drexel University. CBT-RD targets the habitual contraction of the
      abdominal wall and preceding events through the use of habit reversal, using primarily
      diaphragmatic breathing as a competing response.

      This study involves a phone screen to determine eligibility, followed by 5-8 sessions of
      CBT-RD (approximately 50 minutes each). A battery of questionnaires will be administered at
      pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up intervals.
