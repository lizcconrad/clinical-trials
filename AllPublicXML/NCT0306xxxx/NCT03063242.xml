  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine whether administration of sargramostim will improve myeloid
      dendritic cell deficiency in various study groups, including healthy subjects and patients
      with chronic kidney disease, including those with kidney transplants.

      The overall objective of this project is to study the ability of sargramostim to enhance mDC
      level and function, including subsequent stimulation of T cell responses, in various human
      subjects with demonstrated myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) and T cell deficiency.

      Single center nonrandomized trial with an interrupted time series design involving measures
      on blood samples from three separate populations before and after administration of
      sargramostim.

      The objective is to determine the safety and dose response of sargramostim administration in
      healthy participants and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney
      transplants.

      Additionally to determine whether reversal of mDC/T cell deficiency by sargramostim results
      in augmented T cell responses in these three groups.
