    <textblock>
      Pregnant women who are at risk of delivering their infants in the periviable period can
      suffer a large amount of stress and anxiety. Moreover, many women feel a loss of control over
      their own pregnancy. There is some evidence that more counseling and planning can help reduce
      maternal stress and anxiety. Patients at risk of delivering in the periviable period will be
      randomized to either receive standard counselling or to complete the periviable birth plan.
