      This study is single arm, single center trial to study the safety and efficacy of bone
      marrow-derived autologous specific populations of stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells for
      the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetically determined X-linked disease. The
      manifestation of muscle weakness typically starts around the age of 4-5 in males and
      deteriorates fast. Typically muscle loss occurs first in the upper legs and pelvis followed
      by muscles of the upper arms. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein
      dystrophin. Dystrophin is crucial to maintain the muscle fiber cell membrane.

      Currently, there is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Corrective surgery, braces, and physical
      therapy may help with some of the symptoms. Assisted ventilation might be required in
      patients with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications prescribed include steroids to slow
      muscle degeneration, anti-convulsants to control seizures and muscle activity, and
      immunosuppressants to delay damage to muscle cells.

      For decades, research has been conducted to find an effective therapy for Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy (DMD). Stem cell based therapy is considered to be one of the most promising
      methods for treating muscular dystrophies.

      Stem cell based therapies for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can proceed
      via two strategies. The first is autologous stem cell transfer involving cells from a patient
      with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) that are genetically altered in vitro to restore
      dystrophin expression and are subsequently re-implanted. The second is allogenic stem cell
      transfer, containing cells from an individual with functional dystrophin, which are
      transplanted into a dystrophic patient.

      Herein, the investigators describe a method for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy
      (DMD) using autologous bone marrow derived specific populations of stem cells and mesenchymal
      stem cells transplanted in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
