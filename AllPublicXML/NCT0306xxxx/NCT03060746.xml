  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to obtain stool samples from pre-therapy subjects already undergoing
      evaluation for an H. pylori infection by upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and gastric
      biopsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stools will be collected and tested, at a later date, in a clinical performance study with an
      investigational H. pylori antigen assay. This study will be coordinated by the Sponsor.
