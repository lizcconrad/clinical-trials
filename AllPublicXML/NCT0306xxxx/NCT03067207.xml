  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to compare the effect of a mindfulness meditation program for
      adolescents with chronic illness delivered either in person or via an online platform. The
      8-week program will combine meditation practices, breathing exercises and group discussions.
      Participants will be recruited from different general and specialized clinics at the Hospital
      for Sick Children and will be allocated to either an in-person or the online group through a
      random process (like tossing a coin). The study will aim to recruit 60 participants ages
      13-18. Each participant will provide data through research questionnaires, recorded
      interviews and saliva samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a longitudinal randomized controlled trial comparing in-person
      and eHealth delivery of a mindfulness meditation intervention for adolescents with chronic
      illness. There will be two arms. An experimental and a feasibility arm. In the experimental
      arm, 4 groups of 10-15 participants will be formed: two in-person groups (early and late) and
      two eHealth groups (early and late). The early groups will receive the intervention at the
      beginning of the study period and the late groups will be wait-list controlled group that
      will receive the intervention at the middle of the study period. At the end of the
      recruitment period or when the target number of participants is met (60), whichever comes
      first, all teens meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to one of the four
      randomized groups. Teens who are not meeting the final inclusion criteria (able to attend
      mindfulness sessions at Sickkids) will be offered a spot in the feasibility arm of the study
      until the maximum total number of study participants is reached (60). These participants will
      be placed in eHealth groups (either early or late) through a separate randomization process.

      Data collection will take place at baseline (during the intake meeting), immediately before
      and following the mindfulness intervention as well as at the end of the 6-month study period.
      Participants in the experimental arm will provide data through research questionnaires,
      salivary cortisol analysis as well as individual semi-structured interviews with a research
      assistant. Salivary samples will be provided from home for participants in the eHealth
      groups. Participants in the feasibility arm will only provide information through research
      questionnaires.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be conducted as a longitudinal randomized non-inferiority trial comparing two arms: an experimental arm and feasibility arm. Participants living close enough to commit to in-person sessions will be entered in the experimental arm of the study. The feasibility arm, which will only take place if the targeted number of study participants (60) is not reached for the experimental arm, will be offered to participants who are not able to commit to the in-person mode of delivery. It will consist of two groups, one early e-health group and one wait-list e-Health group. At the end of the recruitment period, once participants have been placed in the experimental and feasibility arms, two separate randomizations will take place. The first randomization (experimental arm) will serve to assign participants to one of the four experimental groups and the second randomization (feasibility arm) will assign participants to one of the two feasibility groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This study will be a single-blinded study (investigators only). Participants will be coded using Arabic numerals. A research assistant will receive all questionnaires and cortisol samples. Mindfulness facilitators will be unaware of participant identification numbers. Participants will be assigned to one of four groups (experimental arm) or to one of two groups (feasibility arm) following a computer-generated randomization list (permuted block design, using blocks of two or four). The allocation sequence will be generated by a statistician not otherwise involved in the project and passed on to a research assistant after patient identification data has been collected (ensuring that the investigators are kept blind to the allocation of each participant). Allocation sequence will be password-protected and only accessible by the statistician and research assistant.</masking_description>

    <description>The experimental arm will consist of four groups with a target of 15 participants each: one early intervention group, one wait-list in-person group, one early e-Health group and one wait-list e-health group. All participants will receive the mindfulness intervention, MARS-A, either in-person or via e-health by the end of the 6-month study period. Participants in the in-person groups will meet at in hospital at a designated teen-friendly room containing chairs and yoga mats. Participants in the e-health groups will be encouraged to find a quiet room in their home and will be required to have access to the Internet, a desktop/laptop computer equipped with a webcam or a tablet/smartphone with webcam function.</description>

    <description>The intervention will consist of the 8-week mindfulness meditation program designed for adolescents with chronic health conditions.MARS-A is based on two established mindfulness-based interventions for adults: MBSR and MBCT. The content of the program will be the same for in-person and e-health groups: all participants will receive eight 90-minute weekly evening sessions led by two trained and experienced mindfulness providers. Sessions will include short meditation practices, breathing exercises, guided discussion, mindful movements and inquiry, adapted to the context of chronic illness. Every session will start with a brief review of home practice and will close with a discussion of the home practice for the following week.</description>
