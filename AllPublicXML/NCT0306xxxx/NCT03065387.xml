  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 parts to this clinical research study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2
      (expansion).

      The goal of Part 1 of this study is to find the highest tolerable dose of neratinib in
      combination with everolimus, Ibrance (palbociclib), or trametinib that can be given to
      patients who have advanced cancer with a specific mutation (EGFR, HER2, HER3, or HER4).

      The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn if the dose of neratinib in combination with
      everolimus, Ibrance (palbociclib), or trametinib found in Part 1 can help to control advanced
      cancer in patients who have a specific mutation.

      The safety of this drug will also be studied in both parts of the study.

      This is an investigational study. Neratinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of certain early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. Everolimus is commercially
      available and FDA approved for the treatment of several disease types, including breast
      cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Palbociclib is commercially available and FDA approved for
      the treatment of ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Trametinib is commercially
      available and FDA approved for the treatment of melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.
      The use of this combination to treat advanced cancer with a specific mutation is
      investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 120 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      Depending on the type of disease and when you join the study, you will receive 1 of 3 drug
      combinations:

        -  Group A: Neratinib and Everolimus

        -  Group B: Neratinib and Palbociclib

        -  Group C: Neratinib and Trametinib

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in each study group.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned a study drug
      dose based on when you join this study. About 3-6 participants will be enrolled per study
      drug dose.

      If you are in Part 2, you will receive neratinib in combination with everolimus, palbociclib,
      or trametinib at the highest dose that was safe and tolerated in Part 1.

      A total of about 18-90 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study. About 10
      participants will be enrolled per group and up to a total of 30 participants will be enrolled
      in Part 2.

      If you are in Part 1, the dose of neratinib in combination with everolimus, palbociclib, or
      trametinib you receive will depend on when you join this study.

      The study doctor will let you know what study group and which part of the study you are
      participating in.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days. The following directions are for participants in both Part 1 and
      Part 2.

      You will take neratinib by mouth 1 time a day with food, preferably in the morning, every
      day. If you miss any dose(s) of neratinib, do not make up the missed dose(s). However, if it
      has been less than 6 hours since you were meant to take your dose, you may take your dose
      that day as soon as you remember. It is important that you take neratinib at the same time
      every day. Neratinib must be stored at room temperature and out of direct sunlight.

      There will be a 30 minute waiting period between your dose of neratinib and your other study
      drug(s) during Cycle 1. After that, there is no waiting period.

      If you are in Group A, you will take everolimus by mouth 1 time a day with neratinib every
      day. Everolimus must be stored at room temperature, kept dry and away from light.

      If you are in Group B, you will take palbociclib by mouth 1 time a day with neratinib, every
      day for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week &quot;rest period&quot; during each cycle. Palbociclib must be
      stored at room temperature.

      If you are in Group C, you will take trametinib by mouth 1 time a day with neratinib every
      day. Trametinib must be stored in a refrigerator (do not freeze), kept dry and away from
      light.

      You will also take Imodiumâ„¢ (loperamide) to lower the risk of diarrhea caused by neratinib.
      Along with your first dose of neratinib, you will take 2 tablets of loperamide by mouth 3
      times a day for the first 14 days of Cycle 1. After that, you will take 2 tablets 2 times a
      day for the rest of Cycle 1. After Cycle 1, you will take loperamide as needed. If diarrhea
      continues despite taking loperamide, call your doctor or nurse. If you are constipated, call
      your study doctor but do not discontinue Imodium use unless specifically instructed by your
      doctor.

      Your study doctor or staff will contact you on each of the first 3 days after you start
      taking neratinib to ask if you have diarrhea and to make any changes to your treatment. Your
      study doctor will give you a separate instruction sheet that will explain how to manage
      diarrhea.

      You will receive a study drug diary in which you will record the date and time of each dose
      of study drugs. Your study doctor will also tell you to record the number of stools you have
      per day and the dose of loperamide you take each day for the first cycle of therapy. You will
      need to record all doses of study drugs for the entire study. You will need to bring the
      diary to your study visits. You must also bring any unused study drug and the pill bottles
      (even if empty) to the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 (some of these tests will not be performed if you had them the last 72
      hours):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.

      On Days 2-4 of Cycle 1, the study staff will call you to ask about any symptoms you may be
      having. The call should last about 5 minutes.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers.

        -  On Day 15 only, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn before and then 5
           times over the next 5 hours after study drugs dose for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK
           testing measures the amount of study drug in the blood at different time points.

        -  If you are in Part 2, on Day 15 only, you will have a core or excisional biopsy for
           biomarker testing (including genetic biomarkers).

      On Day 16 of Cycle 1 (about 20-28 hours after your Day 15 dose of study drugs), blood (about
      1 tablespoon) will be drawn for PK testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) and urine will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, including genetic
           biomarkers.

      If you are in Group B, on Day 14 of Cycle 2, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 5, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn before the study drug
      dose for PK testing.

      Every 8 weeks, you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease. After 6
      months, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan every 12 weeks. If appropriate, tumor marker data
      from your blood/tissue samples may also be collected.

      Every 12 weeks, you will have an ECHO or MUGA scan.

      You may have eye exams (Group C only) and other routine tests performed if the study doctor
      thinks they are needed.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After your last study drug dose:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check how
           well your blood clots.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You may have an ECHO or MUGA scan. This scan will not be performed if you had them done
           in the last 12 weeks.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      If you go off study because the disease gets worse, you will be called every 3 months for 1
      year. You will be asked about how you are doing and if you have received any new treatment
      for cancer. The calls should last about 15 minutes.

      Follow-up Visits:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, blood (about 4-5 teaspoons) and urine will
      be collected for routine tests.
