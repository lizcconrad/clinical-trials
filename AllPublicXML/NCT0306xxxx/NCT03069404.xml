      The investigation is a multi-year observational study following the completion of the
      open-label, single dose Phase I/II study involving transplantation of allogeneic HuCNS-SC
      cells into 12 subjects with thoracic spinal cord injury.

      Subjects will be monitored at routine intervals for safety and preliminary efficacy for 5
      years post-transplantation of the Phase I/II investigation CL-N02-SC.
