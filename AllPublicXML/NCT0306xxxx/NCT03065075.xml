      To determine if phenazopyridine reduces the rate of postoperative urinary retention after

      Several tools can be used to evaluate for ureteral patency during urogynecologic procedures.
      Typically, surgeons use urine dyes such as methylene blue, indigotindisulfonate sodium, or
      phenazopyridine, with the latter being restricted to oral administration. However in June
      2014, the two U.S. manufacturers of indigotindisulfonate sodium stopped producing the
      medication and there is no prospect that it will be returning soon. Phenazopyridine is an
      over-the-counter medication (Azo-Gesic, Baridium, Urinary Pain Relief) that has been used
      safely for decades as a bladder analgesic and taints the urine orange.

      Over the past few months, increasing evidence suggests that phenazopyridine may reduce
      transient postoperative urinary retention. Transient urinary retention is common after
      urogynecologic surgery and is assessed postoperatively by performing a void trial (VT) prior
      to discharge. In a study designed to determine the time from administration of oral
      phenazopyridine to visualize dye from the ureters, Propst et al incidentally found that 38%
      of patients (19 of 49) failed postoperative VTs without phenazopyridine, but only 19% (9 of
      47) failed with phenazopyridine, p=0.04. Most recently, a study by Duenas-Garcia et al
      designed to examine local anesthetics and urinary retention in subjects undergoing
      midurethral slings found that phenazopyridine decreased the VT failure rate from 30% to 8%
      (5). The investigators hypothesize that giving a dose of phenazopyridine the morning after
      surgery will significantly reduce the rate of postoperative urinary retention in women
      undergoing prolapse repair.
