    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial aimed at examining the effectiveness of the
      in e-health education on shared care program for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). The experiment will be conducted over 1 year at a regional hospital in Taiwan. The
      research subjects will be excluded 160 patients with T2DM. Subjects assigned to an
      experimental group will receive the integrated care program, whereas those assigned to a
      control group will receive routine care. The membership of e-health education on shared care
      program is established by different type's professionals including diabetes physicians,
      pharmacists, dietitians and diabetes health teacher. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of subjects
      in both groups will be measured at three time points including 1 month before the experiment,
      and 2 and 5 months after the experiment. The self-management conditions and quality of life
      of the subjects will be also recorded using relevant scales.

      in both groups will be measured at three time points including 1 month before the experiment,
      and 2 and 5 months after the experiment. The self-management conditions and quality of life
      of the subjects will be also recorded using relevant scales. SPSS+ 22.0 statistics software
      will be used for a statistical analysis, which will be presented in percentages, means, and
      standard deviations. Additionally, the chi-square test will be also to examine the
      homogeneity of both groups. Generalized estimating equations will be used to analyze repeated
      measurements in order to compare the efficacy of improving HbA1c, self-management, and
      quality of life. We anticipate that the results of this study will provide the e-health
      education on shared care program to clinical nursing staff to assist patients with T2DM in
      controlling their blood sugar as well as to improve their self-management and quality of
      life.
