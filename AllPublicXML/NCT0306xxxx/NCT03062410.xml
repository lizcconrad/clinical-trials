  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physician mainly use RECIST progression-free survival (PFS) and NCI CTCAE safety as a guide
      to evaluate treatment efficiency. In contrast Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL)
      assessment is often restricted to clinical trial. It could be of particular interest to
      evaluate HRQOL in daily clinical practice in order to adequately choose and manage first line
      therapy, especially since HRQOL at diagnosis was shown to be a prognostic factor of overall
      survival in advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). A systematic collection in
      daily clinical practice of the HRQoL data using standardized questionnaires could strengthen
      management of symptoms : improve symptom control, improve patient-clinician communication,
      satisfaction with care and well-being of the patient and in fine the overall survival.

      The objective of the QUANARIE Study is to assess the feasibility of HRQOL assessment in daily
      clinical practice for patients with mRCC treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) using
      electronic patient reported outcome (PRO).

      Indeed, the goal is to make the HRQoL data accessible and exploitable in real time to
      clinicians, to help medical professionals to optimize their practices by adopting a holistic
      and personalized approach based on patient reported outcomet.

      QUANARIE study is an interventional, prospective, multicenter trial involving 9 french
      oncological centers. Patients diagnosed with mRCC initiating TKI anti-VEGF treatment
      (Sunitinib or Pazopanib) will be invited to complete the European Organisation for Research
      and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 cancer specific questionnaire and the EQ-5D before
      each visit with the physician. Questionnaires completion will be done by patients on tablets
      and/or computer terminals via the CHES software (Computer-based Health Evaluation System) at
      hospital before consultation or at home via secured portal. Physician will immediately have
      access to a visual summary of HRQOL evaluation.
