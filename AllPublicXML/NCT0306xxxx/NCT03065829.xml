  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For family members of chronically critically ill (CCI) patients, an ICU admission marks a
      significant milestone in the patient's illness trajectory that highlights the onset of end
      of-life issues and an abrupt need for family members to assume the caregiver role for the
      first time. Assuming the caregiver role can have devastating and longstanding health
      consequences for family members, which can impair their ability to sustain caregiving
      behaviors for a CCI patient. The unrelenting psychological distress perceived by caregivers
      of CCI patients is linked to significant reductions in their self-management and health
      outcomes.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a theoretically-derived Adaptive SenSor-Based
      Intervention for Caregiver Self-ManagemenT (ASSIST) intervention compared to an attention
      control condition for first time caregivers of CCI patients discharged to an extended care
      facility. One group will be exposed to the ASSIST intervention and will wear the sensor-based
      technology for 30 days and receive a daily dose of MMT. Biophysical sensor data (blood
      pressure, heart-rate variability, pedometry, and actigraphy) will be continuously acquired
      and analyzed using anomaly detection and machine learning techniques to vary the dose
      intensity (number of doses per day) of the two components of ASSIST adding a real-time,
      adaptive feature to promote caregiver self-management. The other group will wear the
      sensor-based technology for 30 days but will not receive the daily dose of MMT. The
      investigators will randomly assign participants to each group.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the ASSIST
      intervention compared to an attention control condition among 20 first time caregivers of CCI
      patients discharged to an extended care facility. The investigators will collect mixed
      methods data at baseline (T1) on Day 15 (T2) and Day 30 (T3) after subject enrollment to
      describe changes in proximal and distal outcomes. We have chosen our time points to capture
      neural and behavioral changes associated with the intervention.

      The investigators aim to:

        1. Determine whether there are differences in the distal outcomes [psychological burden
           (anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, HRQoL), cardiovascular health (BP and HRV) and
           economic costs] between subjects who were exposed to ASSIST compared to those exposed to
           the attention control condition.

        2. Examine whether decentering, self-efficacy, decision-making, motivation, caregiver
           activation, and perceived stress mediate the relationship between exposure to a
           self-management condition (ASSIST vs. attention control) and the proximal
           (self-management) outcomes (stress reduction behaviors, sleep hygiene behaviors, and
           physical activity).

        3. Determine if social support and demographics (gender and age) moderate the proximal
           outcomes [emotional distress, sleep quality, and physical activity] or distal outcomes
           [psychological burden (anxiety, depression, caregiver burden, HRQoL), cardiovascular
           health (BP and HRV) and economic costs].

        4. Explore the differences in brain activation (structural and fMRI scans) and HPA function
           and stress response (hair cortisol, inflammation panel) between subjects exposed to
           ASSIST compared to those exposed to the attention control condition.

    <intervention_model_description>Our model posits that effective caregiver self-management depends on analytic and emotional processing. The investigators hypothesize the ASSIST intervention will improve analytic processing by improving self-monitoring. ASSIST will expose subjects to mindfulness meditation training and promote self-awareness, which will aid the regulation of their emotional processing and improve proximal outcomes. The investigators expect proximal self-management outcomes to influence the distal outcomes of caregiver health. Our model will also test the mediating effects of decentering, processing, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA), inflammatory stress response, and cognitive mediators. The influence of potential moderators will be assessed for their effect on the relationship between the self-management intervention and the proximal and distal outcomes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ASSIST intervention will deliver daily doses of MMT and vary dose intensity of all components each day based on the subject's biophysical data. Across a 30-day period, the ASSIST intervention will capture and analyze data to deliver on-demand MMT, guided practices to promote sleep hygiene and physical activity. Each day, subjects will receive at least one prompt to practice MMT (about 5 minutes at a time). However, based on the subject's biophysical sensor data, subjects could receive a maximum of 5 alerts or prompts per day from the device to enhance stress reduction, sleep hygiene, or physical activity.</description>

    <description>This intervention exposes subjects to the wearable technology without the self-management components to minimize novelty effects. Subjects assigned to this condition will wear the device for 30 days, which offers them an opportunity to experientially learn to self-monitor and employ self-regulatory skills by viewing the display biophysical data. Subjects in this condition will not receive any prompts from the device.</description>
