    <textblock>
      A noticeably increasing number of patients are asking for naturally based extracts and
      ingredients as supplementary dermatologic remedies. Patients are seeking natural and
      cost-effective skin care alternatives in place of prescription medications and procedures.
      This study will isolate the effects of oral turmeric and assess a combination tablet that
      includes turmeric on sebum production in healthy subjects.

      Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a spice that has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory,
      antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-neoplastic properties, and even potential to improve mental
      illnesses. In western herbalism, Turmeric is primarily used as an anti-inflammatory agent. In
      India, turmeric is used in Ayurevdic medicine for the treatment of acne. It has been used
      both internally and externally.

      Curcumin is a phytochemical derived from turmeric and believed to be one of the key active
      components of turmeric. Curcumin is reported to have activity as an antibacterial and
      anti-inflammatory agent and has been used as a paste for skin eruptions and infections.
      Previous basic science work by Dr. Raja Sivamani's lab has shown that both turmeric and
      curcumin inhibit lipid synthesis in human sebocytes, the cells responsible for the production
      of sebum

      The goal of this study is to evaluate how ingestion of turmeric and tablets that have a
      combination of herbs including turmeric may modulate sebum production.

Phyllanthus Amarus herb Each tablet contains 500mg total of the above herbs. There is 50 mg of Turmeric in each Healthy Skin ™ tablet. Subjects will take 2 tablets twice per day, which will be a total daily dose of 200 mg of Turmeric. This is comparable to the daily amount of Turmeric in many commercially-available Turmeric supplements; therefore, it is valuable to compare this formulation to the turmeric-only tablets.</description>
