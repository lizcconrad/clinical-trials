  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever results from infection with a bacterium called Salmonella Typhi and is a major
      cause of illness worldwide. It is estimated to infect 20-25 million people every year and can
      affect people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. The disease is
      spread through contaminated food and water, and efforts to improve water quality, sanitation
      and hygiene will likely go a long way to reducing the global burden of disease.
      Unfortunately, improving access to clean water and sanitation improvements is very costly and
      difficult to implement on a large scale. Vaccination against typhoid fever is likely to be a
      cost-effective way of reducing the global disease burden. There are two vaccines currently
      available against typhoid fever. Whilst these vaccines provide some protection against
      disease (in the region of 50-70%) these vaccines are less effective in young children, who
      are the population group at highest risk of disease. In order to develop a new generation of
      typhoid vaccines it is important to have a more complete understanding of how the bacterium
      causes disease. In this study, the investigators are aiming to understand more about the
      Salmonella Typhi bacteria and how it causes disease. In particular, the investigators aim to
      study the importance of a toxin produced by the typhoid bacteria, called the typhoid toxin.
      The typhoid toxin has only recently been discovered. It is made only by the typhoid bacteria
      and closely related bacteria, such as paratyphoid. From studies done in the laboratory, there
      is evidence that the typhoid toxin is important in causing typhoid disease. It is thought
      that the typhoid toxin might be important in causing symptoms of typhoid disease, however the
      exact role of the typhoid toxin during infection in humans hasn't been studied before.
      Studying this might impact on the design new vaccines against typhoid.

      In this study, the investigators will be undertaking a 'challenge' with two strains of the
      typhoid bacteria (Salmonella Typhi). This involves exposing participants to live Salmonella
      Typhi under defined circumstances, by asking them to swallow a solution that contains the
      bacteria. After the challenge the investigators closely monitor participants for a period of
      at least two weeks and the investigators will then treat participants with antibiotics as
      soon as they are diagnosed with typhoid disease. The investigators are interested in
      comparing the response to challenge between two strains of the typhoid bacteria that differ
      in the production of the typhoid toxin. This process has been undertaken by participants in
      previous Oxford Vaccine Group studies since 2011.
