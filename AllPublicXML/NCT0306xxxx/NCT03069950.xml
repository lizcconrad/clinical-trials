    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients treated with both regional chemotherapy using
      the HAI pump and intravenous chemotherapy are able to have their liver tumors removed
      surgically (resected), versus treatment with only intravenous chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the liver
             with no clinical or radiographic evidence of extrahepatic disease. Confirmation of
             diagnosis must be performed by the enrolling institution.

          -  Patients must have a primary L sided colorectal cancer, (at or distal to the splenic
             flexure)

          -  Confirmed RAS/RAF wild type tumor. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue obtained from the
             primary tumor or metastasis

          -  Have received prior treatment for metastatic disease with oxaliplatin-based regimen
             and either

               -  Had disease progression OR

               -  Had stable disease OR

               -  Discontinued oxaliplatin due to neuropathy

          -  Patients must meet the following criteria for unresectability as determined by two
             hepatobiliary surgeons and one radiologist:

               -  When a margin negative resection would require resection of all three hepatic
                  veins, both portal veins, or the retrohepatic vena cava.

               -  Requiring a resection that leaves less than 2 hepatic segments (not including the
                  caudate lobe) behind with adequate arterial/portal inflow, venous outflow and
                  biliary drainage. **

                  **A patient is considered resectable if the procedure includes a minor wedge or
                  thermo-ablation encompassing 10% or less of the volume of the remaining 2
                  segments.

               -  Patient‟s liver metastases must comprise &lt;70% of the liver parenchyma. All
