    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOXÂ®) in the treatment of
      depression associated with Idiopathic Parkinson Disease in adults. As a Randomized Controlled
      Trial, half of the participants will receive onabotulinumtoxinA injections and half will
      receive a placebo saline solution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common, but treatable, comorbid condition often seen in persons with
      Idiopathic Parkinson Disease (iPD). Depression in Parkinson Disease may be hard to treat as
      patients with iPD may be sensitive to side effect of medication. As a result, other
      treatments which have better side effects profiles than antidepressants may be equivalent (or
      better) options.

      OnabotulinumtoxinA is a purified formulation of botulinum toxin serotype A which is widely
      utilized for neurological (and cosmetic) purposes in medicine. OnabotulinumtoxinA has
      preliminary studies showing it may be beneficial for the treatment of Major Depressive
      Disorder when given in isolated injections to facial muscles (corrugator and procerus). When
      given in low doses, onabotulinumtoxinA is thought to have minimal side effects.

      The investigators propose that a single treatment onabotulinumtoxinA may improve symptoms of
      depression in persons with Parkinson Disease over three months compared to placebo. The
      investigators plan to use both subjective and objective evaluations of depression symptoms
      and regular physical exams to ensure physical (motor) symptoms of Parkinson Disease do not
      worsen.
