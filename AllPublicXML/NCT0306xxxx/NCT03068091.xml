  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient with ILD have altered lung
      compliance on chest CT before they have macroscopic structural changes on CT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of lung disorders in which the lung tissues become
      inflamed and then damaged. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is one of the subtypes of ILD
      which has characteristic histological and CT features. It is well known that microscopic
      fibrosis occurs in the lungs of IPF patients well before the structural changes of fibrosis
      become apparent on CT. By combining sophisticated image analysis with CT scans obtained at
      full inspiration and full expiration, it may be possible to detect earlier changes of IPF
      than currently possible by looking at macro structural features alone. With the recent
      development of new therapeutics for IPF, early detection of the disease and improved
      monitoring of treatment efficacy will become important. Using CT to assess regional lung
      compliance has the potential to become an easily translated clinical tool.
