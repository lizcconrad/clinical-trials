  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crown lengthening surgery is done when a tooth needs to be fixed with a crown. Sometimes, not
      enough of the tooth sticks out above the gum to support a crown. This can happen when a tooth
      breaks off at the gum line, or when a crown or filling falls out of a tooth and there is
      decay underneath. To place a crown, the dentist needs to expose more of the tooth. This is
      done by removing some gum tissue or bone.

      After surgery, the area will heal in about three months. Then, making a crown can begin. This
      healing period often delays the delivery a final crown. This study is investing a way to make
      the final impression at the surgery to expedite the delivery of a final crown.

      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes of
      single unsplinted fixed restorations made with digital intraoral imaging in conjunction with
      clinical crown lengthening procedures (CLPs) compared ones fabricated by the conventional
      protocol.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the clinical outcomes between the experimental group (the digital
      impression taking at clinical crown lengthening procedures) and the control group (the
      conventional protocol) Hypothesis: There will be no differences in clinical parameters around
      the teeth between the two groups.

      Approach: The investigators will conduct a prospective clinical study and will compare the
      changes in gingival recession, the width of keratinized gingiva, and pocket depths around the
      teeth between the two groups.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the radiographic outcome between the experimental group and the
      control group Hypothesis: There will be no difference in crestal bone level around teeth
      between the two groups.

      Approach: The study will investigate the difference in crestal bone level around the teeth at
      baseline and 12 months between the two groups.
