    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to conduct a 3-period randomized controlled crossover study to
      investigate the postprandial effects of a high fat meal with spice on endothelial function,
      lipids/lipoproteins, immune function and plasma markers of antioxidants and oxidative stress.
      Metabolomic profiling will also be conducted. In random order, participants will consume
      either a high fat meal (1000kcal, 45g fat) or a high fat meal containing 2g of spice or a
      high fat meal containing 6g of spice. Between each treatment there will be a washout period
      of at least 3 days. It is hypothesized that consumption of a high fat meal with spice will
      attenuate postprandial endothelial impairment and triglyceride levels in a dose response
      manner compared with a high fat meal.

      A 3-period randomized controlled crossover study will be conducted to investigate the
      postprandial effects of a high fat meal with spices on endothelial function,
      lipids/lipoproteins, immune function, plasma antioxidants and markers of oxidative stress.
      Metabolomic profiling will also be conducted. In random order participants will consume
      either a high fat meal (1000kcal, 45g fat) or a high fat meal containing 2g of spices or a
      high fat meal containing 6g of spices with a 3 day washout period between each treatment. The
      following spices will be incorporated into the meal black pepper, basil, bay leaf, cinnamon,
      coriander, cumin, ginger, oregano, parsley, rosemary, red pepper, turmeric and thyme.

      Endothelial function will be measured by flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery in the
      fasting state and 2 and 4 hours after the meal. Participants will also provide a fasting
      blood sample and samples will also be taken at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after the meal.
