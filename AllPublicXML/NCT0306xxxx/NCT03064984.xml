  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topical preparations (eye drops) derived from the blood have become a relatively common
      treatment for more advanced forms of keratopathy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the effect of two blood components from donors (serum cord blood and serum from adult subject
      donor peripheral blood) in the treatment of severe keratopathies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the use of eye drops prepared from the blood as a source is mainly based on
      their content in growth factors (Growth factors, GF), which play an important role in
      regulation of many processes involved in normal healing of damaged corneal epithelium . The
      most used product so far is the eye drop prepared from serum (Autologous Serum, AS) or from
      platelet-rich plasma (Plasma Rich Platelet, PRP) of peripheral blood taken from the patients
      themselves. More recently, treatments were introduced by homologous sources that undoubtedly
      offer advantages as compared to autologous sources. In particular the homologous sources
      show:

        -  not invasiveness to the patient, who could in time not like the repeated withdrawals

        -  applicability even in patients with underlying systemic conditions. They may contain in
           their blood, among others, higher levels of pro-inflammatory factors, with the
           consequence of poor and inappropriate final product to be prepared and delivered to the
           eye

             -  reliability, since the homologous products can be prepared, controlled, also
                validated under the microbiological profile and standardized advance, then kept
                frozen until the dispensation

             -  conceptually unlimited availability of the product to be dispensed

             -  versatility of therapeutic indications, based on different GF levels which are
                estimated in advance

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of two products derived from two
      different blood sources (cord blood collected at birth from placenta umbilical veins and
      adult subject donor peripheral blood) in the treatment of severe keratopathies.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a double-blind, interventional clinical study, randomized, multicenter. The treatments under study comprise topical products prepared from two different sources: umbilical cord blood collected at birth and adult subject donor peripheral blood. The products are prepared, standardized, controlled and sealed in anonymous frozen vials in the Transfusional Service, partner in the study.
The study consists of two phases: Phase 1 is runned for one month treatment. The assignment of the treatment in Phase 1 is performed through a computer based randomization process, blind to the patient and the clinician, only known to the Transfusion Service personnel. The patient enter Phase 2 only in case of a corneal epithelial damage relapse taking place within two months after the end of Phase 1, and the treatment assigned belongs to the remaining arm. In this case also, the treatment is only known to the Transfusion Service personnel, trained to keep data aside.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The effect of the treatment(s) will be evaluated by measuring the area of damaged corneal epithelium (calculated as the mm2 of damaged epithelium) after treatment as compared to baseline, and defined as 1. complete healing : no detection of damaged area; 2. Partial healing : reduction of the damaged corneal area after treatment as compared to baseline ; 3. No improvement : same damaged corneal epithelial area in mm2 at baseline and after treatment; 4. Worsening : damaged corneal epithelial area in mm2 after treatment larger than at baseline</description>

    <description>The effect of the treatment(s) will be evaluated by measuring the subjective discomfort (expressed with the OSDI score) after treatment as compared to baseline and defined as 1. Disappearance of discomfort: OSDI score &lt; 6/100; 2. Reduction of discomfort: reduction of the OSDI score after treatment as compared to baseline ; 3. No improvement : same values for OSDI score after treatment as detected in baseline; 4. Worsening : score for OSDI score after treatment higher than that detected at baseline</description>
