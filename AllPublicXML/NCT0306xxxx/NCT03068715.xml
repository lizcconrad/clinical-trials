    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation using a transcranial
      magnetic stimulation device for treatment-resistant depression. In a double-blind fashion,
      half the participants will receive accelerated theta-burst stimulation while half will
      receive sham treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established technology as therapy
      for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 min over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been very
      successful in real world situations. The limitations of this approach include the duration of
      the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session). Recently, researchers have
      aggressively pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce treatment times with some
      preliminary success. This study intents to further modify the parameters to create a more
      rapid form of the treatment and look at the change in neuroimaging biomarkers.

    <description>Participants in the active stimulation group will receive intermittent TBS (intermittent TBS-1800 pulses/session). They will receive 1800 stimuli of iTBS to left DLPFC per session per session. The L-DLPFC will be targeted utilizing the Localite neuronavigation system. Stimulation intensity will be standardized at 80% of RMT and adjusted to the skull to cortical surface distance (see Nahas 2004).
Sessions will be delivered using the MagPro stimulator, with 3-pulse 50-Hz bursts given every 200ms (at 5 Hz). In the intermittent TBS, a 2s train of bursts will be given every 10 s for a total of 570 s (1800 pulses) over the L DLPFC.</description>
