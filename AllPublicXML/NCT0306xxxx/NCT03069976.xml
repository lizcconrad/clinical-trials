  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based upon the possible implication of microbiota and abnormal microbial metabolites such as
      altered bile acids, in the pathogenesis of PSC, emerging data suggests that oral antibiotics,
      such as vancomycin and metronidazole, may have therapeutic effects in this overlap syndrome
      or PSC.

      The goal of our study is to evaluate role of antibiotics and microflora in children with
      AIH/PSC overlap syndrome or with PSC alone. The investigators hope to learn what effects oral
      antibiotics has on the bacteria present in stool, and hope to learn to characterize human
      intestinal microbial communities, in children suffering from overlap syndrome or PSC.

      The hypothesis of the investigators is that overlap syndrome and PSC develop due to altered
      microflora and the resulting abnormal bile acids pool. The outcome of overlap syndrome or PSC
      could be affected by presence or absence of RCUH. Antibiotics to correct the microflora may
      result in disease/cholangiopathy remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The used antibiotic is Metronidazole (Flagyl), during 14 days, as induction therapy or rescue
      therapy.

      Study participants will provide blood and stool samples in order to evaluate bile acids
      profile and microbiome, before and after the course of metronidazole, and then comparison
      will be made pre- and post-antibiotics.

      The investigators will determine the benefit of oral metronidazole therapy through
      improvement of clinical symptoms and improvement of liver function tests.
