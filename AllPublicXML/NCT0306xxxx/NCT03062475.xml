  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM) is a commom complication during pregnancy and associated
      with various adverse pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and her offspring. Imoportantly,
      with the gradual opening of a two-child policy, more and more Chinese women of reproductive
      age enter pregnancy have a history of GDM. Our previous study showed that regular exercise
      commenced in early pregnancy is effective in reducing the risk of developing GDM in Chinese
      overweight and obese pregant women. Thus, in this study, we want to evaluate the effect of
      lifestyle intervention with detailed information on how to eat and how to diet in preventing
      the recurrence of GDM.

    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus(GDM) is a commom complication during pregnancy. and the
      incidence has reached as high as 19.2% in China. GDM is associated with various adverse
      pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and her offspring, and not only during the perinatal
      phase, but also in the long term.Thus finding effective way to reduce the risk of GDM is of
      great importance,especial for women with high GDM risk factors. GDM history is one of the
      risk factors. Imoportantly, with the gradual opening of a two-child policy, more and more
      Chinese women of reproductive age enter pregnancy have a history of GDM. Our previous study
      showed that regular exercise commenced in early pregnancy is effective in reducing the risk
      of developing GDM in Chinese overweight and obese pregant women. Thus, in this study, we want
      to evaluate the effect of lifestyle intervention with detailed information on how to eat and
      how to diet in preventing the recurrence of GDM

Values of 7.0 mmol/L at 0 hours or 11.1 mmol/L at 2 hours were diagnosed as DM, regardless of the pregnancy stage</description>

    <description>Pregnant women allocated to this group receive lifestyle intervention. With the dietary intervention we aimed to promote a healthy pattern of eating but not necessarily to restrict energy intake. With respect to advice on physical activity, we focused on incremental increases in walking from a pedometer assessed or encourage them to do moderate cycling.</description>

    <intervention_name>lifestyle intervention with dietary and exercise recommendation</intervention_name>
    <description>With the dietary intervention we aimed to promote a healthy pattern of eating but not necessarily to restrict energy intake.For example we suggested exchanging carbohydrate-rich foods with a medium-to-high glycaemic index for those with a lower glycaemic index to reduce the glycaemic load, and restricting dietary intake of saturated fat.
With respect to advice on physical activity, we focused on incremental increases in walking from a pedometer assessed, or encourage them to do moderate cycling during pregnancy.</description>
