  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This register study collects data of patients with proximal humerus and humerus shaft
      fractures to monitor the healing process by assessing shoulder function and quality of life
      according to the treatment method (operative or conservative management).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective data collection of patients with proximal humerus and humerus shaft
      fractures in a lifelong aftercare treatment plan is for analyzing the healing process in one
      patient and compared in the whole cohort.

      According to actual scientific and clinical issues can this data collection be a basis in
      optimizing the treatment method.

    <measure>Constant Shoulder Score (CS) (change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>following a aftercare treatment plan with follow ups after 6,12, 24, 52 weeks in the first year; then through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The CS is a commonly used outcome measure for assessing the outcomes of the treatment of shoulder disorders including the pain score, functional assessment, range of motion and strength measures.
In week 6, 52 and in the yearly follow ups for comparison reasons the investigators also assess the CS of the not affected shoulder. Reported value is the impaired shoulder-functionality in percent. 100% are equivalent to an unimpaired shoulder function.</description>

    <time_frame>following a aftercare treatment plan with follow ups after 1,3,6,12, 24, 52 weeks in the first year; then through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scoring system was developed to assess the level of disability for any patient with any condition affecting the upper limb by covering domains including symptoms, physical function, social function and psychological function.</description>

    <measure>Health related quality of life: EuroQoL (EQ-5D-3L+5L) (change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>following a aftercare treatment plan with follow ups after 1,3,6,12, 24, 52 weeks in the first year; then through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L/5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It was designed for self-completion covering mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Furthermore, health state is indicated by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). EQ-5D assesses the health status of the patients in an one-dimensional number (1-3/1-5).</description>

    <measure>Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) (change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>following a aftercare treatment plan with follow ups after 1,3,6,12, 24, 52 weeks in the first year; then through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SSV is defined as a patient's subjective shoulder assessment expressed as a percentage of an entirely normal shoulder, which would score 100%.</description>
