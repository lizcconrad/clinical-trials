    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to measure childhood self-regulation targets known to be
      associated with obesity risk and poor adherence to medical regimens and to assess whether
      intervening on these mechanisms can improve self-regulation. The investigators will do so in
      a pre-existing cohort of low-income school-age children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor self-regulation (i.e., inability to harness cognitive, emotional or motivational
      resources to achieve goals) contributes to a number of unhealthy behaviors across the life
      course, including overeating, a lack of physical activity, smoking, alcoholism and substance
      abuse that are linked to poor long-term health. The self-regulation processes that generate
      the desire for such substances or that make it difficult to engage in healthy habits are
      theorized to begin very early in the lifespan. Targeting early self-regulation profiles that
      signal risk for engaging in unhealthy behaviors would allow more effective intervention. The
      investigators will assess self-regulation during pre-adolescence, a critical transition when
      children gain responsibility for managing their health choices and self-regulation becomes
      increasingly associated with health outcomes. Obesity is a complex health issue with
      early-emerging biological and behavioral precursors that are related to self-regulation; as
      such it is a good model for understanding a broad range of health conditions that require
      active self-management. Childhood obesity is also an ongoing public health crisis, with
      almost 25% of children overweight by age 4 years (35% by school-age). The goal of this study
      is to measure childhood self-regulation targets known to be associated with obesity risk and
      poor adherence to medical regimens and to assess whether intervening on these mechanisms can
      improve self-regulation. The investigators will do so in a cohort of children with a high
      rate of obesity who have been extensively phenotyped for bio-behavioral self-regulation and
      obesity risk factors from early childhood.

      The aim is to, in low-income school-age children from extant cohorts, develop and field-test
      interventions designed to address self-regulation targets using a Multiphase Optimization
      Strategy (MOST) design to detect intervention effectiveness and child or family factors
      (e.g., maternal education, family stress, early childhood eating or stress regulation
      pattern) that may moderate intervention effects. The investigators hypothesize that our
      interventions will cause change in the self-regulation targets most closely related to the
      intervention components (e.g., EF-focused intervention will change EF targets).

    <measure>Change in Working Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Working memory is assessed using a standardized digit span task from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-WISC-IV, which requires participants to recite digits they have just heard in progressively longer sequences. The longest correct span of digits the participants repeats is the index of working memory.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Inhibitory Control</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inhibitory control is measured using a go/no-go task. In this task, children are taught to play a computer-based &quot;Zoo&quot; game wherein their goal is to help the zookeeper find animals that have escaped and are loose in the zoo. Children are instructed to press a key to respond as fast as possible when they see the &quot;go&quot; stimulus (i.e., an orangutan who is &quot;helping&quot; the zookeeper retrieve the escaped animals, presented for 300 ms) but not when they see the no-go stimulus (i.e., any other animal that has &quot;escaped&quot;). The task thus requires children to demonstrate the capacity to inhibit the response to &quot;go&quot; when they see the &quot;helper&quot; animal, and indexes inhibitory control. Scores on this task are scored based on accuracy and reaction time.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Children's Emotion Management Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Children report on their tendency to engage in reappraisal and suppression emotion regulation strategies using the Children's Emotion Management Scales (e.g., &quot;when I am feeling mad, I can stop myself from losing my temper&quot;). Children report on the use of such strategies for feelings of anger, sadness, and worry and subscales are created to generate effective emotion management strategy scores for each emotion, and overall.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for children</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Parents report on child positive and negative mood using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for children, which presents parents with different positively- and negatively-valenced words and asks them to indicate which words best describe the way they perceive the child to feel, in general (e.g., upset, scared vs. interested, excited). Responses are summed to generate positive and negative affect scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in episodic future thinking</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The interviewer asks children to think of three different upcoming future events that could happen over the next few days, next week, and the next few months, and to describe each event. The interview is audiotaped and later coded using an adaptation of prior coding systems.Indicators of episodic future thinking include use of rich, descriptive detail, vivid imagery, future-oriented language (e.g., &quot;we willâ€¦&quot;), and coherent narratives. Coding of the interviews is thus based on the level of detailed description of specific events; child use of future-oriented language; mental state language; and narrative coherence, and scores for richness of episodic future thinking language are generated.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in NIH Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH Self-Efficacy questionnaire assesses a participant's belief in his/her capacity to manage and have control over meaningful events (e.g., &quot;I can manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough&quot;).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Future Time Perspective subscale from the Zimbardo Time Perspective Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Children indicate how much different items reflect their views (&quot;I can manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough&quot;; &quot;I finish projects on time by working on them a little bit every day&quot;) and scores are generated to reflect the level of future-oriented time perspective .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ratio Reinforcing Computer Task</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Relative reinforcing value (RRV) for food is determined by measuring child responses on a Ratio Reinforcing Computer Task to obtain palatable food. The child is shown how to play the game on a computer and told to play the game to win candy prizes (chocolate, gummy candy, etc.). Each computer screen displays three boxes containing different shapes, and each time a key is pressed the shapes rotate and change. When all shapes match, the child receives a point and for every five points, is given a ticket to use to redeem for candy at the end of the visit. The schedule of reinforcement begins at 10 presses to earn one point and doubles each time a ticket is earned (Progressive Ratio (PR) 20, PR 40, PR 80, PR 160, PR 320, PR 640, PR 1280, PR 2560, PR 5120, PR 10240). Food reinforcement is identified by the highest reinforcement schedule completed by the child to earn candy, with higher values indicating greater motivation to work for food, indexing food reward.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in implicit food bias</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This task assesses implicit associations between images of chocolate and &quot;stopping&quot; versus &quot;going&quot;. Children are first shown how to press buttons based on whether they see a &quot;stop&quot; (e.g., hand signaling stop) or a &quot;go&quot; signal (e.g., walk sign; 16 trials). In block 2 (48 trials) children sort the &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;go&quot; signals by pressing one of the buttons when one of the signals is paired with an image of chocolate (e.g., &quot;go+chocolate&quot;) and the other button for the other (unpaired) signal (&quot;stop&quot;). In block 3 (48 trials), the pattern is reversed and children sort the &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;go&quot; signals based on the alternate signal-chocolate pairing (e.g., &quot;stop+chocolate&quot; vs. &quot;go&quot;). Scores are calculated using the D600 scoring protocol such that higher values on the task indicate a stronger implicit association between chocolate and &quot;go&quot; compared to chocolate and &quot;stop&quot; signals, suggesting an implicit bias toward chocolate.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Power of Food Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Children complete this 15-item scale that assesses individual differences in sensitivity to food cues in the environment (e.g.. &quot;I think about food even when I'm not truly hungry &quot;) and the ability of these cues to increase desire for food (e.g., &quot;If I see or smell a food I like, I get a powerful urge to have some &quot;).</description>
