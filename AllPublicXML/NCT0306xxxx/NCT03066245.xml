      Patients qualified for this study are those diagnosed with ABCs and failed to be treated with
      other forms of classical therapies. In which, these patients will be engrafted with
      biodegradable scaffolds seeded with Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) supplemented with Platelet
      lysate.

    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC) are relatively rare, benign, tumor-like, expansile osteolytic
      lesions of unknown etiology which are predominantly found within the long bones and
      characterized by frequent idiopathic fractures. Despite the large variety of bone substitutes
      that have been used to fill these cystic lesions, to date there is no graft material which
      can be regarded as completely satisfactory, with a recurrence rate that ranges from 5-40% of
      treated cases. Autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear cells have been used previously to
      treat ABCs. Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds have been used in bone tissue
      engineering due to their biodegradability and biocompatibility. Human platelet lysate (PL)
      contains a number of mitogenic growth factors and has been demonstrated to enhance
      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) proliferation and expansion rate in vitro. This study is designed
      to assess the safety and effectiveness of using PLGA scaffolds seeded with autologous bone
      marrow MSCs and supplemented with osteogenic media and platelet lysate in healing bone
      lesions of patients suffering from aneurysmal bone cysts. This study will be conducted at the
      Cell Therapy Center (CTC), Jordan. Four ABC cases will be included. Patients qualified for
      this study are those diagnosed with ABCs and failed to be treated with other forms of
      classical therapies; such as allografts or who are not candidate of autografts.
