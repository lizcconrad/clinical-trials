  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DNA biomarkers in urine are important diagnostic and prognostic indicators for bladder
      cancer. Many genetic alterations have been identified in the urinary DNA. However, not all
      bladder tumors harbor mutations in the most commonly altered oncogenes. Thus, to reach
      satisfactory sensitivity and specificity a new diagnostic test should include multiple
      biomarkers. The investigators will conduct a prospective evaluation of a panel of mutations
      in urine-DNA test for the detection of urothelial bladder carcinoma in patients with gross
      hematuria for cystoscope.

      Urinary DNA representative of the tumour genome provide a promising resource as a liquid
      biopsy for non-invasive genomic profiling of urothelial bladder cancers. Voided urine samples
      will be collected prior to cystoscopy. Cell free DNA and cellular DNA will both be extracted
      and analyzed. A blood sample will be taken. In patients with bladder wall findings suspicious
      of cancer, a bladder wall biopsy will be taken and submitted for histopathology examination,
      according to clinical standard practice. Next generation sequencing will be applied and
      hotspots mutations in DNA from urine, blood and tumor. Logistic regression was used to
      analyze the association between predictor variables and bladder cancer. The investigators
      will confirm a couple of common mutations occured in urine-DNA and blood-derived DNA
      simultaneously and verify the specificity and sensitivity of individual variance or mutation
      combinations to establish an predictive model with optimal robustness in diagnosis of bladder
      cancer. Moreover, external consistency test will be performed on subsequent patients
      collection.
