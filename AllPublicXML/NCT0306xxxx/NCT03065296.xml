  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will encompass an evaluation of the educational value of having evidence based
      home exercise protocols available for family medicine residents in regard to the prescription
      of home exercise treatment for common musculoskeletal conditions. Investigators will be
      evaluating resident knowledge on home exercise prescription as well as their level of comfort
      in educating their patients before and after a series of didactic sessions and implementation
      of exercise protocols.

      This study aims to fill the gap in this area of the literature pertaining to home exercise
      prescription. The justification of this study's scientific merit comes from the lack of
      literature and the need for research in this area. There have been multiple studies that have
      shown different exercise modality treatments for common musculoskeletal (MSK) complaints
      significantly improve both disability and overall quality of life. Despite the evidence of
      the short and long term effectiveness of exercise based therapies, there is a general lack of
      confidence of residents in prescribing and teaching patients rehab exercises.Additionally,
      many of the patients seen in the University of Florida (UF) Family medicine residency program
      cannot afford or do not have time to attend physical therapist led rehab sessions. This makes
      physician led education and the ability of prescribing exercise based treatments for
      musculoskeletal (MSK) complaints a very important component of patient care.

    <description>Phase I: Residents will be surveyed as to their knowledge and confidence in both diagnosing specific musculoskeletal (MSK) issues and prescribing the correct home rehabilitation regimen.
In between phase 1 and phase 2 there will be a series of didactic lectures to educate resident on home exercise prescription and get them familiarized with the handouts.
Phase II: Residents will be surveyed again in May 2017 with the same multiple choice questions and Likert style confidence scales from phase 1
The survey will consist of multiple choice and short essay questions, focused on the most common musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries seen in the primary care setting.</description>
