  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, we completed a phase 1 to 2a clinical trial of pCMV-vegf165 in patients with chronic
      lower limb ischemia (stage 2a to 3 according to Fontaine classification modified by A. V.
      Pokrovsky) who were not suitable for reconstructive surgery or endovascular treatment. This
      study demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and short-term(3 months) efficacy of pCMV-vegf165
      gene transfer,12,13which lead to conducting a phase 2b to 3 multicenter clinical trial. The
      study was conducted under the control of the Russian Ministry of Health and was completed in
      2011. Patients enrolled in the study were subjected to a 6-month

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a phase 2b/3 multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial of the
      intramuscular transfer of a plasmid DNA encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      165 with cytomegalovirus promotor (CMV) in patients with atherosclerotic lower limb ischemia.
      A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study, that is, 75 patients were randomized into
      the test group and received 2 intramuscular injections of 1.2 mg of pCMV- vegf165, 14 days
      apart together with standard pharmacological treatment. In all, 25 patients were randomized
      into the control group and received standard treatment only. The following end points were
      evaluated within the first 6 months of the study and during a 1.5-year additional follow-up
      period: pain-free walking distance (PWD), ankle-brachial index (ABI), and blood flow velocity
      (BFV).

    <measure>Ankle-brachial index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) or ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of the blood pressure at the ankle to the blood pressure in the upper arm (brachium). Compared to the arm, lower blood pressure in the leg is an indication of blocked arteries due to peripheral artery disease (PAD).</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous oximetry, tcpO2 or TCOM, is a local, non-invasive measurement reflecting the amount of O2 that has diffused from the capillaries, through the epidermis.</description>

    <description>SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are now widely utilized by managed care organizations and by Medicare for routine monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients.</description>
