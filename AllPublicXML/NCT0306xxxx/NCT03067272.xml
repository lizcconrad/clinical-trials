    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, pilot study of subjects undergoing the FemBloc Permanent
      Contraceptive System procedure to be conducted at up to 5 sites in the U.S. enrolling up to
      50 subjects total. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of the FemBloc
      Permanent Contraceptive System for female sterilization in preventing pregnancy through the
      3-month confirmation test visit. Following the pilot safety endpoint analysis at 3-month
      follow-up, Femasys intends to continue follow-up of pilot subjects for a total duration of
      approximately 68 months after the FemBloc treatment procedure.

             catheters
