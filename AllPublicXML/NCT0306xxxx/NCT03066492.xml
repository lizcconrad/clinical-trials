  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial examines the effects of a transitional care clinic for
      high-risk patients at an academic medical center who had no trusted medical home. The trial
      will provide the first reliable evaluation of the Northwestern Transitional Care Clinic /
      Follow Up Clinic's (NFC) impact on re-admissions, care coordination, and costs. This research
      will allow us to assess the value of the NFC and similar models of care for providing a more
      coordinated care approach that results in better treatment outcomes for urban poor
      populations.

      It is hypothesized that NFC patients will have fewer 90-day re-hospitalizations and are more
      likely to have a usual source of primary care 6 months after discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Northwestern Transitional Care Follow-up Clinic (NFC) was established in 2012 to improve
      the coordination of care for these patients following inpatient or Emergency Department
      discharge from Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Since 2012, the NFC has constructed an
      integrated team care approach, logging about 2000 post-discharge encounters with Medicaid or
      patients without insurance. The NFC model has evolved over the past 2 years in response to a
      need to address mental as well as physical health needs and to interface with community
      resources to address social determinants of health that might otherwise lead to frequent
      re-admission. By working with clinical partners and public payers like Medicaid and County
      Care, the NFC has also worked to transition patients to accessible primary care medical homes
      that will provide behavioral, physical, and preventive care. The current study will provide
      the first reliable evaluation of the clinic's impact on re-admissions, care coordination, and
      costs. This research will allow us to assess the value of the NFC and similar models of care
      for providing a more coordinated care approach that results in better treatment outcomes for
      urban poor populations.
