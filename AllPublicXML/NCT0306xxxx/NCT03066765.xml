      Study of tongue implant for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with obstructive sleep apnea will be treated with a tongue based suspension implant
      technique to keep airway open while sleeping. Subjects will be followed a year with primary
      endpoint of AHI results through Polysomnography readings (PSG) testing in an overnight sleep
      lab.
