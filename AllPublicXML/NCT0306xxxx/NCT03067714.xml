  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the rising prevalence of allergic diseases and the subsequent risk of developing other
      immune-related disorders, primary prevention of allergy has become a major priority. It is
      generally acknowledged that breastfeeding is one of the main pillars in allergy prevention.
      Infant formulas based on hydrolysed proteins have been developed to be used by infants at
      increased risk of developing allergy in case a mother is unable or chooses not to breastfeed
      her infant. It has recently been demonstrated that the gut microbiota composition and
      microbiota activity of infants receiving an infant formula based on partially hydrolysed
      proteins, supplemented with oligosaccharides, is more similar to breastfed infants than to
      infants receiving standard cow's milk formula, demonstrated by increased levels of
      bifidobacteria. However the interaction between microbial changes impacted by an
      hypoallergenic concept and its influence on early life immune development should be further
      explored. The aim of the present study is therefore to investigate the bifidogenic effect of
      a hypoallergenic formula supplemented with prebiotics and probiotics compared to standard
      infant formula in infants at increased risk of developing allergic disease. This study will
      secondary assess the effects of this concept on the development of allergic manifestations up
      to the age of 12 months, which will be verified in a separate clinical study MAESTRO as
      primary outcome. Furthermore, the effects on growth and safety will be studied.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy term infants (gestational age ≥ 37 and ≤ 42 weeks) at high risk of developing
             allergy based on family history of allergy (*1).

          2. Infants aged ≤ 16 weeks (max. 16 weeks + 0 days), preferably as soon as possible after
             birth.

          3. Infants with birth weight within normal range for gestational age and sex (10th to
             90th percentile according to local applicable growth charts).

          4. Infants who start formula feeding within 16 weeks of age (infants of mothers who have
             chosen not to breastfeed or mothers who completely/partially cease breastfeeding
             before the subject's age of 16 weeks) OR Infants who are exclusively breastfed and
             whose mothers have the intention to exclusively breastfeed at least until their infant
             is 16 weeks of age (*2).

          5. Written informed consent from one or both parents (according to local laws) and/or
             legal guardian.

               -  1)Family history of allergy is defined as at least one first-degree relative
                  (parent or full sibling) with: 1) self-reported historically doctor confirmed
                  allergic disease (allergic rhinitis, asthma, food allergy, allergic eczema); or
                  2) self-reported historically non-doctor confirmed allergic disease (allergic
                  rhinitis, asthma, food allergy, allergic eczema) in combination with positive
                  skin prick test.

               -  2)Subjects whose mother intents to switch to formula feeding before the subject's
                  age of 16 weeks but in the end still exclusively breastfeed, will be included in
                  the breastfed reference group. The other way around, subjects whose mother
                  intents to exclusively breastfeed for at least 16 weeks, but in the end decides
                  to switch to formula earlier, will be included in the randomised groups. All
                  these subject s should meet all other in-/exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Consumption of any amount of infant formula based on intact protein before
             randomisation.

          2. Consumption of any amount of infant formula with added probiotics and/or probiotic
             supplement before randomisation.

          3. Existing allergic manifestations (e.g. allergic skin disorders, food allergy) before
             randomisation according to investigator's clinical assessment.

          4. Severe congenital abnormalities which could influence the subjects' growth (e.g.
             cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, tracheomalacia, tracheoesophageal
             fistula, major congenital heart disease, or any other condition according to
             investigator's clinical judgement).

          5. Severe neonatal illnesses (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome, severe sepsis
             intraventricular hemorrhage, severe neonatal jaundice, necrotizing enterocolitis,
             persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, or any other condition which
             required the use of intravenous antibiotic).

          6. Known underlying disease predisposing to infection (e.g. HIV, viral hepatitis B, and
             C, auto-immune diabetes, immune deficiency).

          7. Severe renal failure and hepatic failure according to investigator's clinical
             judgement.

          8. Incapability of the parents to comply with study protocol or investigator's
             uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the subject to comply with the
             protocol requirements

          9. Participation in other studies involving investigational or marketed products
             concomitantly or within two weeks prior to screening visit.
