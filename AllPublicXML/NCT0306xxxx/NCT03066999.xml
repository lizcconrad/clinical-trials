  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that one in four patients
      hospitalized in the United States is catheterized to void the bladder or monitor urinary
      output. In the male population, Dr. Singh, an urologist estimates that about 20% of
      catheterizations are difficult. Driving a catheter blindly, guessing whether to push the
      catheter forward or manipulate it to get around a point of resistance leads to the risk of
      injury which increases the more the catheter is manipulated. Additional adverse events
      include: urosepsis, UTI and bladder perforation. The standard of care treatment for patients
      with difficult urinary catheterization (DUC) is to proceed with a cystoscopic catheter
      placement or suprapubic tube placement.

      PercuVision has the only Foley catheter with a micro-endoscope for visualization and
      navigation of the urethra for nurses and other qualified health care professionals. Moreover,
      it allows urologists to place a guidewire under direct vision rather than calling for a
      flexible cystoscope which is considered a minor procedure.

      In this study, the investigators plan on assessing the effectiveness and ease of use of the
      PercuVision DirectVisionÂ® System device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine placement of transurethral catheters can be challenging in some situations, such as
      urethral strictures, severe phimosis and false passages. Intravaginal retraction of the
      urethral meatus can complicate Foley placement in postmenopausal females. In men, blind
      urethral procedures with mechanical or metal sounds without visual guidance or guidewire
      assistance are now discouraged due to the increased risk of urethral trauma and false
      passages.

      DirectVision is a new visually-guided catheterization device (VGCD) that uses a camera visual
      guide / microendoscope within a triple lumen flexible urinary catheter with an angled tip,
      essentially combining the functionality of a urinary catheter with a cystoscope. DirectVision
      uses fiber-optic bundle of 6,000 integrated fibers to provide illumination and transmit
      real-time video.

      Procedures done via flexible cystoscopy or DirectVision are covered by insurance (including
      Medicaid/Medicare).

      In this prospective study, the investigators plan on assessing the effectiveness and ease of
      use of DirectVision - A direct visualization system for urinary catheterization.
