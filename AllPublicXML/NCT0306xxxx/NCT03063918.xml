    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well personalized dietary intervention works in
      managing bowel dysfunction and improving quality of life in stage I-III rectosigmoid cancer
      survivors. Personalized dietary intervention may help people understand bowel symptoms,
      identify helpful and troublesome foods for bowel symptoms, adjust diets and food preparation
      based on food triggers, and coach on healthy diet recommendations after cancer treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Administer and determine the feasibility of the personalized dietary intervention.

      II. Using qualitative methods, evaluate the acceptability of the intervention as reported by
      survivors.

      III. Explore decisional conflict associated with treatment decision-making in rectal cancer
      surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      At 6 months after standard of care treatment, patients receive 10 sessions of personalized
      dietary intervention over 30 minutes each over 4 months via the telephone. Patients also
      receive a workbook including reference materials and intervention content.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 6 months.
