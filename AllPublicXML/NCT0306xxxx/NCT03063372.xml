  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical students and residents have high rates of mental distress and burnout related to the
      intellectual and time demands of their training. Research shows that physiological stress on
      the body can be a result of fatigue and high stress work, and is associated with experiences
      related to mental distress. Pomegranate is a fruit that is known to contain a variety of
      antioxidant substances that can reduce physiological stress. This study will look at the
      potential for pomegranate supplementation to reduce physiological stress and improve
      well-being in medical students and residents.

      This is a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial of
      pomegranate supplementation in medical students and residents, and to see whether there is
      evidence of an effect on reported emotional and physical well-being.

      Phase 1 will be a pilot with 10 participants in which all will receive the pomegranate
      supplement for 28 days. In phase 2, we will randomize 40 participants (1:1) to receive either
      the pomegranate supplement or a placebo.

      For both phases, we will measure self reported emotional and physical well-being using
      several questionnaires, and we will conduct laboratory testing for measures of oxidative
      stress and inflammatory biomarkers in blood, and for a metabolite of pomegranate in urine.
