    <textblock>
      This study, a Randomized controlled trial of Autologous microbiome reconstitution to prevent
      Colonization by antibiotic rEsistant bacteria (RACE), seeks to investigate the safety,
      feasibility and the role of autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the
      prevention of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) through microbiome restoration.

    <description>Autologous treatment preparation: Patient stool will be collected and processed into an auto-fecal microbiota preparation (FMP) formulation (either auto-FMP enema or capsule formulation). In this treatment arm, the auto-FMP will be administered to the participant following an infectious episode requiring antibiotics.
V-A Auto-FMP Enema (125 mL):
Route of Administration: Enema nozzle will be inserted into rectum and contents expelled into the distal colon. Target dwell time is 1 hour. Participants will lie in the left lateral decubitas position but if mobility permits will rotate to supine and right lateral decubitus position.
Dosing Regimen: 125mL x 1 dose
V-B Auto-FMP Capsules: Patients will receive a single dose of 30 autologous FMT capsules 48-72 hours (+/- renal/hepatic adjustment) after stopping antibiotics. Auto-FMP capsules will contain the participant's own frozen fecal microbiota.
Route of Administration: Orally. Dosing Regimen: 30 capsules x 1 dose</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the placebo arm will receive a placebo FMT via either enema or capsules. The placebo enema preparation and capsules are identical to the interventional capsules in appearance.
The placebo enema preparation will be comprised of Sodium Chloride (0.9%, USP), Glycerol (12.5%, USP), and 8-12 drops brown food coloring (&lt;1%). The placebo capsules are filled with deionized water, glycerol (12.5%), brown food coloring (&lt;1%) and sodium chloride (0.9%), to prevent unmasking of the trial arms.</description>

    <intervention_name>Autologous fecal microbiota transplant</intervention_name>
    <description>Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) FMT is the process by which processed donor microbiota material is transplanted into recipients, by either upper or lower gastrointestinal delivery. The aim is to reconstitute the normal intestinal microbial flora in recipients. FMT can be administered by either enema or capsule depending on eligibility criteria. In this study, the fecal microbiota preparation will be made from the participant's own stool (autologous FMT).</description>
