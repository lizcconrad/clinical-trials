      The purpose of this study is to collect data to support decisions made by BioFire regarding
      assay development, panel composition, and intended use for the final FilmArray CSI reagent
      pouch. The study will utilize whole blood and/or plasma obtained from pediatric patients
      under 18 years of age that present with acute fever.
