  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized, controlled trial will compare the cost-efficacy and acceptability of
      the Unified Protocol in group format against traditional individual Cognitive Behavioral
      Treatment in a sample of patients with emotional disorders. Ultimately, the goal of the
      current study is to explore whether the Unified Protocol in group format can be a
      cost-effective psychological intervention for emotional disorders in the Spanish National
      Health System, that is, one that generates long-lasting changes in symptoms, while reducing
      both direct and indirect economic costs associated with the treatment of emotional disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional disorders (i.e., unipolar mood disorders and anxiety disorders) have become the
      most prevalent psychiatric disorders globally. It is estimated that anxiety problems and
      unipolar mood disorders affect 14% and 6.9% of the population, respectively, and comordibity
      may be as high as 50%. Comparable results have been obtained in Spain, where mood and anxiety
      disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric problems, with an estimated life-prevalence of
      35.8% and 25.6%, respectively.

      As a result of their high prevalence in the population, emotional disorders have become a
      global health problem due to their associated costs.For instance, a study conducted in 36
      countries estimated that the annual cost of treatment for depressive disorders and anxiety
      problems amounted to $91 billion and $56 billion, respectively. If both direct and indirect
      costs of these emotional disorders were accounted for, expenses increased to $925,000
      million. In Spain, when both direct and indirect costs are included, mood and anxiety
      disorders are estimated to cost €10,763 million and €10,365 million, respectively.

      Pharmacological treatment and individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the most
      frequent interventions for emotional disorders in the Spanish National Health System.
      Therefore, increasing the efficiency of these treatments may be a way of reducing the current
      public health costs of emotional disorders. A recently developed form of CBT, the Unified
      Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP), might serve the aforementioned
      purpose, as it can be applied to a variety of disorders simultaneously and it can be easily
      performed in a group format. The UP was created on the basis of the identification of common
      psychopathological vulnerability factors in emotional disorders, together with elements and
      techniques shared by disorder-specific cognitive-behavioral treatments. In the UP,
      traditional CBT techniques (i.e., cognitive restructuring) and contemporary practices (i.e.,
      mindfulness) are combined to treat emotion regulation deficits, which are argued to be the
      underlying common factor in all emotional disorders. The UP is a structured, manual-based
      treatment, so it can be easily applied in a group format. This, together with the fact that
      the UP can be applied simultaneously to individuals with different emotional disorders, might
      help reduce existent waiting lists and current costs of individual treatment.

      So far, studies exploring the effectiveness of the UP in a group format have led to promising
      findings. Overall, results suggest that the UP has between moderate and strong effect sizes
      on numerous outcomes, including depression, anxiety, positive and negative affect, quality of
      life, overall adjustment, and avoidance of negative sensations, for both anxiety and mood
      disorders. These studies have also revealed that between half and two thirds of patients
      ceased to meet diagnostic criteria after the treatment and one investigation, conducted by
      the investigators participating in the present study, revealed that changes remained stable
      12 months after treatment completion. Despite the previous results are encouraging,
      conclusions should be interpreted with caution as sample sizes have been small (11
      participants in two studies and 47 patients in one investigation) and cost-effectiveness of
      the UP in group format compared with traditional individual CBT remains unclear.
      Methodologically-sound, randomized, controlled trials are needed in order to replicate the
      aforementioned findings and to elucidate whether the UP in group format is an effective and
      efficient treatment option for emotional disorders in public settings.

      It is expected that both interventions (CBT and UP) will be comparable in terms of
      effectiveness and acceptability, but treatment costs will be lower in the UP condition. To
      ensure the generalizability of results, the hypotheses will be tested in various public
      mental health centers in Spain.

    <intervention_model_description>All consecutive patients with emotional disorders attending any of the collaborating centers will be asked to participate in the present study. Once inclusion criteria are met, each patient will be randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups: TAU or UP. Randomization will be performed by a researcher unrelated to the study using a computer-generated sequence (Randomizer). Randomization will be stratified according to the severity of the primary measures of depression and anxiety, using the recommended cutoff in the manuals. Stratification will be made to ensure a comparable proportion of severely depressed and anxious individuals in each group. For each subgroup (i.e., severe or less severe depression and/or anxiety), participants will be randomly assigned to the UP or to TAU.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a largely used measure that evaluates depressive symptomatology. It consists of 21 items, each including a set of four different sentences that reflect an increasing degree of depression. Responses are obtained through a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (lowest degree of depressive symptomatology) to 3 (most severe symptomatology). Scores in the BDI-II range from 0 to 63. The alpha coefficient obtained in the Spanish version (.87) indicates a good internal consistency.</description>

    <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is a frequently used measure of the severity of anxiety symptoms. The BAI includes 21 items. Each item reflects an anxiety symptom and respondents are asked to rate the extent to which the symptoms affected them during the past week. Responses are obtained through a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 3 = severely. Total score ranges from 0 to 63. The internal consistency estimate for the Spanish version of the BAI is high (.93).</description>
