  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective controlled clinical trial in which a minimally invasive microsurgical approach
      was used following the keyhole principle in 55 patients and 65 hands under local anesthesia
      and ambulatory strategy. All patients included in the study had an average of 3 months
      disease course and were considered refractory to conservative treatment. Patients were
      evaluated with stringent inclusion criteria with the Levine severity and functional status
      scale with a 2 year follow-up. Descriptive outcomes on the efficiency of this procedure are
      reported.

    <description>The surgical procedure was a direct microsurgical approach with a 1.5 cm incision in the thenar sulcus, under local anesthesia (3cc, 2% lidocaine) administered with an insulin needle. The keyhole approach applied to this anatomical region is based on a 1.5 cm skin incision from where the 0.5 cm dissection is completed in the subcutaneous plane in the side borders and 1cm in the distal and proximal borders. Thus, the subcutaneous phase of the dissection is completed with separation of the carpal ligament and resection of its borders. Once the transverse fibers are open, the perineural micro adhesions of the median nerve are resected and 3mm of the free borders of the carpal fibers found on the nerve are removed to avoid fibrosis. The wound is checked for hemostasis and closed in apposition with Vicryl 3-0 and a single subdermal 3-0 Nylon stitch.</description>
