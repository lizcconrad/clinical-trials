  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are conventionally put on life long therapy with
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs (Imatinib mesylate in India). Patients who achieve a deep
      molecular response which has been sustained for at least three years, can be taken off the
      drug therapy. Thereafter a close monitoring is required to monitor their disease relapse. In
      case there is evidence of disease recurrence on highly sensitive molecular assays, their drug
      therapy is restarted. The study aims to identify proportion of patients who can be kept off
      drug therapy in a state of sustained molecular remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While a large number of studies which have stopped TKI therapy in similar patients exist in
      Europe and USA, no such study has been done on Indian or other south Asian population. Almost
      all studies done previously have noted that in relapsed patients, who show disease recurrence
      on stopping their TKI therapy, their remission state is regained once the TKI therapy is
      restarted.
