  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) is to develop, evaluate,
      and commercialize a linked parent-youth mobile app system, VillageWhere, to support the key
      treatment targets of evidence-based treatments for youth with conduct disorders: clear
      parental expectations, parental monitoring, discipline consistency, and parental support,
      while simultaneously cultivating intrinsic motivation in youth toward prosocial behaviors.
      When used in conjunction with an evidence-based treatment for delinquent youth, VillageWhere
      could help reduce treatment length and cost. When provided in non-evidence-based clinical
      settings, VillageWhere may increase access to state-of-the-art clinical techniques to those
      who might not otherwise receive them. Investigators will conduct usability and acceptability
      tests of new features with target-end-users (youth and their parents) and key stakeholders
      (i.e., probation officers, clinic administrators). Once usability and acceptability is
      achieved, investigators will conduct a 16-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing
      VillageWhere to an attention-control (placebo) mobile app. We expect that across four time
      points, VillageWhere use will result in greater improvements in parent management practices
      and youth autonomy support, parent-youth communication and connectedness, youth intrinsic
      motivation for positive behavior, and youth conduct problems than the placebo. The RCT will
      occur with 100 parent-youth dyads recruited from various treatment and probation settings,
      and represent clinically-significant conduct-problems of various clinically-significant
      severity levels.

Parent and youth will be asked upload the app to their phone during the baseline assessment process and asked to use it as often as they would like throughout the duration of the 16 week trial. The app is designed to be used several times throughout each day.</description>
