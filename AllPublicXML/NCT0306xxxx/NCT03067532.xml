  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To overcome the obstacles of endoscopic surgery, the da vinci surgical robot system was
      applied to the various surgery area . And the complete understanding and practice of the
      robotic system is very important condition for successful robotic surgery.

      Investigator developed a home made robotic surgery simulator for novice robotic surgeons. And
      investigator want to study about the ability of home made robotic surgery simulator versus
      existing robotic simulation system.
