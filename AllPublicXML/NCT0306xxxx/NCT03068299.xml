  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to analyze the effects of senior dance on the cognition, frailty, and
      burden in elderly caregivers of rural communities. This is a randomized clinical trial to be
      conducted with a sample of 58 elderly caregivers residing in rural communities. Data
      collection will be performed in the homes of the elderly and/or in the dependencies of the
      Family Health units (USFs - primary health care systems). They will answer Socio-demographic
      characterization instrument, ACE-R Battery, and electroencephalography for cognitive
      evaluation, five Fragility criteria proposed by Fried et al and Zarit Burden Inventory. The
      dance protocol will be applied to the experimental group (n=29) in the USFs and the control
      group (n=29) will receive health care, including guidance on health care and practices. The
      protocols include 24 interventions, 60 minutes each, weekly, during 6 months. Analysis of
      effects comparisons will be conducted between groups and be comparing baseline with final
      measurements. Dance intervention is expected to exert important positive effects on all study
      variables (cognitive performance, fragility assessment, and caregiver burden), compared to
      the group. The intervention of the control group is expected to exert positive effects on
      some variables of the study (mainly, caregiver burden).

      Sample Variables above described of 58 participants will be measured. The participants will
      be randomized to the dance group (experimental) and to the health care guidance group
      (control). The group will be paired by age, sex, and schooling. This study focused on
      prevention of cognitive performance decline, frailty and burden.

    <description>Sessions of sixty minutes each, which will take place weekly, totaling 24 weeks (6 months). Ten minutes from the start of each session will be reserved for initial exercises, with movements of the upper limbs, lower, accompanied by a motivational music. The process of identifying and memorizing the movements will be carried out as many times as the group deems necessary. The rhythms include combinations of circular and ballroom dances, including waltz, cha-cha-cha, cancan, among others. In all the sessions, the last fifteen minutes are reserved for a conversation about the dance learned/practiced in the day. It is expected to have reached the proposal of a practice of 15 different choreographies and that this was a pleasant moment for all the participants.</description>

    <description>Control group will receive attention, through guidelines for care and health practices for the caregiver and the elderly care recipient. This attention should occur in the same number of sessions of the dance and group intervention group. The control group should follow the same subdivision of the intervention group, in terms of the number of participants per subgroup. The subjects of the guidelines will be raised by the demand of the participants themselves and then worked in an interdisciplinary way.</description>
