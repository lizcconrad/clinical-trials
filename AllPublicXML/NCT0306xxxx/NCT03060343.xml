      A single-center, open-label pilot study to determine the safety, tolerance and engraftment
      potential of zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes in subjects with PD-L1+ positive non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      The purpose of this first in human study is to determine the safety and feasibility of
      Zeushield Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes(Z-CTLs) in patients with relapsed or refractory NSCLC.
      Z-CTLs therapy is a novel immunotherapy under investigation in which patients have their
      T-cells (a type of white blood cell) collected and modified in the laboratory, before they
      are given back to the patient. The T-cells are modified to transform the intracellular signal
      domain of PD-1 and CTLA-4 to immune activation stimulus signal and transform T cells to a new
      kind of cancer-killer cells: zeushield cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Z-CTls).
