  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing a two-group, randomized, controlled trial with 280 primary
      caregivers of adult patients with a chronic illness to test the efficacy of the Rural
      Intervention for Caregivers' Heart Health (RICHH). Immediate (4-month) and long-term
      (12-month) effects of the RICHH intervention on CVD risk factors, self-management behaviors,
      and depressive symptoms will be compared to usual care. The investigators also will test the
      moderating effect of gender on intervention outcomes, given the many differences between male
      and female caregivers.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine effects of the RICHH intervention on the primary outcomes of CVD
      risk factors (i.e., lipid profile, body mass index, and blood pressure) at 4 and 12 months.

      Hypotheses 1: The intervention group will have better lipid profile, body mass index, and
      blood pressure outcomes than the usual care group at 4 and 12 months.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine effects of the RICHH intervention on self-management behaviors
      (i.e., diet quality, physical activity level, and self-report adherence to specific CVD
      health behaviors).

      Hypotheses 2: The intervention group will have better diet quality, higher physical activity
      levels, and better adherence to specific CVD health behaviors than the usual care group at 4
      and 12 months.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine effects of RICHH on depressive symptoms at 4 and 12 months.

      Hypotheses 3: Caregivers receiving the intervention will have lower levels of depressive
      symptoms than caregivers receiving usual care at 4 and 12 months.

      Specific Aim 4: To evaluate whether intervention effects on outcomes will differ by
      caregivers' gender.

      Hypotheses 4: Effects will be stronger for male compared to female caregivers at 4 and 12
      months.

      Impact: The proposed study will have a substantial impact on caregivers' cardiovascular
      health and quality of life because it will provide needed CVD risk prevention, and health
      promotion to rural caregivers living in distressed environments where CVD risk reduction and
      self-management is difficult. The intervention holds the potential to produce major
      improvements in health among caregivers living in rural environments in the US.

    <description>The RICHH intervention is an educational-behavioral and counseling intervention that promotes caregivers' knowledge, skills and motivation to engage in CVD risk reduction. The intervention is delivered individually to caregivers in their homes using video-conferencing technology on mini-iPads that we provide for all participants. Participants keep the mini-iPads at the end of the study. The program consists of 12 weekly sessions [30-45 minutes] followed by 8 bi-weekly [every other week] booster sessions and 6 monthly booster sessions that will be held at the caregivers' preferred times using a video conferencing program. A cardiac psychiatric advanced practice nurse certified cognitive behavioral therapy will deliver the intervention.</description>

    <description>The usual care control group will receive an attention placebo intervention in which the caregivers will receive mini-iPads loaded with Caregiver and CVD risk reduction pamphlets in PDF format along with the associated links from the American Heart Association. Because the investigators may identify CVD risk factors in baseline testing in participants who do not know they have them, it would be unethical not to provide at least usual care for these. Thus, all individuals enrolled in the study and in whom the investigators identify CVD risk factors will receive referral to a primary care provider for management of the CVD risk factors identified.</description>
