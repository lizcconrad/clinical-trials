  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectivity of intranasal dexmedetomidine
      sedation during intra-articular injection therapy. Intranasal dexmedetomidine is compared
      with dinitrous oxide (N2O) which has already been proven safe and effective sedation method
      during painful procedures in pediatric patients.

      In earlier studies the median VAS during intra-articular corticosteroid injections with
      patients receiving nitrous oxide has been 3 (Uziel et al 2008). Study hypothesis is that with
      intranasal dexmedetomidine sedation the VAS pain levels will be 1 unit lower.
