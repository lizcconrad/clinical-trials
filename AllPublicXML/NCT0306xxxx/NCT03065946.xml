    <textblock>
      Unconscious survivors of cardiac arrest who are treated with intravenous therapeutic
      hypothermia for 24 hours will be assessed after 12 hours for appropriateness to be woken
      early and extubated whilst continuing to receive therapeutic hypothermia. Sedation will be
      reduced/stopped at 12 hours to enable a comprehensive neurological assessment utilising a
      multimodal approach.

      Providing the patient is clinically stable with no adverse neurological signs the patient
      will be extubated. Patients who remain unconscious will be reviewed 6 hourly for neurological
      recovery and their suitability to be extubated in line with standard practice.

      This study is a single centre, prospective, feasibility and safety study. Consecutively
      enrolling 50 patients. Subjects will include adult patients who have suffered a cardiac
      arrest with a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

      To qualify, patients must be unconscious and intubated because their initial Glasgow Coma
      Score (GCS) is &lt;8. Intravenous therapeutic hypothermia (TH) will be established in the
      cathlab and maintained for 24 hours whilst being cared for in the intensive Care Unit (ICU).
      IVTM will maintain the patient's core temperature at a target temperature between 32-34
      degrees Celsius. After the patient has received 12 hours of TH, sedation will be stopped and
      the patient will have a comprehensive neurological assessment combining electroencephalogram
      (EEG), Somatic Sensory Evoked Potential (SSEP) and neurological biomarkers, Neuron Specific
      Enolase (NSE) and S100b. The EEG, SSEP and biomarkers will be reviewed by an expert in
      neurophysiology at a core lab off-site. These results will be reviewed retrospectively,
      therefore will not influence the medical management of the patient.

      Patients who are clinically stable and not showing any adverse neurological signs will be
      extubated after 12 hours. Patients who don't meet the early waking criteria will reassessed
      every 6 hours for extubation. Those patients who are not suitable to be woken early or remain
      unconscious after 24 hours will be reassessed as per standard practice for unconscious
      survivors of cardiac arrest.
