  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, monitorizations during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) are inadequate to
      show the sufficiency of cerebral oxygenation. During CPR, insufficient chest compressions
      have critical importance for neurological results and life quality after the return of
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), which is used in measuring the cerebral tissue
      oxygenation is one of the latest technologies that allow the measurement of brain oxygen
      saturation. With this study, the issue of whether sufficient cerebral oxygenation is provided
      during CPR applied to patients that have Cardiac Arrest (CA) will be investigated, and the
      effect of CPR on the patient prognosis after ROSC will be examined. In this study, the aim is
      to investigate whether sufficient oxygenation is provided in synchronization with chest
      compressions during CPR; and to test the regional brain tissue saturation with rSO2
      measurement, and the prognosis with Full Outline of UnResponsiveness (FOUR) Score in patients
      with ROSC.
