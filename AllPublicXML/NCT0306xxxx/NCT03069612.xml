  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use during adolescence represents a significant risk factor for the development of
      psychosis including schizophrenia. Moreover, cannabis is the most commonly used drug among
      patients with an existing psychotic disorder. An estimated 25% of patients with psychosis
      reportedly meet the criteria of a cannabis use disorder particularly among younger patients
      experiencing their first episode. Cannabis use significantly exacerbates symptomatology
      resulting in an increased duration of the first hospitalization visit, number of hospital
      readmissions, and overall reduced functional outcome. Discovering novel strategies to treat
      the underlying pathophysiology of cannabis dependence early in the disorder may translate
      into improved functional outcome. Working memory deficits have been shown to predict relapse
      in the first-year of psychosis and is modulated with cannabis use. Repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has shown
      tremendous promise for the treatment of both tobacco dependence and working memory impairment
      in patients with psychosis possibly through the modulation of gamma (30-50 Hz) oscillations.
      The proposed study will therefore evaluate the effect of rTMS on abstinence, working memory
      performance, and gamma oscillations through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      28-day longitudinal abstinence study design in patients with early psychosis. It will further
      explore if baseline performance and gamma oscillations predict abstinence in response to
      rTMS. It is hypothesized that active compared to sham rTMS will improve abstinence rates and
      improve working memory performance through the modulation of gamma oscillations.

      This a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, longitudinal 28-Day abstinence study
      design. Patients with psychosis will be randomized (1:1) to receive either active or sham
      stimulation that will be administered three times per week for 4 weeks (28 days) for a total
      of 12 treatments. Urine will be collected three times per week prior to the rTMS treatment.
      Cognition including the N-Back task and MATRICS cognitive battery will be administered on Day
      0, Day 28, and Day 42 to determine the effect of rTMS on cognition compared to sham
      stimulation.
