  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study is designed to investigate the relationship between
      brain temperature, axillary temperature, rectal temperature, and bladder temperature of
      postoperative patients with brain trauma, and the relationship between brain temperature and
      prognosis. This study is conducted based on the following important assumptions. First, brain
      temperature of postoperative patients with brain trauma should be higher than the axillary
      temperature, rectal temperature and bladder temperature. Second, the consistency of brain
      temperature and bladder temperature is better than the consistency of brain temperature and
      axillary temperature, as well as that of brain temperature and rectal temperature. Third,
      brain temperature can help clinicians to predict the prognosis of patients with brain trauma.
      Therefore, brain temperature monitoring is significant in postoperative intensive care and
      treatment of patients with brain trauma.
