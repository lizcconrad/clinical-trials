    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex and multifactorial autoimmune disease. The biological
      treatments that are currently available for the treatment of RA are the TNF-alpha inhibitors.
      Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a dominant cytokine in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid
      arthritis. The anti-TNFs were the first to enter the market, and they revolutionised the
      prognoses of patients with RA. They remain the most common first-line biotherapy and are the
      most used at this time.

      The French Society of Rheumatologists intends to coordinate a prospective national registry
      study for this follow-up.

      This registry will include 1500 RA patients from the start of treatment with anti-TNF-α and
      then followed for 5 years, regardless of the therapeutic modifications occurring thereafter.

      This registry is an observational, multicentre, longitudinal, prospective registry study The
      objectives of this registry is to contribute 1) to evaluate the therapeutic management of
      patients; and 2) to improve this therapeutic management.

      Design: Observational, multicentre, longitudinal, prospective registry Primary objective: To
      evaluate the real life efficacy and safety of anti-TNF inhibitors in patients with RA using a
      prospective national registry.

      Target population: Patients initiating anti-TNF therapy for RA (including infliximab,
      adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab and golimumab, and their respective biosimilar according
      to their arrival on the market) Number of patients and centres : More than 80 centers in
      France (hospital-based, public and private practice) Recruitment period: 3 years Follow-up: 5
      years
