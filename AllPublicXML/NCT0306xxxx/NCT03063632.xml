  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b work in treating
      patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and sezary syndrome that has come back or has
      not responded to previous treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Interferon gamma-1b may boost
      the immune system activity. Giving pembrolizumab and interferon gamma-1b together may work
      better in treating patients with stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides and sezary syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and interferon
      gamma-1b (IFN-G) (Actimmune) combination immunotherapy in subjects with previously treated
      mycosis fungoides (MF) or sezary syndrome (SS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and
      IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to safety and
      tolerability.

      II. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and
      IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to time to
      response (TTR).

      III. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and
      IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to duration of
      response (DOR).

      IV. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and
      IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to
      progression-free survival (PFS).

      V. To explore the safety/tolerability and clinical activity of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and
      IFN-G (Actimmune) in subjects with previously treated MF or SS with respect to event-free
      survival (EFS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the relationship between the following putative biomarkers for combination
      immunotherapy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and IFN-gamma (Actimmune) and clinical outcomes (as
      measured by safety/tolerability and ORR, DOR, PFS, EFS) in subjects with previously treated
      MF/SS, including tumor/microenvironment (PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 expression, cytotoxic T lymphocyte
      [CTL]s, regulatory T cell [Treg]s, macrophages, dendritic cell [DC]s; nanostring gene
      expression profile), systemic immune response (flow cytometry, mass cytometry [CyTOF],
      Luminex multiplexed cytokine profile), and molecular/genomic immune correlates (exome
      sequencing, high throughput sequencing [HTS] for T cell receptor [TCR]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.
      Patients also receive interferon gamma-1b subcutaneously (SC) 3 times per week for 12 weeks,
      and then follow 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off schedule for up to 2 years in the absence of
      disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are follow up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.

    <description>Clinical response (as measured by the primary and secondary endpoints) to combination immunotherapy regimen as a function of biomarkers will be evaluated. All biomarker assays will be run on the clinical trial samples in a blinded manner. Time to event endpoints (DOR, PFS, EFS) will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves generated by biomarker scoring group using the log-rank test. Exploratory outcomes will be summarized with descriptive statistics (primarily proportions and medians) for all biomarkers described above, and additionally, serum IL-10, regulatory T-cells, and activated CD8 T cells. Scatterplots and Kendall's tau estimates will be produced for estimating correlation of PD-1, PDL1, or PD-L2 expression measures and clinical outcome across compartments (skin, lymph node, blood). Comparison of tissue immunohistochemistry markers between pre-treatment and with clinical response or disease progression will be assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</description>

             [qualitative] is detected)

               -  Note: the following will not be exclusionary:

                    -  A positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e.,
                       HBsAb positive and hepatitis B virus core antibody [HBcAb] negative), or a
                       fully resolved acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection

                    -  Patients with chronic HBV suppressed by appropriate antiretroviral therapy
                       with activity against HBV, as outlined in Department of Health and Human
                       Services (DHHS) guidelines

                    -  Positive HCV serology but no detectable HCV RNA, indicative of spontaneously
                       cleared HCV infection

                    -  Patients who have been successfully treated for HCV as long as therapy for
                       HCV has been completed

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment;
             examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, seasonal flu (some), H1N1 flu, rabies,
             Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine; seasonal flu vaccines that do not
             contain live virus are permitted

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Has received prior therapy within 4 weeks with anti-CD137 or anti-cytotoxic
             T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including ipilimumab or any other
             antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways);
             has received prior alemtuzumab within 8 weeks
