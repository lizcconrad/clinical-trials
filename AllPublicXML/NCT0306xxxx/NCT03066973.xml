  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess the efficacy of breathing exercises (BE) during the second stage
      of labor for maternal pain, duration of labor and first-minute APGAR score. This is a
      randomized controlled trial that compares nulliparous pregnant in the second stage of labor
      instructed regarding BE with a control group (CG) that received standard care service. It was
      conducted at Nenehatun Obstetric and Gynecology Hospital between May-June 2016, in Erzurum.
      One session of BE training were given to pregnant in intervention group (IG). Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) was performed to identify perception of pain to all pregnant during the second
      stage of birth. Time of the second stage was recorded as second (sec), and first minute APGAR
      scores were recorded. Significance was set at p&lt;0.05.

      In this trial, it is aimed to assess the effectiveness of breathing exercises (BE) for
      management of labor pain during the second stage of labor. Nulliparous pregnant were
      randomized two arms. Intervention group received breathing exercise at the first stage of
      labor. Control group received routine care services. It was conducted at Nenehatun Obstetric
      and Gynecology Hospital between May-June 2016, in Erzurum, Turkey. Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
      was performed to identify perception of pain to all pregnant during the second stage of
      labor. Time of the second stage was recorded as second (sec), and first minute APGAR scores
      of newborn were recorded. All analysis was carried out using SPSS 20. Significance was set at
      p&lt;0.05.
