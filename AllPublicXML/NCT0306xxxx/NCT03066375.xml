      Objectives: To investigate whether respiratory variations of inferior vena cava diameters
      (cIVC) predict fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients with septic acute
      circulatory failure and irregular heartbeats.

      Design: Prospective, bicentric study, intensive care units.

      Patients and measures: Spontaneously breathing patients with sepsis and clinical signs of
      acute circulatory failure are included. A positive response to fluid loading (FL) is defined
      as an increase of the stroke volume (SV) &gt;10%. The investigators measured the minimum
      inspiratory and maximum expiratory diameters of the IVC (idIVC and edIVC) during standardized
      (st) and unstandardized (ns) breathing. The investigators calculated cIVCst and cIVCns before
      a 500ml-colloid FL.

    <description>Ultrasonographic recordings, systemic arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are recorded immediately before and after volume expansion (VE), performed as a 30-minute infusion of 500 mL of 4% gelatin. Inferior Vena Cava diameters are measured during spontaneous and standardized respiratory cycles. Stroke volume is measured during spontaneous respiratory cycles.</description>
