    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training on
      swimming performance, airway dysfunction and perceived breathlessness in elite swimmers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only a few studies have assessed the impact of Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) on swim
      performance with unclear and inconsistent results. This study aims to evaluate the effect of
      a 12-week IMT program in swimming performance, airway dysfunction and perceived
      breathlessness among elite swimmers. Participants will be recruited from the elite
      competitive Futebol Clube do Porto swimming team. After consent, individuals will be randomly
      allocated into the IMT or Sham-IMT group. A pressure threshold device will be used to perform
      the inspiratory training. The IMT group will perform 30 inspiratory efforts, 5 times a week,
      twice a day, against a pressure threshold load equivalent to 50% of maximal inspiratory
      pressure (MIP). Sham-IMT group will follow a similar protocol, except for the inspiratory
      effort that will be made against 15% of MIP. Measures of lung function, swimming performance,
      airway dysfunction, inspiratory muscle strength and perceived breathlessness will be assessed
      at the beginning and then in 4 weeks intervals until the end of study period. All outcome
      measures will be assessed by an investigator who will be not involved in the intervention
      process. Data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and respective 95%
      confidence interval. The significance level will be 5% (p˂0.05).

    <description>Inspiratory Muscle Training intervention (Sham-IMT) groups during a 3 months training season. A pressure threshold device (POWERbreathe - HaB International Ltd., UK) will be used to IMT. The IMT group will perform 30 inspiratory efforts, 5 times a week, twice daily, for 12 weeks, against a pressure threshold load equivalent to 50% of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP).</description>

    <description>Sham-IMT group will follow a similar protocol, except the inspiratory effort that will be made against 15% MIP. The duration of each IMT session will be 30 inspirations. After the initial setting of training loads, the IMT group will be instructed to periodically increase load so that only 30 maneuvers could be completed. The Sham-IMT group will not receive these instructions. All the IMT sessions, in both groups will take place before swimming training and will be supervised throughout the intervention period to ensure that technique and load will be appropriate.</description>
