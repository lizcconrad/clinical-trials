  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial aggregation is well recognized in some cancers. Though a number of familial cancer
      predisposition syndromes have been described, the nature of inherited genetic alterations in
      patients with a strong history of familial cancer is currently unknown, as is the case with
      childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      The investigators are seeking to learn more about what causes leukemia and why some people
      and families may be at a higher risk of developing this disease. By understanding the origin
      of the disease, better treatments may be identified for patients with leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To identify variants in genes that are inherited, have altered gene
      structure and/or function, and influence the risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (ALL) and other cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To collect demographic, clinical and laboratory information including
      detailed family cancer history and response of cancers to therapy for correlation with the
      primary objective.

      This study entails clinical interviews, submission of a peripheral germline blood sample for
      non-tumor DNA and permission to perform biologic studies on previously stored tumor tissue if
      applicable and available. Participants diagnosed with cancer at outside institutions will be
      requested to sign a release form to allow the outside institution to send germline and/or
      tumor tissue to St Jude if available. For patients who have undergone a stem cell transplant,
      a buccal swab or saliva sample will be requested (for germline DNA). For patients with active
      leukemia, non-tumor cells (for germline DNA) may be obtained using a remission blood sample,
      a skin biopsy (to obtain fibroblasts) or may be purified by fluorescence activated cell
      sorting of leukemia samples. The skin biopsy will be obtained in participants 18 years of age
      and older. In participants less than 18 years, the skin biopsy will be accessed only if it
      was already collected as part of another research protocol or for clinical care.

      All patients being considered for enrollment will have a clinical genetics consult by one of
      the study team members at which time a family history will be taken and information about
      genomic testing will be introduced. Detailed medical history will be obtained which includes
      but is not limited to demographics, clinical data including laboratory results, cancer
      history/diagnosis, treatment outcomes, environmental exposures and cancer risk factors to
      enable phenotype/genotype correlations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and has a relative also diagnosed with
             ALL. Note: There is no upper age limit, and the index ALL case does not have to be a
             patient diagnosed and/or treated at St. Jude.

          -  Family members of the patient, either affected or unaffected by a malignancy, who are
             contacted by the patient (or guardian) and agree to participate in the study.
             Relatives may have been diagnosed with other malignant, genetic or developmental
             disorders.

          -  Research participant or legal guardian, as appropriate, must provide informed consent
             for this protocol.
