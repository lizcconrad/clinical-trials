      This study enrolled 400 patients with type 2 diabetes in five centers in Shandong Province,
      China. Patients with type 2 diabetes who met the inclusion / exclusion criteria were randomly
      assigned to the trial group (conventional treatment + maltose app) or the control group
      (conventional treatment) in a 1: 1 ratio.

      The control group: given conventional hypoglycemic drug treatment, the treatment plan by the
      investigators according to the patient's condition may be, this study does not interfere.

      The trial group: the patients were treated with conventional hypoglycemic drugs. The
      treatment plan was decided by the researcher according to the patient's condition. The
      intervention was not done in this study.

      Interventions include:

        1. Weekly diabetes-related science articles.

        2. Patients reported hypoglycemia or other adverse reactions, the competent physician to
           deal with.

        3. Questionnaires published out the hospital (2 weeks 1), the feedback for the problem.

        4. monitoring of abnormal blood glucose data or the presence of related discomfort, can
           communicate with the competent physician online.

        5. Personalize the development of diet, exercise program.

        6. different insulin and oral hypoglycemic drug medication time to remind.

        7. hypoglycemic drug side effects query.
