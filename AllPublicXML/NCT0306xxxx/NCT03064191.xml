  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is to evaluate the influence of the calcium hydroxide / chlorhexidine combination and calcium
      hydroxide alone as an intra-canal medication in postoperative flare-up in two visits
      endodontic retreatment cases
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Problem: patient needs retreatment Intervention: calcium hydroxide chlorhexidine combination
      as an intra-canal medicament Control: calcium hydroxide alone as an intra-canal medicament
      Outcome: postoperative flare-up (pain and swelling) Time: after 7 days from 1st visit.
      population will be examined:

        1. Patients' needs retreatment.

        2. Patients in good health with no systemic disease (American Society of Anesthesiologists
           Class II)

        3. Age range is between 20 and 50 years.

        4. Patients who can understand the categorical tool (points)for measurement

        5. Patients able to sign informed consent.

    <description>postoperative pain and swelling will be measured by:Categorical (4 points). The incidence of postoperative discomfort was recorded and expressed as numbers and percentages
Subjectively into 4 points:
no pain
Mild pain: recognizable but not discomforting pain that required no analgesics.
Moderate pain: discomforting but bearable pain(analgesics if used were effective in relieving pain)
Severe pain: difficult to bear (analgesics were effective in relieving pain). Patients with severe postoperative pain and/or occurrence of swelling were classified as flare-ups.3 Objectively : percussion test</description>
