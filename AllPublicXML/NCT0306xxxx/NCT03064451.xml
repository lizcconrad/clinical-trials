  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of using CARTOFINDER™ maps
      created by the RHYTHMFINDER-192 catheter and the CARTOFINDER™ Algorithm to terminate
      persistent atrial fibrillation (PsAF) to either Normal Sinus Rhythm or Atrial Tachycardia
      compared to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in treating PsAF. The RHYTHMFINDER-192 catheter is
      investigational, while the CARTOFINDER™ system is CE marked in Europe.

      All subjects with persistent AF who are scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated ablation
      procedure for management of their persistent AF will be the target population for screening.
      The study will enroll approximately 40-70 subjects. Subjects will undergo CARTOFINDER™ guided
      ablation (CFGA) followed by PVI. Subjects will have follow-up visits at 7 days, 3, 6 and 12
      months postprocedure.
