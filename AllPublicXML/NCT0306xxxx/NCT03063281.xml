  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the
      production of multiple autoantibodies. The prevalence and significance of antibodies against
      Ficolin-2 have not been yet investigated. The aims of this study were to determine the
      prevalence of anti-ficolin-2 antibodies among SLE patients and to investigate their potential
      as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in SLE.

      This study is a secondary phase of a serum sample analysis done in early 2015 in order to
      determine the prevalence of anti-ficolin-2 antibodies among the same cohort as the previously
      declared study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02625831; Unique Protocol ID: 1841851v0).

      In this retrospective study, clinical data were obtained from medical files and blood samples
      were selected from preexisting biological collection. SLE patients (n=165) were informed and
      did not objected, they were matched to healthy controls (n=48). Disease activity was
      determined according to the SLEDAI score. Anti-ficolin-2 antibodies levels were measured in
      sera by ELISA and correlated to previously obtained Anti-ficolin-3, Anti-ficolin-2,
      anti-dsDNA and anti-C1q antibodies levels.

      The titer of anti-ficolin-2 antibodies was correlated with the SLEDAI score (p&lt;0.0001). The
      presence of anti-ficolin-2 antibodies was associated with anti-ficolin-3 antibodies, anti-C1q
      and anti-dsDNA antibodies.

      Interestingly, the combination of anti-ficolin-3, anti-ficolin-2 and anti-C1q antibodies
      demonstrated higher specificity than any other traditional biomarker.

      These results suggest that anti-ficolin-3 and anti-ficolin-2 antibodies could be useful for
      the diagnosis of active nephritis in SLE patients.

        SLE patients were studied from medical data files of the Departments of Internal Medicine
        (Grenoble University Hospital, France) and Nephrology (Conception University Hospital,
        Marseille, France). For SLE patients, clinical and biological manifestations as well as
        treatments received and disease activity evaluated using the SLE Disease Activity Index
        (SLEDAI) at the time of sampling were recorded. SLE patients were divided into subgroups as
        described in group section.
