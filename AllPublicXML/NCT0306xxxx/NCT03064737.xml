  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a relatively common pneumonia in France (1200 cases/year), 98%
      of cases are hospitalized and 40% require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Risk factors
      that may predispose to acquisition of LD are well known. Some studies suggest that genetic
      factor may also enhance susceptibility to LD.

      The mortality rate remains high (10% to 33% in ICUs) despite improved diagnostic and
      therapeutic management of patients. Few prospective studies have assessed the factors
      associated with LD outcomes, particularly death, and most of them involved a limited number
      of patients.

      In a multicentre cohort study, the investigators recently identified risk factors associated
      with higher mortality such as female sex, age, ICU stay, renal failure, corticosteroid
      treatment and enhanced pro-inflammatory status, as assessed by higher C-reactive protein
      level (PMID: 22005914). Other factors are suspected but their involvement has not been
      formally demonstrated including a high infectious bacterial load, particular virulence of
      Legionella strain, and an in vivo selection of mutants resistant to prescribed antibiotics.
      Disease progression is highly variable from one patient to another, and usually remains
      unpredictable. There are no objective criteria to predict the prognosis of these patients.

      The clinical course of patients with LD remains difficult to predict because no predictive
      biomarkers have yet been characterized and the demonstration of the presence of mutants to
      antibiotics in vivo has never been done.

      The main objective of the study is to correlate the L. pneumophila load (detected by PCR) to
      the clinical outcome of the LD infection. Clinical severity will measured by the SOFA score
      (Sepsis -Related Organ Failure Assessment) or the PELOD score (Pediatric Logistic Organ
      Dysfunction).

      Secondary objectives are to identify new host and bacterial biomarkers associated with poor
      outcome of LD.

    <description>It will be offered to a subgroup of adult patients carrying genetic markers predisposing to the severity of the LD infection, a skin biopsy in order to realize genetic analyses.
This visit will be conducted once the results of genetic markers obtained (between 30 and 36 months), a specific consent will be required to patients.
The skin biopsy will be performed according to the Clinical Department use.</description>
