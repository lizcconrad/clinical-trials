  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess peak FEV1 of two doses of QVM149 compared to a
      fixed-dose combination of salmeterol/fluticasone (50/500μg b.i.d.) and to characterize the
      respective 24 hour bronchodilator effect profiles in patients with asthma. Data from this
      study will complement lung function data obtained in the pivotal QVM149 phase 3 program by
      assessing the bronchodilatory effect of QVM149 at multiple time-points over an entire dosing
      interval of 24 hours.
