  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened at Intermountain Medical Center and at Intermountain-affiliated
      anticoagulation clinics in the Salt Lake City region. Patients with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation will be considered for study. After written informed consent is obtained,
      subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 to 2 treatment arms: Group 1:
      Dabigatran etexilate (150 mg BID if CrCL &gt; 30 mL/min, or 75 mg BID if CrCL &gt; 15 to 30 mL/min
      or per USPI; and Group 2: Warfarin (Dose-adjusted (INR 2.0 - 3.0). Assessment of kidney
      function every 6 months will be done for Group 1. Standard warfarin follow-up and education,
      based upon system criteria, will be done for Group 2. All subjects will be followed for 24
      months, and will be assessed at 1-week, then 3-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months
      post-anticoagulation visits as well as other visits deem necessary for clinical care. All
      subjects will undergo protocol-specified laboratory tests and will complete 6 standard,
      validated questionnaires at each follow-up visit following the week 1 visit, except at the
      3-month visit when only one questionnaire will be administered. To determine brain volume and
      characteristic changes representative of micro-bleeding, the first 10 subjects in each
      treatment group who are willing and able to undergo the procedure will participate in a MRI
      sub-study. The cranial MRI will be done at baseline and at 24-months post-anticoagulation on
      this sub-group.

    <measure>Moderate decline in cognitive function based on results of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale and the Disability Assessment for Dementia.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determined by measuring the change from baseline to study conclusion on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11, with scores ranging from 0 to 70, and higher scores indicating greater impairment) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicating less impairment). An increase in ADAS-cog11 of &gt;30% is considered significant for moderate cognitive decline. In subjects that score &lt;50% on the DAD, there is a direct correlation with global deterioration scales and scores. Subjects with a 30% decrease in DAD score or those with a score &lt;50% will be considered to have moderate cognitive decline. These scores will be aggregated and if a patient meets either one of the cognitive decline definitions they will be deemed positive for cognitive impairment.</description>

             monitor, or telemetry within 12 months of enrollment.

             risk to the subject and/or compromise the quality of the clinical trial.

         12. Concurrent pharmacologic treatment that is required to treat a condition long-term in
             which concurrent use of dabigatran etexilate is contraindicated.

                  are not considered anticoagulant drugs.

               -  If the subject has received any anticoagulant drug for stroke prevention for less
