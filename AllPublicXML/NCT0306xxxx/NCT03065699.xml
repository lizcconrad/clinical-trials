      The First-In-Man study is a multi-centre, randomised, controlled, study to generate data for
      the evaluation of safety and performance of DIALIVE Liver Dialysis Device in 24 evaluable
      patients with Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) versus standard of care (SOC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The First-In-Man study will evaluate the safety and performance of DIALIVE Liver Dialysis
      Device in Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) patients and will compare the outcome with
      patients treated under standard of care (SOC).

      The hypothesis is that DIALIVE will significantly improve the prognosis of ACLF patients by
      modulating systemic inflammation.

      The target patient population are men and women ≥18 years, ≤81yr. Patients with ACLF grade 1
      and ACLF grade 2 on the background of alcoholic cirrhosis. Treatment will be undertaken in an
      intensive care (ICU) or renal dialysis unit setting if the patients are randomised to the
      DIALIVE treatment arm. For patients randomised to the 'Standard of care' arm, the location of
      treatment (ICU or general ward) will be determined by their clinical need and will be decided
      by the site Principal Investigator.

      This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and
      innovation programme under grant agreement No 733057.
