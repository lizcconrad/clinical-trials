  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if daratumumab can help to control acute
      myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that is refractory
      (does not respond to treatment) or relapsed (comes back after being treated).

      The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Daratumumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). It is considered investigational to use it as treatment
      for AML or MDS.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days (4 weeks).

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive daratumumab by
      vein on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 and 2, on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 3-6, and then on
      Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond for up to 1 year or unless the disease stops responding to
      treatment, whichever is earlier.

      Your first dose will be given over about 6½ hours and the second dose over about 4 hours.
      After that, each infusion should take about 3 hours and 15 minutes.

      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion
      related reaction:

        -  You will get medications, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before
           the infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get medications, including
           inhaled steroids, after the infusion.

        -  The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction.

        -  You may stay overnight in the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check
           your health.

      You may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications you will
      receive to lower your chance of an infusion-related reaction, including how they are
      administered and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 1 year. You will no longer be able to take
      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test
      within 24 hours before your first dose of daratumumab.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a physical exam at any of your study visits.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 2 (+/- 2 days), you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the
           status of the disease.

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3-6:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 3, you will have an EKG.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond (+/- 2 days), you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to
      check the status of the disease. You will continue to have these tests until you have a
      response to the study drug. The study doctor will decide if you will have this test.

      On Day 15 of Cycles 3-6, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 7 only, you will have an EKG.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 28-35 days after your last dose of daratumumab:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      The study staff will call you to ask how you are doing 1 time each month for the first year
      after your end-of-treatment visit, then every 6 months during the second year, and then 1
      time every year after that. Each call should last about 5 minutes.

      If the disease has responded to treatment and the disease does not come back, blood (about 2
      teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1 time each month for the first 2 years after the
      end-of-treatment visit. You may have additional follow-up visits as part of your routine
      care. This will be discussed with you.
