  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of breast cancer at any given time can be through surgery, as well as adjuvant
      treatments (radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy) alone or together. And with this
      the patient tends to lose weight, he becomes depressed, resulting in an increasingly
      debilitating picture. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the relationship
      between physical exercise and its effects on quality of life in patients with breast cancer,
      those who underwent surgery for at least 6 months, patients who are still with the Tumor
      using the adjuvant treatments submitted to physical exercises and not submitted. The sample
      will consist of 25 to 50 female patients aged 18 to 75 years. Patients will be submitted to
      the initial quality of life evaluation (SF - 36 reduced version, Anxiety and depression (HAD
      Scale), Fatigue (Piper Fatigue Scale), Pain (Brief Inventory of Pain), Body Composition
      (Bioimpedance BYODINAMICS 450 ) And oxidative stress markers (oxidized and reduced
      glutathione, TBARS / MDA, Myeloperoxidase and Creatinine), inflammatory markers (IL1, IL6,
      IL8, IL10, MCP-1 and TNF-α), hormones Estrogen, progesterone), blood test (complete blood
      count) 24 hour food recall (24hs food recall), and perform the maximum repetition test to
      find the initial workload that will be adjusted every 4 weeks with the evaluation of the load
      and Completing the 12 weeks of training will be reevaluated following the initial evaluation.
      The data collected will be treated statistically with an α=5% using the software Stata 12.0.

      The patients will be allocated into two groups: exercise group (intervention) and
      conventional treatment group (active comparison). Intervention: The combined training program
      consisted of 12-week aerobic, resistive and flexibility exercises, with 3 sessions per week
      of aerobic and resistive training in the same session (supervised by physical exercise
      coaches) and 2 sessions per week of Flexibility training (unsupervised). As stretching
      sessions were interspersed with sessions of aerobic and weathered training in the daytime
      period.
