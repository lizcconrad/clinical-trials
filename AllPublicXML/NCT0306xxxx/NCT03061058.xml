  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels may have a promising role as
      potential predictive biomarkers for chemotherapy.

      Peritoneal carcinomatosis appears to be the most common pattern of metastasis or recurrence
      and is associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy is widely accepted strategy in the treatment of peritoneal dissemination.

      In this study, our aim is to evaluate the impact of individualized selection of
      chemotherapeutics and intraperitoneal combined with system chemotherapy on overall survival,
      disease free survival, response rate, and safety of advanced gastric cancer patients.

    <description>mRNA levels of BRCA1, topoisomerase I (TOPO1), and thymidylate synthase (TS) were assessed in tumor tissue. Chemotherapeutic agents were selected based on the mRNA levels.
Patients with high level BRCA1 will receive intraperitoneal docetaxel (15mg/m^2, d1, d15, q4w), intravenous docetaxel (30mg/m^2, d1, d15, q4w), and oral S-1 (40mg/m^2, d1-14, q4w).
Patients with low level BRCA1 will receive intraperitoneal cisplatin (25mg/m^2, d1, d15, q4w), intravenous oxaliplatin (75mg/m^2, d1, d15, q4w), and oral S-1 (40mg/m^2, d1-14, q4w).
Patients with middle level BRCA1 and high level TOPO1 will receive intraperitoneal irinotecan (45mg/m^2, d1, d15, q4w), intravenous docetaxel (90mg/m^2, d1, d15, q4w), and oral S-1 (40mg/m^2, d1-14, q4w).
Patients with middle level BRCA1, low or middle level TOPO1, and low level TS will receive intraperitoneal pemetrexed (150mg/m^2, d1, q3w), and intravenous pemetrexed (350mg/m^2, d1, q3w).</description>
