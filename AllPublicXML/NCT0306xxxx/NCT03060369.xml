  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to examine the relationship between continuously measured CareGuide™
      muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2), tissue pH and data provided from standard monitoring
      techniques during the care of subjects with suspected established (Cohort A) or emerging
      (Cohort B) shock in the intensive care unit (ICU).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50 subjects meeting recruitment criteria will be enrolled with a minimum of 20
      subjects meeting entry criteria for established shock (Cohort A).

      Noninvasive near-infrared spectroscopy CareGuide™ measurements of SmO2, tissue pH and
      hematocrit will be collected from enrollment through device removal. These data will be
      compared to specific hemodynamic and laboratory parameters obtained as a part of routine care
      during the CareGuide™ monitoring period.
