  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well comic art creation works as supportive care in
      cancer patients and caregivers. Participating in a comic art creation workshop may help
      patients and their family members or friends share their medical experience through
      storytelling and drawings in a way that can, but does not have to, reflect the real world. It
      may also help improve emotional wellbeing and communication in cancer patients and
      caregivers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of using a 10 week comic art creation workshops for
      supportive care.

      II. To determine the feasibility of studying comic art creation workshops for supportive
      care.

      III. To describe those factors affecting the ability or inability of participants to engage
      in the workshop.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe changes in emotional wellbeing and communication of patients and
      caretakers/family/friends.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify the methods that most engage supportive care patients and caretakers.

      II. Identify the social and cultural interactions most impacted by comics creation.

      III. To describe participant feedback regarding the intervention and study design.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and a family member, caretaker or friend participate in an artist-led comic art
      therapy workshop over 2 hours once a week for 10 weeks. Patients and participants receive a
      range of assignments that focus on creative art and experimentation with materials and
      storytelling in order to make a series of small handmade books that relate directly or
      indirectly to their experience with cancer. Patients undergo a qualitative interview over
      approximately 45 minutes within 4 weeks prior to the workshop and midway through the workshop
      and complete validated questionnaires within 10 days after the end of the interview.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 1 and 6 weeks.

    <measure>Feasibility of the comic art creation workshop defined as participant completion and psychosocial value of the comic art</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The project will be considered feasible if most of the participants complete the study and consider the comic art to have personal meaning, and if an initial power calculation indicates that a sufficiently powered randomized controlled trial is possible given the resources of the study team. It is anticipated that the psychosocial value of the art will be largely derived from the internal creation process and further assessment of the artistic products will not be conducted.</description>
