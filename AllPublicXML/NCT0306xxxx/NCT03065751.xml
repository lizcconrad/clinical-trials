  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is defined by the occurrence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in
      the context of infection. Unfortunately, its incidence appears to be rising, and the
      mortality of septic shock remains extraordinary high (&gt; 60%). Death in sepsis arises from
      shock and multi organ dysfunction that are - at least in part - triggered by an inadequate
      response of the host's immune system to the infection. Given the injurious role of 1) this
      overwhelming immune response and 2) the consumption of protective plasmatic factors (e.g. vWF
      cleaving proteases, hemostatic factors etc.) while the disease is progressing the
      investigators hypothesize that early therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in the most severely
      ill individuals might improve hemodynamics, oxygenation and ultimately survival. This
      therapeutic strategy combines 2 major aspects in 1 procedure: 1. removal of harmful
      circulating molecules and 2. replacement of protective plasma proteins. The investigators
      designed the EXCHANGE trial to analyze in a randomized fashion the benefit of TPE as an
      add-on treatment to state of the art standard sepsis care. Only patients with early septic
      shock (&lt; 12 hrs) and high catecholamine doses (noradrenaline &gt; 0.4 ug/kg bodyweight/min) will
      be included. Those in the treatment group will receive 3 TPEs within three consecutive days.
      The primary outcome is 28-day all cause mortality. To show an assumed reduction from 60% to
      45% in the experimental group, a sample size of 173 patients per group has been calculated.
      The overall sample size is therefore n=346. The recruitment period is 3 years (+3 months
      observation) and will be performed in 11 national centers in Germany. Secondary endpoints
      (including hemodynamics, oxygenation, coagulation, and microcirculation) will be assessed on
      day 1, 2, 3 before and after TPE and on day 4, 5, 7 and 14.

      Project management and data monitoring will be organized by the Hanover Clinical Trial Center
      and biostatistics including a web-based randomization will be performed by the Institute of
      biometrics (Prof. Koch) at Hannover Medical School.

      The investigators hope to demonstrate a potential benefit of an additive treatment approach
      to improve the outcome of patients suffering from an under-recognized but deadly disease.
