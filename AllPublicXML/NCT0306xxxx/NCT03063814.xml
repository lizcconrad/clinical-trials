  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate neuromuscular characteristics
      observed during a single bout of selected and validated injury preventive exercises
      instructed by an app (in accordance with 'Get set - Train smarter') versus gold standard
      instruction, supervision and feedback provided on-site by an expert. The present evaluation
      targets a population of female football and handball players without any previous exposure to
      injury prevention training.

    <description>In the APP group, a video sequence of each exercise, supported by short written descriptions (in accordance to 'Get set - Train smarter', (9) on how to perform the exercise correctly, was shown to the participants on an iPad. The video-recorded exercises were performed by the same physiotherapist who supervised PHY participants. If required, the participants in the APP group were allowed to watch the video and description several times between trials of the same exercise. The participants approved their own trials when they believed that the exercises had been performed as described.</description>

    <description>In PHY, a physiotherapist demonstrated and explained the focus areas of each of the five exercises before the participant performed the exercises. If needed, verbal feedback was given between trials to correct the performance of the exercise. The physiotherapist approved trials that were performed with proper technique.</description>
