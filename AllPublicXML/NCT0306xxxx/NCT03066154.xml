  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment for HRPC patients has not yet been established. Recent trials suggest a
      benefit from early treatment with docetaxel in the castration-sensitive setting, with an
      improvement in failure free survival in high risk and metastatic patients and increase in
      overall survival in the metastatic hormone-sensitive group. In these recent randomized
      controlled trials, patients were treated with hormonal therapy and radiotherapy and adjuvant
      docetaxel, assuming that early systemic treatment for high risk or metastatic disease could
      delay progression in patients with aggressive primary tumor characteristics.

      With the fact that docetaxel is a known radiosensitizer, combined modality treatment with
      docetaxel during the radiotherapy could also lead to better local control and reduction of
      local recurrence. Several phase I and II studies have been done in HRPC patients, to evaluate
      the combination of high dose radiotherapy and concurrent weekly infusions with docetaxel.

      Oral administration of docetaxel has many advantages above intravenously administered drugs
      for patients. Besides the higher patient convenience, possibly longer treatment duration can
      be achieved due to better safety. Frequently occurring toxicities of intravenously
      administered docetaxel, such as neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral
      polyneuropathy have rarely been observed with the oral docetaxel formulation ModraDoc006/r.

      The primary aim of the N15DOP study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of
      ModraDoc006/r when given in a weekly bidaily schedule in combined modality with high dose
      intensity radiotherapy and hormonal therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients
      with high risk disease, including positive lymph nodes.

      Phase IA part This is an open-label, dose-escalating, non-randomized, single centre phase I
      study of ModraDoc006/r combined with ADT and radiotherapy in patients with high risk prostate
      cancer, as defined by node positive prostate cancer with all of the following primary tumor
      characteristics: stage ≥cT2c, Gleason score ≥ 4+3, any PSA level.

      Phase IB part After determination of the MTD of ModraDoc006/r in the combined treatment with
      radiotherapy and hormonal therapy and good tolerability of the treatment without unexpected
      adverse events during the radiotherapy until 6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, the study
      will be further conducted to the phase IB part. This part will explore the feasibility and
      tolerability of long term treatment with ModraDoc006/r.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven prostate cancer.

          2. All eligible patients have hormone naïve non-metastatic node positive high risk
             prostate cancer. Node positive cancer will be defined as radiological demonstration of
             more than four pelvic lymph node(s) consisting of bean shaped lymph node(s) with a
             short axis of minimal 10 mm and/or round lymph node(s) with a minimal size of 8 mm on
             PSMA, MRI or CT scan.

             PSMA-scans or PET-Choline scans may be used, but are not obligated. Since the use of
             the PSMA scan is significantly increased in current clinical practice and the chance
             of false positive results is considered very low in patients with more than 4 positive
             lymph nodes, histological confirmation of positive lymph nodes is not required for
             inclusion if more than 4 pathological nodes are seen with the PSMA, MRI or CT scan

          3. High risk prostate cancer will be defined as node positive with all of the following
