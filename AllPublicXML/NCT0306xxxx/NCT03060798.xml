  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia can affect tissue oxygen saturation and microcirculatory reactivity.
      However, the differences in microcirculation caused by anesthetic methods have not been well
      studied. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures peripheral tissue oxygen saturation
      noninvasively and can be used in conjunction with vascular occlusion (VOT) experiments. The
      purpose of this study was to examine the changes in NIRS derived tissue oxygen saturation
      (StO2) and microcirculatory reactivity by VOT after inhalation anesthesia in healthy
      population.

      This prospective, observational study will be performed on 57 healthy patients who had
      undergone elective surgery under volatile general anesthesia. The investigators measure StO2
      and microvascular reactivity using NIRS combined with vascular occlusion test (VOT). The
      parameters were performed twice per patient, before and after the induction of anesthesia.

      Occlusion slope and recovery slope during VOT will be compared before and after anesthesia.
      Moreover, the changes depend on the age will be analyzed.

      This prospective observational study was performed on 61 patients without comorbidities who
      underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia. Before and after the induction of
      anesthesia, StO2 monitoring and VOT were performed to investigate the effect of anesthesia on
      microcirculation. To investigate the effect of age on microcirculation, the patients were
      divided into two different groups, young (&lt; 65 yrs) and old (&gt; 65 yrs) groups, and the
      VOT-derived parameters and hemodynamics between two groups were compared.

    <measure>Changes in Tissue Oxygen Saturation after General Anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>before and 30 minutes after anesthetic induction</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular occlusion test (VOT) will be performed twice for each patient, before (T0) and 30 min after the induction of general anesthesia (T1). Before induction, a NIRS sensor will be placed on the thenar eminence and an automated tourniquet will be placed around the ipsilateral upper arm. After the baseline StO2 stabilization, the automatic tourniquet will be inflated to 50 mmHg over the patient's baseline systolic blood pressure and maintain for 5 min. After the 5-min ischemic period, the tourniquet will be rapidly deflated to 0 mmHg. StO2 data will be continuously recorded during the VOT procedure. Baseline StO2, minimum StO2 during the 5-min inflation of the tourniquet, maximum StO2 during deflation of the tourniquet, time to minimum StO2, and time to maximum StO2 will be obtained. The occlusion slope and recovery slope will be calculated based on the measured StO2 data.</description>

    <description>Patients will be divided into three groups by age (younger group: &lt; 40 years old; middle group: 40-60 yrs; older group: â‰¥ 60 years old) to perform age-based analysis. The acquired StO2 data by the VOT test among the groups will be analyzed and compared.</description>
