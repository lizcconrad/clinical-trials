    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosis with inoperable gastric cancers are treated with palliative chemotherapy.

      Palliative chemotherapy had proven to be better overall survivals and quality of life in
      unresectable advanced gastric cancer. NCCN guideline suggested two or three drug cytotoxic
      regimen as a first line therapy. But response rate of those regimens is about 50 percent.
      Disappointingly most of cases are about to experience progression of disease.

      Second line regimens of palliative chemotherapy are also have shown its efficacy and
      recommended within patients with better performance status. But There is still lack of
      evidences in gastric cancer patients second line chemotherapy. Several phase II trial those
      subjects are 2nd line palliative chemotherapy in gastric cancer had suggested that
      irinotecan, taxane, oxaliplatin, oral fluorouracil.Investigator assessed whether cisplatin in
      combination with paclitaxel would increase response rate in patient previously treated for
      advanced gastric cancer compared with FOFIRI regimen.
