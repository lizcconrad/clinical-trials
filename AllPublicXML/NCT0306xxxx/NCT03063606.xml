  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy as a specialist
      treatment for binge eating disorder (BED) in patients with obesity. This is a controlled test
      of whether, amongst non-responders to acute treatments, cognitive-behavioral therapy augments
      on-going blinded pharmacotherapy (either naltrexone/bupropion or placebo), compared with no
      additional behavioral treatment .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder, is associated
      strongly with obesity and bio-psychosocial impairment. Improved treatments for patients with
      obesity and BED are needed that can produce sustained clinical outcomes and promote weight
      loss. This study (specialist treatment) RCT will provide new and novel findings from a
      controlled test, amongst non-responders to acute treatments, whether cognitive-behavioral
      therapy augments on-going blinded pharmacotherapy (naltrexone/bupropion or placebo) compared
      with on-going pharmacotherapy alone (without added cognitive-behavioral therapy).

    <description>CBT is a &quot;specialist&quot; focal treatment with three overlapping phases. (1) Establishing a collaborative therapeutic relationship while focusing on educating patients about the nature of binge eating and factors thought to maintain the problem. Specific behavioral strategies (e.g., self-monitoring) are used to help patients identify problematic eating behaviors while establishing a normal structured eating pattern. (2) Integrating cognitive restructuring procedures, focusing on helping patients learn to identify and challenge maladaptive cognitions regarding eating and weight/shape and thoughts that trigger binge eating. (3) Maintaining change and preventing relapse.</description>
