  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of BI-CON-02 in patients with
      HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with trastuzumab The clinical
      trial protocol for BI-CON-02 prescribes a start dose of 0,3 mg/kg. After the Data and Safety
      Monitoring Committee evaluates the data of tolerability and safety of BI-CON-02, received
      during 3 weeks of investigational product therapy (Week 3, Day 1) and approves, extra doses
      can be used.

      Once the safety of investigational product is confirmed, the dose will be increased in the
      subsequent cohorts. Planned doses - 0,3 mg/kg; 0,6 mg/kg; 1,2 mg/kg; 2,4 mg/kg; 3,6 mg/kg and
      4,8 mg/kg.
