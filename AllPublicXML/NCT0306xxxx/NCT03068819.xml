  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) following salvage chemotherapy is the one of the most widely
      used treatment approaches in patients who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplant (allo-HCT). However, the complete remission (CR) rates and long term survival
      remain very poor in these patients and, therefore, there is an unmet need to develop more
      effective treatment approaches in patients who relapse after allo-HCT.

      Based on the initial promising results with our ongoing cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML)
      natural killer (NK) cell trial, the investigators hypothesize that combining the CIML NK
      cells with DLI approach will significantly enhance the graft versus leukemia and therefore
      potentially provide potentially curative therapy for these patients with otherwise extremely
      poor prognosis. Combining CIML NK cells with the DLI platform will also potentially allow
      these adoptively transferred cells to persist for longer duration as they should not be
      rejected by donor T cells as the CIML NK cells are derived from the same donor. The use of
      CIML NK cells is unlikely to lead to excessive graft versus host disease (GVHD) as previous
      studies have not been associated with excessive GVHD rates.
