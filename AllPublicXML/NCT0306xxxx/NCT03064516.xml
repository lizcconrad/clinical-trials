      Objective: To evaluate the immediate and mediate outcomes of endocrowns and onlay ceramic
      restorations with glass fiber pin in endodontically treated teeth. Material and methods: A
      randomized controlled clinical trial, a double-blind (patient and examiner) is conducted by
      two trained and calibrated operators who perform all restorative procedures. The restorations
      are evaluated longitudinally by a blind and calibrated examiner using the USPHS. A total of
      34 patients will be randomly assigned to each group for a total of 68 patients. The
      randomization sequence will be generated (www.sealedenvelope.com) and to ensure the
      confidentiality of the allocation, this will be used opaque, sealed and numbered envelopes in
      series. These will be kept with an independent researcher for the moment of inclusion of the
      subjects. In the group of onlays, the teeth receive a fiberglass pin in the main root canal
      and composite resin filling. In the group of endocrown, only the restoration fill the pulp
      chamber. The parts are milled in IPS e-max CAD (Ivoclar Vivadent) and cemented with the
      Multilink cementation system (Ivoclar Vivadent). The immediate clinical (focused in
      restoration and patient) and mediate (radiographic and clinical) outcomes will be compared
      between the groups. Survival and success rates will be defined in 6, 12 and 24 months.
      Survival will be established by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank can be conducted to
      identify as variables associated with as failures over time. Multivariate analysis with the
      Cox regression models will be condutcted for the determination of failure predictors. For all
      analyzes, the significance value will be adjusted to 5%.
