  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast reconstruction after mastectomy has been shown to provide psychosocial benefits to
      breast cancer patients and is considered an integral part of breast cancer treatment. In
      general, breast reconstruction can be accomplished using the patients own tissues or
      implantable prosthetic devices. Various acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) are offered on the
      market and the costs vary widely despite very similar qualities. The two most commonly used
      ADM products in North America by far are Dermacell and Alloderm. The difference between the
      two products include a) level of sterility, with Dermacell being sterilized to 10-9 while
      Alloderm is sterilized to 10-6 and b) the consistency and thickness of the biologic material
      and c) a significant different in cost ($2200 CAD vs $3600, respectively). Each product has
      shown to be safe and effective. As such, clinical equipoise exists. This will be a pragmatic
      trial to evaluate Dermacell with Alloderm in a head to head randomized fashion, with regards
      to the postoperative complications, namely infection, seroma formation (as measured by drain
      duration and output), loss of implant, incidence of revisional surgery and capsular
      contracture.
