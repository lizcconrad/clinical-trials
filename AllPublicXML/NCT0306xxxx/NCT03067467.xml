  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, purely observational, feasibility study to detect metabolic changes
      in patients with brain malignancy using a novel hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRSI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to test the hypothesis that patients with brain malignancy
      present altered [1-13C]lactate and 13C-bicarbonate production from infused hyperpolarized
      [1-13C]pyruvate in tumor as compared to in normal-appearing brain regions. To achieve this
      aim investigators will assess metabolic phenotype in cancer patients with brain tumors (n =
      8) and in healthy control subjects (n = 8). Total target enrollment will be set at 25
      subjects to allow for attrition and screen failures.

      During each imaging session, following localization of the tumor in brain, tissue
      characteristics and morphological changes will be evaluated with 1H MRI. Then, cerebral
      metabolism will be assessed utilizing 13C MRSI after an intravenous injection with
      hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate. Finally, contrast-enhanced 1H MRI will be acquired. The study
      agent, hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate, will be administered under a Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND), which was approved on 1/3/2017 (IND#
      133229).

      Preliminary data in human are essential to secure larger scale funding required for clinical
      studies. The investigators believe the ability to measure such metabolic shifts in vivo could
      have major significance in assessing the efficacy of multiple anti-tumor therapies currently
      under development that target reversing the Warburg effect as a means of controlling tumor
      growth. Brain tumor applications at the Advanced Imaging Research Center, Harold C. Simmons
      Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Neuro-Oncology Program of the Development of Neurological
      Surgery at the UT Southwestern Medical Center offer today a unique opportunity to lead
      globally the translational scientific efforts in this field.
