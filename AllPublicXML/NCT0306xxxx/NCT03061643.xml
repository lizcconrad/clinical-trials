      Study of Biweekly Docetaxel plus Androgen-Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in Patients with
      Previously-Untreated, Metastatic, Prostatic Adenocarcinoma

      Although surgical or medical castration is considered standard treatment in hormone-naïve PC
      patients, some patients with extensive metastatic disease, including visceral or bone
      involvement beyond axial skeleton, have shorter survival. Based on the recent randomized
      trials (CHAARTED, GETUG-AFU15 and STAMPEDE), hormone-naïve men with metastatic, high-volume
      PC should be offered docetaxel plus ADT. However, side effects from standard 3-weekly 75
      mg/m2 docetaxel can be substantial. In addition, a prospective trial is needed to determine
      whether early docetaxel chemotherapy in combination with ADT is beneficial in Korean men.
      Considering our own experiences with docetaxel, a dose intensity of 20 mg/m2/week (equivalent
      to 60 mg/m2 3-weekly or 40 mg/m2 biweekly) should be tested in the prospective trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a male at least 20 years of age.

          2. Subject has a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of
             prostate.

          3. Subject has radiologic and clinical evidence of metastatic disease initially or after
             treatment for localized disease. They must have metastatic or progressive disease for
             which there is no further curative treatment available.

          4. Subject has an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1.

          5. Subject has a life expectancy of 3 months or more.

          6. At least 4 weeks since the last surgical procedures or radiotherapy prior to
             enrolment. Subjects must have recovered to &lt;Grade 2 from all acute toxicities or
             toxicity must be deemed irreversible by the investigator.

          7. Acceptable hematologic status (without growth factor support or transfusion
             dependency):

          8. Acceptable renal function with serum creatinine

          9. Acceptable liver function:

         10. Subject must agree to use an adequate method of contraception (condom) if he is having
             sex with a woman of childbearing potential or with a woman who is pregnant.

         11. Written and voluntary informed consent understood, signed and dated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing treatment with an anticancer agent not contemplated in this protocol

          2. Pathologic finding consistent with neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma

          3. Any history of clinically relevant coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction
             within the last 3 years, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade III or greater
             congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular attack within the prior year, or current
             serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication except atrial fibrillation.

          4. Non-tolerable &gt;Grade 2 neuropathy or evidence of unstable neurological symptoms within
             4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1

          5. Known uncontrolled brain, leptomeningeal or epidural metastases (unless treated and
             well controlled for at least 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1). Subjects that develop
             brain metastasis during the study may have their treatment interrupted to receive a
             course of cranial radiation and restart trial medication after a recovery period of at
             least 1 week. High dose corticosteroids may be employed for the management of cranial
             radiation but must be tapered off before resuming treatment.

          6. Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1,
             without complete recovery.

          7. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic
             therapy.

          8. Subjects who have exhibited allergic reactions to taxanes.

          9. Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the study,
             or that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the
             subject in this study.

         10. The subject has legal incapacity or limited legal capacity. Dementia or significantly
             altered mental status that would limit the understanding or rendering of informed
             consent and compliance with the requirements of this protocol. Unwillingness or
             inability to comply with the study protocol for any reason.
