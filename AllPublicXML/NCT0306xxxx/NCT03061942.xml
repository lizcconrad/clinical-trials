  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant-Murley score</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function.</description>

    <measure>The average pain VAS(visual analogue scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The average pain VAS(visual analogue scale) is the mean of the pain VAS at rest, at night, and with movement.</description>

    <description>30 subjects will undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with synovectomy. Synovectomy is an operation performed to remove inflamed synovial membrane of a joint. Arthroscopic synovectomy will be performed with the use of a shaver and a cautery device through the portals for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.</description>
