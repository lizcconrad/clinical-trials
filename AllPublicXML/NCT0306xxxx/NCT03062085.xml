    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term visual outcome of the cataract surgery
      using a large-scale and comprehensive database of high myopic cataract and age-related
      cataract patients. The investigators will further investigate into the various genetic and
      environmental factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of high myopic cataract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High myopic cataract (HMC) has become a major high-risky type of cataract in China, which
      accounts for nearly 30% of cataract in recent years. Compared to age-related cataract, HMC is
      characterized with earlier onset, severer lens opacities, higher incidence of
      vitreoretinopathy and postoperative complications compared to age-related cataract(ARC).

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term visual outcome of the cataract
      surgery using a large-scale and comprehensive database of high myopic cataract, when compared
      to those age-matched ARC patients.

      On the other hand, due to the lack of research in the pathogenesis of HMC, it is difficult
      for the investigators to precisely evaluate its risk and prognosis, and to improve its
      prevention and treatment. The previous study of investigators majored in a large-sample
      analysis on the clinical features and related genes of HMC. After preliminary screening,
      eight genes were selected for further investigation: 1) genes related to pathogenesis of HMC:
      CRYAA/ GSTP1/ TXNRD2;2) genes related to vitreoretinopathy: MCP1/ VEGFA/ CFH; 3) genes
      related to postoperative complications: TGFB2/ CERS2. In the present study, in order to
      establish a risk model of HMC from the aspect of precision medicine, the investigators are
      preparing to set up a comprehensive clinical database for further sequencing of selected
      genes (including exons, promoters, 5' UTR and 3' UTR sequences) on a large scale, to
      intensively investigate into the sites and functions of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
      correlated with clinical features of HMC.

      The research aim to evaluate the long-term visual outcome of the cataract surgery using a
      large-scale and comprehensive database of high myopic cataract, to thoroughly illustrate the
      influence of HMC-related genes to its prognosis and to elucidate the pathogenesis of HMC, for
      further promotion in the disease prevention and prognosis as well.
