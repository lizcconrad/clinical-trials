  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most youth with MS experience symptoms such as depression and fatigue. In addition, cognitive
      issues, especially with attention and memory occur frequently. However, little is known about
      interventions that might work to improve these symptoms. In other work, the investigators
      have shown that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of
      depression and fatigue. Importantly, sleep problems are frequently encountered in youth with
      MS, and were seen in 60% of surveyed youth with MS in the investigators preliminary work.
      Modifiable lifestyle factors such as sleep and physical activity (PA) may play a key role in
      ameliorating common symptoms in pediatric MS. However, sleep has not been objectively
      described in pediatric MS, and the relationship between PA and sleep is poorly understood.
      This study aims to address these gaps.
