  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to describe the differential immunologic responses of patients who
      undergo in situ IRE, margin accentuation IRE with surgical resection of the primary tumor,
      and surgical resection of the primary tumor only. The primary hypothesis is that IRE induces
      a long and sustained activation of the cell-mediated immune system, which is distinct from
      the immune response after surgical resection only. The primary endpoint of this study is the
      comparison of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio as an indicator of antitumor immunity both longitudinally
      within a group after the intervention and over time between the three groups. CD4+/CD8+ ratio
      will be measured preoperatively and at postoperative days 1, 7, 42, and 180. As a secondary
      outcome, additional measurements will be taken to more specifically characterize the immune
      response based on peripheral blood samples. Flow cytometry will be used to quantify cell
      subsets (CD3+, CD62L+, NK cells, dendritic cells, Th1/Th2 ratio, and Foxp3+ Tregs), and ELISA
      will be used to measure cytokine levels (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNFalpha, IFN-gamma,
      VEGF, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, sIL-2R, and HSP70), at the same time-points as for the primary
      outcome. Each group of patients as described above will consist of 10 consecutive pancreatic
      cancer patients. Patients aged 18 or older with resectable, borderline resectable, or locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer will be included. Patients with locally advanced disease will
      undergo 3 months of preoperative chemotherapy with monitoring to exclude metastatic disease.
      Main exclusion criteria are cardiac conduction abnormalities and signs of distant metastasis.
