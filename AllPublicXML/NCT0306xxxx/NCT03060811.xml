  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a small organic compound naturally present in fish and
      seefood or generated by the bacterial breakdown of dietary phosphatidylcholine and
      carnitine-containing foods within the human gut microbiome. Elevated serum TMAO was
      previously reported to be associated with an elevated risk for cardiovascular events.

      Aim of this study was to investigate the association between plasma levels of TMAO with the
      Mediterranean diet in a cohort of healthy adults.

        Healthy subjects (n=84) aged 21-50 years with a BMI of 20-29.9 kg/m2, chosen among hospital
        volunteers and employees from the same geographical area. A sample size of n=40 was
        determined from a power analysis of a within-subject design to detect a 10% difference of
        plasma TMAO concentration at alfa&lt;0.05 and β =0.8. Participants were screened by the use of
        a blood chemistry profile, cell count, and health history questionnaire.
