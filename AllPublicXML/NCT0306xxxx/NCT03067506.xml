  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibility and compliance with a novel method for
      assessing mood and cognition in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel method being tested in this study for assessing mood and cognition in participants
      with MDD is wearable technology. This study will look at the correlation of mood and
      cognition outcomes on wearable technology with traditional objective neuropsychological
      cognitive function tests and self-reported mood outcomes.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will be provided with a watch
      on which brief cognitive and mood tests will be evaluated daily up to 6 weeks.

      All participants will be prompted to complete cognitive and mood assessments on 3 occasions
      across the day. Two occasions (morning and afternoon) will comprise assessment of cognition,
      and the final assessment in the evening will constitute a review of the day focusing on
      self-reported depressed mood.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate
      in this study is 6 weeks. Participants will take part in up to 5 study visits (1 in-person
      on-site visit, 3 web-based and 1 at home visit) assessing performance on traditional
      objective neuropsychological cognitive function tests and self-reported measures of
      depression symptom severity and social function.

    <measure>Correlations Between Measures of Cognition on the Wearable Technology (n-Back d') and Performance on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The n-back measures cognition where n=1 or 2. In 2-back test, participants respond when symbol is same as presented 2 earlier. In 2-back, latency and d' measure accuracy=ratio hits (correct detection) and false alarms. A +ve change from baseline=improvement. CANTAB test consists of battery of neuropsychological tests, involving distinct cognitive domains: 1) emotion recognition task to measure accuracy of answers. Higher scores is better.2) Spatial working memory assesses retention of spatial data, ability to manipulate remembered items and strategize. The participant is asked to find tokens in on-screen boxes and move them. Difficulty ranges=4-8 box assessments, 2 trials for each assessment. Range=0-175. Lower scores is better.3) Rapid Visual Information Processing measures sustained attention. Digits from 2-9 appear in pseudo-random order, at rate of 100 digits/minute in a white box on screen. Participants detect order of digits and register (range=0.0-1.0). Higher scores is better.</description>
