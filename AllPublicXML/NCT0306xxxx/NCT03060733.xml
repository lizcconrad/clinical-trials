  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to obtain stool samples from post-therapy subjects already
      undergoing evaluation for an H. pylori infection by upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
      and gastric biopsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stools will be collected and tested, at a later date, in a clinical performance study with an
      investigational H. pylori antigen assay. This study will be coordinated by the Sponsor.

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Subjects are evaluated for H. pylori infectious status prior to eligibility. Evaluation
        includes use of a diagnostic H. pylori test, such as, an FDA cleared UBT or an FDA cleared
        Fecal Stool Antigen. Infectious status must be determined positive for H. pylori for
        subject eligibility.

        Eligible subjects are undergoing EGD with biopsy for H. pylori infectious status after
        completion of therapy
