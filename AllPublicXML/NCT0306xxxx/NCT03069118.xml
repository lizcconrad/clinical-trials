    <description>The Workit Health program is an adaptive &quot;recovery in your pocket&quot; harm reduction and sobriety solution that provides 24-hour access to adaptive lessons, mentorship, written and audio driven therapeutic exercises and tools, and peer-to-peer coaching. Users access our online site and enter an initial 90-day program that takes a holistic approach to recovery by addressing the physical, mental, emotional, and social aspects of addiction. As they advance, they move through successive levels that include lessons, activities, and assignments. Bonus materials, such as meditations and suggested reading, give users timely opportunities to dive deeper into a problem they are struggling with that day. Workit Health implements evidence-based strategies such as CBT, DBT, and MI.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of this research are adults who self-identify as wanting to change their
             relationship to alcohol or drugs, who report currently using alcohol or drugs, or
             having recently stopped, who have access to an internet-enabled device, who are not
             currently suffering from untreated acute medical or psychiatric conditions, who
             anticipate being able to access the intervention over a six-month period, and who are
             able to freely consent to participate by themselves.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Because the intervention is written for an adult audience, as well as the logistical
             challenges of having private access to an internet enabled device, this research is
             limited to participants over the age of 18.
