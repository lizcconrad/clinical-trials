      This is a pilot study to evaluate feasibility, safety, and preliminary evidence of efficacy
      for intravenously administered, RNA electroporated autologous T cells expressing MET chimeric
      antigen receptors with tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ /4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred
      to as &quot;RNA CART-cMET&quot;) in patients with advanced melanoma or breast carcinoma.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate feasibility, safety, and preliminary evidence of efficacy
      for intravenously administered, RNA electroporated autologous T cells expressing MET chimeric
      antigen receptors with tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ /4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred
      to as &quot;RNA CART-cMET&quot;) in patients with advanced melanoma or breast carcinoma. Subjects will
      be treated with IV administration of the RNA transduced anti-cMET CAR T cells for a total of
      up to six doses over a 2 week period.

      Each dose is 1x108 total T cells modified with RNA anti-cMET CAR. All subjects in both the
      melanoma and breast carcinoma arms will receive up to 6 doses of RNA CART-cMET cells, with no
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy administered prior to cell infusion Cell numbers are based on
      total cells with a portion of them having CAR expression depending on transduction efficiency
      and determined by flow cytometry Based on the product release criteria, at least 20% of the
      total cells will express the anti-cMET CAR. Treatment limiting toxicity (TLT). Adverse event
      reporting will begin at the start of the first dose of RNA CART-cMET and will continue until
      4 months after the first infusion, or until another alternative therapy is initiated,
      whichever occurs earlier. Subjects will be continually reassessed for evidence of acute and
      cumulative toxicity.
