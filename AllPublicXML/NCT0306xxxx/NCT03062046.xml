  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, acute and long term effectiveness, during
      standard RF ablation procedures while using Ablation Index and VISITAG™ software in
      combination with a Thermocool SmartTouch® (ST) or SmartTouch Surroundflow® (STSF) catheter.
      Furthermore, the role of Ablation Index and VISITAG™ workflow in creating contiguous ablation
      lines is assessed. The study is a prospective, non-randomized, post-market clinical
      evaluation. Up to 330 patients will be included in this study. All patients who qualify based
      on the study specific requirements will be invited to participate. The total duration of the
      study is estimated to be about 24 months (12 months enrollment period and 12 months of follow
      up). The clinical investigation population include subjects undergoing RF ablation for
      treatment of drug resistant symptomatic paroxysmal AF. Prior to enrollment in the clinical
      investigation, all subjects must meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are suitable
      candidates for enrollment in a clinical investigation in the opinion of the investigator.
      Subjects must have failed at least one antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) (Type I or III, including
      β-blocker) as evidenced by recurrent or are intolerant of the AAD.
