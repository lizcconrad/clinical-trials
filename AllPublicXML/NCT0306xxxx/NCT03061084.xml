  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A transitional Urology database was created in parallel with National Spina Bifida registry
      to follow patients with complex congenital urogenital anomalies and be able to prospectively
      evaluate them. The investigators obtained the standardized questionnaires to collect
      long-term data regarding patients' genitourinary status including urine and fecal continence,
      sexuality, fertility, and pelvic health.

    <textblock>
      The care and management of pediatric patients with congenital genitourinary anomalies
      transitioning to adolescents and later adults is undergoing a period of profound
      transformation. Due to improvements in surgical and nonsurgical interventions, children with
      diverse congenital disease affecting the genitourinary tract are surviving into adulthood at
      far higher rates than in the past. As an example, up to 70-75% of children born with a
      myelomeningocele and consequent neurogenic bladder are living past the age of twenty. These
      new expectations, especially in the areas of sexual function, fertility and reproductive
      health, are creating previously unseen challenges for health care providers attempting to
      transition adolescents from pediatric to adult care. As this patient population continues to
      grow, the transitional process for urological care of congenital anomalies is progressively
      becoming a topic of vital importance.

      We plan to advance adolescence clinical and research care and pioneering a unique and novel
      opportunity in transitional care.

      This database will help us: 1. To develop and revise (as necessary) standards of care and
      treatment best practices for patients transitioning to adolescents with congenital
      genitourinary malformation. 2. To share evidence-based information between physicians across
      the country, advancing best practices for the secondary conditions of spina bifida,
      exstrophy, neurogenic bladder and bowel, and hydrocephalus. 3. To implement benchmarks to
      improve care in transitional urology clinics. 4. Evaluate the clinical cost-effectiveness of
      care offered.
