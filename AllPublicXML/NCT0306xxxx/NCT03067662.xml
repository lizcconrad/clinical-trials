  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A few, small randomized controlled trials have investigated the effects of exercise on blood
      glucose levels in women with gestational diabetes (GDM), with inconsistent results.

      To assess the effects of supervised exercise in women with GDM, 48 women with gestational
      diabetes, diagnosed between the 18th and 28th week of gestation, will be recruited, after
      exclusion of subjects with contraindications to exercise. These subjects will be randomly
      assigned to two groups: structured exercise intervention or standard care.

      Women in the intervention group will perform low intensity aerobic exercise three times per
      week at 30% HRR (heart rate reserve), under continuous heart rate monitoring. Duration of
      each session will progress from 26 minutes the first week to 40 minutes (increasing 2
      min/week). Women in the control group will receive standard diet and physical exercise
      recommendations.

      In all women, clinical, metabolic and anthropometric features will be assessed before, during
      and at the end of the study. Newborn data will also be collected.
