  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug called pembrolizumab in
      patients with Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN); chronic phase (MF-CP), accelerated phase
      (MPN-AP), or blast phase (MF-BP). Myelofibrosis neoplasm (MPN) is a group of diseases of the
      bone marrow in which excessive cells are produced.

      Pembrolizumab also known as Keytruda is a drug that has recently been approved in the United
      Stated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression. Pembrolizumab is experimental in
      the treatment of MPN. The researchers want to find out what effects, good and /or bad it has
      on participants and the disease.

      Participants qualify to take part in this research study if have been diagnosed with a MPN
      blood disorder called myelofibrosis (MF). Accelerated (10-19% blasts in the blood or bone
      marrow) and blast phase (&gt;20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow) MPN has been a difficult
      disease to treat. The term &quot;blasts&quot; refers to immature cells found in the bone marrow. They
      are not fully developed, and therefore, do not yet carry out any particular function within
      the body.

      Funds for conducting this research are provided by Merck and Company, the manufacturer of the
      study drug pembrolizumab.

      The researchers propose a Simon-two stage design for this study. The researchers will test
      pembrolizumab at the FDA approved dose (in head and neck cancer) of 200mg dose administered
      via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes given every 3 weeks. Nine patients will be enrolled
      in the first stage of the Simon-two stage design, and 15 in the second stage. A treatment
      cycle is 3 weeks and the core study period is 6 cycles. Response assessment by established
      consensus criteria will be used to assess response after 6 cycles in order to determine if
      the trial will progress to the second stage and for the purpose of determining the primary
      endpoint. In addition, allowed will be a maximum of ten patients with accelerated or blast
      phase disease (MPN-AP/BP) who are refractory or intolerant to conventional therapies such as
      decitabine, and in which hematopoietic stem cell transplant is not a therapeutic option
      (exploratory cohort), to enroll in the study as a separate exploratory cohort. These patients
      can be enrolled during stage 1 or 2 and will be analyzed separately from the primary cohort
      population.

      Exploratory biomarkers will be obtained from enrolled patients at baseline, cycle 3 and cycle
      7 and at 1 year of therapy. Patients that obtain at least a clinical improvement after 6
      cycles of therapy can continue receiving pembrolizumab until evidence of disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, and patient or physician decision for a maximum of 2 years.
