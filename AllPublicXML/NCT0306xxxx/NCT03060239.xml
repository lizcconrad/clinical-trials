  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the improvement of movement during RBD in Parkinson's
      disease and to explore the neuronal network involved in this improvement using NIRS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the quality of movement during REM sleep during RBD
      episodes and movement awake without and with dopaminergic treatment while measuring cortical
      activity using NIRS.
