  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular response to exercise affects the capacity of all body organs depending upon
      intensity, duration and mode of exercises. The aim was to compare acute effects of arm crank
      with treadmill moderate intensity exercises on heart rate variability in normal participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A one hundred thirty male volunteers were equally and randomly assigned to; Group-I:
      Sixty-five participated in an arm crank moderate intensity exercise for 40 minutes. Group-II:
      Sixty-five participated in a treadmill moderate intensity exercise for 40 minutes. Halter
      heart rate monitor and automatic sphygmomanometer were used to measure heart beat intervals
      and arterial blood pressure respectively.
