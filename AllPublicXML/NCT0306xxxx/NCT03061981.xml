    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject voluntarily agrees to participate in this study and signs an Institutional
             Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent before any of the screening procedures
             are performed.

          2. Male subjects aged between 18 and 55 years (both inclusive) at screening.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 32.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) at screening.

          4. Medical history, vital signs, physical examination, standard 12-lead ECGs and
             laboratory investigations (clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) must be
             clinically acceptable or within laboratory reference ranges for the relevant
             laboratory tests, unless the PI considers the deviation to be irrelevant for the
             purpose of the study. These assessments may be repeated once at the discretion of the
             PI.

          5. Subjects with partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use medically
             acceptable double barrier forms of contraception from IMP administration until at
             least 3 months after the last day of IMP administration. Subjects must not donate
             sperm for the duration of the study and for at least 3 months after the last day of
             IMP administration.

          6. Is a non-smoker or non-tobacco/nicotine user confirmed with urine cotinine test at
             screening and on admission to the EPCU. Nicotine products include, but are not limited
             to, tobacco cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, snuff, cigars, and pipes, including
             hookah or water pipes. The use of nicotine patches or gum (e.g., products used as part
             of a smoking cessation program) is not allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of DA- 1241 or any of
             the excipients or to medicinal products with similar chemical structures.

          2. Has a history or presence of any clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine disease or other
             abnormality that may impact the ability of the subject to participate or potentially
             confound the study results.

          3. Has a glycated hemoglobin A1C (HgbA1C) of â¥ 6.5% consistent with possible diabetes at
             screening.

          4. Any disorder that would interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs.

          5. Any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the PI, would make the
             subject unsuitable for participation in the clinical study.

          6. Subject has a history of drinking &gt; 21 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = 10 g pure
             alcohol = 250 mL of beer [5%] or 35 mL of spirits [35%] or 100 mL of wine [12%])
             within 3 months prior to admission to the EPCU.

          7. Have positive test results for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (anti HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus 1 and/or -2 antibodies (anti
             HIV-1 and/or -2) at screening.

          8. History of drug abuse or has a positive urine drug test (cocaine, amphetamines,
             barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, etc.) at screening or on Day 1.

          9. Has donated or lost 450 mL or more of his blood volume (including plasmaphoresis), or
             had a transfusion of any blood product within 3 months before screening.

         10. Taking any medication including prescription, herbal remedies, vitamin supplements,
             dietary supplements or other over-the-counter (OTC) products within 14 days or 5
             half-lives of the product (whichever period is longer) before admission to the EPCU.

         11. Has an abnormal (clinically significant) ECG at screening or on Day 1. Entry of any
             subject with an abnormal (but not clinically significant) ECG must be approved and
             documented by signature, by the PI or medically qualified Sub-investigator.

         12. Has a supine blood pressure (BP) outside the ranges of 90 to 140 mmHg, inclusive, for
             systolic BP and 50 to 90 mmHg, inclusive, for diastolic BP, or has a resting heart
             rate outside the range of 45 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). If any of the values are

             disease or has alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             values greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Laboratory assessments
             may be repeated once to confirm eligibility at screening and on Day 1.

         15. Participation in another study with an experimental drug within 30 days or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, of this study's screening visit. Participation is
             defined as the date of last dose received in the previous study.

         16. Unwilling to abstain from vigorous exercise within 48 hours before Day 1.

             admission to the EPCU.

         18. Have used alcohol within 72 hours prior to screening or within 72 hours prior to
             admission to the EPCU.

         19. Is unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and study-related
             restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for follow-up visits
             and improbability of completing the clinical study.

         20. Is a study-site employee or an immediate family member or dependent (e.g., spouse,
             parent, child or sibling) of a study-site employee who is involved in the conduct of
             this study.

         21. Has difficulty swallowing 2 tablets at the same time.
