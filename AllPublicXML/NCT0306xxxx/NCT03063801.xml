  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgeries of heart disease in adulthood can happen in two specific contexts:

        -  either for an asymptomatic anomaly, possibly coupled with the onset of symptoms later in
           life and tardily diagnosed and surgically managed

        -  either for a malformation treated in childhood and requiring a new intervention in
           adulthood. In recent years, the number of adult patients with congenital heart disease
           has been steadily increasing. Advances in diagnostic techniques and surgical treatments
           have enabled many children to reach adulthood. The number of these patients is now
           higher than the number of children with congenital heart disease. The number of these
           patients having had surgery in adulthood is also increasing.

      Congenital cardiopathies are numerous, ranging from simpler pathologies such as
      inter-auricular or inter-ventricular communication, to much more complex pathologies such as
      situations of univentricular hearts. The surgical treatments of these congenital heart
      diseases are classified into three groups: initial palliative surgery, initial curative
      surgery or iterative surgery. Palliative surgery aims to improve the clinical tolerance of
      the patient to the conditions of his pathology or to prevent complications. The curative
      surgery restores the physiological circulation, the iterative surgery treats a complication
      or a degeneration appearing after a curative surgery.

      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery frequently receive blood products transfusions during the
      preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative periods. Several observational studies have
      shown that in cardiac surgery, the transfusion of blood derivatives is associated with an
      increase in post-operative morbidity and mortality.

      The objective of this study is to analyze the predictive factors of transfusion in congenital
      patients operated in adulthood at Brugmann University Hospital, depending on the type of
      surgery applied (palliative, curative or iterative). The secondary objective will be to
      assess whether there are any differences with the predictive factors identified in
      non-congenital patients undergoing cardiac surgery, which could potentially alter the
      transfusion approach in congenital patients.
