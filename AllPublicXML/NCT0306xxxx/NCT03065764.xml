  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a screening phase of up to 42 days, eligible subjects will undergo two whole body
      immuno-PET scans with a non-therapeutic tracer dose (2 mg) of 89Zr-pembrolizumab; one with
      and one without a preceding &quot;cold&quot; therapeutic dose of pembrolizumab. For the first 3
      patients, PET scans will be obtained at 1, 72 and 120 hours post tracer injection to
      determine the optimal scan time point and to perform biodistribution measurements and
      dosimetry. All subsequent patients receive only 1 PET scan post-injection (i.e. two PET
      scans). The optimal time point is expected to be at day 5 post-injection. Pembrolizumab
      treatment will continue every three weeks until two years of therapy have been administered,
      disease progression, or unacceptable adverse event(s).

             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy

             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

         13. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

         14. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
