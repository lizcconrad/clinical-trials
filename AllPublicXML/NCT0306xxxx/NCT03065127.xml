  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is arguably one of the most debilitating motor symptoms experienced by
      individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). FOG may be caused by an overload of cognitive,
      limbic, and sensorimotor system activity in the basal ganglia. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study is to evaluate cognitive, limbic, and sensorimotor therapies in individuals with FOG.
      Participants in this study will undergo all three types of treatments in a randomized
      counterbalanced order. Each treatment will occur in 1 hour sessions, twice weekly for a
      period of 4 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is arguably one of the most debilitating motor symptoms experienced by
      individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), and negatively impacts quality of life (Walton et
      al., 2015). Furthermore, advanced FOG does not respond well to treatments commonly used in
      Parkinson's disease (Nutt et al., 2011), therefore warranting the use of adjunct treatment
      options. The development of potential treatment strategies for FOG should focus on the
      underlying mechanism. The cross-talk model of FOG proposes that FOG may be caused by an
      overload of cognitive, limbic, and sensorimotor system activity in the basal ganglia,
      resulting in a depletion of dopaminergic resources, leading to FOG (Lewis &amp; Barker, 2009).
      Hence, based on the cross-talk model, treatments targeting the cognitive, sensorimotor and
      limbic systems independently may lead to a reduction in FOG episodes. Previous studies have
      demonstrated the efficacy of therapies targeting these domains in PD and healthy individuals,
      however, these have yet to be explored in FOG. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
      evaluate cognitive, sensorimotor, and limbic therapies in individuals with FOG.

      This study will employ a within-subjects design, in which participants will undergo all three
      treatments in a randomized counterbalanced order. Sessions for each type of treatment will
      occur for 1 hour, twice weekly for a period of 4 weeks. Participants will also undergo pre-
      and post-test assessments prior to and following each 4-week treatment period. The cognitive
      training will utilize the &quot;Smartbrain Pro&quot; computer software, which has previously
      demonstrated efficacy in individuals with Parkinson's disease (Paris et al., 2011). The
      sensorimotor training group will participate in proprioceptive training of the upper and
      lower limbs. This training will entail a target matching task, in which participants will
      produce active and self-defined movements while blindfolded (i.e. without visual feedback).
      The limbic training group will undergo cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) focusing solely on
      anxiety symptoms.

    <description>Participants will complete one-on-one sessions a target matching proprioceptive training protocol using their upper and lower limbs. For the upper limb target-reaching task, participants will be seated in front of a surface marked with ten targets. They will first visualize a specified target, then blindfolded and asked to reach towards that target with the blindfold on. The blindfold will then be removed allowing participants to view their performance relative to the target. This task will be repeated for the remaining targets on both sides and for both upper and lower limbs. Participants will complete a total of eight one-hour sessions over 4 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Training the cognitive domain may be accomplished by training various cognitive and executive functions with guided practice focusing on specific skills (e.g. visuospatial processing, executive function, memory, language, and attention). Cognitive training has been demonstrated to be efficacious in several studies in individuals with PD. Given the potential cognitive contribution to FOG episodes, this type of therapy may alleviate FOG by potentially improving upon planning, set-shifting, and/or response inhibition.</description>

    <description>CBT has been demonstrated to be effective in the remediation of anxiety in individuals with PD. This may be beneficial to individuals experiencing FOG, given the evidence that anxiety may provoke FOG. During periods of elevated anxiety (e.g. walking in a threatening environment), freezers will be able to more efficiently process this limbic load resulting in greater resources available for movement control.</description>

    <intervention_name>Proprioceptive Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Currently, studies investigating proprioceptive training as a treatment in PD are limited. However, this type of training has potential by improving proprioceptive processing. It would be expected that due to this training, when sensorimotor processing is challenged during locomotion (e.g. by removing visual feedback and preventing compensation of proprioception deficits), freezers would experience less decrements to gait due to an enhanced ability to process sensorimotor demands.</description>
