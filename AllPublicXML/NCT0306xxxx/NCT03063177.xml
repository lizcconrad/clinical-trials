  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluate the relationships between spinal manipulative therapy dosage (speed and
      peak force), the resulting modulation of thoracic spinal stiffness and changes in the
      clinical status in participants with chronic thoracic pain. Participants will attend four
      sessions of one hour over 2 weeks. During session 1 to 3, participants will receive one of
      three different spinal manipulative therapy dosages based on their group assignment and
      preceded and followed by the measurement of their thoracic spinal stiffness. Session 4 will
      include spinal stiffness measurement and clinical status evaluation through questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is based on the premise that clinicians can identify spine
      mechanical changes and accordingly determine the dosage of its biomechanical parameters:
      preload force, rate of force application and peak force. In recent years, our research team
      showed, using an apparatus to deliver specific dosage SMTs, that SMT-related
      neurophysiological responses depend on the dosage of these parameters. Beside determining the
      SMT dosage, clinicians have to select the spinal level to be treated which is partly done by
      applying a light pressure to each spinous process (spinal stiffness assessment). This study
      consist of a randomized controlled trial including 75 participants with chronic thoracic pain
      who will be randomized in one of three groups. Based on their group assignment, participants
      will receive a specific dosage SMT delivered at T7 three times over 2 weeks. These SMT
      dosages are distinct regarding their speed and/or their peak force in order to generate
      either a high vertebral displacement or a high muscle reflex response. T6, T7 and T8 spinal
      stiffness will be measured just before and after treatment and clinical status will be
      assessed at each session beginning through questionnaires. Session four will include the
      questionnaires and the spinal stiffness measurement procedure. Both SMT and spinal stiffness
      measurement will be performed using an apparatus aiming at simulating force-time profiles.
      Surface electromyography electrodes and accelerometers will be positioned over the upper back
      skin in order to measure the muscle response and vertebral displacement during SMT and spinal
      stiffness measurement procedures.

    <measure>Change in spinal stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in spinal stiffness between session four and the first session will be assessed at T6, T7 and T8. Spinal stiffness is measured by applying a gradual load of 45 Newtons (N) (5 kg) through our apparatus and by recording the associated indenter displacement. The resulting force-displacement data are used to calculate a spinal stiffness coefficient (N/mm) with lower value indicating more mobility at the spinal level. The change in spinal stiffness will be calculated for each participant by subtracting the value obtained during the fourth session to the one during the first session. A positive value will indicate a decrease in spinal stiffness (increase mobility) while a negative value will indicate an increase in spinal stiffness (decrease mobility) with higher value indicating more important changes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pain intensity between session four and the first session will be evaluated by subtracting the pain value (over a 0-100 point visual analogue rating scale) obtained at session four by the one at the first session. Positive value indicates a decrease in pain with higher value indicating a more important decrease.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in disability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in disability between session four and the first session will be evaluated by subtracting the Quebec Back Pain Disability scale score (0-100 score with higher score indicating higher disability) obtained at session four by the one at the first session. Positive value indicates a decrease in disability with higher value indicating a more important decrease.</description>
