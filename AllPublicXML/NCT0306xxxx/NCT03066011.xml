    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe representative real-world patterns of care for the
      management of invasive fungal infections (IFIs), including invasive mold infection (IMI).
      Specifically, the study goals are to examine real world patient characteristics and treatment
      patterns, associated healthcare resource utilization, and outcomes associated with use of
      mold-active triazoles (MATs) to treat invasive fungal infections (IFIs).
