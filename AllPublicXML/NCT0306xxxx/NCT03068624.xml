  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is divided into 2 parts: leukapheresis and treatment. In the
      leukapheresis part, white blood cells called T cells will be collected from you to be made
      into specialized CD8+T cells. To make specialized CD8+T cells, researchers separate out T
      cells from blood and treat them so they are able to target melanoma cells. The blood cells
      are then given back to the patient in the treatment part of the study. This is known as
      &quot;adoptive T cell transfer&quot; or &quot;adoptive T cell therapy&quot;.

      This consent form is for the treatment part of the study.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving CD8+T cells
      with cyclophosphamide, and IL-2 (aldesleukin) to patients with uveal melanoma that is
      metastatic (has spread). Some participants will also receive ipilimumab. Researchers also
      want to learn if this combination can help to control the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Specialized CD8+T cells are not FDA approved or
      commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only.
      Cyclophosphamide, ipilimumab, and aldesleukin are FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of uveal melanoma.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      study parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. If you are in Dose Escalation, you will
      receive a dose level of CD 8+ T cells based on when you join this study. Up to 3 dose levels
      of CD 8+T cells will be tested. At least 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.
      After the first group receives a dose level of the CD 8+ T cells, another group will be
      enrolled at a higher or lower dose level based on any side effects that are seen. It is then
      possible that a third group will be enrolled at a higher or lower dose level than the second
      group.

      If you are in Dose Expansion, you will receive the highest tolerated dose level of CD 8+ T
      cells from the Dose Escalation Part.

      All participants will receive the same dose levels of all other drugs on this study.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days before
      you receive the CD8+ T cells). If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given standard
      drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for information
      about how these drugs are given and their risks.

      On Day -1 you will be admitted to the hospital and have a hepatic arterial catheter placed.
      This catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a blood vessel in your
      liver while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in
      more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form. You will stay in the
      hospital overnight after the placement.

      On Day 0, you will receive the CD8+ T cells through the catheter over 60 minutes. You will
      stay in the hospital overnight after the dose.

      Starting within 6 hours after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times each day after that
      for 14 days, you will receive aldesleukin as an injection into the skin around your abdomen.
      You will be taught how to give yourself these injections.

      If you are in the Dose Expansion Part, on Days 1, 22, 43, and 64, you will receive ipilimumab
      by vein over about 90 minutes.

      Study Visits:

      On Day -2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will
           include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. To continue your participation in
           this study, you cannot be pregnant.

      On Days 0, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 56, 64, 70, 77, 84, 112, 140, and 168:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.

        -  Sometime between Days 35 and 42 and again between Days 77 and 84, you will have a CT
           scan to check the status of the disease.

      On Days 1 and 3, blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system
      tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.

      Every day that you are in-patient, you will have a physical examination.

      After your discharge from the hospital and until Day 28, during weekdays only (Monday -
      Friday), you will report to out-patient clinic for toxicity assessment, performance status,
      and to have your vital signs recorded.

      On Days 1, 7, 14, 22 and 28 you will have an EKG.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed to check the status of the disease, blood (about 1½
      tablespoons) will be drawn every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.

      The study tests may be repeated or you may have additional tests performed anytime the doctor
      thinks it is needed.

      Some of the study tests may be done at your local clinic if you cannot return to MD Anderson.
      The collection of data and blood samples will be managed by the MD Anderson study staff.

      The study staff will discuss this with you.

      Length of Treatment:

      The treatment portion of the study will last until Day 64. You will no longer be able to take
      the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      It is possible that you may receive another round of treatment (retreatment) if you did not
      have serious side effects or if you did have side effects but they have gotten better. The
      study staff will discuss this possibility with you.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      At Day 168:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 3 months after Day 84, unless the disease gets worse or you start another cancer
      therapy, you will have a CT scan or x-rays to check the status of the disease. Every 3 months
      for up to 5 years, the study staff will call you or ask your doctor how you are doing. If you
      are called, the calls should last about 10-15 minutes.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will return to the clinic every 4-6 weeks or more
      often if the doctor thinks is needed. Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests, immune system tests, and tests on how long the T-cells survive in your body.
