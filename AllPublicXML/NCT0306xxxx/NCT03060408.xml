  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this retrospective cohort study, the investigators reviewed and analyzed the electronic
      medical records of consecutive patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy either via
      laparotomy or laparoscopy. Intraoperative fluid administration amount, postoperative
      complications, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate were evaluated. The total fluid
      amounts were calculated using the sum of colloids multiplied by 1.5 or 2.0 and crystalloids.

      There has been recent progress in intraoperative fluid therapy. However, little is known
      about intraoperative fluid therapy in laparoscopic surgery. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether there are differences in the basal fluid requirements during surgery
      between laparotomy and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. This study analyzed the records
      between June 2006 and March 2016. And 253 patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy via
      either laparotomy (73 patients) or laparoscopy (180 patients). This study was based on a
      retrospective review and analysis of the electronic medical records. The volume of
      intraoperative fluid administered, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and
      readmission rate were evaluated. The total volume of fluids was calculated as the sum of the
      volume of crystalloid plus the volume of colloid multiplied by 1.5 or 2.0.
