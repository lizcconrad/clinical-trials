    <textblock>
      This study will address a hypothesis that, in late pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia,
      androgens antagonize progesterone's ability to suppress waking LH pulse frequency. All
      participants will receive 4 doses of progesterone; half of participants will be pretreated
      with androgen receptor blockade (spironolactone, 50 mg twice daily), while the other half
      will be pretreated with placebo (twice daily).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late pubertal obese girls with hyperandrogenemia have altered day-night patterns of LH
      secretion when compared to those without hyperandrogenemia. In addition, a previous study
      revealed that late pubertal adolescents with hyperandrogenemia demonstrate impaired
      suppression of LH pulse frequency with estradiol and progesterone administration for one
      week.

      This study will address an overall working model holding that daytime/waking LH pulse
      frequency is acutely suppressed by progesterone negative feedback when testosterone
      concentrations are low, but that daytime/waking LH pulse frequency is resistant to
      progesterone negative feedback when testosterone concentrations are high. The hypothesis is
      that, in late pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia, progesterone suppression of waking LH
      frequency is greater in the setting of androgen receptor blockade (spironolactone, 50 mg
      twice daily) compared to the placebo condition.

      Sixteen late pubertal girls (postmenarcheal, but by no more than 4 years) with Tanner
      stage-specific hyperandrogenemia will undergo two CRU admissions separated by at least 4
      weeks. During each admission, the acute effects of oral micronized progesterone (0.8 mg/kg at
      1000, 1600, and 2200 h) on LH pulse frequency will be assessed. Subjects will be randomized
      to be pretreated for 2 weeks with either spironolactone (an androgen receptor blocker
      commonly used for hyperandrogenism) or placebo prior to the first admission; subjects will be
      pretreated with the other medication (placebo or spironolactone) for 2 weeks before the
      second admission in accordance with a cross-over design.

      Wake LH pulse frequency from spironolactone and placebo admissions will be analyzed via a
      hierarchical linear mixed model.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Late pubertal girls (i.e., postmenarcheal, but by â‰¤ 4 years)

          -  Hyperandrogenism, as defined by an elevated Tanner stage-specific free testosterone
             concentration and/or clinical evidence of hirsutism

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 10 or &gt; 17 years (this study is designed to elucidate mechanisms underlying
             emerging PCOS in late pubertal, postmenarcheal adolescent girls)

          -  Men and boys are excluded (this study is designed to elucidate mechanisms underlying
             HA and emerging PCOS in peripubertal adolescent girls)

          -  Inability to comprehend what will be done during the study or why it will be done

          -  Obesity associated with a diagnosed (genetic) syndrome (e.g., Prader-Willi syndrome,
             leptin deficiency), obesity related to medications (e.g., glucocorticoids), etc.

          -  To ensure that blood withdrawal is within safe limits, weight &lt; 28.1 kg is an
             exclusion criterion.

          -  Since underweight can alter pulsatile LH secretion, BMI-for-age percentile &lt; 5 is an
             exclusion criterion.

          -  Positive pregnancy test or lactation. Subjects with a positive pregnancy test will be
             informed of the result by the screening physician. Under Virginia law, parental
             notification is not required for minors. However, the screening physician will
             encourage the subject to tell her parent(s). We will counsel the adolescent about the
             importance of appropriate prenatal care/counseling. We will offer appropriate
             follow-up at the Teen Health Clinic at UVA and/or encourage the adolescent to secure
             prompt care via their primary care physician's office.

          -  Virilization or a total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl (confirmed on repeat), which suggests
             the possibility of a virilizing neoplasm

          -  DHEA-S &gt; 1.5 times the age-appropriate upper limit of normal (confirmed on repeat)

          -  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): A morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) &gt; 300
             ng/dl (confirmed on repeat) will suggest the possibility of CAH. If obtained during a
             luteal phase (as evidenced by high progesterone), the 17-OHP will be repeated at
             0800-0900 h during the early follicular phase (or, if oligomenorrheic, during
             follicular phaseâ€”confirmed by low serum progesterone). If a 17-OHP &gt; 300 ng/dl is
             confirmed on repeat testing, an ACTH-stimulated 17-OHP &lt; 1000 ng/dl will be required
             for study participation.

          -  Morning cortisol concentration &lt; 3 Âµg/dL (confirmed on repeat), history of adrenal
             insufficiency, or symptoms suggestive of adrenal insufficiency (e.g., persistent
             anorexia, nausea, unintentional weight loss, etc.)

          -  Evidence of Cushing's syndrome by history or physical exam (e.g., history of impaired
             growth)

          -  Any abnormal TSH concentration will trigger repeat testing. In many cases when TSH is
             initially abnormal, a repeat TSH will be normal. These subjects will be permitted to
             continue study. If TSH remains abnormal on repeat testing, the subject will be
             referred to her primary medical provider. In some cases, a participant's primary
             medical provider will elect to simply observe a mildly low (&gt; 0.1) or mildly elevated
             (&lt; 10) if stable. In such cases, we will accept a TSH between 0.3 and 7 (inclusive) if
             it has remained stable for at least 6 monthsâ€”such TSH values are exceedingly unlikely
             to influence the central reproductive axis or to influence the risks of the study.
             Notably, subjects with reasonably-treated primary hypothyroidismâ€”reflected by TSH
             values between 0.3 and 7â€”on a stable dose of thyroid hormone (i.e., same dose for at
             least 2 months) will not be excluded.

          -  Prolactin concentration &gt; 30 ng/mL (confirmed on repeat)

          -  Persistent hemoglobin &lt; 11.5 g/dL for non-African American subjects; hemoglobin &lt; 11.0
             g/dL for African American subjects (confirmed on repeat). Importantly, documentation
             of a hemoglobin â‰¥ 11.0 g/dL for African American subjects or â‰¥ 11.5 g/dL for
             non-African American subjects in the month prior to the CRU admission is required for
             frequent sampling protocol in the CRU.

          -  A previous diagnosis of diabetes, a fasting glucose â‰¥ 126 mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c â‰¥
             6.5% (confirmed on repeat)

          -  Elevated creatinine concentration and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 80
             mL/min/1.73 m2 (confirmed on repeat)

          -  Persistently abnormal sodium or potassium concentration (confirmed on repeat)

          -  Bicarbonate concentrations &lt; 20 or &gt; 30 (confirmed on repeat)

          -  Liver test abnormalities (confirmed on repeat), with two exceptions: (1) mild
             bilirubin elevations will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome or
             when the subject's primary care provider provides a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's
             syndrome and has no plans for further work-up; (2) mild transaminase (ALT, AST)
             elevations may be seen in obese girls, so stable elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper
             limit of normal will be accepted in this group.

          -  Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected
             congestive heart failure; asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids;
             etc.)

          -  Personal history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT)

          -  Personal history of ovarian, endometrial, or breast neoplasia

          -  Absolute contraindications to spironolactone use include anuria, acute renal
             insufficiency, significant impairment of renal excretory function, hyperkalemia,
             primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), and concomitant use of eplerenone
