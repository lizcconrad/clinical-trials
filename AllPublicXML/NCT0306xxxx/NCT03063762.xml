  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, Phase 1b, adaptive, clinical study to assess
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary therapeutic
      activity of RO6874281 in combination with atezolizumab with/without bevacizumab in
      participants with unresectable advanced and/or metastatic RCC. The study will consist of
      dose-escalation part and extension part.
