          -  Patients with 1-2 relapses of WHO Classification follicle centre NHL grade 1-2/3.
             Patients must have achieved at least a PR to previous treatment.

          -  Central pathology review before registration

          -  Ann Arbor stage III or IV

          -  Measurable disease: defined as clinically or radiologically documented disease with at
             least one site bidimensionally measurable using clinical exam, CT or MRI performed in
             the 3 weeks prior to study enrollment.

          -  ECOG performance status of &lt;2.

          -  Patients may have received not more than 1 prior course (4 infusions) of rituximab.
             Timing of rituximab must exceed 12 months prior to registration. Patients must have
             demonstrated at least a PR to rituximab if previously administered.

          -  Patient consent according to institutional and university human experimentation
             committee requirements

          -  Adequate Renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function test unless the abnormal values are
             thought to be due to involvement with lymphoma as defined by:

        Hb&gt; 85 ANC &gt;1000/mm3 Platelets &gt;100,000/mm3 Serum/Total Bilirubin &gt;=2 SI units AST/ALT &lt;2x
        Upper Limit of Normal

          -  Serious non-malignant disease (e.g., congestive heart failure, or active uncontrolled
             bacterial, viral, or fungal infections), or other conditions, which, in the opinion of
             the investigator and/or the sponsor, would compromise other protocol objectives.

          -  Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within four weeks.

          -  Presence of anti-murine antibody (HAMA) reactivity. These laboratory results must be
             available prior to receiving treatment for those patients

          -  who have received prior murine proteins or patients who have allergies to murine
             proteins.

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart disease (see Appendix H, Clinical
             Evaluation of Functional Capacity of Patients with Heart Disease in Relation to
             Ordinary Physical Activity) or myocardial infarction within the past six months.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives (of the study
             drug with the longest half-life) prior to entry into the study, which ever is longer.

          -  Previous chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy for the
