      The purpose of this study is to look at patient outcomes when docetaxel is started prior to
      ADT with degarelix.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at two drugs, docetaxel and degarelix, which are both FDA approved for
      the treatment of prostate cancer. Docetaxel is a standard chemotherapy treatment for
      metastatic prostate cancer. Degarelix is an androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) agent that
      decreases the amount of testosterone in the body, which helps to fight tumor growth. Usually,
      docetaxel is given after ADT. This study will look at how your cancer changes when docetaxel
      is started before ADT. You are being asked to participate in this study because you have
      metastatic prostate cancer that can be treated with docetaxel and ADT.

    <measure>PSA response at 10 months</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSA complete response is defined as PSA level less than or equal to 0.2 ng/ml for two consecutive measurements at least three weeks apart. Date of complete response will be defined as the date of first recorded value less than 0.2 ng/ml. PSA partial response is defined as a decline of PSA from trial baseline of &gt; 50% for two consecutive measurements at least three weeks apart. Date of partial response will be defined as the date of first recorded decline of &gt; 50% baseline. Date of partial response will be defined as the date of first recorded decline of &gt; 50% baseline. PSA progression will be defined as &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir (lowest PSA value recorded since trial enrollment) and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir. Two consecutive increases must be recorded at least three weeks apart. Date of PSA progression will be defined as the first recorded PSA value that is a &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of disease progression at 12 weeks using PSA</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PSA progression will be defined as &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir (lowest PSA value recorded since trial enrollment) and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir. Two consecutive increases must be recorded at least two weeks apart. Date of PSA progression will be defined as the first recorded PSA value that is a &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir. PSA progression will not be established during the first 12 weeks of therapy (4 cycles of docetaxel) as defined by PCWG2 criteria. Thus subjects with no PSA decline from baseline during therapy will have date of PSA progression defined as first PSA value after 12 weeks that is a &gt; 25% increase from the PSA nadir and &gt; 2 ng/dl above the nadir.</description>
