    <textblock>
      Celldex endeavors to make investigational products available to patients with
      life-threatening diseases who have exhausted other treatment options and where there is a
      reasonable expectation of benefit over risk. Requests for expanded access to glembatumumab
      vedotin in patients with gpNMB expressing triple negative breast cancer will be considered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is 18 years of age or older.

          2. The patient has histologically confirmed, gpNMB expressing, metastatic triple-negative
             breast cancer

          3. Overexpression of gpNMB in at least one tumor sample as determined by a Sponsor
             approved laboratory using IHC methods

          4. The patient does not have abnormal organ function, active autoimmune disease, active
             infections or additional concurrent conditions that would compromise the patient's
             ability to safely receive glembatumumb vedotin.

          5. The patient is not eligible for or cannot access ongoing glembatumumab vedotin
             clinical trials

          6. The patient does not qualify for, or cannot access, other comparable or satisfactory
             alternative therapy for triple negative breast cancer.

          7. The patient is able to read and understand, and has signed a patient informed consent
             form, which outlines the nature of the proposed treatment and the anticipated benefits
             and risks of treatment with glembatumumab vedotin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar composition to
             glembatumumab vedotin, MMAE, dolastatin or auristatin.

          2. Pregnant or breast-feeding women, and women or men who are not willing to use
             effective contraception during the time from signing of informed consent through two
             months after the last dose of glembatumumab vedotin treatment.

          3. The patient was previously treated with glembatumumab vedotin or previously enrolled
             on the METRIC trial (regardless of which arm they were randomized to).

          4. Any underlying medical condition that, in the investigator's or Sponsor's opinion,
             will make the administration of Glembatumumab vedotin hazardous to the patient, or
             would obscure the interpretation of adverse events.
