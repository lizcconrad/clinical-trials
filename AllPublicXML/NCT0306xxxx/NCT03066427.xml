  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic scenario of metastatic renal cancer is undergoing a new revolution with the
      appearance of a novel therapeutic strategy after the antiangiogenic treatments, that is the
      immunotherapy, in addition to the approval of new active drugs in the following lines of
      treatment.

      There are currently two phase III trials in the first line of treatment in metastatic renal
      cancer that include different combinations of treatment based on immunotherapy. If results of
      these studies were positive, the therapeutic algorithm would be modified so that the
      remaining drugs would have to be repositioned within the therapeutic decision scheme.

      Sunitinib has previously demonstrated its benefit in patients who had failed to prior
      treatment with cytokines, so it is likely to continue to be effective in patients who have
      become resistant to treatment with new drugs based on immune checkpoint blockade.

      This phase II study is developed to evaluate the activity of sunitinib after treatment with
      immunotherapy-based regimens that are currently being developed within phase III clinical
      trials.
