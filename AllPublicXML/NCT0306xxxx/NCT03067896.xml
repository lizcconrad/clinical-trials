  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia has become more popular in cesarean deliveries because most of the
      parturients prefer being awake during the birth process. In addition, regional anesthesia may
      be a safer method than general. In spinal anesthesia local anesthetics alone may not be
      enough for an effective postoperative analgesia and hemodynamic stability of the patient wich
      is crucial during cesarean section. So far many adjuvants have been used to augment the
      analgesia produced by intrathecal local anesthetics and to reduce their adverse effects .

      Various intrathecal adjuvants to local anaesthetics have found to improve the quality and
      extend duration of spinal block. Prolongation of duration of spinal block is desirable both
      for long procedures and for postoperative pain relief. Efficacy and safty of intrathecal
      magnesium as analgesic adjuvant has been tested by several clinical trails in recent
      years.Antinociceptive effect of magnesium appears to be relevant for the management of
      chronic and post operative pain. These effects are primarily based on regulation of calcium
      influx in to the cell. Magnesium blocks calcium influx and non competitively antagonizes NMDA
      channels. NMDA receptor signelling plays an impartent in determining the duration of acute
      pain3).) addition of magnesium to spinal anaesthesia improved postoperative analgesia in
      orthopedic setting. addition of intrathecal magnesium sulfate to 10 mg bupivacaine plus 25µg
      fentanyl prolonged spinal anaesthesia in patients undergoing lower extremity surgery.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective 2-adrenergic agonist which has been used as
      pre-medication and as an adjuvant to general anesthesia.Dexmedetomidine have several
      beneficial actions during perioperative period. They decrease sympathetic tone with
      attenuation of the neuroendocrine and haemodynamic response to anaesthesia and surgery,
      reduce anaesthetic and opiod requirement, cause sedation and analgesia. Dexmedetomidine was
      first introduced into clinical practice as a short term intravenous sedative in intensive
      care. Like any other adjuvant dexmedetomidine is not free from adverse effects. Use of
      dexmedetomidine is often associated with a decrease in heart rate and blood
      pressure.Dexmedetomidine was used to enhance the analgesic property of local anaesthetics
      like lidocaine bupivacaine and ropivacaine. In vivo and in vitro studies indicated that these
      local anaesthetics had significant neurotoxicity. Dexmedetomidine showed protective or growth
      promoting properties in tissues, including nerve cells from cortex. Intrathecal
      dexmedetomidine has a neuroprotective effect similar to methylprednisolone.

      The mechanism by which intrathecal alpha 2-adrenergic agonists prolong the motor and sensory
      block of local anesthetics is not clear. It may be an additive or synergistic effect
      secondary to the different mechanisms of action of local anesthetic and alpha 2 adrenergic
      agonist. The local anesthetics act by blocking sodium channels, whereas the alpha 2
      adrenergic agonist acts by binding to pre synapyic C fibre and post synaptic dorsal horn
      neurons. Intrathecal alpha 2 adrenergic agonist produce analgesia by depressing the realease
      of C fibre transmission by hyperpolarization of post synaptic dorsal horn neurons. Li et al
      observed that Glutamate is involved in excitatory neurotransmission nociception and plays an
      essential role in relaying noxious stimuli in the spinal cord. Intrathecal injection of alpha
      2 adrenergic agonists produces potent antinociceptive effects by altering spinal
      neurotransmitter release and effectively treats acute pain.
