      The diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) is difficult. The metacholine challenge
      test is not enough specific for the diagnosis of EIB. The exercise challenge test on a cycle
      ergometer is often use to diagnose this condition. This test has very high specificity, but
      not enough sensibility because the ventilation achieved during this test is often not big
      enough to induce a bronchospasm, especially in trained athletes. Eucapnic voluntary
      hyperventilation (EVH) is the recommended test of the Olympic National committee to establish
      the diagnosis of EIB, but there are no study comparing the sensibility and specificity of the
      cycle ergometer challenge test and the isocapnic hyperventilation in an establish population
      of asthmatics. The investigators assume that the sensitivity and specificity of EVH are
      higher than those of the cycle ergometer for the diagnosis of EIB in a population of
      asthmatics with symptoms suggestive of bronchospasm on exertion. In a population of
      asthmatics with exercise symptoms, what is the sensitivity and specificity of EVH and
      exercise challenge on a cycle ergometer for the diagnosis of EIB?

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for the group &quot;exercise-induced bronchospasm&quot;:

          -  The subject must have a diagnosis of asthma according to 2010 Canadian Thoracic
             Society consensus criteria since more then one year.

          -  The subject should have an average expiratory volume per second (FEV1) ≥ 80% of the
             predicted value (post bronchodilatation) at the time of the initial visit.

          -  The subject must have had a positive methacholine test at the first visit of the study
             demonstrating the presence of bronchial hyperreactivity.

          -  The subject must have asthma control as defined by 2010 Canadian Thoracic Society
             consensus, with the obvious exception of limitations related to physical activity.

          -  The subject must have at the questionnaire significant symptoms of exercise-induced
             bronchospasm for more than 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria for the group &quot;healthy&quot;:

          -  The subject should not have a positive history of eczema, urticaria or allergic
             rhinitis for life.

          -  The subject should have a FEV1 ≥ 80% of the predicted value and an FEV1 / FVC (Forced
             vital capacity) ratio of ≥70% at the time of the initial visit.

             date of enrollment of this study.

          -  The subject should not have smoked within the last 6 months.
