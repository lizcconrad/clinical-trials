    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose
      study that will investigate the efficacy and safety of 5.6 mg TNX-102 SL (2 x 2.8 mg
      tablets)â€”a sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine. Following successful screening and
      randomization, eligible patients will have a telephonic visit at week 2 and then return
      regularly to the study clinic for monthly visits for assessments of efficacy and safety.
