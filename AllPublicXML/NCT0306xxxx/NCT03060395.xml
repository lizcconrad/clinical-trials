  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that a number of people experience moderate milk intolerance
      characterised by increased gas production, bloating and abdominal cramp, which can neither be
      attributed to lactose intolerance, nor to milk protein allergy. Milk digestion can lead to
      the formation of bioactive peptides, one of which derived from a mutated gene variant (A1)
      coding for milk beta-casein has been associated with increased gastrointestinal inflammation
      and poor gastrointestinal function. In this study, we hypothesise that consumption of
      non-mutated A2 milk will improve gastrointestinal symptoms in non-lactose milk intolerant
      individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-lactose milk intolerance is a condition that has not been defined clinically yet but the
      current literature reports existence of subjects who are moderately milk intolerant and whose
      intolerance can neither be attributed to a defect in lactose intolerance, nor to milk protein
      allergy. Yet, they experience at least one or two of the following symptoms following milk
      consumption: gases, bloating, abdominal cramp. It is known that the A1gene variant coding for
      beta-casein leads to the production of a bioactive peptide with opioid activity named
      betacasomorphin 7 (BCM7). This peptide has been associated with several metabolic health
      disorders including diabetes, elevated cardiovascular risk and stimulation of
      pro-inflammatory signals. Recently, it was reported that non-lactose milk intolerant subjects
      did not experience such symptoms when consuming milk containing the non-mutated A2 gene
      variant coding for beta-casein. In this study, we hypothesise that consumption of A2 milk
      will improve gastrointestinal symptoms in non-lactose milk intolerant individuals. The
      primary outcome of this study will be the reduction of gastrointestinal inflammation
      following a course of A2 milk consumption.
