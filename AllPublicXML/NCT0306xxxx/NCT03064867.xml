  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the correct dose and safety of adding a new cancer
      drug, venetoclax, to a standard combination of chemotherapy drugs as a second treatment for
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL. In this study, venetoclax will be added to RICE (rituximab,
      ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), a common set to cancer drugs used as a second line
      treatment for relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

      Venetoclax, is a new targeted anti-cancer drug, which works by mimicking a particular protein
      produced by the tumor and interrupting its normal processes, ultimately causing the tumor
      cells to die. Adding venetoclax to the standard RICE regimen is believed to increase the
      chance of getting cancer into remission.

      Venetoclax is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL. Venetoclax has been FDA approved for
      use in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      Primary Objective:

      Establishment of safety of V+RICE in order to identify the recommended Phase II dose (RPD2)

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of V+RICE relative to historical controls of
           RICE alone in r/r DLBCL.

        2. Determine the proportion of patients who proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation
           after V+RICE relative to historical controls.

        3. Describe the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients
           treated with V + RICE who do and do not proceed to auto-Stem Cell Transplant, relative
           to historical controls.

        4. Measure total number of peripheral blood stem cells collected in patients treated with V
           + RICE who proceed to stem cell mobilization/harvesting, compared to historical
           controls.

             per year during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of
             venetoclax or 18 months after the last dose of rituximab, whichever is longer.

        A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not
        reached a postmenopausal state (&lt; 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified
        cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of

             contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined
             below:

        With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom
        plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per
        year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of
        rituximab. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.

        With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the
        treatment period and for at least 6 months after the last dose of rituximab to avoid
        exposing the embryo.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment toxicities have not resolved to ≤ Grade 2 according to NCI CTCAE
             Version 4.0 (except clinically insignificant toxicities such as alopecia).

          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Venetoclax. In addition, these
             subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow
             suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. HIV testing prior to enrollment is
             not required for screening but strongly encouraged for patients with no documented
             prior HIV assessment.

          -  Presence of positive test results for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C (HCV) antibody.

             basal cell carcinoma of the skin, &quot;in-situ&quot; carcinoma of the cervix or breast,
             superficial bladder carcinoma, or previously treated localized prostate cancer with
             normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels). Patients who have had completed all
             anti-cancer treatment for another primary malignancy more than 2 years prior to
             screening are eligible if they are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot;

          -  Known allergy to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase.

          -  Use of warfarin is prohibited. Anticoagulation with low-molecular weight heparin (i.e.
             enoxaparin) or direct thrombin inhibitors is permitted.

          -  The following concomitant medications are not allowed from 7 days prior to the first
             dose of study drug and during venetoclax administration: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors
             including but not limited to fluconazole, ketoconazole, and clarithromycin or strong
             CYP3A4 inducers included but not limited to rifampin, carbamazepine.

          -  Receipt of live-virus vaccines within 28 days prior to the initiation of study
             treatment or need for live-virus vaccines at any time during study treatment.

          -  Concomitant medications that fall into the categories below could potentially lead to
             adverse reactions and should be considered with caution.

               -  Moderate/Weak CYP3A inducers such as efavirenz and oxcarbazepine

               -  CYP2C8 substrates such as thiazolidinediones (glitazones) and select statins
                  (because of expected inhibition of the metabolism of CYP2C8 substrates) by
                  venetoclax

               -  CYP2C9 substrates such as tolbutamide (because of expected inhibition of the
                  metabolism of CYP2C9 substrates by venetoclax. It is recommended to exclude
                  CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index such as phenytoin.
