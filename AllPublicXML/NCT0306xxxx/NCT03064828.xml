    <textblock>
      This preliminary clinical trial aims to evaluate the performance of the low-dose CT
      colonoscopy (CTC) with computer aided detection (CAD) on polyps detection compared with
      optical colonoscopy (OC), and explore the possible clinical routine for integrated use of CT
      colonoscopy and optical colonoscopy OC in colorectal cancer screening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT colonoscopy (CTC), also referred to as virtual colonoscopy (VC), utilizes computer
      virtual-reality techniques to navigate inside a three-dimensional patient-specific colon
      model reconstructed from abdominal CT images, looking for colonic lesions, full bowel
      preparation and colon inflation are needed to perform CTC examination. The clinical trial
      consists of two major parts:

        1. Comparative study on the performance of CTC and OC: 50 subjects will be recruited in
           this part with written consents. With full bowel preparation, all the volunteers receive
           CT scans first with inflated colon, then OC followed by the same day, and necessary
           pathological analysis thereafter. The performance of CTC based on high-resolution CT
           data, including the number of polyps detected, size, position, etc, will be validated by
           that of OC with the paired comparison.

        2. Integrate use of low-dose CTC with OC for colorectal cancer screening: After the
           validation of CTC performance, in this part, another 50 subjects will be recruited to
           explore the integrated use of CTC with OC as a possible and efficient workflow for
           colorectal cancer screening. In this part, a combination of normal dose and low-dose
           scan protocols will be employed (e.g., normal dose on supine, low-dose on prone),
           low-dose CTC based on the low-dose CT scanning protocol and an artifacts reduction
           technique will be introduced to reduce the radiation risk in screening.
