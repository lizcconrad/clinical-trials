      A study conducted to evaluate the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high
      and very high risk treated by interventional cardiology. Study endpoints:

        1. Achievement of the target LDL-C at 1-year follow-up LDL-C &lt;70 mg / dl in the group of
           very high-risk and LDL-C &lt;100 mg / dL in high-risk patients

        2. Assessment of the lipid profile of the severity of coronary artery disease in patients
           undergoing invasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease

        3. Evaluation of trends in the treatment of lipid-lowering in patients in different years

      The TERCET Zabrze Registry is an observational study of all patients hospitalized due to the
      cardiovascular diseases. The date include information on the hyperlipidaemia treatment,
      clinical characteristics, any treatment modalities and prognosis in this population. Data
      collection is patient-based (not event-based).

      The study population is formed by all-comer patients hospitalized in cardiology wards and
      intensive cardiac care units with a diagnosis of coronary disease, both stable angina, and
      acute coronary syndromes (ACS). For the purpose of this study hyperlipidaemia is defined in
      accordance with European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

      Complete patient demographics; medical history, complete hospitalization data (diagnostic and
      therapeutic), in-hospital and out-hospital results are collected in an electronic form by the
      attending physician. The patients are under constant follow-up for all cause mortality and
      major adverse events.

    <description>The registry compares lipid profile values (assayed by the standard laboratory techniques): total cholesterol (TCh), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and TG (triglycerides) with an intense emphasis on the LDL-C value measured during the inclusion to the registry, with MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events) and a control lipid profile measurement, depending on the therapy form (revascularization followed by an intensified pharmacological treatment/revascularization only/pharmacological treatment only). The information regarding MACE is acquired from the NFZ (National Health Fund; polish healthcare provider). Using the statistical analysis the influence of an optimised hyperlipidemia treatment on the long-term prognosis will be assessed.</description>

    <description>A comparison of an initial lipid profile values (with an intense emphasis on the LDL-C), assayed by the standard laboratory techniques) and the coronary artery atherosclerosis extensity, and the long-term prognosis in a year after discharge from hospital. The information regarding MACE is acquired from the NFZ (National Health Fund; polish healthcare provider). Using the statistical analysis the influence of an optimised hyperlipidemia treatment on the long-term prognosis will be assessed.</description>

    <description>An observation of TCh, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG serum concentration values (measured by the standard laboratory assay techniques) depending on the period of the Registry function and the date of inclusion to the Registry. This part of the examination will answer how do the physicians adhere to the hyperlipidemia treatment guidelines in Poland and what are the trends in this therapy form.</description>
