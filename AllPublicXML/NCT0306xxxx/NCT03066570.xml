  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To investigate the effects of a cognitive behavioural intervention targeting
      specific fears in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, on physical activity and quality
      of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intervention: Graded Exposure in vivo (GEXP) is a second-generation cognitive-behavioural
      intervention, and is characterized by systematic and repeated exposure to feared movements,
      activities and/or sensations in order to decrease fear and subsequently increase physical
      activity.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The purpose of this project is to develop and test a
      cognitive behavioural intervention targeting specific fears in patients with PDN, in order to
      increase physical activity and improve QOL.
