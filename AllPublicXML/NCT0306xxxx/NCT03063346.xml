    <textblock>
      Overtraining is a real problem for (semi-)professional athletes. Overtraining is often caused
      by the bodies' lack of ability to recover between training. In addition, during high
      intensity training reactive oxygen species are formed up to 20 fold compared to resting
      values. This causes increased muscle tissue damage after intense exercise, which slows down
      recovery. Improving recovery may increase an athlete's ability to reach higher training
      volumes resulting in establishing a higher performance plateau.

      It is known that hydrolyzed proteins have a positive effect on muscle protein synthesis due
      to its faster absorption rate. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a known protein hydrolysate
      may have positive effects on strength recovery.
