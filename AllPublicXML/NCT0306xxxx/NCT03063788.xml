      This study aims to develop a method to accurately image the size and location of HIV
      persistence in HIV-infected individuals. The project aims to combine the broadly neutralizing
      anti-HIV antibody 3BNC117 with a Copper-64 radio isotope for use in a clinical trial.

      The clinical trial has three different stages. The first stage is to recruit two HIV
      uninfected individuals and determine the safety of 3 mg/kg of 3BNC117 combined with Copper-64
      and MRI/PET scanning at 1, 24 and 48 hours post infusion. The second stage is to examine the
      distribution on MRI/PET of the 3BNC117-Copper-64 combination in four HIV-infected individuals
      with viremia who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy. The final stage is to perform the
      same intervention in aviremic people with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy.
