    <textblock>
      'The TOP Study' is a prospective cohort study whose main objective is to develop better
      prognostic biomarkers and identify children at risk of adverse thrombotic outcomes very early
      in the course after an initial venous thromboembolic events (VTE). The study will compare
      biomarkers in children that develop poor VTE outcomes (such as recurrence, postthrombotic
      syndrome and post PE impairment ) after an initial VTE with those that do not develop such
      outcomes.

      All newly diagnosed patients with a first radiologically confirmed thrombotic event (any
      site) diagnosed at Children's Medical Center, Dallas will be followed prospectively with
      global coagulation assessment over a 24-month period, and monitored for development of
      carefully defined adverse VTE outcomes in a blinded manner. Biomarker assessment will include
      global coagulation assays (thrombin generation assay and modified thromboelastography to
      study fibrinolysis) at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post VTE diagnosis.
