    <textblock>
      No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested for safety endpoints in this trial. Based on
      the well tolerated safety profile from a global phase 3 study, it is hypothesized that
      talimogene laherparepvec will be safe and well tolerated in Japanese subjects with
      unresectable Stage IIIB-IVM1c melanoma. A DRR is hypothesized to be consistent with results
      from the global phase 3 study

    <description>T-VEC will be administered by intralesional injection only into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumors, with or without image ultrasound guidance. On day 1 (week 0) the first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be up to 4.0 mL of 106 PFU/mL. The second injection up to 4.0 mL of 108 or 107 PFU/mL, should be administered 3 weeks (+ 5) days after the initial injection (no sooner than day 22 but should not be delayed more than 5 days after the 21-day time point). The dose of 108 PFU/mL will be diluted 1:10 to obtain a concentration of 107 PFU/mL immediately prior to injection. Subsequent injections up to 4.0 mL of 108 or 107 PFU/mL should be given every 2 wks (Â± 3) days. The maximum volume of talimogene laherparepvec to be administered at each treatment visit is 4.0 mL</description>
