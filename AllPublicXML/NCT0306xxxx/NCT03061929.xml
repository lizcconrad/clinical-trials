  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional profile of mother's milk is influenced by various factors including
      environmental, dietary and nutritional status of the mother. Given the huge diversity noted
      in nutritional status and ethnic dietary patterns in Indian population, including pregnant
      and lactating mothers, it can be conceivably predicted to have an influence on milk
      composition. With the lack of recent literature addressing these, it is vital to understand
      and update the influence if any, of nutritional status and dietary patterns on nutritional
      quality of human milk. The proposed Human milk analysis clinical study in Indian mothers is
      aimed to achieve a more recent and updated database of nutritional profile of Indian mother's
      milk considering the dietary and regional influences and demographic differences which can
      play a key role in levels of nutrients in mother's milk. In order to incorporate the varied
      dietary patterns, milk samples will be collected from mothers recruited from 8 sites across
      the country and analysed for important nutrient levels.

      The study is a 5-month prospective observational cohort study. Approximately 258
      mother-infant pairs in 33-42 weeks of pregnancy will be recruited. Eligibility assessment
      will be done for the mother at enrolment and for the mother-infant pair at delivery. Based on
      the recorded anthropometric data and BMI (kg/m2) calculated based on the self-reported
      pre-pregnancy weight or earliest recorded body weight from their first trimester, mothers
      consenting to the study will be categorized as either well-nourished or malnourished. All
      study centers will recruit equal number of participants in each group at their respective
      sites. As per standard of care, mothers will continue to take the prenatal supplement
      primarily consisting of folic acid, elemental iron, calcium and will be encouraged to breast
      feed their infants during prenatal visits. Breastfeeding advice normally consists of messages
      on the benefits of breastfeeding, instructions on early initiation of breastfeeding and
      proper breastfeeding techniques, and recommendation on exclusive breastfeeding for the first
      6 months. Mothers will be provided with a diary to make a note about their supplement intake
      and the frequency of breastfeeding. The entry of the details will be enquired telephonically
      (biweekly) and restated during the face follow-up sessions at study visits 3 and 4.

        258 mother-infant pair subjects (86 per group) will be enrolled. The mothers will be
        normally-nourished or undernourished or over nourished based on pre-pregnancy measured BMI
        (kg/m2).
