    <textblock>
      Background

      Ovarian cancer (OC) is a disease with a poor prognosis due to diagnosis at late stage.
      Early-stage OC presents with non-specific and vague symptoms and therefore OC usually is not
      detected until reaching an advanced stage. From 2008, Danish general practitioners (GPs)
      could urgently refer patients suspected of having OC to standardized cancer patient pathways
      (CPPs). The CPP is designed for women presenting specific signs and alarm symptoms, and is
      supposed to shorten the pathway from suspicion to treatment.

      Hypothesis

      Direct access to fast transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) through general practice is feasible in
      earlier diagnosis of OC.

      Aim

      The aim of this study is to assess the implementation and clinical implications of direct
      referral access to fast TVU through general practice.

      Materials and methods

      The study is a feasibility study and GPs from in Central Denmark Region are offered direct
      access to fast TVU for women aged 40 years or more who present symptoms that could origin
      from OC, but which are not classified as alarm symptoms. The GPs will receive education about
      updated knowledge on OC symptoms and the use of the guideline for earlier diagnosis of OC in
      general practice. The study period is 1 year.

      Perspectives

      There is a great need to test rational strategies for diagnosing OC at an earlier stage in
      order to improve survival. For women who do not fulfil access criteria for the CPP, and for
      whom the main prospect for earlier diagnosis is improved identification of symptomatic OC,
      this study may provide important new knowledge of how to facilitate the diagnostics of OC in
      the future and reduce time to diagnosis and improve survival.

  <detailed_description>

      Background

      Around 550 ovarian cancers (OCs) are diagnosed yearly in Denmark. Still, OC is the fourth
      commonest cause of cancer death amongst women in Denmark. Epithelial ovarian cancers
      (carcinomas) account for more than 90% of all OCs and Denmark has the second highest
      incidence in the world (15 per 100.000 women) with a life-time risk around 2%. The mean age
      at diagnosis is 63 years, and 80% are postmenopausal. In Denmark, 74% are diagnosed in FIGO
      stage III-IV and therefore at the time of diagnosis have regional or metastatic spread.
      Five-year survival with FIGO stage I is 83%, stage II 62%, stage III 23% and stage IV 11%.
      Thus, OC is detected at advanced stages with a very poor prognosis.

      In 2008, a national fast-track system for cancer patients was established to ensure fast
      diagnosis and initiation of treatment. The fast-track system or cancer patient pathway (CPP)
      implies that patients presenting 'alarm' symptoms of e.g. OC will be referred immediately for
      diagnostic workup; no more than 14 days must pass from referral to initiation of treatment.
      Only about one quarter of the women with OC are referred primarily through this route.
      Therefore, additional accelerated routes are needed for the majority of women with OC.

      A possibility could be access to fast TVU through general practice for women presenting with
      vague and non-specific symptoms that may represent underlying OC.

      Aim

      Develop and conduct training for general practitioners (GPs) in the latest knowledge of OC
      symptomatology. And at the same time investigate the feasibility and clinical implications in
      general practice of direct referral access to fast TVU, intended for women presenting with
      vague and non-specific symptoms.

      Material and methods

      GPs in Central Denmark Region are offered direct access to fast TVU for women aged 40 years
      or more who present vague and non-specific symptoms that could origin from OC, but which are
      not classified as alarm symptoms. Shortly afterwards all the GPs are offered a short lecture
      on OC symptomatology and instructions for the use of TVU for earlier diagnosis of OC through
      general practice. The lecture will be conducted by researchers from the research group.

      Prior to investigation, all women who are referred to TVU will receive a consent form and a
      symptom-questionnaire. The symptom questionnaire focuses on the experienced symptoms during
      the past year.

      After finished investigation, the TVU test results will return electronically to the
      referring GP.

      The study period is one year. Data analysis will focus on the frequency of TVU use in general
      practice, action taken on test results and patient-reported symptoms prior to TVU.

      Perspectives

      The project will provide important new knowledge of the GPs referral practice when they
      suspect OC. For women presenting with vague and non-specific symptoms that may origin from
      OC, the introduction of TVU through general practice will provide new possibilities for
      evaluating the symptoms. Therefor introduction of TVU is a corner stone in the identification
      of more efficient ways to evaluate women at risk of developing OC.

      This study will contribute with important knowledge of how to improve the diagnostics of OC
      in the future and may reduce time to diagnosis.
