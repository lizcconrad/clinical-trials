  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of concurrent
      administration of influenza vaccine in patients receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy (nivolumab
      or pembrolizumab). This will be a prospective observational study, aiming to assess patient
      tolerance of treatment, adverse events (incidence, grade, need for hospitalization),
      incidence of influenza infections, and seroconversion rates.
