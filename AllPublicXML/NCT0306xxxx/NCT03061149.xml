  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is considered to be the most common entrapment neuropathy.
      Conservative treatment is recommended in the mild and moderate stage of CTS. The aim of this
      trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy modalities in carpal tunnel
      syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conservative treatment is recommended in the mild and moderate stage of CTS and should
      involve splinting, steroid injections, oral steroids and ultrasounds .

      However, the results of some research studies have showed the beneficial effect of
      photobiomodulation as well as nerve and tendon gliding exercises in non-operative treatment .

      Patients were divided into two groups. The one group received low-level laser therapy (LLLT);
      the other group underwent ultrasound treatment. Additionally, nerve and gliding exercises
      were administered in both groups.

      The purpose of this trial is to assess the therapeutic efficacy of ultrasound treatment and
      low-level laser therapy combined with nerve and tendon gliding exercises and to compare the
      two regimens.

    <measure>The measurement of hand grip strength in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome after physical therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Jamar dynamometer (Sammons Preston, Canada) is used to assess hand grip strength; the mean score of three consecutive trials is accepted for each strength measurement. The result is expressed in kilogram [kg]. The evaluation is performed before and after treatment.</description>

    <description>The group received low-level laser therapy (LLLT). The application of a GaAlAs infrared laser with a pencil probe (BTL 5000 Combi, United Kingdom; at 830 nm, 9J/cm2 per point, power output of 100 mW, beam diameter of 5 mm) was performed at five points along the median nerve on the palmar side of the wrist 7. The time of exposure was 10 minutes (2 minutes per point). Both the patient and the therapist wore protective glasses during every session.A total of 10 therapeutic sessions were performed during a period of two weeks (five session times per week).
Additionally, nerve and gliding exercises were administered.</description>

    <description>The group underwent ultrasound treatment. Ultrasound treatment was administered at a frequency of 1 MHz, intensity of 1 W/cm2 ,pulsed mode duty cycle of 1:4 and with a handhold transducer of 5 cm2 (BTL 5000 Combi, UK). The time of application was 6 minutes over the area of the carpal tunnel. Aquasonic gel was used as a couplant. A total of 10 therapeutic sessions were performed during a period of two weeks (five session times per week). Additionally, nerve and gliding exercises were administered.</description>
