  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RAMEC is a phase II, multi-center, randomized trial with a safety test. There will be a
      safety test to establish the safety and tolerability of Neo-MASCT treatment and assess the
      immune response to the treatment.The randomized trial will assess DFS and immune response.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety test will recruit 10 patients. Following registration they will receive 3 cycles
      of Neo-MASCT treatment. Patients will be seen at week 1, week 2 and week 4 of every cycle.

      Following the safety test, 98 patients will be randomized to the trial across 3 recruiting
      centers. All patients on the treatment arm will complete up to 18 cycles of Neo-MASCT
      treatment. Patients on the control arm will be actively monitored after randomization. Blood
      samples for immune response test will be taken at baseline, cycle 1day 1 and then 3 monthly
      on day 1 of the subsequent cycles. The planned treatment duration will be until relapse of
      disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. The end of the trial will be 24
      months after the recruitment of the last patient.
