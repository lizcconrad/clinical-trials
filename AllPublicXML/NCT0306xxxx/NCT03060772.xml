  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, open-label, randomized clinical trial to determine the effect
      of pioglitazone (PIO) treatment on alveolar macrophage immune function, redox stress, and
      NADPH oxidase expression in outpatient alcoholic subjects. The researchers will recruit a
      cohort of otherwise healthy patients with an alcoholic use disorder from the Substance Abuse
      Treatment Program at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center and randomize them to
      receive the usual treatment for two to four weeks or to the usual treatment plus PIO
      treatment for two to four weeks. There will also be a healthy control group (matched on age,
      gender, and smoking status) that will receive no treatment. To measure the effect of
      pioglitazone, participants will undergo a bronchoscopy before taking the study drug and then
      again 2-4 weeks later to look for changes. The bronchoscopy will allow researchers to obtain
      fluid from the lungs to see how well their immune cells respond to bacteria by determining
      phagocytic capacity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse is a major burden on society and an enormous problem in the veteran population.
      Many people are aware that chronic alcohol ingestion can cause serious health problems like
      liver injury and brain damage but chronic alcohol consumption can also hurt the lungs. People
      who regularly drink more than the daily maximum levels recommended by the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) (1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men) are more
      likely to suffer from pneumonia and acute lung injuries.

      The primary goal of this clinical research study is to determine if a Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved diabetes drug, called pioglitazone, can improve the lung immune
      defenses in otherwise healthy alcoholics. There is strong evidence from experimental animal
      models that pioglitazone preserves lung health even during daily alcohol ingestion.

      This National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded project will recruit veterans who are
      patients at the Atlanta VA Hospital. Half of the participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive pioglitazone and half will be assigned to receive no treatment. Participants assigned
      to pioglitazone will take the pill once per day for two to four weeks. To measure the effect
      of pioglitazone, participants will undergo a procedure called a bronchoscopy before taking
      the study drug and then again 2-4 weeks later to look for changes. The bronchoscopy will
      allow researchers to obtain fluid from the lungs to see how well their immune cells respond
      to bacteria (by determining phagocytic capacity). The researchers also plan to enroll 12
      healthy veteran patients who do not drink. These participants will undergo a one-time
      bronchoscopy and no other visits will be required of them.

      The findings from this study will guide future, larger scale clinical trials to determine if
      pioglitazone can be used in the clinical setting to improve outcomes in alcoholics who
      develop pneumonia or acute lung injury.

    <time_frame>Baseline, After 2-4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in phagocytic index will be determined between the alcohol use disorder study arms to examine the effect of PIO treatment. Phagocytic index of the alveolar macrophage is the rate at which particles are cleared from a culture. The phagocytic index is a well-established marker of immune function and its improvement with pioglitazone (PIO) treatment would indicate reversal of the alcoholic lung phenotype. The phagocytic index will be measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids.</description>

    <measure>Change in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH oxidase)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After 2-4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH oxidase) will be determined between the alcohol use disorder study arms to examine the effect of PIO treatment. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH oxidase) is an enzyme complex. NADPH oxidases are the primary sources of oxidative stress in the alveolar macrophage. Chronic alcohol consumption causes pulmonary oxidative stress via increased expression and activity of NADPH oxidases. NADPH oxidases will be measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids.</description>

    <measure>Change in alveolar macrophage oxidative stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After 2-4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in alveolar macrophage oxidative stress will be determined between the alcohol use disorder study arms to examine the effect of PIO treatment. The alveolar macrophage plays a crucial role in lung immunity by protecting the individual from developing respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Alcohol-induced oxidative stress impairs the ability of the alveolar macrophage to function normally. A decrease in alveolar oxidative stress with pioglitazone treatment would indicate that the treatment is having a positive impact. This outcome will be measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids.</description>

    <measure>Change in redox couple glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, After 2-4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in redox couple glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) will be determined between the alcohol use disorder study arms to examine the effect of PIO treatment. Glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is a redox (a chemical reaction) which is frequently measured as an indicator of oxidative stress. The antioxidant GSH reduces to GSSG and in a healthy state there is greater than 90% GSH to less than 10% GSSG. Chronic alcohol consumption causes pulmonary oxidative stress via decreased levels of GSH. GSH and GSSG will be measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) fluids.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, After 2-4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in cysteine/cystine (Cys/CySS) redox potential will be determined between the alcohol use disorder study arms to examine the effect of PIO treatment. Cysteine (Cys)/cystine (CySS) is a redox (a chemical reaction) regulating a variety of biological processes. CySS is the oxidized form of Cys and the ratio is sensitive to alcohol abuse, among other environmental exposures. Cys and CySS will be measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) fluids.</description>

    <description>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH oxidase) will be compared between the PIO treatment arm and the healthy control arm to determine if PIO treatment leads to normal function. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH oxidase) is an enzyme complex. NADPH oxidases are the primary sources of oxidative stress in the alveolar macrophage. Chronic alcohol consumption causes pulmonary oxidative stress via increased expression and activity of NADPH oxidases. NADPH oxidases will be measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids.</description>
