      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of integrating family caregiver support into
      cancer clinical trials on the well-being of the caregiver, the care-recipient and on the
      cancer clinical trial system. This study will allow us to examine the benefit of adding a
      personalized support program for the family caregiver of a patients participating in a cancer
      clinical trial. Findings will assist in strengthening patient/caregiver-centered care
      management and support programs developed to enhance the quality of life of patients with
      cancer and the caregivers, reduce barriers to clinical recruitment, and improve retention in
      clinical trials.
