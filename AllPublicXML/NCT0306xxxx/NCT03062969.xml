  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shortly after the implementation of Comprehensive Chromosome Screening (CCS) techniques for
      Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) came the transition in biopsy timing. Trophectoderm
      biopsy is meant to overcome the limitations of cleavage stage biopsy and single cell
      analysis.

      The investigators have recently introduced this new approach and a frozen-thawed policy of
      euploid blastocysts is routinely performed.

      This is a single centre retrospective study in patients undergoing a PGS cycle. The aim of
      the study is to assess the results obtained in a PGS programme after the implementation of a
      new biopsy timing and transfer policy. Results obtained in PGS cycles with blastocyst biopsy
      and frozen-thawed embryo transfer were analysed in comparison to cycles with cleavage stage
      biopsy and fresh blastocyst transfer.
