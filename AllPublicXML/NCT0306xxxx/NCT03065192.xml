      Safety and efficacy of AADC gene transfer in participants with Parkinson's disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving loss of dopamine producing
      neurons located in the striatum. Levodopa is the primary treatment used to treat Parkinson's
      disease, which converts to dopamine by the enzyme (protein) Aromatic L-Amino Acid
      Decarboxylase (AADC). As PD progresses, the amount of AADC levels in the brain decreases, and
      in turn, reduces the amount of dopamine that is produced with each dose of levodopa.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of increasing AADC levels, via
      gene delivery. The investigational drug, termed VY-AADC-01, will be injected directly into
      the striatum during a neurosurgical procedure that is performed with real-time MRI imaging to
      monitor delivery.

      Participants will continue to take their Parkinson medications, including levodopa while
      participating in this study.

      The safety and potential clinical responses to VY-AADC-01 will be assessed by repeated
      clinical evaluations of Parkinson's disease, treatment review phone calls, cognitive tests,
      laboratory blood tests, patient reported outcomes scales, patient diaries, collection of
      adverse events, and neuro-imaging. Clinical evaluations will be performed over a 3 year
      follow-up period.
