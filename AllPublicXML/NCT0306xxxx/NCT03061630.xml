      Previously-untreated, high-risk (&gt;T3 and/or N+) muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)

      Screening numbers are endowed to all patients who sign the informed consent forms. These
      screening numbers are used as 'Subject Identification Code&quot; along with patient initials.
      Patients withdrawn from the study retain their screening number. New patients must always be
      allotted with a new screening number. The study population includes chemotherapy-naïve adults
      with high-risk MIBC. Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria will receive cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on
      days 1, 8 and 15. On day 1, adequate hydration and antiemetics are needed. Study chemotherapy
      will repeat every 4 weeks on an outpatient basis and continued until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, deterioration of clinical condition, patient refusal, or up to 2 or 3
      cycles, depending on the operation schedules.

      Patients will be seen every 4 weeks. All study subjects will be also eligible to receive best
      supportive care (BSC) defined as any standard supportive measures that are not considered a
      primary treatment of the disease under study, including the use of growth factors (i.e.
      G-CSF) for myelosuppression, bisphosphonates for management of skeletal metastases,
      analgesics and transfusion of blood products. BSC will be provided at the discretion of the
      investigators.

             deemed irreversible by the investigator.

          7. Adequate marrow function without growth factor support or transfusion dependency

          8. Adequate renal function with serum creatinine 1.5 x ULN or a calculated creatinine
             clearance ≥ 60 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD formulas

          9. Adequate hepatic function

         10. Must agree to use an adequate method of contraception if the patient is sexually
             active, during and for 12 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy

             infarction within the last 3 years, (NYHA) grade III or greater congestive heart
             failure, cerebrovascular attack within the prior year, or current serious cardiac

         10. Subject with legal incapacity or limited legal capacity. Dementia or significantly
