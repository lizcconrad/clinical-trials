  <brief_summary>

      To determine if an asthma navigator is helpful in improving communication between care
      providers and improving patient adherence to asthma medications after an asthma exacerbation.

      This study will aim to use technology to evaluate the effectiveness of a patient navigator
      for childhood asthma. The Investigators will place adherence monitoring devices on patient
      inhalers, and track use of patient asthma medicines. The Investigators will also utilize an
      asthma navigator who will discuss adherence with families and help to address any barriers to
      adherence that families identify. Additionally, the navigator will communicate patient
      specific adherence information to the patient's primary care physician (PCP) and school
      nurse. The adherence monitor will monitor communications between these providers.
