  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine feasibility, acceptability, safety, and preliminary efficacy of
      trauma-focused Equine-Assisted Therapy (EAT) for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). While several well-studied, validated treatments for PTSD exist, some individuals
      find these treatments ill-suited, ineffective, or undesirable. EAT is an alternative therapy
      widely used by organizations, such as PATH International Equine Services, that endorse its
      effectiveness for treating a variety of mental health issues. These claims have drawn
      criticism because the published research contains glaring methodological flaws, making it
      difficult to assess how effective these therapies actually are (Anestis et al., 2014).
      Equine-assisted therapies present a unique treatment modality that might effectively treat
      PTSD, particularly for individuals who have difficulty with other treatment modalities. In
      EAT, a psychotherapist and equine specialist work together to help the patients negotiate
      interactions with a horse using structured interventions or activities.

      In this pilot study the investigators will develop the EAT intervention and determine whether
      research methods (evaluation interviews, assessment measures, videotaping procedures) are
      acceptable to participants. Specifically, the investigators will focus on issues such as
      session length, appropriateness of the &quot;content&quot; for treatment of PTSD, ordering of session
      content, adherence to the manual of the equine therapeutic team (based on observations made
      during supervision and feedback from the consultants), and will detail logistics of data
      collection and how best to record the sessions (camera angles, etc.).
