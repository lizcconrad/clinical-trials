  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic liver cancers is
      one the most common malignancies in the world. Over 10000 new cases per year are diagnosed in
      Taiwan. Despite the many treatment options, the prognosis of HCC remains dismal. More than
      8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. A majority (70% to 85%) of patients
      present with advanced or unresectable disease. In contrast, small liver cancers can be cured
      with an appreciable frequency. Five-year disease-free survival exceeding 50% has been
      reported for surgical resection, and for the inoperable patients who do not have vascular
      invasion or extrahepatic spread. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recommended as an
      alternative curative therapy. However, the main drawback of RFA is its limitation to tumor
      size and location. The tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter or located adjacent to vessels,
      could not be ablated completely sometimes. Microwave ablation (MWA) can ablate tumor by
      higher temperature than RFA, so is supposed not to be diminished by adjacent vessels.

      Several pre-clinical studies have already demonstrated microwave ablation (MWA) is a safe and
      effective treatment for live cancers. The system (Emprint Microwave Ablation system) with
      2.45 GHz microwave generator the investigators will use has been approved as safe by the
      European Union (EU) in 2009 and received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2014.
      However, there are still few experiences in using MWA for tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this
      study, we will perform MWA for 40 inoperable patients with liver cancers adjacent to vessels
      who are suitable to receive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in our hospital. The investigators
      will evaluate the potential side effect and ablate effect of tumors by abdominal computed
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the investigators will also
      follow-up this patients for 1 years to evaluate the overall survival and local recurrence
      rate. The investigators will appraisal the clinical feasibility and advantage of the system
      by this study.
