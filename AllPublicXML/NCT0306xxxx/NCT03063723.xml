  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently,surprisingly and unexpectedly increased aggressiveness and high rates of HCC
      recurrence (28%(16/58) and 29%(17/59), respectively) have been reported in patients who
      cleared HCV with DAAs after achieving a complete response to resection or local ablation
      within only 6 months of therapy. The authors hypothesized that the rapid eradication of HCV
      and control of liver inflammation would impact anti-tumoral immune control, which in turn
      might contribute to the neoplastic cells proliferation. Conversely, three independent
      prospective French cohorts failed to reveal an increased risk of HCC recurrence after DAAs
      treatment in CHC patients after receiving curative cancer treatments.Although the impact of
      DAAs treatment on the rate of HCC occurrence or recurrence still remain unclear, it would be
      more important to pay attention to the immunological changes of CHC patients treated with
      DAAs.Up to now, little was known about the immunological changes of chronic hepatitis C (CHC)
      patients treated with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), here we try to explore the
      effect of antiviral treatment of CHC patients with DAAs on the frequency of monocytes, NK
      cells and cytokines that promote their activation.

      15 treatment-naive CHC patients and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Patients were
      examined before DAAs therapy (0w) and at weeks 4 (4w) and weeks 12 (12w) of the therapy. The
      percentage of monocytes,NK cells of the peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry.
      Serum cytokines IL-12, IL-18, CXCL10, CXCL11, sCD14 and sCD163 were measured by enzyme linked
      immunosorbent assay.
