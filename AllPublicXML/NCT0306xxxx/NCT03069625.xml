  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic hereditary respiratory disease. Exercise testing is part of
      CF patients regular assessment.

      Cardio-Pulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) is currently considered as the gold standard to
      assess physical capacities. However, simple field tests are emerging. These tests are easier
      to perform especially in a population of CF children and adolescents.

      The 1minute Sit-To-Stand test have recently been evaluated in CF adults. This test correlates
      with maximal oxygen consumption during CPET.

      The investigators hypothesized that this test also correlates with 6-Minute Walking distance
      (during a 6-min Walk Test), quadriceps strength, respiratory muscles strength and
      health-related quality of life.
