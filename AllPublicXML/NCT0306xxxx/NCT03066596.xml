  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research study is to test the effectiveness of a multifaceted and
      multi-level prompting intervention in a real world urban primary care office setting on
      improving provider-delivered guideline-based asthma care and reducing asthma morbidity among
      urban children with persistent or uncontrolled asthma.

      Investigators will conduct a cluster randomized trial comparing the intervention to enhanced
      usual care (eUC) in 20 Bronx practices serving over 5,000 children ages 2-12 years with
      persistent or uncontrolled asthma. Eleven eUC practices will receive guideline information
      and assess children's asthma severity and control, but active intervention components will
      not be provided. Practices will join the study in 4 waves over 4 years (4-6 practices per
      year). Provider adoption of guidelines and utilization of care in all patients (~5,000) ages
      2-12 years with persistent or uncontrolled asthma from intervention and eUC practices will be
      evaluated using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data and practice-based screening for asthma
      severity and control. Investigators will also enroll a random subset of 512 caregivers of
      children with persistent/uncontrolled asthma from both study arms to systematically evaluate
      caregiver-reported child morbidity outcomes and obtain measures not available in EHR.

      Intervention consists of academic detailing in the EHR that follow national asthma guidelines
      and outreach worker care coordination for patients with persistent or uncontrolled asthma.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The criteria listed below will apply to ~5,000 children from eMPI and eUC practices:

          -  Physician-diagnosed asthma (based on EHR).

          -  Persistent or uncontrolled asthma as per clinic assessment. Based on NHLBI guidelines,
             any one of the following: in past month, &gt; 2 days/week with asthma symptoms, &gt;2
             days/week with rescue medication use, &gt;2 days/month with nighttime symptoms, or &gt; 2
             episodes in the past year that required systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Age 2 and 12 years, inclusive.

        Additional inclusion criteria will apply to a subset of 512 of children whose caregivers
        will be interviewed to obtain caregiver-reported morbidity outcomes:

          -  Caregiver is able to speak and understand either English or Spanish. Participants
             unable to read will be eligible as all surveys will be administered verbally by
             research personnel.

          -  Consent from the primary caregiver, caregiver permission for the child to participate
             as well as assent from the child (&gt;7 years). If there are eligible siblings, only one
             child will be randomly selected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The child has other significant medical conditions, such as congenital heart disease,
             cystic fibrosis, or other chronic lung disease, that could interfere with the
             assessment of asthma-related measures.

        Additional exclusion criteria will apply to a subset of 512 children/caregivers as
        described above:

          -  No access to a telephone to conduct follow-up surveys.

          -  Children in foster care or other situations in which consent cannot be obtained from a
             guardian.
