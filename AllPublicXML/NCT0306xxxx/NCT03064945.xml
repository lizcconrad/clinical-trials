      This is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, single-arm, crossover, double-blind clinical
      study assessing the Livia Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) in women
      suffering from dysmenorrhea. The study will be conducted at community clinics. Advertisement
      will be used to publish and promote recruitment.

      The study will include 3 visits: Screening visit and two consecutive visits each one after
      monthly menstrual period. Treatment will be self-administrated and during the study, the
      subjects will be requested to complete home diaries.

    <time_frame>3 days before the beginning of the menstrual period and up to three days after termination of the menstrual period.</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will rank the severity of her dysmenorrhea symptoms before and after the device use on the VAS scale from 0 to 100, where 0 determines- &quot;No pain&quot; and 100 determines &quot;Very painful&quot;. Then, the difference between the two measurements will be calculated.</description>
