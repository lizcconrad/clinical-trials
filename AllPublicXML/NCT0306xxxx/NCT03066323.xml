      This study is designed as a randomized, single blind (data evaluation), placebo controlled,
      full cross-over study and conducted in 166 (including 10% drop out) males and females, aged ≥
      18 and ≤ 65 and waist circumference of &gt;80 cm for women and &gt;94 cm for men (indicating
      increased risk of metabolic complications (WHO)) and having a sedentary lifestyle. Subjects
      will receive rice with a tea extract and rice without a tea extract.

      There will be three visits to the test facility: one screening visit and two intervention
      visits. During the intervention visits venous blood samples will be collected for the
      analysis of plasma glucose (t = -30m, -5m, 15m, 30m, 45m, 1h, 1h 30m, 2h and 3h, relative to
      the start of rice consumption ) and serum insulin (t = -5m, 30m, 1h, 2h and 3h).

      Between the two intervention visits subjects have an interval of one week. This interval is
      required to minimize subject discomfort from repeated blood sampling.
