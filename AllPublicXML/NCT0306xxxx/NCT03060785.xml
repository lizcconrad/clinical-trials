  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, steady-state study of Tenofovir (TFV) and Emtricitabine (FTC)
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in transgender women taking feminizing hormones. Half of the
      participants will be transgender women on feminizing hormones, the other half will be male
      volunteers not taking any hormone therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an open-label, steady-state study of TFV and FTC PK in blood and
      colon tissue in healthy TGW on feminizing hormones to be compared to healthy cis men, all at
      risk for HIV infection. Research participants will already have received eight days of
      TDF/FTC dosing. Evaluating TDF and FTC PK at steady-state is important as it reduces
      inter-individual variability since the rate of phosphorylation of TFV and FTC is highly
      variable, resulting in highly variable TFV-DP and Emtricitabine-Triphosphate (FTC-TP) PK
      among individuals in the first day and during rise to steady-state.
