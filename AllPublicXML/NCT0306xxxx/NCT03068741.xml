  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis occurs when a serious infection - most commonly infection of the lungs, urinary
      system, or blood - leads to acute organ failure. It is a common, expensive, and frequently
      lethal condition. A growing body of evidence suggests that early recognition and treatment of
      sepsis can improve survival.

      Unfortunately, many patients with sepsis do not receive key therapies until physicians
      working in Emergency Departments have assessed them - often introducing marked delays. It is
      estimated that one‚Äêhalf of patients with sepsis are treated and transported to hospital by
      paramedics. This allows paramedics a unique opportunity to provide early treatment at the
      initial point of patient contact, thereby decreasing the time to treatment for these
      critically ill patients. This randomized controlled trial will evaluate whether prompt
      recognition followed by early antibiotics and/or intravenous fluids delivered by paramedics
      in the field leads to improved survival, compared to usual care, for patients who are
      transported to the hospital with sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of this research program is to evaluate a fundamental change in the
      delivery of sepsis care. Currently, patients with severe sepsis do not receive key
      evidence-based therapies until they have been assessed in emergency departments - often
      introducing considerable delays. This research tests whether integrating paramedics directly
      into a chain-of-survival for sepsis will improve outcomes for these critically ill patients.
      In essence, this research seeks to break down silos of care, delivering sepsis treatments
      based on when they are needed, rather than on where the patient is physically located. If the
      trial is positive, the results will have broad implications for other health systems by
      showing that prehospital identification and treatment of sepsis increases the number of
      patients that survive this life-threatening condition. If the trial fails to demonstrate
      effectiveness of prehospital sepsis treatments, it will ensure that resources are not
      needlessly invested in large-scale implementations of paramedic sepsis protocols, as has been
      done in several other jurisdictions. A lack of benefit would also cast doubt on the
      observational data suggesting that early antibiotics are important, and suggest a more
      restrained approach to empiric antibiotic therapy.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 2x2 factorial RCT, with simultaneous randomization of individual patients into 2 randomized controlled trials.
The first RCT compares administration of 1g of intramuscular ceftriaxone versus placebo. In this RCT, participants, care providers, investigators, and outcome assessors will all be masked to the treatment allocation.
The second RCT compares a liberal fluid resuscitation (up to 2litres of intravenous 0.9% saline) versus conventional resuscitation (administration of intravenous 0.9% saline, started only when systolic blood pressure is &lt;90mmHg and only continued until systolic blood pressure is &gt;= 100mmHg). In this RCT, only participants and outcome assessors will be masked.</intervention_model_description>
