      Play encourages the development of a child's social and cognitive skills. Playgroups are
      interactive environments that facilitate these developmental abilities and provide
      opportunities for parents to engage with their children. A lack of play can have negative
      effects on a child's development and may result in a decline in social participation.

      Objective: The purpose of this research is to investigate if children between the ages of 15
      months and 5 years old demonstrate improved levels of playfulness, social- emotional growth,
      and participation through playgroup intervention, provided in various settings in the
      community. Investigators will also examine the impact that these playgroups have on
      participating caregiver's confidence levels in regards to their abilities in taking their
      child/children on outings in the community.

      Method: A quasi-experimental stepped-wedge design with one way cross-over will be used. This
      study will look at the effectiveness of all playgroups, and then determine differences in the
      three groups: 25 pairs will be in a control standard of care early intervention playgroup, 25
      pairs will take part in a occupational therapy led playgroup,and 25 pairs will be
      participating in a standard of care early intervention playgroup with additional occupational
      therapy support. The control site will be the same site as the support playgroup (cross-over,
      wait-list). The Test of Playfulness will measure child playfulness, the Social Profile and
      Assessment of Preschool Children's Participation play sub scale will determine child
      participation, the Devereux Early Childhood Assessment will determine social emotional
      growth, and the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale will determine the caregiver sense of
      competence. Mean differences will be analyzed using a mixed analysis of variance to determine
      significant changes over time for each group. We hypothesize that playgroups will have a
      significant effect on child playfulness, social-emotional growth, participation, and parent
      competence.

      All children have the right to play; the right to play is enshrined in Article 31 of the UN
      Convention on the Rights of the Child. Play is the fundamental way that children enjoy their
      childhood. It is essential to their quality of life as children.

      Play permits children to engage and interact with the world around them. This exploration
      supports the development of their social and cognitive skills needed for learning. Research
      has described play as the most important 'work' a child engages him or herself in. Children
      with developmental disabilities often have difficulties establishing peer relations.
      Impairments in social competence can have adverse effects on play and can result in negative
      behaviors that are detrimental to forming relationships. As a result, the purpose of this
      research study is to determine if an intervention playgroup will increase playfulness and
      social participation for children ages 18 months to five years. The current research will
      also measure parental confidence in its attempt to understand the full effect of playgroups
      on the family unit.

      Playgroups have the potential to encourage parents, caregivers, and their children to play
      and have fun together safely. Playgroups offer a stimulating environment that facilitates a
      child's developmental needs and encourages parents to develop stable support networks.
      According to research, to enhance participation for children with disabilities, play must be
      involved in something or with someone, must offer a sense of inclusion, must have choice or
      control in the activity, and must be working towards a goal or enhancing the child's quality
      of life.

      Early intervention involves establishing developmentally appropriate play as an outcome or
      means to achieve goals. Playgroups have the added benefit of allowing the opportunity to
      coach caregivers on parenting, creating social networks, forging friendships, and seeking
      community connectedness. Practitioners who use a family centered approach see significant
      improvements in both occupational performance and parent confidence . Carryover of skills
      from the playgroup and into the home will be accomplished through the interaction between
      dyads. Findings from the National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study (NEILS) showed that
      98% of families participating in early intervention felt competent in caring for their
      children's basic needs and 90% reported that early intervention services had improved their
      ability to help their children develop and learn.

      Playfulness is defined as the way in which the child approaches any activity or task.
      Arguably, playfulness can be considered more important to defining play than the play
      activity itself. There is a strong correlation between playfulness and coping strategies a
      child will use later in life. Play positively affects cognition and problem-solving, thereby
      increasing their coping abilities. Through play, a child develops strategies of managing and
      exploring a world of rich interactions.

      Currently, there are limited studies describing the effectiveness of playgroups on a child's
      playfulness and social participation. Countries such as England and Australia have both local
      and national playgroup associations with established procedures for organizing and running a
      group headed by a team of professional coordinators. However, in the US, playgroups are
      sparse, less formal, and receive little to no support from national or state associations.
      There is a need for future research to explore the benefits of playgroups within the local
      community to remedy the lack of support in the US and provide an adequate play environment to
      children of any developmental background.

      Major Research questions:

      Will children ages 15 months to five years demonstrate increased playfulness and social
      participation after participating in playgroup? Will the caregiver of a child ages 18 months
      to five years report increased confidence in community outings with their child?

      Hypothesis:

      Children that participate in playgroups will show increased playfulness and social
      participation. Their primary caregiver will report increased confidence in community outings
      with their child.

    <description>The approach of the playgroup is to promote healthy family play routines with an emphasis on child and family well-being. The intervention types for playgroup sessions included the occupation of play, activities to promote play and participation, educating caregivers through modeling and coaching, advocating for the child and family, and the use of group sessions. Specific playgroup strategies included a predictable routine, following the child's lead, imitating the child, modeling of new behaviors, and scaffolding play - within both the social and physical environment. When developing activities, play objects that families have at home and are easily obtained were used and positioned intentionally with respect to the child-caregiver dyad and the group as a whole.</description>
