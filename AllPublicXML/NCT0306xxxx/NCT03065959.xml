  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of CK-2127107 versus placebo on
      skeletal muscle fatigue assessed as change from baseline versus 14 days of treatment in sum
      of peak torque during isokinetic knee extensions.

      This study will also assess the effects of CK-2127107 on physical performance via a short
      physical performance battery (SPPB), stair-climb test and 6 minute walk test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants will be randomized to receive either CK-2127107 or Placebo first and
      then will be crossed over to receive the opposite intervention. The study will consist of two
      treatment periods of 14 days separated by a washout period of 14 days.
