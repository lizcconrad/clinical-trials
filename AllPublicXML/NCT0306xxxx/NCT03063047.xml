  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate exposure to &quot;tar&quot; and nicotine from two menthol cigarette products
      and provide a basis for comparing mouth-level exposure when smokers smoke the two cigarette
      products. Mouth-level exposure is the measurement of substance trapped in the cigarette butt
      after smoking the cigarette.

      Other purposes of this study are to:

        -  Compare the plasma cotinine, a byproduct of your body's processing of nicotine, levels
           found in users after smoking each of two different cigarettes.

        -  Find out the daily mouth-level exposure to cigarette &quot;tar&quot; and nicotine from smoking
           each of two different cigarettes in adult smokers.

        -  Determine if certain measures of nicotine dependence change based on the type of
           cigarette smoked

        -  To compare product liking and intent to use it again.

      The study will consist of one group of approximately 32 adult subjects randomly assigned to
      the order in which they will smoke two study menthol cigarette products (including one
      comparator product and one test product). Subjects will smoke each study product exclusively
      for approximately one week prior to a test visit, with a different product smoked each week
      over a two-week period. Cigarette butts will be collected the day prior to each test visit
      for determination of MLE &quot;tar&quot; and nicotine levels. Blood samples will be collected at each
      test visit for determination of plasma cotinine levels. Subjects will provide responses to
      questions during each test visit to assess their cigarette smoking and cigarette butt
      collection behavior during the preceding day.
