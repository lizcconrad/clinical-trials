      The MR308-3502 study is a multicenter double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active
      comparator-controlled study in female subjects to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MR308
      with acute pain after TAH or STAH (total or subtotal abdominal hysterectomy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active comparator-controlled
      study in female subjects to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MR308 with acute pain after
      total or subtotal abdominal hysterectomy (TAH or STAH).

      The screening Visit (Visit 1) can take place up to 28 days before the planned TAH or STAH.
      The surgery will be performed at Visit 2. Visit 2 consists of three different sections, a
      part before the surgery, the surgery and post surgery. On the next Day (Visit 3) subjects
      will qualify for further participation by regular measurements of their pain. Subjects
      meeting all eligibility criteria, such as defined pain levels, will be randomised to one of
      six treatment groups and be given IMPs for 120h. Subjects who will not be randomised are
      screen failures and will be given standard care as per local practice.

      Visits 4, 5, 6 ,7 and 8, one to five days after randomisation will be performed to record
      efficacy and safety parameters.

      The last dose of IMP should be taken by the subject about 120h after the initial dose and
      before Visit 8 (Completion/Discontinuation Visit) is performed.

      The Adverse Event (AE) Follow up Visit (Visit 9) is the last study visit and should not be
      done earlier than seven days after the subject's last dose of IMP. It can be performed by
      telephone.

    <time_frame>0-4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the Sum of Pain Intensity Differences over 0-4 hours (SPID4). SPID4 is derived as the weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (baseline pain - current pain), measured at different time points via the PI-VAS. Time between two consecutive measurements will be used for weighting. Larger values indicate larger pain relief.</description>

          3. Subjects are scheduled to have a total or subtotal abdominal hysterectomy under
             general anasethesia via a Pfannenstiel incision.

          4. The elective procedure (total or subtotal hysterectomy with or without
             salpingo-oophorectomy) must be for benign conditions within 28 days of screening.
             Subjects with stage 0 carcinoma in situ of cervix, endometrial hyperplasia or

             of contraception throughout the study, not breastfeeding, and have negative pregnancy
             tests prior to receiving IMP. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as
             one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used
             consistently and correctly such as sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner).

          7. Good general health as judged by Investigators on the basis of medical history and
             physical examination.

          8. Willingness to comply with the study procedures and requirements.

             70mm and ≤ 90mm) as a result of a surgical procedure (abdominal hysterectomy) under
             general anaesthesia. This must be measured within a maximum of 24 hours after leaving
             the recovery room and subjects can only be randomised on the day after surgery, after

             antidepressants, MAO inhibitors (within 14 days before taking IMP), antipsychotics,
             anticonvulsant and other seizure threshold-lowering medicinal products), celecoxib
             (e.g. increased risk of post-operative bleeding, active peptic ulceration, GI bleeding
             or inflammatory bowel disease) or paracetamol.

             (unrelated to the pain) that could interfere with pain assessment; other pre-existing
             or new non-abdominal/pelvic pain that might impair the assessment of the nociceptive
             pain.

         10. Any medical history of significant and/or inadequately controlled cardiovascular
             (uncontrolled high blood pressure, high risk of cardiovascular events, severe heart
             failure), pulmonary, hematologic, (including coagulopathy/bleeding disorders),

         11. Previous randomisation in this study.

         12. Subjects who participated in a clinical research study involving a new chemical entity
             or an experimental drug within 30 days of study entry (defined as the start of the
             Screening Period).

         13. Subjects who were treated regularly with opioid analgesic or NSAIDs within 30 days
             prior to screening or who have received a long-acting NSAID within three days prior to
             the start of the surgery.

         14. Subjects who are incapable of complying with the protocol.

         15. Epidural or spinal anaesthesia or infiltration of the wound with an infusion of a
             local anaesthetic agent is not allowed. A single perioperative dose is allowed.

         16. History or ongoing chronic pelvic inflammatory disease or painful endometriosis.

             with the protocol.

          3. Subject clinical need for antiemetics (apart from standard perioperative practice as
             defined in the protocol) or any other medication which is prohibited as per section
             prohibited medication.

          4. Subjects who have received any analgesic medication other than perioperative analgesia
             as described in the protocol.

          5. Any concerns that renal function has deteriorated, e.g. a laboratory parameter,
             profound hypotension, poor urine output or excessive bleeding during surgery.
