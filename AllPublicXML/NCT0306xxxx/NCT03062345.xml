  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality is a video game in which a person and their real-time movements are
      represented on a screen in a virtual environment. This study will compare the use of
      multi-user virtual reality (VR) to single-user VR to determine if either provides superior
      engagement in upper extremity therapy and greater motivation to perform repetitive training.

      Stroke survivors will participate in a longitudinal study in which they will have the
      opportunity to perform rehabilitative training with multi-user VR and single-user VR modes in
      their homes. They will use each mode for 2 weeks, completing 4 session per week, each session
      is 1 hour long. Upper extremity motor control, level of engagement, and active range of
      motion will be assessed at time points during the intervention period.

      Subject evaluations will take place before the intervention, at the midpoint of intervention
      (between switching from multi-user to single-user modes, or vice versa), and at the end of
      the intervention.

      The investigators hope to address two aims:

      Aim 1: To determine if the use in-home multi-user virtual reality treatment results in
      greater engagement in therapy compared with in-home single user virtual reality treatment.

      Aim 2: To determine if in-home virtual reality treatment results in greater practice

      The investigators hypothesize that stroke survivors will be more engaged in therapy when
      training with the multi-user VR system and this will translate into greater practice.
