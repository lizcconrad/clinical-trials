             examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs or ECGs, as deemed by the PI or

             sexual intercourse during the study. (No restrictions are required for a vasectomized
             male provided his vasectomy has been performed 4 months or more prior to Day -1 of
             Period 1. A subject who has been vasectomized less than 4 months prior to Day -1 of

             non prescription medications, herbal remedies, or vitamin supplements beginning 14
             days prior to Day -1 of Period 1 and throughout the study. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g
             per 24 hour period) may be permitted during the study.

         14. Has been on a diet incompatible with the on study diet, in the opinion of the PI or
             designee, within the 28 days prior to Day -1 of Period 1 and throughout the study.

         15. Is lactose intolerant.

         16. Is unable to complete the meal prior to Hour 0 on Day -1 of Period 1 and prior to
             dosing on Day 1 of Period 1.

         17. Subject consumed grapefruit or Seville oranges within 14 days prior to Day -1 of
             Period 1.

         18. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to Day -1 of Period
             1.

         19. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to Day -1 of Period 1.

         20. Participation in another clinical study within 28 days prior to Day -1 of Period 1.
             The 28 day window will be derived from the date of the last blood collection or
             dosing, whichever is later, in the previous study to Day -1 of Period 1 of the current
             study.
