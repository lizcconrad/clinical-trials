    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical study of safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of biosimilar drug Ritumax® compared to original drug
      MabThera® in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, receiving stable doses of Methotrexate.

      At Week -2, after signing the Patient Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form, patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis receiving stable doses of Methotrexate (10-25 mg per week orally or
      parenterally) will pass screening procedures.

      Patients meeting all the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be invited to the investigational
      site for Visit 2 (Week 0) to be randomized into one of two treatment arms:

        -  Ritumax® 1000 mg х 2 intravenous infusions

        -  MabThera® 1000 mg х 2 intravenous infusions After being assigned to the treatment arm
           patients will receive a course of study treatment, including two i/v infusions at 14-day
           interval: at Week 0 and Week 2.

      After that, patients will be followed up for the next 22 weeks. Safety, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic parameters will be monitored at this visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Patient Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form to participate in the
             study.

          2. Men and women aged 18 years and older.

          3. Patient diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis of at least 6-month duration, determined
             according to classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and
             the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (ACR-EULAR 2010) or the American
             College of Rheumatology (ACR1987) (in case if the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis
             was determined till 2010).

          4. Active phase of the disease confirmed due to the combination of the following
             parameters:

               -  DAS28 &gt; 3,2

               -  5 (of 28) of tender and 5 (of 28) of swollen joints

          1. Other inflammatory arthropathies apart from rheumatoid arthritis (e.g. gout, reactive
             arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy, Lyme desease) or
             other system autoimmune diseases (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory
             bowel disease, pneumosclerosis or Felly's syndrome, sclerodermia, inflammatory
             myopathy, mixed collagenosis or other crossed syndrome). Patients with secondary
             Sjorgen's syndrome or secondary limited cutaneous vasculitis with a rheumatoid
             arthritis background may participate in the study.

          2. Chronic heart failure Class III or IV in New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             classification and clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular
             tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation).

          3. Serious chronic pulmonary diseases (COPD, bronchial asthma); functional dyspnea of
             severity level III and higher (due to the Medical Science Research Council scale for
             dyspnea).

          4. Signs of significant uncontrolled concomitant disease, e.g. renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine system and nervous system disorders, which, according to
             the Investigator's opinion, could prevent the patient's participation in the study.

          5. Any surgical procedure, including bone and joint surgeries, or synovectomy (including
             arthrodesis or endoprosthesis replacement), performed within 12 weeks prior to
             screening or planned to be performed within 24 weeks after (except for small surgical
             procedures, requiring a local anesthesia or no anesthesia).

          6. Infectious diseases.
