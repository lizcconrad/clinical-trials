  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated proof of concept study with the purpose to examine the
      safety, tolerability and feasibility of Dronabinol (synthetic Δ9-THC) and PEA for the
      treatment of adults with Tourette syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 12-week, investigator-initiated, open-label trial of a
      therapeutic combination of Dronabinol and PEA in 18 adults with Tourette syndrome.
      Participants will receive Dronabinol and PEA in combination for the duration of the trial.
      The goal for this pilot study is to (1) provide initial safety, feasibility and tolerability
      data on both Dronabinol and PEA in a TS population and (2) provide data in order to make a
      more informed decision regarding the appropriate sample size and design of a larger clinical
      trial to prove efficacy (i.e. sample size and trial duration in large efficacy trial of the
      Dronabinol/PEA combination in TS).

Dronabinol will only be increased to 10mg at the week 1 assessment if the subject is tolerating the 5mg dose of Dronabinol and the Dronabinol may be reduced based on patient side-effects.
