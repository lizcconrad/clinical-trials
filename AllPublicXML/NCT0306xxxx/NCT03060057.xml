  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, post-approval study designed to evaluate the
      short and long term clinical performance and safety in subjects receiving primary total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) with the U2 Knee™ System. The study will enroll up to 200 subjects with
      scheduled pre-discharge, 6-week, 3- and 6-month and up to 5-year annual follow-up visits.
      Study outcomes will be analyzed and published when 1.) all enrolled and implanted subjects
      complete their 6-week follow up, 2.) all implanted subjects complete their 2-year follow up,
      3.) at the conclusion of the study.

      The study will follow GCP guidelines and will be registered on clinicaltrials.gov.
