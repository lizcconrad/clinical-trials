  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of
      Ophiocephalus striatus extract in elderly patients with malnutrition. The measured outcomes
      are the level of IGF-1, albumin, and MNA score.

      This research was conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital and M. Djamil General
      Hospital, in collaboration with Biomedical Laboratory Faculty of Medicine University of
      Andalas and Prodia Laboratory, Indonesia. The inclusion criteria were elderly patients (≥ 60
      y.o.) with malnutrition (MNA score ≤ 23,5) and hypoalbuminaemia (&lt; 3,5 g/dL), had been
      treated, and permitted to leave from the hospital. All participants had been interviewed and
      physically examined to measure the anthropometric profile. Investigators also measured
      participant's Activity of Daily Living ADL Barthel, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and
      Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) to assess participant's compliance for consuming Ophiocephalus
      striatus extract. Blood samples were obtained to measure participant's level of IGF-1 and
      albumin before intervention.

      Recruited-randomized participants were classified into two groups (control and intervention)
      with double-blind scheme. Intervention group was given the extract 5 grams two times/day for
      two weeks. After two weeks, all participants were invited back to out-patient clinic in
      hospital. MNA score was measured after the intervention. Blood sample were obtained again to
      know if there were any changes in IGF-1 level and albumin level.

      Finally, investigators analyzed results to generate the conclusion.
