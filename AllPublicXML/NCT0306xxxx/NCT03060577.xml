    <textblock>
      ORION-3 is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, active comparator extension trial to
      assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of long-term dosing of inclisiran and
      evolocumab given as subcutaneous injections in participants with high cardiovascular risk and
      elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

      ORION-3, an extension of study MDCO-PCS-15-01 (ORION-1) [NCT02597127], is a Phase II,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of inclisiran (ALN-PCSSC) injection(s). All participants who completed ORION-1
      (at least up to and including Day 210) and meet the study criteria will be enrolled into this
      study.

      ORION-3 is a long-term extension trial with an active comparator (evolocumab) in participants
      with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk equivalents (diabetes,
      familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated LDL-C, despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL-C
      lowering therapies.

             antibodies directed towards PCSK9.

         11. Any condition that according to the investigator could interfere with the conduct of
             the study, such as but not limited to:

               -  Inappropriate for this study, including participants who are unable to
                  communicate or to cooperate with the investigator.

               -  Unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and study-related
                  restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study
                  (including participants whose cooperation is doubtful due to drug abuse or
                  alcohol dependency).

               -  Unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions, and
                  study-related restrictions (for example, uncooperative attitude, inability to
                  return for follow-up visits, and improbability of completing the study).

               -  Involved with, or a relative of, someone directly involved in the conduct of the
                  study.
