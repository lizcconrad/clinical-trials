  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized 3-period crossover, controlled feeding study designed to evaluate
      the effects of the most commonly consumed spices in the U.S. on CVD risk factors,
      inflammation &amp; immune function, and diet satisfaction in participants at risk for CVD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 3-period randomized crossover controlled-feeding study will be conducted. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive each 4-week treatment (diet) in random order. Each test diet
      period will be separated by a standard 4-week compliance break. Data collection will be
      conducted across at baseline (start of study) and the end of each diet period to assess the
      effects of chronic spice consumption on selected cardiovascular endpoints.
