  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3008348 is being developed as a treatment for IPF. A first-time-in-human study showed that
      single nebulized doses of 1âˆ’3000 micrograms (mcg) GSK3008348 in healthy volunteers were well
      tolerated, with pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures within the defined limits set in the protocol.
      The proposed study is a 2-cohort study of single doses, intended to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and PK of the drug in participants with IPF not currently treated with
      pirfenidone or nintedanib, and to obtain preliminary information on target engagement. Cohort
      1 will be a 2-period, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled group with at least 7 days
      washout between doses, and follow-up period of up to 7-14 days. Cohort 2 is optional. It will
      be designed to further explore safety and to provide additional information on the target
      engagement profile of GSK3008348. The total duration of the study will be up to 62 days.
