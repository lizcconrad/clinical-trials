  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic effect of oncometabolic surgery (long limb Roux-en Y reconstruction) for early
      gastric cancer patients has been revealed in a few pilot studies. However, the nutritional
      safety has not been dealt with in previous literatures. This is a prospective pilot study for
      evaluating the nutritional safety and metabolic benefits of oncometabolic surgery for obese
      early gastric cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed long limb uncut Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy (uRYGJ) in 20 patients with clinical
      T1N0 stage and preoperative body mass index (BMI) ≥ 32.5 kg/m2 or ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 with
      co-morbidities between September 2015 and July 2016.

      The primary endpoint was the incidence of micronutrients' deficiency (iron, folate, vitamin
      B12) at postoperative 1 year and secondary endpoints were anemia incidence, BMI change and
      remission rates of co-morbidities.
