  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pilot clinical study involving two study groups. This study is
      designed to demonstrate that the study treatment meets primary efficacy and safety endpoints.
      The treatment involves radiofrequency treatment to address symptoms of stress urinary
      incontinence.

      After receiving the study treatment, subjects will be followed out to 12 months
      post-treatment. At the Screening Visit, and at each designated follow-up timepoint, subjects
      will be asked to complete a variety of questionnaires, provide a patient diary, and undergo
      an objective assessment for urine loss.

      This is a prospective, pilot clinical study involving two study groups. Subjects meeting the
      all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study.
      Subjects will receive a single SUI treatment; subjects in Group 2 will receive two SUI
      Treatments.

      At the Screening Visit, and at each pre-designated study follow-up timepoint, subjects will
      be asked to complete several quality of life questionnaires related to the treated condition.
      In addition, subjects will provide a bladder voiding diary for review and data collection,
      and a pad weight test will be conducted and results collected.
