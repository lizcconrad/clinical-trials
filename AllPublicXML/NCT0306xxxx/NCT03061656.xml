    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of tandem HDCT/ASCT
      including high-dose 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) treatment. In the present study, a
      single arm trial of tandem HDCT/ASCT will be carried out.

    <textblock>
      Although the outcome of high-risk neuroblastoma has improved after the introduction of
      HDCT/ASCT, the outcome was still unsatisfactory with 30-40% of survival. We previously
      reported the results of a single arm prospective trial (SMC NB-2004 study) using tandem
      HDCT/auto-SCT for high-risk neuroblastoma. In the NB-2004 trial, total body irradiation (TBI)
      was incorporated in second transplantation. Survival rates were very encouraging; however,
      short- and long-term toxicities associated with tandem HDCT/auto-SCT, particularly TBI, were
      also very significant. For this reason, we designed a new prospective trial (SMC NB-2009
      study), in which only TBI in the second HDCT/auto-SCT of NB-2004 study was substituted with
      high-dose 131I-MIBG treatment in order to reduce short- and long-term toxicities without
      jeopardizing survival rate.
