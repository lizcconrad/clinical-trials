  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single center, double armed, randomized treatment with observation only
      (standard of care) control group. Subjects receiving study treatment will have 6 months of
      study follow-up. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF), an adipose-derived tissue preparation, will
      be injected into salivary glands to determine safety and efficacy to restore saliva
      production in head and neck cancer patients with chronic xerostomia resulting from radiation
      therapy.
