  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: the aim of this study is to identify risk factors associated with the development
      of pyogenic liver abscesses (PLA) in adult liver recipients (ALR) and to describe the
      experience of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA) in the diagnosis and therapeutic
      management of these patients.

      Background: adult liver recipients differ from the general population with PLA as they
      exhibit: reconstructed biliary anatomy, recurrent hospitalizations, regular performance
      status and are subjected to immunosuppression. However, the scientific evidence regarding PLA
      developed in transplanted organs is still scarce and the management of this disease continues
      to be based on experience in non-transplanted patients.

      Methods: between 1996 and 2016, 879 adult patients underwent liver transplantation (LT) at
      our institution. Patients who developed PLA after LT (cases) and controls are matched
      according to the time from transplant to abscess in a 1 to 5 relation. The investigators
      performed a logistic regression model to establish PLA risk factors considering clusters for
      matched cases and controls. Independent risk factors will be identified using multivariate
      regression analysis.

    <description>The diagnosis of hepatic abscess was based on clinical findings, evidence obtained from imaging studies, blood cultures, purulent material obtained from punctures, intraoperative findings and resolution after antibacterial chemotherapy, and one of the following scenarios could be found:
to. Findings of one or more intrahepatic images of liquid characteristics by means of ultrasound and / or CT scan associated with suspected hepatic abscess based on the clinical picture, laboratory tests and / or microbiological study.
B. Finding one or more intrahepatic images of liquid characteristics by means of US and / or CT, with posterior drainage of pus.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients older than 18 years of age with a history of univisceral liver
             transplantation since January 2002 for any cause and who have undergone medical
             follow-up at HIBA and had at least one event of liver abscess after transplantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who died during the hospitalization of the transplant. Patients with
             parasitic, fungal or amoebic abscesses were excluded. Those patients with
             subdiaphragmatic or subhepatic abscesses, tumors with abscessed central necrosis were
             not included in the study either. Patients who underwent liver transplantation at
             another institution and were then admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of AHP were
             not included.
