    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-year project is to develop an evidence-based curriculum for
      teaching preschool children to eat in response to internal hunger and fullness signals. There
      are currently no validated methods for teaching children these basic skills, despite the fact
      that doing so is necessary to prevent the development of obesity.

      The purpose of this multi-year project is to develop an evidence-based curriculum for
      teaching preschool children to eat in response to internal hunger and fullness signals. There
      are currently no validated methods for teaching children these basic skills, despite the fact
      that doing so is necessary to prevent the development of obesity. To accomplish this task,
      the investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary team from nutrition, eating behavior,
      obesity prevention, science education, and information sciences and technology.

      First, the investigators will refine and build upon a pre-existing curriculum by
      incorporating 1) state-of-the art theories in early childhood science education, 2)
      innovative virtual technology to provide more realistic simulations of hunger and fullness,
      and 3) a parent training component to improve long-range sustainability.

      Second, the investigators will conduct an experimental study to determine the effectiveness
      of this curriculum on children's ability to regulate energy intake in the laboratory. Forty
      children (ages 4-5) will be tested over an 9-week period. Key outcomes will be children's
      adjustment in intake in response to a first course (energy compensation) and children's
      intake of tasty snacks when not hungry (eating in the absence of hunger). Additionally, the
      investigators will measure other variables likely to impact the success of the curriculum,
      for example: child gender/age, parent feeding practices, parent education, infant feeding
      practices, child/parent weight status, and others.

      The long term goal of this line of research will be to create an evidence based curriculum
      that can be integrated into early childhood education and health-based interventions. The
      translation potential of this research is broad because once validated, the curriculum can be
      disseminated more widely to early childhood education programs.

    <description>Children's ability to compensate for calories in a first course will be assessed by measurement of compensation score. The Compensation Score will be measured over two baseline lab sessions where children are served a low-energy drink (~3 calories) or a high-energy drink (150 calories), followed 25-30 minutes later by a buffet test-meal consisting of the common foods listed above.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children must be between the ages of 4-5 years-old at the time they participate in the
             study.

          -  All children will be physically healthy, with no food allergies. Parents are asked if
             the child has any medical problems or is taking any prescription medication. If the
             answer to either of these questions is yes but the medical problem (or medication) is
             not severe nor has the potential to affect the study outcome, as judged by our PI,
             then the child may be included.

          -  The person primarily responsible for feeding the child must be able to make nine,
             two-hour visits along with the child to the lab within an nine-week time period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child is younger than 4 or older than 6.

          -  Child is not physically healthy. Parents are asked if the child has any medical
             problems or is taking any prescription medication. If the medical problem (or
             medication) is severe or may affect the study outcome, as judged by our PI, then the
             child may be excluded.

          -  Child has food allergies.

          -  Person primarily responsible for feeding child and child cannot make nine, 90 minute -
             2 hour visits along with the child within a 9-week period.
