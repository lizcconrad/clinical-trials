  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subject is to study the lung microbiota and the one of upper airways (UAs) (much less
      studied than the intestinal microbiota) in 40 patients having lung cancer. 20 patients
      undergo only surgical treatment, while other half receives also chemotherapy. The idea is to
      explore changes in microbiota of the lung, upper UAs and intestine, and potentially find
      associations between them. These results will serve us as a base for the future study,
      focused on manipulation of the microbiota by prebiotics, probiotics or symbiotics and its
      effect on anti-cancer treatment tolerance and effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer patients will be divided in two groups, a first one with patients undergoing both
      chemotherapy and surgery (Pct-chir), and the second one with patients only undergoing surgery
      (Pchir). Following inclusion, they will be given a 7-days alimentary survey, along with blood
      and saliva sampling (after buccodental examination and dental panoramic). The Pct-chir group
      will repeat the same procedure after the chemotherapy and before the surgery.

      Day before the surgery, patients are asked to bring their faecal samples (in special box
      provided in advance) and the filled survey. During the operation the piece of lung tissue as
      well as the tumour (if the size enables it) will be sampled for further analysis. Lavage will
      be performed on the lung immediately after its resection.

      Saliva, faecal sample, lung and tumour tissue, and lavage will be used for bacterial DNA
      extraction, followed by qPCR and sequencing analysis.

      Lavage and blood samples will be analysed by flow cytometry and ELISA, to establish the
      immunological profile (interleukines, cell surface markers).
