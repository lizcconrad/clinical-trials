  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia occurs frequently causing a substantial burden to society (1). Historically,
      insomnia has been considered as secondary to a handful of other psychiatric disorders, such
      as depression and anxiety - but it is now clear that this disorder is associated with a wide
      range of psychiatric conditions and may actually precede and predict their development and
      severity (e.g. 2). Treating insomnia has been posited to hold the promise of reducing or
      preventing the development of co-morbid problems - although this possibility needs to be
      rigorously tested.

      Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for disturbed sleep,
      specifically insomnia, in adults (3) and is recommended by NICE for the management of
      long-term sleep problems. This treatment is more accessible than ever before given recent
      ground-breaking internet initiatives - such as the Sleepio programme (see:
      https://www.sleepio.com/home/), which was developed by one of the collaborators (Colin Espie)
      and has yielded encouraging results (4).

      Despite the importance of CBT for treating disturbed sleep and the finding that it leads to a
      good outcome for the majority of sufferers, some people fail to respond to this treatment.
      For example, research cited on the Sleepio website notes that around 70% of those with even
      very long term sleep difficulties experience long-term improvements from the treatment,
      meaning that 30% do not (see 4). Understanding more about who does and does not respond holds
      the promise of improving or tailoring treatments for insomnia.

      The study proposed here builds on recent work by one of the researchers who has been
      exploring demographic (5), clinical (e.g. 6) and most uniquely genetic (e.g. 7); and
      epigenetic (e.g. 8) predictors of psychological treatment response (coining the term
      Therapygenetics, see, 7). While these predictors are individually only likely to explain a
      small proportion of the variance of treatment outcome, understanding these multiple risks and
      their interaction is the best way to consider this issue. The study addressed here is a pilot
      study, necessary to demonstrate feasibility of utilising a sleep intervention application in
      an unselected sample of young adults, prior to applying for grant funding to undertake a
      larger but similar behavioural genetics study in the future.

      The main aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of the study design, by
      investigating whether unselected participants show an improvement in sleep quality after
      taking the intervention. Participation and drop out rates as well acceptability of the
      intervention in a non-clinical population will also be investigated.

      Research Questions:

        1. Does the online CBT intervention improve sleep quality in a non-clinical, unselected
           sample?

        2. How feasible is it to run this study on a non-clinical sample? This will include
           investigating response rate, participant drop-out, and treatment accessibility.

           The investigators will also offer perform preliminary investigations into:

        3. Does improving sleep quality have implications for associated phenotypes? Specifically
           the investigators will examine symptoms of anxiety, depression, attention-deficit
           hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), psychosis, and well-being.

        4. Which demographic, clinical, genetic, and epigenetic factors predict treatment outcome
           for sleep problems?

      Research questions 3) and 4) will be primary aims in the main study, but will constitute
      secondary aims in the pilot study as there won't be the statistical power to fully address
      these questions.

    <measure>Online CBT for insomnia in sleep paralysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in sleep paralysis symptoms from the baseline to the end of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep paralysis is a relatively common but understudied phenomenon that has the potential to cause large amounts of fear and/or distress in individuals who experience it. As an exploratory analysis, it shall be investigated whether individuals assigned to the CBT intervention who also experience sleep paralysis show any reductions in the frequency of episodes, and associate levels of fear/distress throughout the programme.
As this isn't a main aim of the study, this aim is dependent upon a sufficient number of participants who experience sleep paralysis being present in the sample. It is unlikely that there will be sufficient power to thoroughly assess this, but it is hoped this will provide helpful information to future studies.</description>

As this isn't a main aim of the study, this aim is dependent upon a sufficient number of participants who experience exploding head syndrome being present in the sample.</description>

    <description>CBT participants will receive six weekly sessions delivered by an animated 'virtual therapist' (The Prof) via the online platform 'Sleepio'. The programme comprises a fully automated media-rich web application, driven dynamically by baseline, adherence, performance and progress data, and provides additional access to elements such as an online library with background information, a community of fellow users, and support, prompts and reminders sent by e-mail.
CBT content was consistent with the literature (4) and covered behavioral (e.g., sleep restriction, stimulus control) and cognitive (e.g., putting the day to rest, thought restructuring, imagery, articulatory suppression, paradoxical intention, mindfulness) strategies, as well as additional relaxation strategies (progressive muscle relaxation and autogenic training) and advice on lifestyle and bedroom factors (sleep hygiene). The intervention was based upon a previously validated manual (4).</description>
