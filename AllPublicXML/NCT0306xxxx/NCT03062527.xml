  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to assess the influence of low vs moderate glycemic
      index of a 3-week diet on aerobic capacity, endurance performance and body mass and
      composition in endurance-trained athletes in a randomized, controlled crossover trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of glycemic index of pre-exercise meal on endurance capacity and performance has
      been widely investigated. However, little is known about the adaptations to longer dietary
      interventions with different glycemic index and their influence on aerobic capacity and body
      composition in runners. Therefore, the purpose of this study was the assessment of the
      influence of low GI vs moderate GI of a 3-week diet on aerobic capacity, endurance
      performance and body mass and composition in endurance-trained athletes in a randomised,
      controlled crossover trial.

    <description>Group consuming low glycemic index diet. Calculated glycemic index of daily diet was lower than 40. Carbohydrate- containing foods included whole rye bread, pumpernickel bread, whole oats, wheat brans, brown rice, buckwheat, vegetables (besides corn, cooked carrots, potatoes and pumpkin) and fruit such as apples, pears, grapefruits, tangerines, prunes, dried apricots and unripe bananas.
Interventions:
The experimental procedure for each participant included a 3-week low glycemic index diet. Between the 3-week low and moderate glycemic index diets or a moderate and low glycemic index treatment, a 14-day washout period was introduced.</description>

    <description>Group consuming moderate glycemic index diet. Calculated glycemic index of diet was higher than 60. Carbohydrate- containing foods included wheat bread, wheat rolls, potatoes, instant oats, cornflakes, white rice, millet, boiled carrots and fruit (ripe bananas, grapes, raisins, dates, cranberry, honey and high sugar jams)
Interventions:
The experimental procedure for each participant included a 3-week moderate glycemic index diet. Between the 3-week low and moderate glycemic index diets or a moderate and low glycemic index treatment, a 14-day washout period was introduced.</description>
