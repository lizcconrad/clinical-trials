  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, pregnant women adopt an atypical pattern position with the intention to
      maintain stability and balance.These postural changes can cause instability at the level of
      the sacroiliac joint with painful condition during pregnancy and postpartum.

      40 % of women have postpartum lumbopelvic instability. In 17 % of cases the lumbopelvic pain
      is perpetuated.

      Another alteration influenced by the gestational status and progress of labor is urinary
      incontinence (UI).

      The mechanism developed by Masai Barefoot Technology (MBT) provides an unstable base. Some
      studies reviewed, indicate that this shoe increases muscle activity, contributes to the
      decrease of joint overload and thereby, decreases pain.

      Objective To compare the efficacy of shoes with unstable sole MBT®, over the use of
      conventional sports shoes, in primiparous women with lumbopelvic postpartum pain.

      Material and Methods Randomized clinical trial. 24 postpartum women from the Gynecology
      Service of the Hospital Universitario Madrid Chiron were included in the study.

      The subjects were randomly divided into experimental and control group.
