  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is one of most prevalent types of musculoskeletal pain and is strongly
      related to disability. The McKenzie method is one of most popular treatment options for LBP.

      The objectives of this study are to determine the effect of the hands-on McKenzie program on
      pain, disability, spine mobility, and posture deviations in subjects with derangement low
      back pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty eight patients with sub-acute and chronic LBP will be randomly assigned to the
      McKenzie group (MG) or the control group (CG). The MG will perform exercises with the
      hands-on procedure (three sessions per week) for two weeks, while the CG will perform only
      exercises for two weeks. Both groups will do a home exercise program. The outcome assessments
      will measure pain by the Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NPRS), the level of disability through
      the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), spine mobility by range of motion (ROM) for the lumbar
      spine, and the centralization of symptoms and the postural alternation by postural analysis
      grid (PAG). By using SPSS version 20, a paired t-test will be use to study the effect of the
      McKenzie program before and after treatment. An independent t-test will be used to study the
      significance between the two groups.
