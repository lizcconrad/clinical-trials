      A quasi-experimental study is designed. Sixty premature babies will be recruited by purposed
      sampling, according to the criteria of very low birth weight (＜1500gm) from a sick baby room
      in a medical center. The control group only receive routine care in sick baby room unite. The
      babies in experimental group will be observed for one day, and then intervene the simplified
      acupressure three times a day for 15 days, and continuously recoding the observation and
      records until discharge. The intervention includes acupressure for 15 minutes each at 10Am,
      1Pm and 4Pm.
