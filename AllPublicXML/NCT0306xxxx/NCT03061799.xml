  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In women, as the age increases, ovarian function is lost, resulting in the deficiency of
      female hormones, resulting in menopause, in which menstruation is permanently lost. The
      average age of menopause in Korean women is 49.7 years old, which is equivalent to 22.3% of
      the total female population. In addition, the increase in the number of women who experience
      early menopause due to environmental factors such as stress as a result of the increase in
      the number of women entering the society is also a major cause of the expansion of the market
      for menopausal women's health functional foods. Women's menopausal symptoms have been
      regarded as a natural process for everyone, but with the recent interest in health and the
      results of related studies, the perception that menopausal symptom management is necessary
      has spread.

      In traditional medicine of far east asia, danggui (Angelica gigas Nakai), taeunggung (Cnidium
      Rhizome), and broilers (Cinnamon bark) have been commonly used for postmenopausal symptoms
      improvement. However, scientific evidence for these foods are lacking. Therefore, in this
      study the investigators tried to examine the efficacy and safety of extracts of angelica
      gigas nakai, cnidium rhizome, and cinnamon bark in postmenopausal symptoms. This study is
      designed as double-blinded placebo control study.

      The results of preclinical efficacy evaluation of HPC-03 (Angelica gigas Nakai complex
      extract) obtained by mixing materials mentioned above showed that increase of serum estrogen
      level and increase of bone mineral density (BMD) of femur due to ALP(Alkaline phosphatase )
      inhibition, bone related index (BALP,bone-specific alkaline phosphatase ; CTX- 1,C-terminal
      telopeptide-1 ; Osteocalcin).

      Therefore, the investigators aimed to confirm the safety and efficacy of HPC-03 (a complex
      extract of Angelica gigas Nakai) which has been confirmed in preclinical studies, on the
      improvement of menopausal symptoms.

    <masking_description>The product manufactured as clinical food and placebo are identical in shape, color and weight. In addition, clinical trial food should be labeled by affixing the same label with placebo so that it remains blind to both subjects and the investigator. Lot number of the label, includes reference number of the test food and reference number of the placebo together.
Dispensing of food and placebo for clinical trials is handled by the management pharmacist.
Clinical tester supplies clinical trial food corresponding the random assignment code assigned to subjects. Except inevitable cases such as occurrence of adverse events resulted by clinical food, the code will not be released until the end of the clinical trial. In case of deficiency or breakage of food for clinical trial, extra clinical food with unique code will provided to subjects, therefore maintain blinding.</masking_description>
