  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) causes degradation and deformities of joints, including knees, hips,
      hands, and feet. Approximately more than 55% of populations above 45 years and more than 70%
      of population above 70 years will develop OA in at least one joint. The symptoms are
      dominated by pain but also stiffness and swelling occur. There is currently no cure for OA,
      and the ultimate treatment is joint replacement surgery. However, there is an unmet need to
      identify other treatment options that may delay or avoid surgery.

      Aquamid Reconstruction (AR) is a polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG) which is a non-degradable,
      highly visco-elastic synthetic gel, which is atoxic with durable effect and
      tissue-compatibility and well tolerated by mammal tissue by allowing in vivo vessel and
      fibrous in-growth. Experimental studies supported by histopathological observations have
      shown that AR exerts its effect via integration over time within the soft tissues, through a
      combination of vessel in-growth and molecular water exchange. Intra-articular injection of AR
      is expected to provide permanent pain relief and improve the functional ability through a
      cushioning or padding effect on the joint and thereby reduce symptoms and improve patients'
      quality of life.

      The purpose of this study is to obtain information of the safety and effectiveness of AR in
      patients with OA of the knee.

    <description>AR contains 2.5% polyacrylamide and 97.5% non-pyrogenic water, with a unique molecular structure that allows the normal water exchange with the surrounding tissue without losing shape or effect. AR is biocompatible, non-biodegradable, stable and sterile.
The gel is provided in a sterile, pre-filled 1 ml sealed syringe. The gel is intended to be injected intra-articularly with a sterile 21G x 2 inch (0.8 x 50 mm) needle.</description>
