  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is a common problem in women. Rectal prolapse and
      rectocoele are frequently identified in patients with ODS. Surgery is the only definite
      treatment for those patients and is preferably performed minimally invasive. The most used
      procedures are laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR) and stapled trans-anal rectal
      resection (STARR). However, high-level prospective studies on treatment strategies for ODS
      currently are lacking and, thus, no consensus exist regarding the optimal treatment for
      patients with ODS. This study aimed to compare LVMR alone and LVMR combined with STARR
      evaluating functional and anatomical results.
