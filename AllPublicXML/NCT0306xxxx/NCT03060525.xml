  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Deaf Weight Wise 2.0 (DWW 2.0) study is to test an evidence-based,
      comprehensive program to modify obesity-related health behaviors with Deaf people ages 21 to
      70 who use American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary language. Participants will be
      randomized to one of four arms: immediate intervention vs. intervention delayed one year, and
      in-person group intervention vs. individual intervention delivered via videophone. The
      investigators' primary hypothesis is that participants in the immediate DWW 2.0 intervention
      will increase their physical activity and reduce their caloric intake and body weight
      compared with those in the delayed intervention group (no intervention yet).

    <description>This arm will receive the DWW 2.0 Group intervention in Year 1 of the clinical trial. The group intervention will consist of groups of approximately 6-8 subjects who meet together for 16 weeks, for two hours each week. A trained, deaf, American Sign Language (ASL)-fluent DWW 2.0 counselor will lead the sessions. Subjects will be asked to complete a daily food and physical activity diary during the course of the 16-week intervention. Each intervention session will include a weigh-in, group sharing and problem solving, discussion of a weight management topic, which may include watching a powerpoint presentation and/or video; and a discussion on goal setting and action planning for the next week.</description>

    <description>This arm will receive the DWW 2.0 Individual Videophone intervention in Year 1 of the clinical trial. The participant and their intervention counselor will have one-on-one sessions that take place via videophone (like a Skype call), for one hour each week. Each session will be led by a trained deaf, ASL-fluent DWW 2.0 counselor and will be held at a scheduled appointment time that is agreed upon by the subject and the counselor. Subjects will be asked to complete a daily food and physical activity diary during the course of the 16-week intervention. Each intervention session will include a weigh-in, personal sharing and problem solving, discussion of a weight management topic, which may include watching a powerpoint presentation and/or video; and a discussion on goal setting and action planning for the next week.</description>

    <intervention_name>Deaf Weight Wise 2.0</intervention_name>
    <description>Deaf Weight Wise 2.0 is a group or individual intervention lead by trained, American Sign Language fluent Deaf counselors, who utilize an existing evidence-based curriculum that emphasizes healthy eating, exercise, and lifestyle components. It is a behavior change intervention that uses motivational interviewing techniques to help participants identify/recognize their own unhealthy behaviors, help individuals build skills that will promote behavior change, and help group members to support each other to make behavior changes. The Curriculum includes group exercise activities (&quot;Do It!&quot;), experiential learning activities (&quot;Try It!&quot; such as learning how to read a nutrition label or modify a recipe to make it healthier), and group activities related to food preparation or sampling healthy foods (&quot;Taste It!&quot;). Self-monitoring using daily food diaries and weekly &quot;weigh-ins&quot; is also a key component. The intervention also includes a 6-month follow up and maintenance phase.</description>
