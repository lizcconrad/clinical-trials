      The present controlled clinical randomized study aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of
      silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in arresting dentin caries lesions on the occlusal surface of
      primary molars when compared to atraumatic restorative treatment (ART). For this, 118 healthy
      children aged 2-5 years with at least one active dentin carious lesion, with no signs of pain
      or pulp involvement. The participants will be allocated randomly to one of two treatment
      groups: (1) Test Group - SDF and (2) Control Group - ART. The International Caries Detection
      and Assessment System (ICDAS) will be used to determine caries diagnosis and activity. In
      both groups, the guardians and children will receive oral hygiene instructions and will be
      advised about eating habits and fluoride dentifrice use.The clinical success will be verified
      through examinations performed by a blinded operator, after 3, 6 and 12 months, with clinical
      evaluations to detect caries arresting, representing the primary outcome of the study.
