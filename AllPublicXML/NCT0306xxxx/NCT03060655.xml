    <textblock>
      The different proportion samples of PLGA-Mg were made in this study. Then, they would be
      placed in the femoral condyle of the New Zealand rabbits. The appropriate proportion of
      PLGA-Mg is obtained after the experiment, which will be used to make the plate or screw to
      fix the fragments. Then, the clinical role for bone will be assessed.

      The deposition of calcium could be facilitated by the increase of magnesium, which played an
      important role in fracture union. However, its degradation may be completed before the
      fracture line was disappeared. In addition, the hydrogen may be released during degradation.
      Thus, its clinical popularization was limited.

      As a new polymer material, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) has been widely used
      clinically. The hydrolytic production of PLGA was acidic, which could neutralize the
      alkalinity of production degraded from magnesium. In addition, it was a long time before the
      total accomplishment of degradation of PLGA, which may postpone the degradation of magnesium.

      The different proportion samples of PLGA-Mg were made in this study. Their physical and
      chemical properties were analyzed to estimate its safety of implantation. Then, they would be
      placed in the femoral condyle of the New Zealand rabbits. The osteogenesis and complication
      of samples are examined to select an appropriate proportion of PLGA-Mg is obtained. Then, the
      PLGA-Mg material will be used to fix the fracture of human as a fixation. The review of the
      patients will be conducted to assess its clinical role.
