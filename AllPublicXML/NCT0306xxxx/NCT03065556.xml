  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study (Study 203) has been designed to determine and compare the efficacy and
      safety of 188-0551 Solution and Vehicle Solution applied twice daily for up to four weeks in
      subjects with plaque psoriasis. Subjects will be instructed to apply the test article
      (188-0551 Solution or Vehicle Solution) to all psoriasis plaques within the designated
      Treatment Area twice daily for four weeks (Study Day 29), unless the investigator verifies
      the subject's psoriasis has cleared at Day 15, then test article application will be for 2
      weeks (Study Day 15).

    <time_frame>End of Study (Day 15 or 29)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with IGA treatment success at EOS where EOS is the subject's last completed post-Baseline visit (Day 15 or 29).</description>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects rated a treatment success for each of the clinical signs of psoriasis (scaling, erythema and plaque elevation)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Study (Day 15 or 29)</time_frame>
    <description>Scaling, erythema and plaque elevation will each be scored on a 5-point scale where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. These evaluations are an assessment of the overall or &quot;average&quot; degree of each of three key characteristics present within all of the subject's psoriatic lesions in the Treatment Area by the investigator or designee.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in pruritus score</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Study (Day 15 or 29)</time_frame>
    <description>At the Baseline Visit, prior to the first application of the test article, the subject's overall experience of pruritus within the previous two (2) weeks will be assessed using a questionnaire that assesses the degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution of the subject's pruritus. At Days 15 and 29, the overall experience of pruritus, in the previous two weeks, will be scored using the same questionnaire.</description>
