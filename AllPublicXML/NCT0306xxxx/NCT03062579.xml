  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is a severe inflammatory disease of the
      central nervous system characterized by relapsing optic neuritis and longitudinal extensive
      transverse myelitis. The specific autoantibody against aquaporin 4 (AQP4-ab) has been
      suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Peripheral blood plasma cells are
      a major source of AQP4-ab. Previous studies have observed increased IL-6 levels in serum and
      cerebrospinal fluid of patients with NMOSD, particularly during relapses. Exogenous
      interleukin (IL)-6 promotes the survival of plasma cells and their production of AQP4-ab in
      vitro. And blockade of IL-6 receptor signaling by an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody reduces the
      survival of plasma cells in vitro. Tocilizumab (ACTEMRA®), a humanized monoclonal antibody
      against the IL-6 receptor, has shown beneficial clinical effects in some patients with NMOSD
      when concomitant immunosuppressive medications were administered. However, the long-lasting
      biological effects of preceding immunotherapies such as rituximab might overlap with the
      subsequent tocilizumab therapy. To reduce the side effects of concomitant treatments to large
      extent and verify the beneficial effects of tocilizumab, we evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of tocilizumab as monotherapy in patients with NMOSD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug tocilizumab as monotherapy contributes
      to reduce the average relapsing rate (ARR) and improve neurological disability in NMOSD
      patients, who still have experienced relapses when common immunosuppressive medications
      including rituximab had been used.

      The primary (most important) objectives of this study are to determine: Whether bortezomib
      reduces relapse frequency in patients with relapsing NMO. The number of attacks during the
      one year treatment period will be compared to the number of attacks that occurred prior to
      initiation of tocilizumab treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to determine:

      The safety profile of tocilizumab in patients with NMO and whether tocilizumab improves
      walking, visual function and quality of life as measured by a variety of established
      disability scales.

    <measure>Neurological Disability - Expanded Disability Scale Score (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS provides a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability. The range of main categories include (0) = normal neurologic exam; to (5) = ambulatory without aid or rest for 200 meters; disability severe enough to impair full daily activities; to (10) = death.</description>

    <description>The Timed 25-Foot Walk test is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. If required, the subject may use an appropriate assistive device to walk as quickly as he/she can from one end to the other end of a clearly marked, unobstructed, 25-foot course.</description>
