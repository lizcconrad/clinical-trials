    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well afimoxifene works in reducing the risk of
      breast cancer in women with mammographically dense breast. Estrogen can cause the growth of
      breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using afimoxifene may fight breast cancer by blocking
      the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate and compare the percent change in mammographic breast density (using Cumulus
      software) from baseline to month 12 in women applying 4mg afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen
      [4-OHT]) gel per breast versus placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the Cumulus versus (vs.) Volpara breast density measurement methods to estimate
      percent change in mammographic breast density from baseline to month 12 in women applying 4mg
      of 4-OHT gel per breast vs. placebo.

      II. To compare the percentage of women who underwent a change in Breast Imaging Reporting and
      Data System (BIRADS) category, comparing pre-and post- treatment measurements, for recipients
      of active agent versus placebo.

      III. To estimate percentage of women with &gt;= 10% absolute decrease in quantitative
      mammographic density percentage between baseline and 12 months, comparing between treated
      group 4mg per breast 4-OHT gel to placebo.

      IV. To describe symptoms assessed by breast cancer prevention trial (BCPT) eight symptom
      scale (BESS) questionnaire and laboratory toxicity assessment (factor VIII [F VIII], Von
      Willebrand [vWB] factor, sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG], lipid profile).

      V. To evaluate serum measurements of 4-OHT and related metabolite levels and factors related
      to tamoxifen exposures, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway members, C-reactive
      protein (CRP), estradiol.

      VI. To evaluate tissue biomarkers (among women undergoing optional pre- and post-treatment
      biopsies): terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) involution; collagen structural changes;
      SETER/PR index: estrogen related transcription, Ki-67, COX-2, p16, CD68.

      VII. To examine whether any reductions in mammographic density seen after 1 year of 4-OHT vs.
      placebo gel application persist at 24 months, one year after gel application has stopped.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients apply placebo gel topically to each breast once daily (QD) for up to 52
      weeks.

      ARM B: Patients apply afimoxifene gel topically to each breast QD for up to 52 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 months.
