    <textblock>
      This study outlines the safety of the autologous SVF cells injection in the hands of patients
      with SSc. Preliminary assessments at 6 months will suggest potential efficacy needing
      confirmation in a randomised placebo-controlled trial on a larger population

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with systemic sclerosis(scleroderma, SSc), impaired hand function greatly
      contributes to disability and reduced quality of life, and is insufficiently relived by
      currently available therapies. Adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is
      increasingly recognized as an easily accessible source of regenerative cells with therapeutic
      potential in ischaemic or autoimmune disease. The investigators aimed to measure for the
      first time the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of autologous SVF cells local
      injections in patients with SSc with hand disability.
