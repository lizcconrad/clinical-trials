      A pilot study to evaluate changes in hip function and pain in patients with osteoarthritis
      receiving the ReNu™ Hip Injection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized pilot study evaluating the efficacy of ReNu™ hip
      injection on patients with moderate osteoarthritis. The effects will be measured primarily
      through patient-reported outcomes questionnaires after a single injection. Patients will be
      followed up to 12 months to evaluate improvements using common pain and function subscales.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with moderate hip osteoarthritis determined by a combination of clinical and
             radiographic findings

          -  Radiographic findings consistent with osteoarthritis as documented by Tonnis
             radiographic classification (Grade 1 or 2)

          -  Grade 1 Tonnis changes are defined as mild and include increased sclerosis, slight
             narrowing of the joint space, no or slight loss of head sphericity

          -  Grade 2 Tonnis changes are defined as moderate and include small cysts, moderate
             narrowing of the joint space, moderate loss of head sphericity

          -  Patients with bilateral grade 1or 2 Tonnis hip osteoarthritis who have bilateral
             symptoms may have their more symptomatic hip injected. If equivalent symptoms are
             reported by the patient, then the patient will choose which hip is to be injected. The
             other Hip can be treated with all standard local interventions that will not have a
             prolonged systemic effect that could affect the study hip (for example steroid
             injection, cold therapy, soft braces).

          -  Between the Ages 18 to 70 with minimum activity level of 2 on the Tegner scale.

          -  BMI less than 40

          -  Female patients must be actively practicing a contraception method, abstinence, be
             surgically sterilized, or be postmenopausal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pain medication (including NSAIDs) less than 15 days before injection (may take
             acetaminophen)

          -  Receiving pain medication other than acetaminophen for conditions unrelated to
             osteoarthritis of the index hip

          -  Regular use of anticoagulants, such as Coumadin, dabigatran or rivaroxaban; use of
             antiplatelet medications are not a reason for exclusion

          -  History of substance abuse.

          -  Failure to agree NOT to take additional hip symptom modifying drugs, other than
             acetaminophen, during the course of the study without reporting to the study team

          -  Pregnancy or desire to become pregnant during study duration

          -  Corticosteroid injection into the index hip within 6 months

          -  Viscosupplement injection into the index hip within 6 months

          -  Previous open or arthroscopic hip surgery of the involved index hip within the
             previous 6 months

          -  Open or arthroscopic surgery of the contralateral hip within the last 6 months

          -  Worker compensation

          -  Acute index hip injury (injury within 3 months)

          -  History of Diabetes mellitus

          -  History of solid organ or hematologic transplantation

          -  History of rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorder

          -  Diagnosis of a non-basal cell malignancy within the preceding 5 years

          -  Infection requiring antibiotic treatment within the preceding 3 months

          -  Current therapy with any immunosuppressive medication, including corticosteroids at a
             dose &gt; 5 mg per day
