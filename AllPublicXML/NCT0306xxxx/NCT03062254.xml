    <textblock>
      Broadly, the objective of this study is to evaluate the fractional decline of intensity of
      tracer uptake measured by SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in bone metastases from prostate cancer
      following treatment with radium-223 as a surrogate marker for tumor cell killing.
