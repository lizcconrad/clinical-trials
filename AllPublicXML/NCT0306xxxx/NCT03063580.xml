      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of sotagliflozin and its
      metabolite in healthy male and female subjects.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess total 24-hour urinary glucose excretion (UGE) after a dose of sotagliflozin
           400 mg, alone and with rifampicin, in healthy male and female subjects.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of single dose sotagliflozin with and without
           rifampicin in healthy male and female subjects.

      The expected duration of the study is approximately 53 days total, including 2-28 days of
      screening, treatment periods of 6 days and 11 days, 1 day of end of study visit, and at least
      7 days of follow-up visit.

             period or for at least 15 days prior to inclusion; any injectable contraceptives or
             hormonal intrauterine devices within 12 months prior to inclusion; or topical
             controlled delivery contraceptives (patch) for 3 months prior to inclusion.

          -  Any subject in the exclusion period of a previous study according to applicable
             regulations.

          -  Any subject who cannot be contacted in case of emergency.

          -  Any subject who is the Investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant,
