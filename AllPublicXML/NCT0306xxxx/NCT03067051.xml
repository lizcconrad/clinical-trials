  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the study is to obtain safety data as well as to establish dose parameters
      for the SpectraCure P18 System with IDOSE®, with verteporfin for injection (VFI) as
      photosensitizer for the treatment of recurrent prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, more than 200,000 men in North America alone were diagnosed with cancer of the
      prostate, which makes it one of the most common cancer types. It affects the lives of the
      subjects in many ways.

      After treatment the subjects PSA levels are being closely monitored to detect potential
      recurrence. A high number of subjects will get recurrent prostate cancer. The treatment
      options for recurrent cancer are more limited than for primary tumors as secondary treatment
      partly depends on which treatment the subject has previously undergone.

      Treatment of recurrent prostate cancer may, depending on the standard treatment of the
      primary disease, include the following:

      Radiation therapy.

        -  Prostatectomy for subjects initially treated with radiation therapy.

        -  Hormone therapy.

        -  Pain medication, external radiation therapy, internal radiation therapy with
           radioisotopes such as strontium-89, or other treatments as palliative therapy to lessen
           bone pain.

      The objectives of this study is to demonstrate that the use of the SpectraCure P18 System
      (Interstitial multiple diode lasers and IDOSE® Software) and verteporfin for injection (VFI)
      is a safe treatment for recurrent prostate cancer.

    <intervention_model_description>As result of the accelerated titration design with light dose and verteporfin for injection (VFI), the final number of subjects depends on the outcome of the titration. If all dose levels enroll and complete at the minimum number of subjects, the number of subjects is 12 (1 each at dose levels 1-3, 3 each at dose levels 4-6). If all dose levels enroll and complete at the maximum number of subjects, the number of subjects is 36 (6 subjects at each dose level 1-6). The range is thus 12-36 subjects.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Verteporfin and Interstitial Photodynamic Therapy are the interventions in this dose titration study.
The interventions will be light dose (as laser) using the SpectraCure P18 System and drug intervention with verteporfin as a photosensitizer.
The study will be conducted as a dose titration study to determine the light and drug threshold dose using the SpectraCure P18 System (Interstitial multiple diode lasers and IDOSE® Software) and verteporfin for injection (VFI).
The light is delivered to the tumor via optical fibers and each dose arm will receive Interventional Photodynamic Therapy of Prostate Cancer combined with the drug verteporfin as a photosensitizer .</description>
