  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early clinical development paradigm for chemotherapeutic agents has significantly
      influenced the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines. However, there are major
      differences between these two classes of therapeutics that have important implications for
      early clinical development. Specifically, the phase 1 concept of dose escalation to find a
      maximum-tolerated dose does not apply to most therapeutic cancer vaccines. Most therapeutic
      cancer vaccines are associated with minimal toxicity at a range that is feasible to
      manufacture or administer, and there is little reason to believe that the maximum-tolerated
      dose is the most effective dose.

      In a recent article from the biostatistics literature, Simon et al. write that &quot;the initial
      clinical trial of many new vaccines will not be a toxicity or dose-ranging trial but rather
      will involve administration of a fixed dose of vaccine … in most cases the dose selected will
      be based on preclinical findings or practical considerations. Using several dose levels in
      the initial study to find the minimal active dose or to characterize the dose-activity
      relationship is generally not realistic&quot;.

      Consistent with these recommendations, the general philosophy of the phase 1 clinical trial
      is to facilitate a prompt preliminary evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of the
      personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy. The proposed clinical trial will test a
      fixed dose of vaccine. There is considerable experience with the synthetic long peptide
      vaccine platform. The synthetic long peptide vaccine platform has an excellent safety
      profile, and the optimal dose appears to be based on practical considerations (solubility of
      the peptide). The dose to be tested in the proposed clinical trial is consistent with other
      similar cancer vaccine trials that have been recently completed or are currently ongoing. The
      sample size (n=10-20) will provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the safety and
      immunogenicity of the vaccine.

Additional peptide vaccine doses will be administered again on Days 4, 8, 15, and 22 of the first cycle as a priming strategy. On all subsequent cycles, the peptide vaccine will be given on Day 1.
Peptide vaccine administration will continue until supply is exhausted or development of intolerance or disease progression in the case of fatal high grade neoplasms. Otherwise, vaccination will continue until supply is exhausted or intolerance or one year for non-fatal tumors. Additionally, patients with non-fatal tumors who complete one year of vaccinations and have stable disease will be given the option of resuming vaccinations if they develop subsequent progression if remaining vaccine is available.</description>

        It is anticipated that most potential participants will be consented following standard of
        care surgical procedure (biopsy, resection). Consenting and eligible patients will have
        sequencing data accessed to evaluate for candidate neoantigens (sequencing may take place
        under the auspices of this project, as part of the participant's standard of care, or under
        a tumor bank or other research project). Shortly before the vaccine is ready for
        administration, participants will be re-screened using the criteria below to confirm
        eligibility.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient, regardless of current age, who was diagnosed between the ages of 0-21

             recurrent or refractory disease.

          -  Availability of tissue for sequencing to determine presence of targetable neoantigen.
             This may be fresh tissue collected specifically for sequencing or archived tissue from
             a previous craniotomy with biopsy, subtotal resection, total gross resection, or
             re-resection. (Acquisition of specimens for sequencing and the sequencing itself may
             be done under this study or as part of routine care or another research project.)

                  creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy is permitted provided dosing is minimal based on age
             0.1mg/kg/day with a max of 4mg daily (dexamethasone or equivalent) on the day of
             vaccine administration.

          -  Bevacizumab will be allowed if given for symptomatic control of vasogenic edema and to
             avoid high dose of corticosteroids at the discretion of the treating physician.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As this is a safety and feasibility study, prior immunotherapy will be permitted.
             However, any prior immunotherapy must be discontinued at least 2 weeks before peptide
             vaccine administration. Non-immunologic therapy may be continued.

             superficial bladder cancer, or any early-stage solid tumor that was successfully
             resected without need for adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Known allergy, or history of serious adverse reaction to, vaccines such as
             anaphylaxis, hives, or respiratory difficulty.

             biologic composition to poly-ICLC or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             condition or use of medication which might make it difficult for the patient to
             complete the full course of treatments or to generate an immune response to vaccines.

          -  Presence of clinically significant increased intracranial pressure (e.g. impending
             herniation) or hemorrhage, uncontrolled seizures, or requirement for immediate
