    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multiple dose study, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies will
      be performed at the same time with tolerability study. Three dose arms are designed, 12
      subjects will be enrolled in each arm, will equal number of males and females.

      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies were performed in parallel with PB-119
      25μg、50μg、and 100μg dose escalation tolerability study, plasma samples were collected to
      determine drug concentration and pharmacodynamics parameters. The study duration of each arm
      was 8 weeks, study medication was given about 8:00 a.m. on day 1 of each week, totally 6
      times, and subject was followed until 15 days after last dose (50 days of study) and then
      study can be completed.
