      OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether respiratory variations of the inferior vena cava (ΔIVC)
      and internal jugular vein (ΔIJV) diameters during standardized breathing (ΔIVCST and ΔIJVST)
      increase after a therapeutic bleeding in spontaneously breathing and obese patients with
      dysmetabolic hyperferricemia.

      DESIGN: Prospective, monocentric study in the EFS Nord-de-France blood center.

      PATIENTS: Obese patients with dysmetabolic hyperferricemia undergoing a therapeutic bleeding.

      INTERVENTIONS: The investigators performed ultrasound measures and collected clinical
      parameters before and after a therapeutic bleeding, during a standardized respiratory
      maneuver.

      MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the ΔIVCST change induced by a 300 to
      500ml therapeutic bleeding. The investigators measured the minimal and maximal IVC and IJV
      diameters during a standardized respiratory maneuver. ΔIVCST and ΔIJVST were calculated as
      follows: [(maximal diameter - minimal diameter)/maximal diameter].100.
