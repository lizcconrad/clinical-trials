    <textblock>
      This study assesses the acute effects of dried Cabernet grape intake on vascular function and
      platelet reactivity in postmenopausal women. Previous studies from this lab and others have
      demonstrated acute effects on vascular function and platelet reactivity from phenolic-rich
      food sources. Postmenopausal women are suggested as the study group, as they are likely to
      have compromised vascular function due to the loss of protective estrogen, and have been the
      study group for past and present research projects in this lab.

    <textblock>
      The initiation and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is
      multifactorial in nature, and is currently thought of as a chronic inflammatory condition. To
      reduce the risk of CVD and its associated health care costs in California and elsewhere,
      nutrition and health recommendations strongly advocate the consumption of a diet rich in
      fruits and vegetables. Such recommendations are based largely on epidemiological data; the
      mechanisms underlying the putative positive effects of plant food-rich diets are poorly
      defined and an area of active debate.

      In addition to essential vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables contain a number of
      bioactive compounds that may be involved in vascular function. In this regard,
      epidemiological studies have noted a significant inverse relationship between the intake of
      plant foods rich in polyphenols and the risk of both all-cause mortality and CVD. For
      example, the &quot;French paradox&quot; refers to diet patterns that, despite being high in saturated
      fat, are associated with a relatively low cardiovascular risk, which may be due, in part, to
      a robust intake of polyphenols found in red wine, grapes, and other plant foods. Red wine
      contains an array of phytochemicals that have been proposed to improve cardiovascular health,
      with a great focus on polyphenols. However, grape products such as dried cabernet grapes also
      contain substantial amounts of polyphenols that may be vasculoprotective.
