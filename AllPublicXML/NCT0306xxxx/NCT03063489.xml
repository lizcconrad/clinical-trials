    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of LE
      (loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic gel), 0.38% in normal healthy volunteer subjects at least
      18 years of age and with a normal ophthalmic history. Systemic PK will be assessed in this
      study after a single dose and after 2 weeks of daily BID dosing.
