    <textblock>
      To determine if levator muscle block with bupivacaine improves postoperative pain control
      relative to placebo controls among women undergoing prolapse surgery involving a posterior
      colporrhaphy. Improvement is defined as no less than a 25% lower total pain score on a ten
      point numerical pain scale.

A second injection of 5mL of 0.5% bupivacaine, 1-2 cm deep to the surface of the vaginal epithelium will be repeated on the same side, approximately 2-3 cm cephalad of the first injection at the iliococcygeus muscle. These 2 injections will then be repeated on the contralateral side.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any woman over the age of 18 years with a capacity to give informed consent who are
             undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery including a posterior colporrhaphy may be included
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any woman who is a non-English speaker, does not have ability to provide consent, has
             a cardiac arrhythmia, liver disease, myasthenia gravis, bleeding diathesis or adverse
             reaction / allergy to anesthetic will be excluded. Women that are also having vaginal
             mesh excisions at the time of prolapse repair or those that will undergo subsequent
             surgery in the follow up period will be excluded.
