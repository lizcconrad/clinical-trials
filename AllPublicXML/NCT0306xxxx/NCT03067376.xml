  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to evaluate how CORT125134 is taken up, broken down and removed from
      the body when given as an oral capsule to healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>

      The study was conducted to determine the recovery of [14C]-CORT125134 after the
      administration of a single oral dose of [14C]-CORT125134, to determine the routes and rate of
      elimination of [14C]-CORT125134 and associated radioactivity from the body, and to measure
      concentrations of radioactivity in the blood. Additional objectives of the study were to
      determine the chemical structure of each significant metabolite in plasma, urine and feces.
      Safety and tolerability were assessed.
