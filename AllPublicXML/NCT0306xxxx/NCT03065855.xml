      Traditionally these catheters are retained for 7 days, because a higher incidence of urinary
      retention is related to early removal of the urinary catheter. However, recently Enhanced
      Recovery After Surgery presents that urinary catheters placed via the urethra can be
      withdrawn 48 hours after colon/rectal surgery in patients receiving epidural pain relief，but
      there is no clear data on the incidence of urine retention.Longer retaining time of urethral
      catheter would induce the urinary tract infection while early removal of urethral catheter is
      considered to develop acute retention of urine due to lack of sensation when the bladder is
      full. Taking the comfort and mobility for faster rehabilitation of patients into account, the
      investigators aim at obtain the optimal removal time of urinary catheter after after
      laparoscopic anterior resection of the rectum

      For a better view to avoid accidental trauma and monitoring kidney function during surgery
      and in the post-surgery period, patients undergoing abdominal operations will usually have a
      urinary catheter placed in the bladder before the surgery. Traditionally these catheters are
      retained for 7 days, because a higher incidence of urinary retention is related to early
      removal of the urinary catheter. However, recently Enhanced Recovery After Surgery presents
      that urinary catheters placed via the urethra can be withdrawn 48 hours after colon/rectal
      surgery in patients receiving epidural pain relief.
