    <textblock>
      This clinical study will assess the metal concentrations present in the blood serum of
      patients who receive surgical treatment with the PRESTIGE LP™ Cervical Disc at two contiguous
      cervical levels from C3-C7. The information obtained from this clinical investigation will be
      used to support the post market surveillance for a PMA supplement for the PRESTIGE LP™
      Cervical Disc implanted at two contiguous levels.

    <time_frame>preoperative, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The concentrations of Titanium, Vanadium, and Aluminum at different time points will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall success</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients enrolled in the study who receive the PRESTIGE LP™ Cervical Disc at two contiguous levels will be considered an overall success if the following criteria are met:
NDI score improvement of at least 15 points from baseline;
Maintenance or improvement in neurological status;
No serious AE classified as implant associated/related or implant/surgical procedure associated/related;
No secondary surgical procedure classified as a &quot;failure&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NDI success</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Neck Disability Index (NDI) Questionnaire (Vernon and Mior, 1996) will be used. Success for each individual patient will be defined as pain/disability improvement postoperatively according to the following definition:
Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score &gt; 15</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck pain and Arm pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scales adapted in part from Measuring Health (McDowell and Newell, 1996) will be used to evaluate neck pain and arm pain. The pain score is derived by adding the numerical rating scores from the pain intensity and duration scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological success</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status is based on motor function, sensory function, and reflexes. Each of the categories is comprised of a number of elements. Postoperative evaluations of each element will be compared to the preoperative evaluations. Success will be defined as maintenance or improvement in each element for the time period evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product(s) under study. This definition includes events related to the procedures involved and/or worsening of pre-existing conditions.</description>

    <measure>Secondary surgery at index level</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 12, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Some AEs or treatment failures may lead to a secondary surgical intervention at an operated index level. All patients undergoing a secondary surgical intervention at any operated index level will be followed.</description>
