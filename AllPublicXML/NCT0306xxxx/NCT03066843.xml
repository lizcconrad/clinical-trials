    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial evaluating blue light 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)
      photodynamic therapy with different incubation times for the treatment of actinic keratosis.

      Subjects who are interested in participating, currently living in the Chicago metropolitan
      area, and meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will
      be randomized to either 1) zero time ALA incubation or 2) 1 hour ALA incubation. Demographic
      and health data will be collected prior to treatment initiation. Three visits will be
      conducted: screening, treatment, and follow up visit at 8 weeks.

      This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.
