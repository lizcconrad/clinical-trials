  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to 1)characterize the differentially expressed metabolites between
      cardiomyopathy patients and healthy controls,2)identify the specific biomarkers associated
      with outcomes or risk evaluation in patients with different cardiomyopathies in a follow-up
      of a cohort and 3)to determine whether differentially expressed may affect the pathological
      process of cardiomyopathies . Standardized protocols will be used for the assessment of
      medical history and examinations, laboratory biomarkers, and the collection of blood plasma.

      The aim of this study is to analyze metabolomic profile of patients with cardiomyopathy in
      order to identify biochemical markers with risk stratification and prognostic value. Clinical
      data of enrolled patients regarding demographics, cardiovascular risk factorsï¼Œclinical lab
      data and previous cardiovascular disease will be recorded. Follow up will be at 3 months,6
      months,9 months,1 year and 3 years and will be performed by clinical recordings or phone call
      when necessary. Blood samples of patients with cardiomyopathy are taken when they enrolled.
      Serum samples will be analyzed by Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer/Mass Spectrometer.

        A diagnosis of cardiomyopaty is adjudicated by three cardiologists,according to current
        guidelines when there was clinical evidence of cardiomyopathy together with clinical
        symptoms of heart failure or echocardiography or imaging evidence.

        age- and gender- mathced healthy controls are also recuitted in the hospital.
