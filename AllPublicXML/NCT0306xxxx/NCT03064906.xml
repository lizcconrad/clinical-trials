    <description>This study is a two-part, multi-center, observational clinical trial being conducted in a Clinical Research Center (CRC) setting using the Insulet AP (artificial pancreas) system.
Subjects may participate in hybrid closed-loop session Option A - Meal Performance and/or Option B - Exercise, but are not required to participate in both. If participating in both, Option A and Option B must be conducted in separate sessions.</description>

             hospitalization within the past 6 months

          3. Hypoglycemic unawareness as determined by a score of ≥4 &quot;R&quot; responses on the Clarke
             Questionnaire

          4. One or more episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis requiring ER visit or hospitalization
             within the past 6 months

          5. Used non-insulin anti-diabetic medication within last 30 days

          6. Pregnant or lactating, or is a woman of childbearing potential and not on acceptable

          7. Dermatological conditions at the proposed sensor wear sites that in the investigator's
             opinion could preclude ability to wear the Pod and/or the Dexcom sensor

          8. Current or known history of cardiovascular disease, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction
             (MI) or stroke. An electrocardiogram (ECG) must be obtained within 6 months.

          9. Currently undergoing systemic treatment with steroids or immunosuppressive medication

         10. Current illness that would interfere with participation in the study

         11. Currently participating in another clinical study using an investigational drug or
             device

         12. Recent (within the preceding 30 days) participation in a clinical study using an
             investigational drug.
