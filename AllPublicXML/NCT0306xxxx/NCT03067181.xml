      This partially randomized phase III trial studies how well active surveillance, bleomycin,
      carboplatin, etoposide, or cisplatin work in treating pediatric and adult patients with germ
      cell tumors. Active surveillance may help doctors to monitor subjects with low risk germ cell
      tumors after their tumor is removed. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bleomycin,
      carboplatin, etoposide, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether a strategy of complete surgical resection followed by surveillance can
      maintain an overall survival rate of at least 95.7% at two years for pediatric, adolescent
      and adult patients (ages 0- 50 years) with stage I (low risk) malignant germ cell tumors, and
      at least 98% for patients with ovarian pure immature teratoma.

      II. To compare the event-free survival of a carboplatin versus (vs.) cisplatin-based regimen
      in the treatment of pediatric, adolescent and young adult patients with standard risk germ
      cell tumors.

      III. To compare the event free survival (EFS) of a carboplatin-based regimen (carboplatin [C]
      etoposide [E] bleomycin [b]) vs. a cisplatin-based regimen (cisplatin [P]Eb) in children
      (less than 11 years in age) with standard risk germ cell tumors (GCT).

      IV. To compare the EFS of a carboplatin-based regimen (BEC) vs. a cisplatin-based regimen
      (BEP) in adolescents and young adults (ages 11 - 25 years) with standard risk GCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the incidence of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in children, adolescents and
      young adults with standard risk germ cell tumors treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy
      as compared to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

      II. To refine and validate a novel patient-reported measure of hearing outcomes for children,
      adolescents and young adults with standard risk germ cell tumors.

      III. To assess the utility of using an established panel of four circulating micro
      ribonucleic acid (RNA)s as a universal marker of diagnosis, recurrence and response to
      therapy.

      IV. To identify novel genetic variants associated with an increased risk of
      platinum-associated ototoxicity as determined by standard audiology at the end of therapy
      using both a candidate gene and genome wide approach.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To prospectively determine the correlation of tumor marker decline (alpha-FP and beta-HCG)
      with clinical outcome in low and standard risk germ cell tumor patients.

      II. To prospectively determine the clinical significance of activation of the BMP, Ras/MAPK
      and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways in GCTs.

      III. To investigate the prognostic significance of an established panel of four circulating
      microRNAs at diagnosis, during follow-up and at relapse in malignant GCTs.

      IV. To identify integrated messenger RNA/microRNA profiles in primary malignant GCTs that
      correlate with poor clinical outcome.

      V. To evaluate the significance of tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation class.

      VI. To characterize the incidence of nephrotoxicity in children, adolescents and young adults
      with standard risk germ cell tumors treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy and treated
      with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

      VII. To compare self-reported peripheral neuropathy and other patient-reported outcomes
      between children, adolescents and young adults with standard risk germ cell tumors treated
      with carboplatin-based chemotherapy as compared to cisplatin based chemotherapy.

      VIII. To determine the utility of novel biomarkers of kidney tubular injury to provide
      earlier diagnosis of nephrotoxicity and to compare the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin versus
      carboplatin.

      IX. Identify novel genetic variants of platinum neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and hematologic
      toxicity using both a candidate gene and whole gene approach.

      X. Assess the relationship between hearing loss as measured by audiometry with the effects of
      tinnitus as assessed on the AYA-HEARS instrument.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients with low-risk stage I grade 2, 3 ovarian immature teratoma or stage I malignant germ
      cell tumors undergo observation and can transfer to standard risk arm when eligibility
      criteria are met.

      Patients with standard risk 1 are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (CEb): Patients receive bleomycin intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes and carboplatin IV
      over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (PEb): Patients receive bleomycin IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive
      etoposide IV over 1-2 hours and cisplatin IV over 1-3 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients with standard risk 2 are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM III (BEC): Patients receive bleomycin IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, etoposide
      IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM IV (BEP): Patients receive bleomycin sulfate IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,
      etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5, and cisplatin IV over 1-3 hours on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly to 12 months, every 2
      months to 24 months, every 6 months for years 3-5, and then annually for up to 10 years.
