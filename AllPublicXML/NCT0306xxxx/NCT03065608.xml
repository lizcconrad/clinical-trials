    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joints dysfunction is a functional disorder concern with the abnormal
      functioning of the muscles of the stomatognathic system, temporomandibular joints involved in
      the dynamic movements of the jaw and surrounding structures.

      The aim of the study was to compare the level of C-reactive protein in patients with pain and
      painless form of temporomandibular joints dysfunction.

      Temporomandibular joints dysfunction is a functional disorder concern with the abnormal
      functioning of the muscles of the stomatognathic system, temporomandibular joints involved in
      the dynamic movements of the jaw and surrounding structures.

      The aim of the study was to compare the level of C-reactive protein in patients with pain and
      painless form of temporomandibular joints dysfunction.

      Material and methods The research material consisted of 72 patients who reported to the
      prosthetic treatment because of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. The study group included
      36 patients with pain form of dysfunction, and control group - 36 patients with painless form
      of disorder. Each patient underwent specialized examination of functional disorders, in order
      to diagnose the type of dysfunction and commissioned to carry out a study of the blood test
      concern with evaluation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the same analytical
      laboratory.

      The results of the investigation were subjected to statistical analysis.

        The study enrolled a group of 72 patients, aged 21 to 48 years, of both sexes, who reported
        to the prosthodontic treatment in Consulting Room of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction at
        Dental Institute at Jagiellonian University in Cracow, between January 2015 to February
        2017, due to the pain and painless form of the temporomandibular joints dysfunction, and
        acoustic symptoms, accompanied by excessive tension of masticatory muscle. Symptoms
        persisted from 3 to 12 months prior to beginning of the treatment.
