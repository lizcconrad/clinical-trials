    <textblock>
      High risk patients who receive direct anterior approach total hip arthroplasty are more
      likely to experience wound complications. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      the usage of closed incision negative pressure dressings decreases the risk of wound
      complication compared to standard dressings. Patients who decide to participate in the study
      will be randomized to one of the two dressing prior to surgery and will leave the operating
      room with one of the treating dressings. Patient will be monitored 90 days after surgery for
      wound complications and pictures of the wounds will be taken. The patients course of
      treatment besides being randomized to one of the two dressings will be identical to any other
      patient received a Direct Anterior Approach for Total Hip Arthroplasty (DAA THA).

      The primary outcome measure will be uneventful wound healing (requiring no intervention)
      versus the occurrence of wound complications (wound drainage, breakdown, necrosis,
      dehiscence, superficial or deep infection) requiring additional intervention. Intervention
      will be defined as any attempt of the surgeon to improve wound healing (in-office
      debridement, topical ointment, aspiration, antibiotic therapy, or return to the OR for the
      wound). Secondary outcome measures will include duration of wound healing delay, length of
      hospital stay, number of days of antibiotic therapy, and direct and estimated indirect costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of closed incision negative pressure
      therapy (CiNPT) for prevention of wound complications and return to the operating room for
      wound complications in patients with pre-determined risk factors that affect wound healing.
      This is will be a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to either the ciNPT intervention group or the control group using
      computer-generated, randomized envelopes with equal numbers in each treatment arm. Both
      dressings will be applied under sterile conditions at the end of the DAA THA surgery, while
      still in the operating room, and then removed after 7 days.

      Patients randomized to the control group will receive a conformable, water resistant,
      silver-impregnated, antimicrobial hydrofiber dressing (AQUACEL® Ag, Convatec) which is
      currently the standard of care at our institution for postoperative wound dressing. This
      dressing is left in place for 7 days and then removed by the patient or visiting nurse at
      home. Patients randomized to the study group will receive an incisional ciNPT device, which
      is currently being used selectively in high-risk patients at our institution (Prevena™, KCI).
      Both wound dressings are FDA-approved devices. Due to the obvious difference in appearance of
      the two dressings, neither patients nor treating surgeons can be blinded to treatment arm.

      Wounds will be assessed postoperatively at regular intervals until wound healing is achieved.
      This will occur at least 2 and 6 weeks after surgery, which are standard intervals in our
      current postoperative protocol. No additional office visits will be needed for patients in
      the control or treatment arms. Photodocumentation of the wounds will occur at two and six
      weeks postoperatively.
