    <description>This is an exploratory objective: Serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI). HAI will be performed in microtiter format using turkey RBCs (red blood cells) and egg-grown, betapropriolactone-inactivated A/California/07/09 virus as antigen. The titer of antibody will be defined as the highest dilution resulting in complete inhibition of hemagglutination. Sera will be treated with receptor-destroying enzyme and heat inactivated prior to testing at an initial starting dilution of 1:4. Sera with no detectable HAI titer will be assigned a titer of 1:2 for calculation purposes. Serum antibody titers will be correlated with CD4 cells measured by ELISPOT.</description>

             or serum) within 24 hours prior to vaccination.

          4. The subject must be in good health, as determined by: vital signs (heart rate &gt;55 to
             &lt;100 bpm; blood pressure: systolic ≥ 90 mm Hg and ≤150 mm Hg; diastolic ≤ 90 mm Hg;
             oral temperature &lt;100.0ºF); medical history; and targeted physical examination, when
             necessary, based on medical history. Stable medical condition is defined as: no recent
             increase in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3
             months and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within
             acceptable limits in the last 6 months.

          5. The subject is able to understand and comply with the planned study procedures,
             including being available for all study visits.

          6. The subject has provided informed consent prior to any study procedures.

          7. Subjects who have not received seasonal flu vaccine for the current year.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subject report of known hypersensitivity to allergy to components of the study vaccine
             or other components of the study vaccine.

          2. Subject report of known latex allergy

             previous influenza vaccine.

          5. The subject is a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding or intends to become pregnant
             during the study period between enrollment and 30 days following receipt of vaccine.

             immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs, or use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation
             therapy within the preceding 36 months.

          7. The subject has an active neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer or
             prostate cancer that is stable in the absence of therapy) or a history of any
             hematological malignancy. For this criterion, &quot;active&quot; is defined as having received
             treatment within the past 5 years.

          8. The subject has long-term (greater than 2 weeks) use of oral or parenteral steroids,
             or high-dose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or
             equivalent) within the preceding 6 months (nasal and topical steroids are allowed).

          9. The subject received immunoglobulin or another blood product within the 3 months prior
             to enrollment in this study.

         10. The subject has received an inactivated vaccine within the 2 weeks or a live vaccine
             within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study or plans to receive another
             vaccine within the next 28 days.

         11. The subject has an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would
             interfere with the evaluation of responses. These conditions include any acute or
             chronic medical disease or conditions defined as persisting for 3 months (defines ad
             90 days) or longer, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury,
             render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere
             with the evaluation of responses of the subject's successful completion of the study.

         12. Subjects with an active infection or that has an acute illness or an oral temperature
             greater than 99.9F (37.7C) within 3 days prior to enrollment or vaccination. Subjects
             who had an acute illness that was treated symptoms resolved are eligible to enroll as
             long as treatment is completed and symptoms resolved &gt; 3 days prior to enrollment.

         13. The subject is currently participating or plans to participate in a study that
             involves an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or

             in this study, or intends to donate blood during the study period.

         14. The subject has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator,
             place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to
             meet the requirements of the protocol.

         15. Have been hospitalized for psychiatric illness, history of suicide attempt, or
             confinement for danger to self or others, within the past 10 years.

         16. The subject has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bi-polar disease, or other severe
             (disabling) chronic psychiatric diagnosis, or is receiving psychiatric drugs. Subjects
             who are receiving a single antidepressant drug and are stable for at least 3 months
             prior to enrollment without decompensation are allowed enrollment into the study.
