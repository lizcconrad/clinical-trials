    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, feasibility trial with the primary aim of comparing
      how well oral rapidly dissolving olanzapine controls primary headache pain when compared to
      the current treatment strategies used in emergency departments which often require
      intravenous or intramuscular medications.

      Primary Question:

      Does oral rapidly dissolving olanzapine provide efficacious analgesia in patients with acute
      headache of non-organic origin (primary headache) who come to the ED for abortive therapy
      when compared to current standard of care?

      Secondary Aim:

      Additionally, the study will aim to see if oral rapidly dissolving olanzapine decreases 1)
      duration of ED length of stay and 2) need for IV access when compared to the current standard
      of care.

      This is a prospective, randomized, convenience sample, feasibility trial to test for
      non-inferiority of oral rapidly dissolving olanzapine versus current emergency department
      standard of care in providing symptomatic relief to patients presenting with primary
      headache.
