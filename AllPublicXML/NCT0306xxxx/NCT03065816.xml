      Primary Objective:

      Pharmacodynamics: assessment and comparison by gamma scintigraphy of the gastric retention of
      alginate rafts (raft performance) of Z0063 to the effect of Gaviscon Double Action Tablets,
      in healthy adult subjects.

      Secondary Objective:

      Safety: assessment of the clinical safety of Z0063 versus Gaviscon Double Action tablets, in
      healthy adult subjects.
