  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quitting smoking has important health benefits for people with serious mental illness, more
      than half of whom are smokers. Smoking reductions in this population, in turn, could
      contribute to saving billions of dollars in healthcare expenditures.

      Finding ways to deliver more effective and wider reaching smoking cessation interventions to
      individuals with serious mental illness is a pressing priority. Smartphone apps are a wide
      reaching technology that could provide a viable platform to deliver smoking cessation
      interventions for individuals with serious mental illness.

      However, do smoking cessation apps need to be tailored for people with serious mental illness
      to ensure their success? Or can providers simply use standard and freely available smoking
      cessation mobile health treatments designed for the general population? Furthermore, is it
      feasible to conduct mHealth trials in this population?

      Therefore, this trial will test whether (1) a tailored smoking cessation app for people with
      serious mental illness results in higher levels of engagement with smoking cessation content
      as compared to an app designed for the general population and (2) smoking cessation mHealth
      trials can be feasibly conducted in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking tobacco shortens the lifespan of adults with serious mental illness by 25 years and
      contributes to $317 billion expenditures in healthcare, indirect loss of earnings and
      disability benefits. Determining whether it is possible to deliver more effective and wider
      reaching smoking cessation interventions to individuals with serious mental illness is a high
      priority. Smartphone apps are a wide reaching technology that could provide individuals with
      serious mental illness the necessary skills for quitting.

      This feasibility trial will test whether a tailored smoking cessation app for people with
      serious mental illness, Learn to Quit, results in higher levels of engagement with smoking
      cessation content as compared to an app designed for the general population, NCI QuitGuide.
      The trial will also demonstrate whether it is possible to (a) feasibly recruit and retain
      individuals with serious mental illness in an mHealth clinical trial, and (b) successfully
      gather smoking cessation outcomes. Ninety individuals with serious mental illness will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the experimental condition, participants will
      use the Learn to Quit app. In the comparator condition, participants will use the NCI
      GuitGuide app. Participants in both conditions will receive Nicotine Replacement Therapy
      (standard dosing of nicotine patch + 1-week course of 4mg nicotine lozenges) and technical
      coaching. Study duration will be 4 months, with four follow-up appointments at 1-month,
      2-month, 3-month, and 4-months.
