  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo in vitro fertilization with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection
      (IVF / ICSI) often experience an impact on their quality of life and emotional maladjustment
      to treatment and outcome. Multiple contributors to this negative impact have been identified,
      including interference with professional activities, expenses related to fertility treatment
      and hormonal side effects. In-vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes obtained from minimally
      stimulated or unstimulated ovaries offers a more &quot;patient friendly&quot; treatment option than the
      conventional ovarian stimulation protocols for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)
      treatment. Historically, IVM has been offered to women with increased ovarian response
      (so-called &quot;high responders&quot;), typically women with polycystic ovaries (PCO/PCOS), who are at
      increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) if conventional ART protocols are
      used. IVM treatment programs are characterised by a minimal administration of fertility
      hormones, are less disruptive to patients' daily life through a reduced need for hormonal and
      ultrasound monitoring, avoid a range of minor and major complications because of the reduced
      hormonal burden of this procedure, and aim to reduce the total cost for of infertility
      treatment.

      To facilitate the application of IVM as a treatment that can potentially improve the overall
      patient experience, a study comparing the psychological impact of a conventional ovarian
      stimulation protocol versus an IVM protocol will be conducted; furthermore, a study
      investigating the differences in quality of life between the two subgroups will also be
      performed.

      Socio-demographic data, medical characteristics and the following questionnaires will be
      collected: Specific questions for patients with fertility problems (FertiQol); Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) and an instrument to measure side effects designed by the
      research group. The study group (IVF patients and IVM patients) will be evaluated at three
      predefined time points: at intake, after oocyte collection and when the outcome after the
      first embryo transfer is known.

      Descriptive analysis, intergroup comparisons and explanatory/predictive model of the
      dependent variables (quality of life, emotional adjustment) will be performed.
