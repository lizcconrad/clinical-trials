  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UK has the highest incidence of mesothelioma. The incidence has risen by 497% since the
      late 1970's and is increasing worldwide due to continued mining and use of asbestos. For
      patients with mesothelioma who have relapsed after taking pemetrexed and cisplatin, there is
      currently no standard treatment, making this an urgent unmet need. Recent trials in this area
      have not found an effective treatment that improves overall survival.

      Following a debate in the House of Lords, a national survey assessing the research priorities
      in mesothelioma found that 'exploiting the potential of immunotherapy' was a top priority.
      This trial was designed in response to that survey. It uses the immunotherapy agent nivolumab
      which blocks programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on activated T-cells (a type of white
      blood cell forming part of the immune system). Early research has found a dependency of
      mesothelioma on the PD-1 checkpoint. By attaching to PD-1, nivolumab blocks its action
      (checkpoint inhibition), preventing it from turning off the T-cell, and therefore allowing
      the immune system to work. PD-1 checkpoint inhibition has revolutionised the treatment of
      melanoma and it is hoped to be as effective in mesothelioma.

      This trial is a randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial of patients with
      mesothelioma who are third relapse following a platinum based chemotherapy treatment.
      Patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio (nivolumab: placebo).

      336 patients will be recruited from 25 UK centres over a four-year period with the last
      patient having a minimum of 6 months follow up. All patients will be on treatment for 12
      months unless they progress or withdrawal prior to this. Clinic visits will occur every 12
      weeks, mirroring standard care. Data following progression will be obtained from the NHS
      Information Centre.
