    <textblock>
      Blood contamination, such as apical microleakage, of root canal during preparation can be a
      major problem in endodontics. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the
      hemostatic properties of sulfonic/sulfuric acid solution used during root canal therapy in
      teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

    <textblock>
      A new device (HYBENX®) has been developed with the purpose of destroying dental biofilm. The
      material contains a concentrated aqueous mixture of hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (37%) and
      hydroxymethoxybenzene acids (23%), sulfuric acid (28%), and water (12%).

      The investigators planned a clinical and microbiological study using the decontaminant device
      in order to destroy the dental biofilm of root canals in cases of irreversible pulpitis. The
      ability of the decontaminant device to immediately stop bleeding during canal instrumentation
      was found out accidentally during the procedures of this still unpublished trial.

      Due to this fact, the investigators were interested in evaluating the coagulation property of
      the material. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study is to describe a new approach to
      obtain hemostasis during root canal therapy using a sulfonic/sulfuric acid solution.

      A total of 15 teeth with irreversible and acute pulpitis were included in the study. After
      manual and mechanical instrumentation of the root canal, a sterile paper point was introduced
      in the canal, and a first score was given based on the blood quantity.

      The solution was used to irrigate the bleeding root canal; then a second sterile paper point
      was introduced, and the same score was assessed. The null hypothesis was that there is no
      difference in root canal bleeding before and after the use of the solution (⎧=0)

      Results: The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a statistically significant decrease in the
      root bleeding score after the application of sulfonic/sulfuric acid solution (P&lt; .0001)
      Conclusions: The use of the material seems to aid in the root canal treatment of teeth with
      irreversible pulpitis and copious root canal bleeding.

    <description>After the root canal, shaping was performed, and a first sterile paper point was introduced in the root canal, up to the working length, to detect blood presence.
The root canal bleeding score (RCBS) was given as follows:
0: no blood detected
1: blood detected in the apical third of the root canal
2: blood detected both in the apical and the middle thirds of the root canal
3: blood detected in the whole root canal. After the use of the material a second sterile paper point was introduced in the root canal, up to the working length, to detect the presence of blood and an RCBS was assessed according the previous criteria</description>
