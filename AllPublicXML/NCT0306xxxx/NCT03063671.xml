      This study investigate the effect of addition dexmedetomidine, ketamine or their combination
      to bupivacaine in thoracic epidural analgesia on acute postoperative pain after breast cancer
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in Egyptian women. Many modalities are used
      in the treatment of breast cancer including chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgical
      intervention. Nowadays, surgical intervention is more conservative.Modified radical
      mastectomy (MRM) is the standard surgical procedure of choice in these patients. MRM is
      usually performed under general anesthesia, almost always combining intravenous and
      inhalational agents.The drawback of general anesthesia includes inadequate pain control due
      to lack of analgesia, high incidence of nausea and vomiting, stress of anesthesia and
      surgery, and increasing the length of hospital stay.Post mastectomy pain is a pain which
      occur following breast cancer procedures, particularly those operations that remove tissues
      in upper outer quadrant of breast and/or axilla. This pain can be severe enough to cause long
      term disabilities and interfere with sleep, performance of daily activities. Also, it can
      seriously affect the patient mood, and social functions.

      Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) faces growing interest as adjuvant anesthetic and
      post-operative analgesic regimen. the use of adjuvant drug with local anesthetic is essential
      as it prolongs the duration of action, gives better success rate and increases patient
      satisfaction.

      Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, not only abolishes peripheral afferent
      noxious stimulation, but it can also prevent the central sensitization of nociceptors. When
      added to epidural local anesthetics, ketamine appears to have adjuvant effects.
      Dexmedetomedine is a selective, α2-adrenoceptor agonist with analgesic potency, sedative
      properties, and minimal respiratory depression when used as an adjuvant to regional
      anesthesia.
