  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab or placebo
      given with best supportive care (BSC) in Asian participants with previously systemically
      treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary hypothesis of this study is that
      overall survival is prolonged in participants who receive pembrolizumab compared to those who
      receive placebo.
