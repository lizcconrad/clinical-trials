  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is sleep disorder characterized by an unpleasant feeling in the
      lower limbs, which can be accompanied by paresthesias, and need for urgent movement of the
      legs. Its diagnosis is clinical, based on an International Committee of the Study of RLS
      (International Restless Legs Syndrome Study) questionnaire. Its prevalence is about 5-15% in
      the general population, being twice as frequent in women and with a tendency to increase
      incidence with aging. In the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, mainly in patients on
      dialysis, the prevalence increases by up to 70%. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with RLS
      and active vitamin D supplementation seems to improve RLS and severity. It is seems, studies
      on the role of vitamin D supplementation in CKD population are missing. The
      clinical-scientific hypothesis of this study is that replacement of vitamin D
      (cholecalciferol) will improve the symptoms of RLS. As parathyroidectomy can relieve RLS, the
      aim of researchers is to randomize patients with CKD on dialysis to receive cholecalciferol
      or placebo in 2 distinct groups: secondary hyperparathyroidism and adynamic bone disease.
