      The purpose of this randomized, open-label, 2-arm, Phase 3 study is to assess the assess the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of rovalpituzumab tesirine versus topotecan in participants
      with advanced or metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) with high levels of delta-like
      protein 3 (DLL3) and who have first disease progression during or following front-line
      platinum-based chemotherapy.
