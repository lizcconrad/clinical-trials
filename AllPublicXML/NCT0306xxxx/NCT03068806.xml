  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study designed to examine how the psychiatric illness called schizophrenia
      affects brain function and thinking abilities such as attention and memory during simple
      computer-based tasks, and how measures of brain function are related to performance. We do
      this by looking at brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI). We compare participants' results to the activity in their brain as well as
      clinical measures and questionnaires also completed during this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  EEG recording: In this procedure, the researcher will assess your brain function while
           you perform simple computer-based tasks. The computer tasks involve presentation of
           pictures or sounds to which you respond by pressing a button. We will also record some
           of your own speech sounds and play them back to you. You will be given clear
           instructions and a chance to practice before each task. While you are performing these
           tasks, we will record the weak electrical signals produced by your brain, or &quot;brain
           waves&quot;, using a technique called electroencephalography (EEG). In order to record your
           EEG, sensors (small plastic discs) will be attached to specific locations on your scalp.
           Your scalp will be gently scrubbed before the sensors are attached. The sensors are held
           in place on your scalp using a nylon cap that fits snugly on your head. Sensors will
           also be attached above and below your eyes and will record your eye movements. It will
           take approximately one hour to attach the sensors. The entire EEG will take
           approximately 2-3 hours. Before you take part in the EEG session, please make sure to
           wash your hair and scalp. Do not use conditioner or a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner. Your
           hair should be dry before your arrival. We ask this in order to make the set-up process
           go more smoothly.

             -  During some tasks, you will feel a vibratory sensation that is produced with an
                electrical current and it is possible that it may feel like a slight shock. The
                current is controlled and cannot reach levels that are painful or dangerous. Every
                participant experiences this sensation differently, so it is important that you
                tell the researchers if the sensation becomes uncomfortable to you so the current
                can be adjusted or the task can be stopped.

             -  You may be asked to complete additional EEGs for this study, depending on your
                interest in participating and your availability. All EEG sessions will last
                approximately 2 hrs.

        -  MRI: In the fMRI procedure, we will use a magnet to measure blood flow to your brain
           while you do different tasks. You will be asked to lie down on a platform that can be
           slid into the middle of the magnet. A plastic MRI imaging coil will be placed around
           your head. You will not come into contact with the coil during the experiment. Foam pads
           will be placed around your head to limit head movement during the experiment. We will
           then slide you into the magnet. At different points during the experiment, you will be
           asked to do the same tasks you did in the training session prior to the scan. During the
           scan, you will be asked to either lie still and rest, or do some tasks like tapping your
           fingers, remembering letters or digits, or viewing images that are designed to activate
           different parts of your brain. The entire MRI will take approximately two hours.

             -  While performing the MRI, you may be asked to wear a cap that contains multiple EEG
                sensors applied to your scalp. A removable gel will be used. The EEG measures
                electrical activity produced by your brain while you undergo the MRI. Set up for
                the EEG will take approximately 30 to 60 minutes.

             -  You may be asked to repeat an MRI session if the data the study team collects is
                not usable due to data quality issues, or if you are unable to stay awake in the
                magnet during your scan.

        -  Brief interview session: There will be a series of questions about your education,
           smoking status, and economic background. You will also be given a list of words to read
           to the researcher. If you are a patient diagnosed with one of the above-mentioned
           psychiatric disorders, you will be asked to participate in an additional interview,
           lasting about one hour, focusing on how you have been feeling recently.

        -  Behavioral testing: In this part, you will use a touch screen computer, mouse and/or
           paper and pencil to perform certain visual and auditory tests of your mental abilities.
           Specifically, these tests will assess your memory, attention, language, and motor
           skills. This testing will last approximately one hour. Depending on your preference,
           this testing can be done on the same day as an EEG or on a different day. The order of
           the two sessions does not matter, so long as they occur within one week of each other.

      Additional Information:

        -  A medical record will be created for you at the San Francisco VAMC and information
           pertaining to your study participation will be entered in this record, as per VAMC
           requirements.

        -  If information about your mental health is needed from your current or former doctor(s),
           you will be asked to sign a separate permission form before the researcher can contact
           your doctor(s).
