  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a short training program - designed to improve memory and
      attention skills - will benefit mathematical reasoning in preschoolers from a range of
      socio-economic backgrounds. The investigators will test how long any benefits last for and
      whether any intervention effects are greater for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The
      aim is to test interventions that aim to close the achievement gap by improving skills known
      to underpin academic skills, at an age children may benefit most from training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children's academic success across a range of domains is related to their executive function
      skills - specifically by their ability to maintain and update information (working memory)
      and to suppress inappropriate responses (inhibitory control). These skills undergo
      significant development during the preschool years. Notably, preschool executive function
      skills strongly predict school readiness, as well as concurrent and later academic
      achievements in mathematics. The aim of this project is to test an intervention that is
      specifically designed to improve preschoolers' executive functions - crucially, before the
      achievement gap sets in. The study will be carried out, following CONSORT (2010) guidelines,
      with typically developing preschoolers (aged approximately 4 years of age). The study will
      include children from socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged families. Children will
      be randomly assigned to either an executive function training group or an active control
      group. A nominated person external to the project will conduct the random allocation process.
      The random allocation will be done for each nursery to ensure roughly even numbers in each
      group from each nursery. Children in both groups will complete computerized tasks lasting
      15-20 minutes once a week for four weeks. The investigators will compare the trained children
      to an active control group that closely matches the training in terms of activity. To check
      for improvements, the investigators will measure cognitive and maths skills at baseline (one
      week before training); one week post-training; three months post-training; and one year
      post-training. These assessments will be conducted by testers blind to the child's group.

    <description>The intervention comprises four weekly sessions lasting 15-20 minutes. In these sessions, children complete computerised tasks requiring working memory and inhibitory control. These tasks are child friendly and are based on established measures of executive function. The working memory tasks involve maintaining information in mind and processing information (for example, finding items hiding in different locations that move around) and suppressing a dominant but incorrect response (for example, a game where children try to catch fish but not sharks). Children receive feedback on their responses. If children score 75% or more correct in a session the difficulty level increases in the following session.</description>

    <description>The control task program, like the intervention, comprises four weekly sessions lasting 15-20 minutes. In these sessions, children complete computerised tasks not requiring executive function skills. Instead, they require simple attention and decision making skills and visual search skills. For example, finding an item among distractors (e.g., a spaceship), or deciding which of two animals can fly (out of a bird and a fish). Children receive feedback on their responses.</description>
