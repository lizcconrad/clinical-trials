      Effect Of Reduction Osteotomy On Gap Balancing During Total Knee Replacement For Severe Varus
      Deformity

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe varus deformity with a tibio femoral angle of 15Â° or more as measured on full-length
      weight-bearing radiographs necessitates extensive release of the medial structures to gain
      neutral limb alignment during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). progressive releases of the
      medial structures are performed until medial and lateral envelopes are equally balanced. This
      technique, however, faces a risk of over-release and subsequent instability, ultimately
      resulting in the use of a thicker polyethylene insert or even a constrained-type prosthesis.
      Reduction osteotomy is known as a soft tissue-sparing technique for soft tissue balancing,
      and it is capable of reducing the amount of release required to balance the knee and of
      preventing over release of medial structures. Dixon et al . and Mullaji et al . proposed the
      effectiveness of down-sizing the tibial component in the case of knees with severe varus
      deformity Aim of the work: Assess the effect of reduction osteotomy on gab balancing during
      total knee arthroplasty for severe varus deformity -What is the amount of deformity
      correction achieved with reduction osteotomy during TKA in varus knees? - What is the
      correlation of amount of deformity correction achieved to the amount of bone osteotomized and
      the degree of varus deformity?
