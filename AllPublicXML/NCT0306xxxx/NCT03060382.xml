      The investigators randomly divided the knee osteoarthritis patients met the inclusive
      criteria into two groups (study group and control group). Placement of balanced buttress
      absorbable spacer and total knee arthroplasty were conducted. The clinical outcome of two
      groups were compared in this study.

      Knee osteoarthritis, caused by non-uniform settlement of medial and lateral tibial plateau,
      was not uncommon in clinic. Medial stenosis was the most type of the disease. The symptoms
      included knee pain during walking and varus deformity of lower limbs. Total knee arthroplasty
      and tibial osteotomy were two common conventional treatment of the knee osteoarthritis, which
      were not minimally invasive and bring great financial burden to patients' family. The
      investigators planned to recruit 150 patients of knee osteoarthritis into this study, which
      were randomly divided into two groups (study group and control group). For the patients of
      study group, a balanced buttress absorbable spacer was placed into the gap after the
      osteotomy of tibia and fibula to modify the lower limb line. However, total knee arthroplasty
      was conducted for the patients of control group. The patients were followed up and the
      clinical outcomes were compared in this study.
