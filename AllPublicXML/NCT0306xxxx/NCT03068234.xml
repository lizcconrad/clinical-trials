  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an antifibrotic agent, pirfenidone as
      treatment of systemic sclerosis. The primary outcome of this study is improvement of skin
      fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled should suffer from moderate to severe skin fibrosis at the screening
      stage.

      The study period is 52 week. The study contains two stages, a 24-week blind stage following
      with open stage for another 24-week period of time. Subjects will receive pirfenidone or
      placebo randomized in the first 24-week and will all receive pirfenidone treatment in the
      second 24-week, with of combination of low dose steroids.

      The secondary outcomes of this study include but not limit to safety, improvement of lung
      fibrosis and digital ulcer burden.
