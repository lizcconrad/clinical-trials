    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and response of pulsed low dose rate radiation
      therapy in treating gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis. Radiation therapy
      uses pulsed low dose rate high energy X rays to kill tumor cells and make less side effects
      than conventional 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. Palliative radiation therapy may
      help gastric cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis live more comfortably.

          -  Tumor within the irradiated field is negatively impacting patient's quality of life or
             threatening catastrophic complication if left untreated as determined by the treating
             physician

          -  Patient is not a surgical candidate or tumor is not surgically resectable, as
             documented by surgical oncologist

             72 hours prior to radiation simulation, postmenopausal woman must have been
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential) and
             nonlactating, and men and women must be willing to exercise an effective form of birth
             control (abstinence/contraception) while on study and for 3 months after therapy
             completed

             of assessments and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy to the reirradiation target within
             4 weeks prior to entering the study
