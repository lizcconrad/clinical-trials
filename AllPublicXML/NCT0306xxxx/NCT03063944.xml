  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 when
      given together with decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that does not
      respond to treatment or is newly diagnosed and ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. STAT
      inhibitor OPB-111077 and decitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 (OPB-111077) in
      combination with decitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe any preliminary efficacy of OPB-111077 in combination with decitabine in
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To measure adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and perform metabolomics in patients
      with AML who are receiving OPB-111077 and decitabine.

      III. To assess apoptosis and proliferation assays in patients with AML who are receiving
      OPB-111077 and decitabine.

    <description>Data analysis will be descriptive. All estimates of dose-specific rates (e.g., response and toxicity) will be presented with corresponding confidence intervals using the exact method. The method of Atkinson and Brown will be used for any rate related to definition of dose limiting toxicity, due to two-stage sampling. The method of Conover will be used otherwise.</description>

    <description>Patients receive STAT inhibitor OPB-111077 PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             one of the following:

               -  Primary refractory non-M3 AML

                  ** Evidence of leukemia after any therapy which, in the opinion of the
