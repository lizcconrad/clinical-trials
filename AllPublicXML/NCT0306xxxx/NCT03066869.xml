    <description>A responder will be defined by the binominal presence or absence of active retinal vasculitis as evaluated at Week 24. Active retinal vasculitis is defined as angiographic leakage from retinal arterioles, venules, or capillaries as determined by investigator, seen on wide-field angiography. Complete resolution or absence of active retinal vasculitis at Week 24 is considered success or &quot;remission&quot;.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any adult patient with active retinal vasculitis (involving arteries or veins) as a
             manifestation of non-infectious ocular inflammatory disease; fundus must be viewable
             with wide-field FA in the study eye

          -  If both eyes are involved, both are eligible for inclusion in the study

          -  Patients already on non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy may continue on this
             during the study, but the dose must not be increased or decreased within 6 weeks of
             initiating the trial

          -  Willing and able to sign the informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under age 18

          -  Patients who are pregnant (must be ruled out in women of child-bearing age)

          -  Active infectious ocular or systemic disease

          -  Patients with active infectious ocular or extraocular disease

          -  Patients with history of malignancy, except for dermatologic entities of basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma which have been completely excised or removed previously

          -  Patients with systemic illness involving abnormalities of the
             hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; patients with primary adrenocortical
             insufficiency or adrenocortical hyperfunction

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to Acthar

          -  Patients on other non-steroidal systemic immunomodulatory medications with dose
             adjusted sooner than 6 weeks prior to study drug administration

          -  Patients currently on or recently treated with (within 6 weeks) systemic
             corticosteroid

          -  Patients with periocular or intraocular injections of medications administered to help
             control inflammation sooner than 6 weeks prior to study drug administration

          -  Patients with severe disease that warrants critical attention, deemed unsafe for the
             study by the investigator, or contraindicated, including but not limited to, patients
             with scleroderma, osteoporosis, systemic fungal infections, ocular herpes simplex,
             recent surgery, history of or the presence of a peptic ulcer, congestive heart
             failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or sensitivity to proteins of porcine origin.
             Administration of live or live attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients
             during the entire duration of the study and for one month prior
