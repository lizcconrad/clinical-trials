  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain (PFP) is a common knee problem, primarily affecting adolescents and young
      adults. PFP is characterised by significant retropatellar and/or peripatellar pain and
      impairment of function and quality of daily life. Exercise therapy is unequivocally
      recommended as a core component of the management of PFP. Different exercise types (e.g.
      quadriceps strengthening, hip strengthening and functional/neuromuscular exercises) have been
      investigated, with knee and hip strengthening exercises as the most common and recommended
      types. These exercises approaches produce similar small to moderate effects on pain and
      physical function. However, the PFP population is very heterogeneous and
      &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;-approaches presumably are sub-optimal because the heterogeneity is
      ignored. The heterogeneity probably explains the overall limited beneficial effects of
      exercise, and the lack of differences in direct comparisons of different exercise types. In
      that sense, it is not unlikely that certain patient characteristics may predict outcome
      success of either a hip training program or a training program that focus on the quadriceps
      but this remains to be shown.

      This study has two aims:

        1. To assess the comparative effectiveness of two different exercise programs (Quadricep
           Exercise [QE] vs. Hip Exercise [HE]) on self-reported pain and function in individuals
           with PFP.

        2. To explore candidate patient characteristics that predict differential responses to the
           two exercise programs (QE vs HE) on self-reported pain and physical function in
           individuals with PFP.

      According to the study aims we pursue the following hypothesis:

      - QE and HE have equivalent efficacy on self-reported pain after 12 weeks of treatment in
      patients with PFP.

      The second study aim is to explore possible candidate patient characteristics that may
      associate with differential outcomes. As this is exploratory, the pursuit of this aim is
      hypothesis-free.

    <measure>Change from baseline in the KOOS questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is used to assess patient-reported knee-related symptoms. The KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument developed to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated problems.KOOS comprises of 42 items in 5 separately scored subdomains: KOOS Pain (9 items), KOOS Symptoms (7 items), Function in daily living (KOOS Function; 17 items), Function in Sport and Recreation (5 items), and Knee-related Quality of Life (4 items). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions, and the questions relate to one knee (the target knee in this trial).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change fom baseline in the Dynamic Assessment of Pain test</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Dynamic Assessment of Pain Test is a simple performance test with an integrated pain score, designed to provide useful information for monitoring treatment progress and evaluating treatment effects in clinical physiotherapy practice. The patient is asked to perform as many squatting movements (both legs) as possible within 30 seconds. The knees should reach approximately 90 degrees of flexion and full extension for each squat. This is supervised by the rater. There outcome of the test is the knee pain during the test on a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) rated immediately after the test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change fom baseline in the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The pain self-efficacy questionnaire is a 10-item questionnaire developed to assess the confidence people with pain have in performing activities while in pain. It is applicable to all persisting pain presentations, and covers a range of functions. Confidence in performing activities are rated on a 7-point (0-6) Likert scale with 0 representing not at all confident and 6 representing completely confident. A total score is calculated by summing the answers producing a score between 0 and 60. Higher scores reflect stronger self-efficacy beliefs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transition Questionnaire of global perceived effect on overall health, pain, and function</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Transition Questionnaire of global perceived effect is an adaptive questionnaire in which the participants initially answer if their current state is &quot;unchanged, worse&quot; or &quot;better&quot; compared to the baseline visit. An &quot;unchanged&quot; equals a transition score of 0. If the participant answers &quot;worse&quot;, he/she is asked to rate the degree of worsening on a 7 point Likert scale, and the corresponding scores range from -1 to -7. Correspondingly, if a participant answers &quot;better&quot;, he/she is asked to rate the degree of improvement on a 7 point Likert scale, and the corresponding scores range from 1 to 7. Thus the Transition score range from -7 (worsening) to 7 (improvement), with the mid-point - 0 - representing no change. The transition scale is used to assess overall knee related health status.</description>

    <measure>Candidate prognostic factor: PainDetect questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The painDETECT questionnaire (PDQ) is a patient reported questionnaire developed and validated to assess presence of signs of neuropathic pain. It comprises questions regarding pain intensity, course of pain, subjective experience of a radiating quality of the pain, and the presence and perceived severity of seven somatosensory symptoms of neuropathic pain. A validated algorithm is used to calculate a total score ranging from 0 to 38. A score ≤12 indicates that the presence of neuropathic pain is unlikely, a score ≥19 indicates that a neuropathic pain component is likely to be present, while a score of 13-18 points towards unclear screening conclusion.</description>
