    <textblock>
      The RANGER II SFA is a global, prospective, multi-center clinical trial. Approximately 396
      subjects will be enrolled at up to 80 study centers worldwide. Regions participating include
      the United States, Canada, European Union, Japan and New Zealand.

      The trial consists of a single-blind, superiority, 3:1 (Ranger DCB vs. Standard PTA)
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) and a concurrent, non-randomized, single-arm,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy.
