    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, two armed trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Fenfuro
      capsule twice daily for 90 days in 100 patients with type 2 diabetes that will be conducted
      in single center in India. The primary outcome measures will be the determination of decrease
      in plasma glucose levels from baseline to last visit. The secondary outcome will be the
      determination of safety of Fenfuro capsule in type 2 diabetic subjects.

      Diabetes mellitus, involving rise in blood sugar levels, has shown to be a highly prevalent
      disease. Treatments and treatment regimens include combinations of oral anti-diabetic drugs
      (OADs), anti-hypertensive medications and anti-dyslipidemic agents, but these have been less
      than successful in managing their respective disease targets with clinical goals. Now-a-days,
      the treatment strategies for diabetes mellitus type 2 which are opted by general population
      include natural supplements. This choice is based upon the involvement of very less side
      effects along with high effectiveness of the natural supplements as compared to the synthetic
      medications. One of those natural supplements is fenugreek seeds extract i.e. Fenfuro which
      has been used as a nutraceutical in the present study for the management of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

      Fenugreek has been extensively used as a source of anti-diabetic compounds from long time.
      Thus, Fenfuro, prepared from fenugreek seeds extract, is supposed to have anti-diabetic
      properties as well. Previous studies on fenugreek seeds extract have shown effective and safe
      anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic properties of it. It has shown to decrease blood
      glucose levels as well as lipid profile of the diabetic patients.

      In this proposed study, Fenugreek seed extract will be used as an add-on to the existing
      therapy in patients with type-2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of the extract will be
      evaluated using standard methodology.
