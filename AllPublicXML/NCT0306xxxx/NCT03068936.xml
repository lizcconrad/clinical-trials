  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has high incidence in the southern China, especially in Guangdong
      Province. In the world, the standardized morbidity has reached 30/10 million in men while in
      women, about 13/10 million. At present, the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China
      accounted for more than 80% of the world. The cancer-related deaths is in the eighth, which
      is a serious threat to our people's health and life. A recent multi-center phase II study of
      stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma showed that: compared with Intensity Modulation
      Radiotherapy (IMRT) plus cisplatin, the 3 year local control rate, regional control rate,
      distant metastasis-free survival rate and disease-specific survival rate of IMRT were
      similar, but the side effects of radiotherapy alone group were lower.

      Based on the results of the phase II clinical study, the investigators designed this phase
      III clinical study, with the aim to compared the efficacy and toxicity of these two treatment
      programs. And finally to provide sufficient evidence for the treatment of stage II
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
