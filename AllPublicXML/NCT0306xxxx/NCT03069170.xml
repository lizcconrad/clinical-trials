      Until now, there is no effective approach to stop the progression of multiple sclerosis and
      stimulate re-myelination. Autologous stem cell transplantation shows hope and is quickly
      developing as an alternative therapy. We propose the use of autologous bone marrow-derived
      specific stem cell populations and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (BM-MSC) associated
      with immuno-modulation to treat patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune de-myelinating disease in which the myelin sheaths
      of nerve cells in the central nervous system are damaged.This damage disrupts the ability of
      parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms,
      including physical, mental, and psychiatric issues. To date, There is no known cure for
      multiple sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new
      attacks.

      Stem cells possess strong immunomodulatory properties that are shown to play a role in the
      maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and that may stimulate
      repair and regeneration of lesion. Clinical studies have shown that stem cells can be safely
      harvested and do not form tumors. Most of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical
      applications for haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both. When
      administered intravenously they have an immune inhibitory effect that can ameliorate animal
      autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical outcome in
      experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). When administered intravenously, MSC may migrate to
      inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival of nervous cells. Hence, MSC have become the
      focus of studies as a potential cell therapy for stimulating neuro-protection in human
      neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.

      We propose a safety and efficacy trial of a intravenous and intrathecal injections of
      autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells into patients with MS.
