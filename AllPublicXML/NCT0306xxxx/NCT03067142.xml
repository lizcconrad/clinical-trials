      The purpose of this study is to identify unique urine protein markers of Primary
      Hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) compared to healthy controls. Urine protein markers can be
      identified by &quot;proteomic&quot; analyses in which proteins are processed in a lab to break them
      down into smaller building blocks. Using analytical chemistry techniques and specialized
      equipment many proteins can be identified and measured. Most proteins are found in healthy
      living cells while subtle changes in these proteins or the presence of different markers
      reflect abnormal processes and patterns of disease. When identified in disease, protein
      biomarkers can help to determine if a disease responds to new types of therapies. In this
      study, changes in urine proteomic patterns over time, their association with change in
      estimated (calculated) kidney filtering function, and the relative risk for progression of
      PH1 will be determined. Additionally, as part of the study, the investigators will measure
      urinary proteins and peptides that are markers of kidney tissue protection (for healthy
      healing of the kidneys from ongoing damage from high urine oxalate levels, oxalate crystals
      and stones) to establish if and when these markers are prospectively decreased in PH1 urine.
      Longitudinal studies of urine &quot;proteomics&quot; may assist in identifying the mechanisms behind
      PH1-related progression of kidney failure and might contribute important information towards
      future identification and development of effective therapies to slow or prevent kidney
      failure in PH1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare genetically inherited disorder seen in
      1:100,000-150,000 people and is often underdiagnosed in children. PH1 is characterized by
      abnormally high levels of oxalate in the blood and urine, crystals in the urine, frequent
      formation of kidney stones, and hardening (calcification) of the kidneys called
      &quot;nephrocalcinosis.&quot; Identification and evaluation of proteins and peptides (biomarkers) in
      the urine of PH1 patients may provide insight into the process of kidney damage that occurs
      over time in PH1 by evaluating these markers at some point after diagnosis and over
      long-term. By studying biomarker patterns in the urine of PH1 patients that are collected
      over the course of their disease, information about changes in biomarker patterns over time
      may provide important clues about those patients at a higher risk for faster progression to
      end stage kidney failure and may serve as important outcomes for new therapies in the future,
      too.

      Primary study objective: Identify the unique urine proteomic markers of PH1 versus healthy
      intra-familial sibling controls of PHI patient specimens at one point in time
      (cross-sectionally).

      Secondary study objective: Determine change over time in urine proteomic patterns, their
      association with change in estimated (calculated) kidney filtering function, and the relative
      risk for progression of PH1 and kidney disease progression.

      Tertiary study objective: Establish if and when, in the course of PH1, the protective effects
      of the body (and kidneys) for normal kidney tissue healing are decreased/ lost as evidenced
      by the long-term change in biomarker patterns.

      The primary endpoints of this study include standard clinical endpoints (data that a kidney
      doctor would look at as a PH1 patient would be followed over time in the clinic), as they
      best reflect PH1 disease progression: (a) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), known
      as kidney filtering function; (b) urine oxalate; and (c) plasma oxalate (when eGFR &lt; 40
      ml/min/1.73 m2, which is when kidney function is significantly decreased).

      The goal of the Rare Kidney Stone Consortium (RKSC) is to advance understanding and treatment
      of severe, rare forms of nephrolithiasis that cause marked excretion of insoluble minerals
      important in stone formation in which patients experience recurring stones from childhood
      onward and are at risk for chronic kidney disease. End state renal disease is common in PH1.
      Importantly, these conditions are rare enough that there has been minimal sharing of
      information and expertise among clinicians and scientists, a situation that has slowed
      progress toward effective treatments. Over the last 6 years, RKSC has formed secure,
      web-based registries and tissue banks open for collaborative projects.

      About this Study: This is a pilot investigation using previously collected and archived (1)
      cross-sectional 24 hr. urine samples from PH1 patients (n=20) and healthy sibling controls
      (n=18) and (2) longitudinally collected 24 hr. urine samples from patients with PH1 enrolled
      in the RKSC registry bank (n=55). No new samples will be collected.

      Additional information that will be collected (or provided with the urine specimens) as part
      of this study: De-identified data from each patient's health history, medications and
      supplements taken; history of kidney stones (and their chemical make-up); gender, current
      age, height, weight; old measurements of urine acidity, and blood oxalate, urine oxalate,
      calcium, citrate, and creatinine (from muscle breakdown) concentrations, and urine super
      saturation.

    <description>(1) Quantitative Mass Spectrometry analyses will be completed on previously collected, de-identified, and archived urine specimens (collected at only one time point) from patients with Primary Hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and from healthy controls to determine unique protein markers in the urine of PH1 patients, taking into account archived data collected about: (a) known genetic PH1 mutations; (b) concomitant estimated kidney filtering function; (c) urine and plasma oxalate concentrations (using the measure of plasma oxalate when kidney function is low) (d) the level of kidney function (called a &quot;stage&quot;); and (e) any medications and supplements &amp; their dose and frequency taken for differences in disease (PH1) versus a healthy state. To accomplish this, urine specimens and data which were previously collected, de-identified, and archived will be provided by Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) and Ann &amp; Robert H.

    <description>Quantitative Mass Spectrometry analyses of previously collected, archived, and de-identified serial urine specimens (collected in up to/more than 5 years of follow-up) from patients with Primary Hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) will be completed to determine if a change occurs in: (1) urine proteomic patterns (proteins and peptides) over time using previously collected data on: (a) estimated kidney filtering function declines (indicating kidney disease progression) and (b) oxalate concentrations in the urine (or plasma) continue to rise. Statistical analyses will determine the relationship between the urine protein/peptide pattern changes over time to kidney disease progression in PH1. All previously collected, de-identified, and archived data and urine specimens will be provided by Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN).</description>

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Establish if and when, in the 5 year serial follow-up of Primary Hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) urine specimens, normal kidney tissue healing is decreased/lost (down regulated) and pathologic kidney tissue damage increases (upregulated). This will be evidenced by the long-term change in biomarker patterns and progressive loss of kidney filtering function. This will be accomplished using: (1) standard identification of specific urine protein and peptides using known databases and (2) statistical analyses for urine protein/peptide marker pattern development reflective of kidney pro-injury and irreversible kidney cell damage. (All serially collected, de-identified, and archived urine specimens and data will have been provided by Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN).</description>
