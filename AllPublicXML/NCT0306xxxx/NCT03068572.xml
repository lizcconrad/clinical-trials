  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linked color imaging(LCI),a new system for endoscopy modality,creates clear and bright
      endoscopic images by using short-wavelength narrow-band laser light combined with white laser
      light on the basis of magnifying blue laser imaging(BLI) technology.LCI makes red areas
      appear redder and white areas appear whiter.Thus,it is easier to recognize a slight
      difference in color of the mucosa.This is a study to assess the effectiveness of LCI for
      diagnosing esophageal minimal endoscopic lesions and Los Angeles classification system when
      compared to conventional white-light endoscopy (WLI).Gastroesophageal reflux disease(GERD) is
      a common disease that be defined as a condition which develops when the reflux of stomach
      contents cause troublesome symptoms and/or complications.Esophageal injury was classified
      according to the Los Angeles classification system,Non-erosive reflux disease(NERD) is
      defined by the presence of troublesome reflux-associated symptoms and the absence of mucosal
      breaks at endoscopy,which includes minimal change oesophagitis and no endoscopic
      abnormalities.LCI improved the visualization of the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) by
      enhancing the contrast,mucosa minimal changes could be seen more easily and clearly with LCI
      than with standard white-light endoscopy.By comparing White-light endoscopy and LCI,it will
      show if there is any comparable advantage to using one or the other for lesion detection.

      This is a prospective study comparing the use of linked color imaging(LCI) versus standard
      white light for the detection of minimal change esophageal.Gastroesophageal reflux
      disease(GERD) is a common disease that be defined as a condition which develops when the
      reflux of stomach contents cause troublesome symptoms and/or complications.At present,more
      than half the patients with GERD symptoms were diagnosed as having nonerosive reflux
      disease(NERD).However,by careful analysis,the majority of NERD patients did not have
      completely normal endoscopic finding but were found to have subtle distal esophageal mucosal
      changes.Forty-eight patients with suspected minimal change esophageal reflux disease(positive
      GerdQ but normal conventional endoscopy)and forty asymptomatic control were recruited.The new
      LCI(GF-L590WR) was performed.The criteria for positive liquid crystal thermography (LCT)
      were:a)triangular indentation,b)punctuate erythema.

    <description>45 GERD patients without obviously abnormality were examined by conventional white-light endoscopy and then followed by Linked Color imaging(LCI) to evaluate minimal change esophagitis and observation agreement of Los Angeles classification system GERD patients with the absence of mucosal breaks at conventional endoscopy,and those patients was given standard or double dose of oral proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 2 weeks to determine the efficacy of anti-secretory therapy (the so-called PPI test).The response to PPI treatment comprised the NERD group.</description>
