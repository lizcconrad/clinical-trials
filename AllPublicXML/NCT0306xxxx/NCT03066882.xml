  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative-calorie diet is among the popular dieting guides for weight loss; however, there is
      still little knowledge about this method. The present study aimed to determine the effects of
      negative-calorie diet on weight loss and lipid profile, and to compare its efficiency with
      low-calorie diet.
