  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 24-week single-center, open-label, parallel controlled group comparing gliclazide,
      liraglutide, and metformin effects on diabetes with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

      Following enrollment, eligible participants were randomized (1:1:1) using computer-generated
      random numbers to the metformin (Glucophage, Bristol-Myers Squibb), liraglutide (Victoza,
      Novo Nordisk), or gliclazide (Diamicron, Servier) groups. All patients were informed about a
      proper diet and exercise. For the metformin group (n = 31), the dosage was 250 mg thrice a
      day during the first week, 500 mg thrice a day during the second week, and 1000 mg twice a
      day from the third week to the conclusion of the study. For the gliclazide group (n = 31),
      the initial dosage was 30 mg before breakfast, which was gradually titrated to a maximum of
      120 mg/day to achieve a fasting capillary plasma glucose of &lt;7.0 mmol/L. For the liraglutide
      group (n = 31), the dosage was 0.6 mg/day during the first week, 1.2 mg/day during the second
      week, and 1.8 mg/day from the third week to the conclusion of the study.At the end of the
      study, data will be collected and analyzed.
