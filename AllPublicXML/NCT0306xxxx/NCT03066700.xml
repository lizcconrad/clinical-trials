  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study to identify the prognostic factors of the good outcomes in
      patients who presented with upper GI bleeding from tumor and received Hemospray via endoscopy
      for hemostatic control. The good outcomes were assessed by immediate hemostasis, rebleeding
      at 72 hours as well as 7, 14 and 30 days following presentation at initial bleeding episode
      and also 6-month survival rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor-related gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is increasing due to the advancement of
      treatment in oncology. However, conventional endoscopic hemostatic methods are not reliable
      to control bleeding. Surgery, embolization, and radiotherapy can served as the salvage
      hemostasis; though, a bridging endoscopic therapy is required during resuscitation and
      stabilization of the patients. Hemospray is a recent novel endoscopic hemostatis powder which
      has a trend to be an effective instrument for controlling the active upper GI tumor bleeding
      from a match-pair, case-control study by the author's recent publication. Consequently, the
      authors hypothesized that there are some prognostic factors related to the outcome of
      Hemospray treatment in tumor bleeding.

    <description>HemosprayTM (Tc-325) is an endoscopic hemostatis powder that came onto market recently. It is made of an inorganic, non-absorbable powder which acts locally at the mucosa. When spraying the powder on to the bleeding site, it creates an adherent stable barrier sheath that allows for at least temporary hemostasis. Neither luminal nor systemic side effects have been reported to date.</description>
