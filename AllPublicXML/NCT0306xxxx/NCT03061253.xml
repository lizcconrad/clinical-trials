  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The large current uptake of e-cigarettes (2.8 million U.K. users in 2016; 26), the continuous
      involvement of e-cigarettes (which potentially affects their contents as well), the
      uncertainty about their medium- and longer-term effects, and the need to promote smoking
      cessation as means of reducing Cardiovascular disease, dictate that more research is urgently
      needed. Research exploring the impact of e-cigarettes on cardiovascular function/ health has
      been requested by the European Parliament, the British Medical Association, regulatory
      agencies, clinicians and researchers, as there is currently no consensus within the smoking
      cessation community as to the potential impact of e-cigarettes. With e-cigarettes being
      successful in replacing traditional cigarettes (i.e. up to 42% within a month), such studies
      should not only be efficacy-focused, but should also explore the physiological effects of
      e-cigarettes, as preliminary work in the field is contrasting and limited, in both the acute-
      and longer-term timeframe. Furthermore, as e-cigarettes are not simple nicotine-based
      products, the general public, researchers and government agencies cannot rely on the existing
      research exploring the effects of nicotine on the cardio-vasculature (e.g. coronary and
      peripheral vasoconstriction, intravascular inflammation and deregulation of cardiac autonomic
      function as well as inhibition of microcirculation). Thus, the lack of direct evidence -
      which would clarify the degree of safety of e-cigarettes for the user's vascular system and
      determine their longer-term cardiovascular disease risk - increases the need for research in
      the field.

      Such studies will supply in-depth information to service-users and policy-makers, especially
      as the recently-initiated U.K.'s &quot;Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency&quot;
      validation of e-cigarettes will increase likelihood of their introduction in smoking
      cessation clinics.

      This study will bridge the existing knowledge gap and inform the general public, the
      scientific and the smoking cessation community in respect to the physiological (e.g.
      cardiovascular health) and participants' experience of both nicotine-inclusive and
      nicotine-free, e-cigarettes (when combined with behavioural change support) and compare it
      against a currently NHS-applied smoking cessation pathway that combines Nicotine Replacement
      Therapy and behavioural change support. This will allow future research to advance and
      optimize the pharmacological treatment of tobacco and nicotine dependence, by taking into
      consideration the study's physiological and Health Economics' findings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  smokers (at least 10 cigarettes/ day for the past year)

          -  willing to attempt quit smoking by using the National Health Service smoking cessation
             services or via e-cigarette use.

          -  Non-ambulant people and people with a recent (e.g. within 6 months) cardiovascular
             disease event (e.g. stroke, myocardial infarction) or cardiac surgery,

          -  people with insulin-controlled diabetes mellitus or with coexisting skin conditions,
             leg ulcers, vasculitis or deep venous occlusion (as these may affect their
             cardiovascular function),

          -  pregnant women,

          -  people who require major surgery (which will prevent them of taking part in the study)

          -  people who following referral to the smoking cessation services, are advised that
             Nicotine Replacement Therapy is not appropriate for them,

          -  people who are currently using e-cigarettes on a daily basis, or currently undertaking
             an attempt within a smoking cessation service,

          -  people who are judged to be unable or are unwilling to give informed consent.

        The study team will assess prospective participants and will not include in the study those
        who appear too frail or have health problems (e.g. dementia, Alzheimer's etc.) that might
        prevent them of giving a conscious, informed consent.
