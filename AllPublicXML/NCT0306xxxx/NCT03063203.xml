      In this study, the investigators seek to determine whether decitabine therapy can improve
      outcomes, specifically overall survival this selected subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      patients with the poorest prognosis based on refractoriness to induction treatment and high
      risk genetic mutations.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  TP53 mutant relapsed/refractory AML following 7+3 (or similar cytarabine containing
             induction chemotherapy for AML) disease detected by one of the following methods:

               -  bone marrow blasts &gt; 5%, or

               -  Hematologics flow cytometry assay (threshold &gt; 0.5%) (alternative equivalent
                  assay may be substituted), or

               -  Persistent cytogenetic abnormality (e.g. del5, del17p, etc), by FISH or
                  conventional karotyping, or

               -  Persistent TP53 mutation (at least 5 variant reads with at least 50x coverage).

          -  Patients with &gt; 10% blasts on a day +14 bone marrow biopsy following 7+3 may either be
             enrolled or may be treated with a course of standard re-induction (e.g. 5+2 or
             similar) and then re-evaluated for response. Eligible patients will meet any of the
             above criteria on a subsequent biopsy.

        The presence of a TP53 mutation should be determined by Genoptix (or institutional
        preferred equivalent assay) for all patients. Detection of a TP53 mutation at the time of
        initial diagnosis is sufficient for enrollment. Detection of a TP53 mutation in either the
        peripheral blood or bone marrow is adequate for enrollment.

          -  Bone marrow and organ function as defined below:

               -  Peripheral white blood cell count &lt; 50,000/mcl (patients may receive hydroxyurea
                  as necessary for cytoreduction),

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal,

               -  AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal,

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal, and,

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable

          -  Performance status ≤ 3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with either decitabine or azacitidine.

          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia with PML-RARA or t(15;17).

          -  Active HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection.

          -  Concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing uncontrolled infection,
             symptomatic NYHA class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or

          -  Radiation therapy within 14 days of enrollment.

          -  Chemotherapy administration in the 14 days preceding enrollment with the exception of
             hydroxyurea, which can be continued until Cycle 2. A washout period for oral tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors (e.g. Jakafi, etc) is not required, although tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors therapy must be discontinued prior to enrollment.

          -  Malignancies requiring active therapy, with the exception of basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin which can be treated with local resection only or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to decitabine or other agents used in the study.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             urine pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry.
