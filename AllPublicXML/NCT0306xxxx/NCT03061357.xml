      This project was a cluster randomized trial examining the effects of utilizing a wearable
      activity tracker in a credit-based Physical Activity Instructional Program on promoting
      habitual levels of physical activity (PA) in college students.

      The project was conducted in a large public university located in the mid-south region of the
      US. The university offers more than one hundred 1-credit hour PAIPs per academic semester.
      Considering the pilot nature of the study, the target PAIPs was limited to those meeting the
      following inclusion criteria: 1) PAIP with a size of 30 students that generally show an
      approximately equal gender distribution; and 2) PAIP that delivers the principles and
      practice of individually tailored habitual activity plans. The investigators randomly
      selected 14 eligible PAIPs and assigned them into intervention (k=7) and control (k=7)
      groups. The outcome measures of interests were the changes in objectively and subjectively
      measured physical activity over an academic semester.

    <description>Participants in intervention arm were provided with a small and lightweight activity tracker, Misfit Flash (Misfit Wearables Co., Burlingame, CA), that can be worn with a clasp or watch band. A handout detailing the step-by-step instructions for utilizing the activity tracker with Misfit App on their smartphone was provided. There was no intervention component mandated in the curriculum of intervention PAIP courses; rather, participants were continuously encouraged by the instructors to track their activity levels and use all the features in Misfit App on a daily basis as they learned health benefits of PA and as to how to develop individualized, life-long PA plan during the course of semester.</description>
