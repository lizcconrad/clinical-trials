  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the preventive vaccine efficacy (VE), safety
      and tolerability of a heterologous prime/boost regimen utilizing Ad26.Mos4.HIV and
      aluminum-phosphate adjuvanted Clade C gp140 for the prevention of Human Immuno Virus (HIV)
      infection in HIV-seronegative women residing in sub-Saharan Africa from confirmed HIV-1
      infections diagnosed between the Month 7 and Month 24 visits.

             twice in the past 30 days prior to screening, and is considered by the site staff to
             be at risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection

          -  Access to a participating HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) Clinical Research Sites
             (CRS) and willingness to be followed for the planned duration of the study

          -  Willingness to discuss HIV infection risks and willing to receive HIV risk reduction
             counseling and appropriate referrals to minimize HIV acquisition, as applicable

          -  Negative beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) pregnancy test performed prior
             to vaccination on the day of initial vaccination. Persons who are NOT of reproductive
             potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy
             (verified by medical records), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing

          -  Participants must also agree not to seek pregnancy through alternative methods, such

             vaccination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigational research agents received within 30 days before first vaccination

          -  HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For volunteers who have received
             control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 705/HPX2008 (Protocol Safety Review
             Team) PSRT will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis

          -  Live attenuated vaccines other than influenza vaccine received within 30 days before
             first vaccination or scheduled within 14 days after injection (example: measles,
             mumps, and rubella [MMR]; oral polio vaccine [OPV]; varicella; yellow fever)

          -  Influenza vaccine or any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines and were
             received within 14 days prior to first vaccination (eg, tetanus, pneumococcal,
             Hepatitis A or B)

          -  Immunosuppressive medications received within 6 months before first vaccination
