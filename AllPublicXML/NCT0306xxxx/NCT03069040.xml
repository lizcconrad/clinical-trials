    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer in young patients increased significantly in recent years, and early surgical
      treatment for patients with 5 years of survival rate is as high as 90%, But the traditional
      extensive hysterectomy (RH) caused by intraoperative pelvic autonomic nerve may damage the
      bladder and rectum and the incidence of complications such as sexual dysfunction is nearly
      25% to 80%, thus seriously affect the patient's quality of life.Pelvic autonomic nerve
      preservation system of extensive hysterectomy (NSRH) can decrease the complications of above,
      but at home and abroad mainly adopts pulling the urine tube time, determination methods of
      residual urine volume, bladder function are studied in only a few scholars urine flow
      mechanics method is applied to carry on objective appraisal limited cases of postoperative
      bladder function, and the anorectal function damage ï¼Œwe can use the anorectal dynamics to get
      objective index of anorectal function .overall research lack of large sample research of
      dynamic system. No objective index to evaluate the anorectal function In the early stage of
      the study, we have conducted about uterine ligament, sacral ligaments and nerve distribution
      of the bladder cervix vaginal ligament of experimental research, provide the neural anatomy
      basis for NSRH operation, and based on research for innovative operation scheme is put
      forward.Proposed on the basis of the above research, this study adopt the internationally
      used - urine flow mechanics, the method for evaluating the bladder function of NSRH, RH, two
      kinds of the injured function of bladder surgery patients before and after operation of
      comparative study, the change of dynamic assessment before and after surgery in patients with
      bladder function,and the anorectal function dameage and than provide the basis for further
      treatment.

    <description>Type C1 radical hysterectomy,that is nerve sparing radical hysterectomy, requires separation of two parts of the dorsal parametria: the medialpart , which entails recto -uterineandrecto-vaginal ligaments, and the lateral laminar structure, also called mesoureter, which contains the hypogastric plexus. Furthermore, type C1 requires only a partial dissection of the ureter from the ventral parametria, which is usually asymmetric towards more extensive resection of the medial leaf of the cranial (above the ureter) part of the ventral parametria .</description>

    <description>In the C2 type, the ureter is completely dissected from the ventral parametria up to the urinary bladder wall. Defining the resection limits on the longitudinal (deep parametrial or vertical) plane is crucial for distinguishing between types C1 and C2.</description>
