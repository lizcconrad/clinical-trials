  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      m-RESIST is an m-health intervention program aimed to develop, test and evaluate a tool to
      allow patients suffering from treatment-resistant schizophrenia to self-manage their
      condition. This may facilitate acceptance and involvement of patients with their own
      treatment, as well as of caregivers. Moreover this programme could provide a new tool to the
      psychiatrist, psychologists working together with other health care professionals, to better
      monitor patients, through a personalised and optimised therapeutic process.

      The present document corresponds to the pilot field-trials phase included in a three year
      European research project, co-funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European
      Union (grant agreement nº 643552). This document summarises the protocol of the whole
      therapeutic process, specifying all the procedures included in the program. This protocol
      will be implemented in three countries: Israel, Hungary and Spain, in order to test
      acceptability, usability, satisfaction and changes in the quality of life reported by the
      end-users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the present study is to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and
      satisfaction to m-RESIST solution among the target groups (patients, caregivers, clinicians),
      and also to evaluate the effect of m-RESIST solution to empowerment and perceived quality of
      life of the treatment-resistant Schizophrenia patients (TRS). Interventions targeting key
      problems in TRS (risk behaviours, persistent symptoms of psychosis, poor medication
      adherence, lifestyle habits) will be administered in a clinical setting, with the long-term
      goal of creating a widely-available system that can be deployed by users as needed, in their
      own environments.

      The study will be conducted in three different regions: Gertner (Israel), Semmelweis
      (Hungary) and Barcelona (Spain). Consequently, the outcomes obtained in each site and their
      comparison will allow improving the m-RESIST program in terms of interoperability,
      integration of components and final implementation of the interactive system in the
      healthcare pathways.

      The participants will be selected from Sheba Medical Center - Psychiatric Division (Tel
      Aviv), Semmelweis University - Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (Budapest), and the
      adult psychiatric outpatient service of Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona).

      A total of 45 patients with TRS (15 per centre), with their caregiver, will be included in
      the trial. All participants will be fully informed about the nature of the study (aims,
      methodology) and the system tested (data protection, expected risks/benefits, possible
      adverse events) and they will sign the informed consent for their participation in this
      study.

    <description>m-RESIST is a system designed to improve illness self-management and facilitate recovery in individuals with Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). The system will be used to
Continuously capture multidimensional behavior as it occurs in real-time and in real-world environments, using continuous collection and analysis of sensor data.
Detect individual early warning signs, and trigger targeted interventions that may mitigate the severity of worsening or prevent their recurrence altogether, using the clinical decision-suport system (CDSS) and Recommender operation.
The m-RESIST will deliver both system initiated (i.e. pre-programmed) and patient initiated (i.e. on demand) real-time assessments, to the participants and in their own environment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Schizophrenia following the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
             disorders (DSM-V) criteria.

          -  Meet criteria for &quot;treatment-resistant schizophrenia&quot;, term referred to two different
             subgroups of patients:

               -  Patients with schizophrenia who are refractory despite receiving antipsychotic
                  treatment in suitable doses and duration (at least two dopaminergic-receptors RD2
                  antagonist antipsychotics, or on-going treatment with clozapine due to meeting
                  treatment-resistant criteria), and presenting good adherence to treatment
                  (Peuskens, 1999).

               -  Patients who may be considered pseudo-resistant to the treatment or
                  resistance-like (Elkis &amp; Meltzer, 2007). In this case, presence of active
                  symptoms may be influenced by psychiatric and medical conditions such as poor
                  insight, negative attitude to medication, social isolation, consumption of toxic
                  substances, presence of nutritional and medical problems, inappropriate health
                  habits, as well as poor alliance and/or environment conditions (low involvement
                  of caregivers in the therapeutic process), which may substantially contribute to
                  poor responses or insufficient effects of medication.

          -  Duration of disease less than 15 years.

          -  Used to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and having the physical
             capability to use them (determined using the Technological Readiness Questionnaire).

          -  Presence (and willingness to participate) of a caregiver or informal carer -family
             members or significant others- of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

          -  Both patient and caregiver should sign the informed consent before entering the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Meet criteria for remission according to the Remission of Schizophrenia Working Group
             (Andreasen et al., 2005.)

          -  The presence of delusions mainly related with their therapists or with new
             technologies.

          -  Hearing, vision, or motor impairment that makes it impossible to operate a smartphone.

          -  Presence of a caregiver or Informal carer not used to ICT or physical incapability to
             use them (determined using the Technological Readiness Questionnaire).

          -  Presence of intellectual developmental disability.-
