  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a number of popular, freely available online interventions targeting hazardous
      alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, most have limited or no published evidence regarding
      their efficacy. Of particular interest is the intervention, 'Hello Sunday Morning.' The
      current project proposes to evaluate its' efficacy employing a RCT, using The Check Your
      Drinking intervention as an active comparator in the trial.

      Participants will be recruited through Amazon's MTurk crowdsourcing platform. Potential
      participants identified as problem drinkers based on an initial survey will be invited to
      complete another survey in 6 months time. Those who agree to be followed-up will be assigned
      by chance to be asked versus not asked to access one of the interventions and then
      recontacted 6 months later to ask about their drinking and their impressions of the online
      intervention. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that participants receiving access to
      any of the online interventions will report a greater level of reduction in number of drinks
      in a typical week between the baseline survey and six-month follow-up as compared to
      participants in the control condition.
