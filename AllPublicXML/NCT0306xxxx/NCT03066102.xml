  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of scapular muscle fatigue on scapular
      joint position sense and neuromuscular performance (scapular muscle strength, the kinematics
      data and muscle activity of shoulder during scaption (arm elevation in the scapular plane)).
      The investigators hypothesize that scapular muscle fatigue would increase scapular reposition
      error and affect neuromuscular performance of the scapular during scaption.
