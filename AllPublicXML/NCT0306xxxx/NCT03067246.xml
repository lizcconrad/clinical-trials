    <textblock>
      A study comparing two second generation supraglottic Airway devices, the VBM intubating
      laryngeal tube and the I-Gel.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study comparing the use of a newer generation laryngeal mask to the 2nd generation
      widely used at present. The company responsible for the manufacture of this product is VBM
      Medizintechnik GmBH, Germany. The recent difficult airway society guidelines recommend the
      use of these newer generation devices and this has been the incentive to conduct this
      project. These newer generation supraglottic devices have an additional feature which is an
      extension of the mask with a balloon that sits in the oesophagus. The trial is investigating
      ease of placement of these devices, ventilatory pressures, leak pressure and ease of
      intubation through the VBM device compared to I-Gel. The position of the supraglottic device
      on insertion and the position of the endotracheal tube will be confirmed with a fibrescope. A
      follow up will take place on the same day and after 24 hours for symptoms of a sore throat
      postoperatively.

    <description>The position of the VBM Intubating Laryngeal Tube will be assessed using a fibreoptic scope following balloon inflation of the cuff. Seal pressure will be assessed with the presence of the inflated cuff. Endotracheal intubation through the intubating laryngeal tube with a size 7 VBM reinforced tube will be assessed using a fiberoptic scope.</description>
