  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) have a potential to develop into a malignant
      disease with varying severity. Decision making on when and how to make a therapeutic
      intervention is not simple. Endoscopic equipment that can enter the pancreatic duct itself
      can provide the much needed additional information on the cystic condition. Visual
      inspection, direct visual guided biopsies from the target and the cytology of the flushing
      fluid of the pancreatic duct may be helpful in the decision making process of when and how to
      treat the condition. We study whether SpyGlass pancreatoscopy brings accuracy to the
      diagnostic process concerning IPMNs and does it provide additional information to help make
      decisions about therapeutical interventions. We also document complications related to the
      procedure itself in the following weeks after the procedure.

    <textblock>
      In this part retrospective, part prospective single-center study we look in to the patients
      who have undergone SpyGlass pancreatoscopy in Helsinki University Hospital in the recent
      years, and recruit patients continuously to obtain a significant amount of study subjects. We
      investigate the radiological findings and diagnoses before the SpyGlass procedure, and if
      ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) has been performed, also brush
      cytology.

      During the SpyGlass procedure we collect direct visual guided biopsies of the suspected IPMN
      area and the flushing liquid used in the pancreatic duct. We then compare the diagnosis given
      by the collected samples to the ones the patients had based on examinations before the
      SpyGlass pancreatoscopy.

      Our SpyGlass pancreatoscopy technique is different compared to previous studies. With our
      equipment we are able to provide pancreatoscopy to patients, who previously have had an
      endoscopic stenting procedure affecting their pancreatic duct. We also collect and analyze
      the flushing fluid for malignant cells, which haven't been done before. With these new means
      we hope to get more accurate results.
