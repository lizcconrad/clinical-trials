  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key part in promoting
      neovascularization and edema in neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).
      VEGF inhibitors (anti-VEGF), including ranibizumab (LUCENTIS®, Genentech) and aflibercept
      (EYLEA®, Regeneron), have been shown to be safe and effective for treating nAMD and have
      demonstrated improvement in vision. However, anti-VEGF therapy is administered frequently via
      intravitreal injection and can be a significant burden to the patients. RGX-314 is a
      recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vector carrying a coding sequence for a
      soluble anti-VEGF protein. The long-term, stable delivery of this therapeutic protein
      following a 1 time gene therapy treatment for nAMD could potentially reduce the treatment
      burden of currently available therapies while maintaining vision with a favorable
      benefit:risk profile.

      This Phase I, open-label, multiple-cohort, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of RGX-314 gene therapy in subjects with previously treated nAMD.
      Three doses will be studied in approximately 18 subjects. Subjects who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and have an anatomic response to an initial anti VEGF injection
      will receive a single dose of RGX-314 administered by subretinal delivery. RGX-314 uses an
      AAV8 vector that contains a gene that encodes for a monoclonal antibody fragment which binds
      to and neutralizes VEGF activity. Safety will be the primary focus for the initial 24 weeks
      after RGX-314 administration (primary study period). Following completion of the primary
      study period, subjects will continue to be assessed until 104 weeks following treatment with
      RGX-314.
