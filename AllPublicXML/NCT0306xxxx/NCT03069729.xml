  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to develop better tools for diagnosing illness of the feet and
      legs of people who have diabetes. Investigators will use thermal videos of the foot to aid in
      the refinement of a system designed to detect signs of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).
      The team of investigators will also look at diabetic eye disease and how it might relate to
      diabetic foot disease.

      This study focuses on further development and testing of a microvascular functional imaging
      system, a computer-based system for screening thermal video images, designed to detect
      biomarkers of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Additionally, severity levels of diabetic
      retinopathy (DR) will be compared with those of DPN.

      All participants in this study will undergo foot exams, thermal imaging of the foot, and
      standard retinal imaging. These non-invasive assessments will be performed at an initial
      study visit. Some of the participants will be offered additional study visits. One of the
      additional visits involves a standard nerve conduction velocity assessment by a neurologist,
      the other involves a DPN exam by a podiatrist.

      Portions of the study take place at University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNM
      HSC). The research utilizes services of the Clinical Translational Science Center (CTSC).

      The study is approved by University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center's Human Research
      Review Committee (HRRC), which coordinates and supports the activities of the three federally
      mandated Human Research Review Committees (HRRCs) responsible for reviewing and approving all
      human research.

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between severity levels of DR and DPN will be determined.
The severity level of DR will be assessed by qualified retinal image readers. Level of severity will be assigned, based on the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale, into 5 levels:
No apparent retinopathy
Mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy
Moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy
Severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
The severity of DPN will be graded by utilizing data from assessments from a DPN exam performed by an experienced podiatrist, Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV) test performed by a neurologist, and assessments performed by technicians. Data utilized will include:
NVC results
Vibration threshold, reported in seconds
Monofilament test of protective sensation</description>
