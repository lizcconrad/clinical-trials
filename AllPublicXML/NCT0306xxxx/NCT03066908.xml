      A prospective, single arm, multicenter study designed to demonstrate that the Sinopsys®
      Lacrimal Stent can safely create transcaruncular access to the ethmoid sinus to enable sinus
      irrigation and reduce symptoms in patients with moderate to severe chronic rhinosinusitis.

             turbinectomy are not exclusions.

             classification type 3

          -  Prior surgical history, physical exam, nasal endoscopy and/or imaging studies that
             suggest significant craniofacial deformity (such as any facial anatomic abnormality
             from surgical intervention, trauma, and congenital or any other cause thus prohibiting
             adequate placement of the Sinopsys Lacrimal Stent

          -  Presence of a sinonasal encepholocele as determined by Non-Contrast CT scan

          -  Febrile illness within 2 weeks of procedure and/or active pus from nose

          -  Any sign of active ophthalmic disease, infection, or inflammation including the
             presence of severe ocular surface inflammatory disease as determined by ophthalmic and
             physical exam, which could be exacerbated by the presence of the device

          -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) worse than 20/50

          -  Dry Eye disease defined by the following:

          -  Corneal staining showing superficial punctate keratopathy of Grade 1 or higher in
             either eye at Screening Visit

          -  Use of topical or systemic prescription ocular medications, except rewetting drops for
             contact lens-related discomfort, for the eye to treat an active ophthalmic disease at
             or within 14 days of screening and through procedure

          -  Underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the
             subject at high risk if IV sedation (MAC or monitored anesthesia care) were used
             during the procedure

          -  Excessive ocular and/or adipose tissue that may obscure implanted device visualization
             and/or placement

             postmenopausal for at least 1 year (&gt; 12 months since last menses) or are surgically
             sterilized do not require testing

          -  Severe co-morbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate (i.e. other
             disease processes, mental capacity, cognitive function, substance abuse, shortened
             life expectancy, vulnerable patient population, high surgical risk)

          -  Currently involved in another clinical study where that participation may conflict or
             interfere with the treatment, follow-up or results of this clinical study
