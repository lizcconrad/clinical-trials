  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Promising results have shown that interventions to reduce insomnia diminish suicidal
      ideation. A better understanding of the bidirectional mechanism between sleep disturbances
      and suicide behavior will allow the design of tailored interventions to prevent suicide
      attempts.

      Significance of the proposed study for the field The aim of the present is to assess the
      feasibility and the acceptability of sleep tracking monitoring in a sample of suicide
      attempters. The investigator hypothesize that sleep monitoring using a connected object is
      feasable and acceptable by patients.

    <description>The Watch (PulseOn or Suunto Spartan Ultra) and a smartphone will be given to the patient after discharge. After a brief training on how to use the sleep tracker, patient will monitor his sleep with watch during the five nights following the discharge. All data will be transmitted directly to the smartphone. Each morning, the patient will complete a questionnaire to assess the quality of his sleep and on day 5, during a standart follow up visit, he will complete a questionnaire evaluating the acceptability of the sleep recording device.</description>
