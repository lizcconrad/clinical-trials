      OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether respiratory variations of the inferior vena cava (ΔIVC)
      and internal jugular vein (ΔIJV) diameters during standardized breathing (ΔIVCST and ΔIJVST)
      increase after a therapeutic bleeding in spontaneously breathing and non-obese patients with
      genetic hemochromatosis.

      DESIGN: Prospective, monocentric study in the EFS Nord-de-France blood center.

      PATIENTS: Non-obese patients with genetic hemochromatosis undergoing a therapeutic bleeding.

      INTERVENTIONS: Ultrasound measures and collected clinical parameters before and after a
      therapeutic bleeding, during a standardized respiratory maneuver.

      MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the ΔIVCST change induced by a 300 to
      500ml therapeutic bleeding. It measured the minimal and maximal IVC and IJV diameters during
      a standardized respiratory maneuver. ΔIVCST and ΔIJVST were calculated as follows: [(maximal
      diameter - minimal diameter)/maximal diameter].100.
