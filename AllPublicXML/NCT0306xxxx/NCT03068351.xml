  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter, global study designed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of RO6870810 as monotherapy and in combination with daratumumab in participants
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Each treatment cycle will be 21 days in length.
      There are two parts to this study. A dose-escalation phase (Part I) will be used to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability and dose limiting toxicities, and to establish the maximum
      tolerated dose/optimum biological dose of RO6870810 when given as monotherapy or in
      combination with daratumumab. A dose-expansion phase (Part II) will further characterize the
      safety, tolerability and activity of RO6870810 as monotherapy or in combination with
      daratumumab at the defined expansion dose-levels.

    <measure>Number of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first drug administration to end of dose-escalation phase (up to approximately 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs are defined as the toxicities known and expected of RO6870810 and daratumumab that occur during a DLT assessment window of 21 days from the first administration of RO6870810 or study combination treatments, and are considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment. DLTs are defined at specific severity levels for each term and include, but are not limited to the following Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) terms: neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and injection site reaction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of study (up to approximately 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants whose confirmed best overall response is either complete response (CR, including stringent complete response [sCR]) or partial response (PR, including very good partial response [VGPR]), assessed with use of the IMWG criteria. CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and &lt;5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. sCR: CR plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. PR: &gt;/=50% reduction of serum M-protein plus reduction in 24h urinary M-protein by &gt;/=90% or to &lt;200 mg/24h. VGPR: serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis; or &gt;/=90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level &lt;100 mg/24h. ORR= CR + sCR + PR + VGPR</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of study (up to approximately 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression (per IMWG criteria) or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as an increase of &gt;/= 25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following: serum M-component, urine M-component, in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (the absolute increase must be &gt;10 mg/dL), bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute level &gt;/= 10%), definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of study (up to approximately 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>DoR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response (sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR) to the time of first disease progression per IMWG criteria or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as an increase of &gt;/= 25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following: serum M-component, urine M-component, in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (the absolute increase must be &gt;10 mg/dL), bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute level &gt;/= 10%), definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to end of study (up to approximately 2.5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
