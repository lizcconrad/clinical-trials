  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of a two-step mouth rinsing procedure on
      reducing the germs (mutans Streptococci) that cause tooth decay. We hope that the two-step
      mouth rinse (0.3% NaOCl followed by 10% Povidone Iodine) decreases the tooth causing germs
      better than the one-step mouth rinse (10% Povidone Iodine). The mouth rinse for both
      treatment groups is done only once at the beginning of the study after the initial saliva
      samples are taken, and before a detailed examination of the teeth and gums. It is
      hypothesized that the treatment group receiving the NaOCl and Povidone iodine will have
      significantly lower microbial counts than the control group (Povidone iodine) because the
      NaOCl will disrupt the microbial biofilm and make the Povidone iodine more effective in
      decreasing the microbes in the biofilm. Microbial counts are made from Salivary samples taken
      from participants at baseline, one week, one month, two months and three months. The samples
      are tested by two commercial methods for determining microbial counts. The CariScreen Test is
      a rapid bioluminescence assay that quantitates the total number of all of the organisms
      present. The CRT test requires a culture media that is specific for the two germs (S. mutans
      and Lactobacillus) strongly associated with tooth decay. The results of the CRT Test are read
      after three days of incubation.

    <description>The CRT test is done on culture media that is specific for S. mutans and Lactobacillus. After incubation for 3 days the colonies are compared to photographic standards. Caries Screen is done after the saliva sample is placed in a meter that reads the number of microbes present.</description>

    <description>. Participants were assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups and continued in parallel for the three-month duration of the study. The control group (CT) rinsed with iodine (10%) for minute. The CT group was a positive control. Both of these treatments were done only once at the baseline. The reminder of the three-month study was to obtain saliva samples at specific times to determining microbial levels.</description>
