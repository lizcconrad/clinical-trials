  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Early diagnosis of respiratory impairment in Post-Polio (PPS) patients may delay
      respiratory decline and future need of invasive respiratory aids.

      Objectives: To compare pulmonary function measures, maximal respiratory pressure and activity
      levels and fatigue of respiratory muscles between patients with PPS and healthy controls.

      Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Hadassah physical medicine and rehabilitation
      department, Jerusalem. Patients: Patients with PPS (N=12; 6 males; age 62.1±11.6 years) able
      to walk for 6 minutes without human assistance; age-matched healthy subjects (N=12; 4 males;
      age 62.2±6.5 years).

      Intervention: None. Measurements: A body plethysmograph was used to quantify forced
      expiratory volume in the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver, vital capacity, slow
      vital capacity, Residual Volume (RV), Total Lung Capacity (TLC), and Thoracic Gas Volume
      (TGV). Also, RV to TLC ratio is calculated. A manometer was used to measure Maximal
      Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP). A spirometer was used to
      measure Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV). Surface electromyography (sEMG) recorded
      diaphragmatic muscle activity during rest and while performing MVV.
