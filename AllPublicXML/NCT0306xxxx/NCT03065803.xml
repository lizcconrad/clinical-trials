    <textblock>
      Introduction and evaluation of a new technique for socket preservation involving internal
      expansion of the buccal plate of the extraction socket using internal flapless corticotomy
      and bone grafting the extraction socket with application of bioresorbable membrane
      biomaterials in comparison with the conventional guided bone regeneration technique for a
      conventional socket preservation method hoping to maintain or improve hard and soft tissue
      contour of the alveolar ridge post tooth extraction.

    <description>An internal osteotomy of the socket buccal plate will be performed with a piezotome (SurgyStar).
Two vertical osteotomies and one horizontal osteotomy will be made to push the buccal plate outward from the socket. Two small cervical releasing incisions will be made in the mesiobuccal and distobuccal aspects of the socket to permit the displacement of the osteotomies in the area of keratinized tissue. The socket will be loaded with natural bovine bone mineral (cerabone). The biomaterial will be pressed to push the released buccal plate outward. A collagen bio absorbable membrane will be utilized to cover the socket. The collagen membrane plug will be stabilized on the top of the socket with a cross suture (silk 4/0).</description>

    <description>On buccal side, two vertical incisions will be made at mesial and distal papilla of the adjoining teeth. These incisions will be stretched out past mucogingival junction. After full‑thickness flap reflection on buccal and lingual sides, atraumatic tooth extraction utilizing periotome will be performed. The periosteum of buccal flap will be incised; this would permit coronal advancement of facial flap and a tension‑free primary closure. Extraction sockets will be grafted with natural bovine bone mineral (cerabone). Collagen membrane will be trimmed and placed on the grafted socket and alveolar bone. Buccal and lingual/palatal flaps will be approximated utilizing interrupted simple loop and vertical mattress sutures (4/0) (Sadeghi et al., 2016).</description>
