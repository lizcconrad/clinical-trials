      Primary Objective:

      Pharmacodynamics: assessment by pH metry of the change in gastric pH (antacid activity) of
      Z0063, in comparison to the effect of Gaviscon Double Action Tablets, in healthy adult
      subjects.

      Secondary Objective:

      Safety: assessment of the clinical safety of Z0063, and Gaviscon Double Action Tablets, in
      healthy adult subjects.
