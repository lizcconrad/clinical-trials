    <textblock>
      The researchers are planning a two-center double blind, sham-controlled randomized trial (N:
      44) to assess the long term efficacy of RF neurotomy of cervical medial branches. Patients
      with chronic neck pain who are found eligible and achieve &gt;75% pain relief to predictive test
      blocks, can be included. Demographic and clinical data will be recorded at baseline while
      primary and secondary outcome measurements are recollected after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
      Primary outcome measurements include self reported neck function (NDI) and pain relief.
      Regression analyses will be used to identify how &gt;75% pain relief of a two blocks predicts
      response to RF neurotomy.

    <textblock>
      Chronic neck pain represents a common health problem. The mechanisms appear to be
      multifactorial. Researchers have suggested a disturbed interplay between the neck muscles and
      the facet joints. In Europe and the US radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN) has become a common
      treatment. The evidence base, however, is still insufficient. Thus, a double blind,
      sham-controlled, randomized, two-center trial will be carried out including 44 participants.
      To simplify the data collection a digital internet based program will be used. Patients with
      chronic neck pain, referred to Oslo University Hospital or St Olavs University Hospital and
      not responding to non-interventional treatment, will be screened. Those who are found
      eligible and achieve &gt;75% pain relief to predictive test blocks, can be included. Demographic
      and clinical data will be recorded at baseline and the primary and secondary outcome
      measurements are recollected after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Primary outcome measurements
      include self reported neck function (NDI) and pain relief. Regression analyses will be used
      to identify how 75% pain relief of two test blocks and pain catastrophizing (Pain
      Catastrophizing Scale = PCS) predict response to RF neurotomy . If RF neurotomy is found
      superior to sham treatment, this may be implemented in the national treatment program for
      selected patients with chronic neck pain.
