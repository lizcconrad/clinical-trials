    <textblock>
      This study is the second phase of a research project called &quot;Smart Pain Assessment Tool based
      on Internet-of-Things&quot;. During the course of this project, a smart pain assessment tool (SPA)
      to detect and assess pain employing behavioural and physiologic indicators will be developed.
      We aim to assess pain based on changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity in facial muscles,
      i.e. changes in facial expressions and simultaneously use physiologic signs such as heart
      rate, respiratory rate and galvanic skin response as adjuvant measures to develop an
      algorithm for pain assessment in critically ill patients.

      The aim of this &quot;smart pain assessment tool based on internet of things&quot; SPA-research project
      is to develop an automatic and versatile pain assessment tool algorithm for detection and
      assessment of pain in a reliable and objective way in non-communicative patients. The final
      objective of the research project is to develop a smart pain assessment tool to detect and
      assess pain employing behavioural and physiologic indicators for a wide range of
      users/patients from infants to elderly people who are unable to communicate normally. The
      research project consists of three clinical phases (European Commision. Meddev 2.7/4/2010).
      The clinical phase I of the research project focused on developing pain assessment techniques
      involuntary working-age healthy study subjects. This current Clinical phase II includes the
      further development and research of the smart pain assessment tool in elective (non
      emergency) postoperative surgical patients during their stay after surgery in a recovery
      room.
