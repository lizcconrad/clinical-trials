    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study of DCC-3014 in patients with advanced
      malignancies, featuring solid tumors, but will also enroll select patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). There will be an Escalation Phase and an Expansion Phase in this
      study
