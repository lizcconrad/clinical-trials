  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of all women will develop an HPV infection in their lifetime. While most
      infections are naturally asymptomatic or cleared by the immune system, some persist and can
      lead to the development of cervical, vulvar, or anal lesions and eventually cancer. Screening
      regimens for these lesions are currently only in place for the cervix through regular Pap
      tests. These Pap tests usually involve an examination of the vulva -however, no screening
      procedures exist for anal cancer for women. Several studies have suggested that women with
      existing gynecological lesions are more likely to develop anal lesions and anal cancer. Here
      the investigators propose a multi-center study which seeks to screen for and treat anal
      cancer in women over the age of 40 with vulvar lesions and a stable immune system. The
      investigators will achieve this through performing anal Pap smears on eligible women and
      conducting High Resolution Anoscopy (HRA) and appropriate treatment procedures on those with
      abnormal anal cells. With enough evidence, there may be an indication to establish regular
      anal cancer screening measures in this potentially underserved population.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that at least 40% of women with vulvar cancer or
      VIN2/3 will have abnormal anal cytology. 35% of the population will be hrHPV DNA positive and
      11% will additionally have AIN2/3. This prospective study may lay the groundwork for routine
      anal screening regimens in Ontario and help shift health policy to treat this population.
