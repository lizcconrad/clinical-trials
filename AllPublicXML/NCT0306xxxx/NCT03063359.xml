  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute tramatic pain is one of main reasons for consultation in pediatric emergency
      departments.

      To manage pain quickly and effectively must be a primary outcome of the emergency department.
      However, pediatric emergency department are sometimes criticized for inadequate and delayed
      initiation analgesia . Indeed, several studies have shown the inadequacy between the
      intensity of the pain evaluated by the care team and the therapeutic management of it.

      The ideal analgesic must have a rapid onset of action, have a powerful analgesic effect, have
      few side effects and can be administered quickly and painlessly. That's why, the main outcome
      of this study is to assess the non inferiority of a treatment by intranasal Fentanyl vs
      morphine sulfate (oral use) in children with traumatic pain on arrival to pediatric emergency
      department.
