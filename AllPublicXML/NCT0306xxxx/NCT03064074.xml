  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare disorder that causes bones to break easily. People
      with OI may have broken bones with little or no trauma, dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), and,
      in adult years, hearing loss. OI can range from very severe to very mild. The current
      standard-of-care for severe types of OI involves the use of IV medications (bisphosphonates)
      and surgery to put rods in bones to strengthen them. These therapies, although often
      life-saving, are new and very little is known about their long-term effects on bone and other
      body systems.

      Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a protein important in bone formation.
      Fresolimumab is an antibody that can silence TGF-β . In studies with mice with OI, it has
      been shown that silencing TGF-β can lead to higher bone mass, quality and strength. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if fresolimumab is safe in the treatment of OI.

      Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare disorder that causes bones to break easily. People
      with OI may have broken bones with little or no trauma, dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), and,
      in adult years, hearing loss. It is seen in both genders and all races. OI can range from
      very severe to very mild. Individuals with the most severe type of OI may die at birth.
      People with severe OI who survive may have bowed arms and legs, very short stature and be
      unable to walk. People with the mildest form of OI may only break bones occasionally and have
      normal height and lifespan. Breaks can occur in any bone, but are most common in the arms and
      legs. The current standard-of-care for severe types of OI involves the use of IV medications
      (bisphosphonates) and surgery to put rods in bones to strengthen them. These therapies,
      although often life-saving, are new and very little is known about their long-term effects on
      bone and other body systems.

      TGF-β is a protein important in bone formation. Studies have shown that increased TGF-β
      activity leads to lower bone mass and strength and increased fractures. Fresolimumab is an
      antibody that can silence TGF-β . In studies with mice with OI, it has been shown that
      silencing TGF-β can lead to higher bone mass, quality and strength.

    <description>The purpose of this study is to determine if fresolimumab is safe as a treatment for OI. We will evaluate the safety of a single dose of fresolimumab in the 1st stage of the study. We will evaluate the safety of multiple doses of fresolimumab in the 2nd stage of the study. The Investigators will evaluate the effect of the two doses of fresolimumab in Stage 1 on markers of bone turnover and determine the dose that shows the greatest reduction in bone turnover markers compared to no treatment. This dose will be chosen for the repeat dose studies. If there were no significant changes between the bone turnover markers with either dose, the 4 mg/kg dose will be chosen for the repeat dose study.</description>
