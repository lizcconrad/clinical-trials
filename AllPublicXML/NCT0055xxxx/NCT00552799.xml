  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether a period of prophylactic penicillin after an episode of cellulitis of the
      leg reduces the risk of repeat episodes. Participants are randomised to receive 12 months of
      prophylaxis (penicillin VK 250mg b.d. or placebo). The PATCH I study will recruit only
      patients with recurrent disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellulitis of the leg is an common, acute, painful and potentially serious infection of the
      skin and subcutaneous tissue. It currently accounts for 2-3% of UK hospital admissions. The
      average length of in-patient stay is 9 days (Hospital Episode Statistics, Department of
      Health (UK), 2002-2003) and 25-50% of treated patients suffer further episodes and other
      morbidity, such as oedema and ulceration.

      Cellulitis of the lower leg is usually due to streptococcal infection that has entered into
      the body via a relatively subtle portal, such as toeweb fissures. Penicillin is the most
      useful of the commonly used oral antibiotics against streptococci, although other agents such
      as flucloxacillin are often used if staphylococcal infection is a clinical possibility.

      There are numerous risk factors for cellulitis of the lower leg and recurrent disease is one
      the biggest problems.

      Existing evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent further episodes is very
      limited. Two small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) hint at possible benefit, but these
      studies are very small (16 and 40 participants respectively). Despite this, many physicians
      routinely use prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent cellulitis, although opinions on the
      value of such practice is firmly divided.

      This study will recruit over a 12-24 month period participants who have completed the therapy
      for the current episode of cellulitis. Participants will be followed up for up to 24 months
      with telephone calls at 10 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months and then every 6
      months after completing the intervention. A diary will also be provided as an &quot;aid memoir&quot; to
      phone calls and to note missed tablets and recurrence of cellulitis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of cellulitis of either leg AND a history of at least one previous episode
             of cellulitis of either leg within the three

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any doubt about the certainty of the diagnosis of either the index episode or the previous
        episode (if applicable), will be grounds for exclusion. Additionally, patients with any of
        the following will be excluded:

          -  Taken antibiotic prophylaxis (defined as more than 3 months usage) for the prevention
             of cellulitis within 6 months prior to index episode.

          -  A time lapse of longer than 12 weeks since the start of treatment for the index
             episode to the date of potential randomisation into the trial.

          -  Known allergy to penicillin.

          -  Preceding leg ulceration, surgery or penetrating trauma, as these cases are more
             likely to be caused by staphylococcal infection. (NB: this does not exclude patients
             with toeweb maceration/tinea pedis or other minor/blunt wounds).

          -  Treating physician or principal investigator unwilling to randomise patient. This
             includes, but is not limited to:

               -  The treating physician and/or patient feels that prophylactic antibiotics are not
                  in the patient's best interests and therefore entry to this study would be
                  inappropriate.

               -  The treating physician and/or patient feels it would not be ethical or
                  appropriate for the patient to receive placebo and so they are not willing/able
                  to accept randomisation

               -  Concomitant medication that would mean that long-term penicillin is inappropriate

               -  Diagnostic uncertainty

               -  Gastrointestinal disease causing persistent diarrhoea or vomiting severe enough
                  to affect the absorption of the phenoxymethylpenicillin.

               -  Allergic diathesis or severe bronchial asthma severe enough to preclude the use
                  of phenoxymethylpenicillin.

               -  Confounding concurrent disease (e.g. DVT).

          -  No access to a telephone.

          -  Aged less than 16 years.

          -  Unable to give informed consent.

          -  Already taking part in a research study.
