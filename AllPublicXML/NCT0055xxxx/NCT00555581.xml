  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of imatinib mesylate
      (Gleevec) in patients with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Gleevec is a medication already
      FDA approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors (GIST), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tumors, Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and aggressive
      systemic mastocytosis. In-vitro studies have suggested that imatinib may inhibit collagen
      production by scleroderma fibroblasts, and in mouse models of fibrosis imatinib has been
      shown to decrease skin thickness.

      This is a Phase IIa, single center, prospective open label clinical trial of Gleevec in
      patients with systemic sclerosis. All patients will be treated with active drug for 12
      months. The primary objective of this study will be to determine the safety and tolerability
      of Gleevec in patients with systemic sclerosis, but important secondary outcomes of relevance
      will be improvement in disease status as defined by skin scores and indices of pulmonary
      function.

      Patients who complete the initial phase (described above) of the study will be eligible to
      participate in an extension phase. The purpose of the extension phase of the study is to give
      patients who participated in the phase IIa clinical trial of Gleevec at the Hospital for
      Special Surgery the opportunity to continue Gleevec treatment if both the treating physicians
      and the patient are in agreement that Gleevec had acceptable safety and tolerability, as well
      as possible efficacy during the initial year of therapy.

      Further description of extension phase:

      Patients will first be evaluated for inclusion in the extension phase of the study at either
      the follow-up visit following three month withdrawal from Gleevec treatment or at the visit
      after the follow-up visit. Patients can undergo evaluation for inclusion in the extension
      phase up to six months following their completion of the initial one year trial. All patients
      evaluated for inclusion in the extension phase will sign a new informed consent form
      detailing the purpose and procedures associated with the extension phase at the initial
      visit. After the initial visit, patients who meet inclusion criteria will be required to
      undergo evaluation every three months for the 27 months following initiation of treatment, or
      more frequently if deemed clinically necessary. Treatment will consist of Gleevec, at doses
      ranging from 100 to 400 mg daily (100 mg pills will be distributed for oral administration).
      At each study visit, a history and physical exam will be performed and urine and blood tests
      will be conducted for disease activity and organ function. Additional blood for research may
      also be collected at study visits. The Modified Rodnan Skin Score will be measured to assess
      the degree of skin involvement associated with the patient's disease. Patients will also
      continue to complete questionnaires about their ability to function and quality of life.

      Patients will be financially responsible for all professional and clinical services, as well
      as all laboratory and diagnostic tests, associated with the extension phase of the study. All
      co-pays, deductibles and co-insurances will be paid by the participants. Any additional costs
      for parking and travel the patients incur as a result of participating in the extension phase
      will not be reimbursed by the study. Novartis Pharmaceuticals will donate drug supply.

    <measure>Improvement in the Modified Rodnan Skin Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in the Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) is measured by Mean change (and 95% Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean.Measure Description: The Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) measures dermal skin thickness through the examination of 17 body areas: fingers, hands, forearms, arms, feet, legs, and thighs (in pairs), and face, chest, and abdomen. The skin score is 0 for uninvolved skin through 3 for severe thickening (hidebound skin). The total skin score is the sum of the skin scores of the individual areas. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 51. A higher score indicates greater severity of disease. The mean change in MRSS represents the average change in total skin score from baseline to month 12.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Indices of Pulmonary Function Measured by Change in FVC % Predicted</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure includes patients with and without the presence of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking a deep breath. It is used to determine the severity of lung disease. Improvement in FVC % predicted is measured by Mean change (and 95% Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean. Results are compared to the predicted values that are calculated from a patients age, size, weight, and sex. Results are considered normal if FVC is 80 percent or more of the predicted value. Mean change in FVC % predicted is measured by the average change in FVC% percent predicted from baseline to month 12.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Indices of Pulmonary Function Measured by Change DLCO hb Adj % Predicted</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure includes patients with and without the presence of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). Diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) measures how much oxygen travels from the alveoli of the lungs to the blood stream. DLCO is adjusted for hemoglobin as small changes in hemoglobin concentration can affect the carbon monoxide transfer. DLCO results are compared to normal values for a patient's height, age, sex, and ethnicity. A DLCO result that is at least 80% of the predicted value is considered normal. Improvement in DLCO hb adj % predicted is measured by Mean change (and 95% Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean (the average change in DLCO hb adj% from baseline to month 12).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Month 12 in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Questionnaire:Mental Component Summary</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is a validated 36 item questionnaire which measures quality of life across eight domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health. The mental component score is composed of a subset of the 8 health domains. Each component is directly transformed into a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. A score of 0 is equal to maximum disability, and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.The SF-36 mental component can be obtained by looking at the mean average of all the emotionally relevant items. Change in Short Form 36 mental (SF-36 MC) is measured by Mean change (and 95 % Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean (the average change in SF-36 mental component from baseline to month 12).</description>

    <measure>Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) consist of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and 8 other domains which include scales looking at pain, patient global assessment, vascular, digital ulcers, lung involvement, and gastrointestinal involvement. It addresses scleroderma related manifestations that contribute to disability. It is a quality of life measure. Each question is scored from 0 (without difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). Some domains in the SHAQ are visual analog scales that are measured first and then changed to a 0-3 scale.
The maximum from each category is added together and divided by the number of categories completed. Change in Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (SHAQ-DI) is measured as Mean Change (and 95% Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean (the average change in SHAQ-DI from baseline to month 12).</description>

The physical component score is composed of a subset of the 8 health domains.The SF-36 physical component can be obtained by looking at the mean average of all the physically relevant items. Each component is directly transformed into a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. A score of 0 is equal to maximum disability, and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. Change in Short Form 36 physical component (SF-36 PC) is measured by Mean change (and 95 % Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean (the average change in SF-36 physical component from baseline to month 12).</description>

          <description>The Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) measures dermal skin thickness through the examination of 17 body areas: fingers, hands, forearms, arms, feet, legs, and thighs (in pairs), and face, chest, and abdomen. In each of these areas, the skin score is evaluated by manual palpation. The skin score is 0 for uninvolved skin, 1 for mild thickening, 2 for moderate thickening, and 3 for severe thickening (hidebound skin). The total skin score is the sum of the skin scores of the individual areas. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 51. A higher score indicates greater severity of disease.</description>

        <title>Improvement in Indices of Pulmonary Function Measured by Change in FVC % Predicted</title>
        <description>This outcome measure includes patients with and without the presence of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking a deep breath. It is used to determine the severity of lung disease. Improvement in FVC % predicted is measured by Mean change (and 95% Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean. Results are compared to the predicted values that are calculated from a patients age, size, weight, and sex. Results are considered normal if FVC is 80 percent or more of the predicted value. Mean change in FVC % predicted is measured by the average change in FVC% percent predicted from baseline to month 12.</description>

        <description>This outcome measure includes patients with and without the presence of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD). Diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) measures how much oxygen travels from the alveoli of the lungs to the blood stream. DLCO is adjusted for hemoglobin as small changes in hemoglobin concentration can affect the carbon monoxide transfer. DLCO results are compared to normal values for a patient's height, age, sex, and ethnicity. A DLCO result that is at least 80% of the predicted value is considered normal. Improvement in DLCO hb adj % predicted is measured by Mean change (and 95% Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean (the average change in DLCO hb adj% from baseline to month 12).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Month 12 in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Questionnaire:Mental Component Summary</title>
        <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is a validated 36 item questionnaire which measures quality of life across eight domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health. The mental component score is composed of a subset of the 8 health domains. Each component is directly transformed into a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. A score of 0 is equal to maximum disability, and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.The SF-36 mental component can be obtained by looking at the mean average of all the emotionally relevant items. Change in Short Form 36 mental (SF-36 MC) is measured by Mean change (and 95 % Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean (the average change in SF-36 mental component from baseline to month 12).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline at Month 12 in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Questionnaire:Mental Component Summary</title>
          <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is a validated 36 item questionnaire which measures quality of life across eight domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health. The mental component score is composed of a subset of the 8 health domains. Each component is directly transformed into a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. A score of 0 is equal to maximum disability, and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.The SF-36 mental component can be obtained by looking at the mean average of all the emotionally relevant items. Change in Short Form 36 mental (SF-36 MC) is measured by Mean change (and 95 % Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean (the average change in SF-36 mental component from baseline to month 12).</description>

        <title>Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index</title>
        <description>The Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) consist of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and 8 other domains which include scales looking at pain, patient global assessment, vascular, digital ulcers, lung involvement, and gastrointestinal involvement. It addresses scleroderma related manifestations that contribute to disability. It is a quality of life measure. Each question is scored from 0 (without difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). Some domains in the SHAQ are visual analog scales that are measured first and then changed to a 0-3 scale.
The maximum from each category is added together and divided by the number of categories completed. Change in Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (SHAQ-DI) is measured as Mean Change (and 95% Confidence Interval) from Baseline mean to Month 12 mean (the average change in SHAQ-DI from baseline to month 12).</description>
