    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find the answers to the following questions:

        1. What are the highest doses of CBP501 and cisplatin that can be safely administered as
           consecutive 2-hours and 1-hour infusions every 21 days?

        2. What are the side effects of the combination of CBP501 and cisplatin when given as an
           infusion every 21 days?

        3. What amount of CBP501 and cisplatin are found in the blood at certain times after it is
           given?

        4. Are there any substances in your blood or tumor that can tell us about tumor sensitivity
           to CBP501 and cisplatin?

        5. Will CBP501 given with cisplatin help to treat your cancer?

      9.1 23BOverall Study Design and Plan This was an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and
      pharmacokinetic Phase I study of CBP501 and cisplatin administered as consecutive IV
      infusions according to a once-every-3-weeks schedule in patients with advanced solid tumors
      refractory to standard therapy. The study was conducted in three US centers. During the
      course of the study, an amendment was introduced (#3, October 17th, 2007; see section X9.8X)
      to allow administration of a unique dosing of single agent CBP501 prior to the initiation of
      combination therapy to enable completion of the pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of
      single agent CBP501. Pharmacodynamic analysis involving phosphoserine 216 evaluations was
      also removed. See section X16.1.1X for copies of the protocol and all protocol amendments.
      With 8 additional patients included at the recommended dose (at DL6), it was decided to stop
      all PK and CTC sampling (and therefore the day-7 CBP501 alone infusion), as sufficient
      information had been retrieved. In addition, based on evidence of efficacy observed in
      ovarian cancer patients, a further 10 ovarian and 4 endometrial cancer patients were to be
      included at the recommended dose; these patients were to be assessed for DLT to confirm the
      identification of the MTD.

      Case Report Forms were used to collect the data, and data management was carried out by
      AAIOncology. All laboratory data and Investigator observations were be transcribed into the
      CRF. ECG, U/S, MRI and CT scans were to be reported in summary in the CRF. The original
      reports, traces and films were to be retained by the Investigators for future reference. See
      section X16.1.2X for a sample CRF.

    <description>CBP501 is given IV on Day 1 of each cycle (every 21 days). Dose escalation of CBP501 and cisplatin will be starting doses of 3.6 mg/m² CBP501 and 50 mg/m² cisplatin (Dose Level 1). Step 1, if during the first 2 cycles, at least 2 out of 3 to 6 patients experience Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) at 50 mg/m² cisplatin, then the cisplatin dose will be de-escalated to 30 mg/m². If no more than 1 out of 6 patients experiences DLT, cisplatin dose will be escalated to 75 mg/m². Step 2, dose escalation will be performed using the cisplatin MTD, with escalating CBP501 doses. CBP501 dose escalation will take place until the MTD has been defined or 74 mg/m² is reached.</description>
