      Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is considered by many leading expert
      surgeons to be the next step in MIS (Minimally Invasive Surgery). This is a rapidly evolving
      area of preclinical research and several groups worldwide are developing this surgical
      approach together with industry support. In this new surgical technique, abdominal operations
      are performed using the oropharynx, rectum, or vagina as the ports of entry to the peritoneal
      cavity instead of incisions on the abdominal wall. NOTES offers all the advantages of
      minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and also completely eliminates trauma to the abdominal wall
      and the numerous complications of abdominal wall incisions. A NOTES procedure eliminates any
      visible scar and could also potentially reduce post operative pain due to the elimination of
      abdominal wall trauma.

      In this trial we intend to operate healthy women who need to undergo cholecystectomy or
      appendectomy. The operations will be performed through the vagina as the access port to the
      peritoneum and it will be monitored with laparoscopic vision for safety reasons.
