      Multi-centre one year trial for patients who have rising PSA while on Casodex 50mg daily
      dose. Casodex dosage escalated to 150 mg tablet daily. Treatment will be continued until
      patient demonstrates clinical benefit at one year, PSA progression, toxicity, or withdrawal.
      Treatment will be continued after one year if patient demonstrates continued clinical
      benefit.

      The study will be a national, multicentre, open-label, phase II trial. Patients who have a
      rising PSA on MAB with bicalutamide 50 mg daily will be dose escalated to MAB with 150 mg
      bicalutamide daily. Subjects will receive trial treatment for 12 months, or until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Open label treatment will be
      offered thereafter if the subject demonstrates clinical benefit at the end of one year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of written informed consent.

          2. Men, over 18 years of age, with histologically-confirmed prostate cancer

          3. Treatment with Zoladex (goserelin acetate) for greater than 3 months prior to Day 1

          4. Serum testosterone level &lt; 50 ng/ml

          5. Current treatment with bicalutamide 50 mg daily.**

          6. Two consecutive rises in PSA above a nadir value, with the absolute value of the
             latest PSA &gt; 2.0 ng/ml.

          7. Highest PSA level no greater than or equal to 30 ng/ml.

          8. Life expectancy of greater than 1 year -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients may not have received prolonged anti-androgen therapy other than with
             bicalutamide. Patients who have received short term (2 months or less) non-steroidal
             anti-androgen therapy with an agent other than bicalutamide to block flare are not
             excluded.*

          2. PSA level greater than 30 ng/ml.

          3. In the opinion of the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             disease which would make it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial.

          4. Subjects who have received prior chemotherapy.

          5. Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or superficial transitional cell carcinoma of
             the bladder.

          6. Absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 x 109/L or platelets less than 100 x 109/L.

          7. Serum bilirubin greater than 1.25 times the upper limit of reference range (ULRR).

          8. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 2.5
             times the ULRR.

          9. Serum creatinine greater than 1.5 times -
