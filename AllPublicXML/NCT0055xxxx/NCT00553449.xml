      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of each of the rabeprazole treatment
      regimens on nocturnal heartburn symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is limited data regarding the estimate of patients who experience nocturnal symptoms
      despite adequate daytime heartburn control, the incidence and severity of nocturnal heartburn
      episodes after a minimum of 4 weeks of acid suppressive therapy with a Proton-pump inhibitor
      (PPI) or Histamine -2-receptor antagonist (H2RA), and the effect of instituting rabeprazole
      therapy after failure to control nocturnal heartburn symptoms with other acid suppressive
      therapy. This is a multicentre, randomised (study medication is assigned by chance),
      controlled, parallel-group, open-label study in GERD patients. Patients will be screened and
      enter a 2-week run-in phase to document heartburn symptoms while on their current therapy,
      during which they will complete a daily diary of symptoms and antacid use. Patients who have
      troublesome nocturnal heartburn episodes, but adequate daytime heartburn symptom control (as
      defined) will enter an 8-week treatment phase where they are randomised to one of the
      rabeprazole regimens: 20mg once daily in the evening (dose administered 30minutes prior to
      the evening meal; &quot;QPM&quot; regimen), 10mg twice daily (dose administered 30minutes prior to the
      morning and evening meals; &quot;BID/twice daily&quot; regimen) or 20mg once daily in the morning (dose
      administered 30minutes prior to the morning meal; &quot;QAM/every morning&quot; regimen), plus antacids
      as required. The study hypothesis is that after failure to control night-time heartburn
      symptoms with other acid suppressive therapy, instituting rabeprazole will have a beneficial
      effect. Safety assessments include: physical examination and pregnancy test at screening,
      vital signs and weight at randomization and final visit, adverse event and concomitant
      medication reporting at every visit. Rabeprazole 20mg once daily in the evening: one
      rabeprazole 20mg tablet daily in the evening, 30-60 minutes before dinner for 56 days OR
      Rabeprazole 10mg twice daily: one rabeprazole 10mg tablet in the morning, 30-60 minutes
      before breakfast, and one rabeprazole 10mg tablet 30-60 minutes before dinner for 56 days. OR
      Rabeprazole 20mg once daily in the morning: one rabeprazole 20mg tablet daily in the morning,
      30-60 minutes before breakfast for 56 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have had a minimum three-month history of symptomatic GERD, with
             heartburn as the predominant symptom, and must report nocturnal heartburn symptoms
             (i.e., heartburn symptoms experienced during the night-time period, between 2200 and
             0600h)

          -  Patients must currently be taking a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) or histamine-2
             receptor antagonist (H2RA) at least four weeks prior to study admission

          -  Patients must be able to read, write and understand the language of the HRQOL and
             productivity assessment instruments (PAGI-SYM, PAGI-QOL, WPAI-GH) i.e., English or
             French

          -  Patients must have been at least 80% compliant with their current acid suppressive
             therapy, and must have completed a minimum of 11 of 14 nocturnal heartburn ratings
             during the run-in period (i.e. &lt;=3 &quot;missing&quot; nocturnal heartburn ratings during the
             14-day period)

          -  Patients must have a total nocturnal heartburn symptom score of &gt;4 points during the
             2-week run-in period

          -  3 &quot;missing&quot; nocturnal heartburn ratings during the 14-day period) as recorded in the
             diary
