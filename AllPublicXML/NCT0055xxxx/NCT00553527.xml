  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective clinical data collection is to document the performance and
      clinical outcomes of Biomet Humeral Stems.

      All stems on which data will be collected are legally marketed and none of the devices are
      investigational or experimental. This data collection effort will document the clinical
      outcomes of the humeral stems. The data gathered will be collated and used to provide
      feedback to designing engineers, support marketing efforts, and answer potential questions
      from reimbursement agencies.

      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria are within the indications and contraindications stated in the
      labeling, cleared by the FDA, for the device. Surgical techniques and patient care are to be
      standard for the surgeon participating in the protocol. There will be no experimental or
      investigational surgical techniques used. The devices and products are to be used in
      accordance with their instructions for use and/or approved labeling.

      The outcomes and data collected include:

      UCLA End-Result Score Radiographic Evaluation

      Survivorship will be documented by asking the surgeon to record revisions, complications, and
      device related events.
