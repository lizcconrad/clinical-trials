  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of Gamma3 intramedullary nails versus
      sliding hip screws on rate of revision surgery in individuals with inter-trochanteric
      fractures. Secondary outcomes include fracture healing rates, fracture related complications,
      and health-related quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are becoming a more prevalent issue worldwide, leading to profound morbidity,
      and in some cases, mortality. Currently the most common method of surgical treatment includes
      the use of a sliding hip screw over a Gamma intramedullary nail, but there is conflicting
      evidence regarding which device has a lower revision of surgery rate and complication rate.
      The newest generation of Gamma3 nails have strong rationale suggesting significantly
      decreased rates of femoral shaft fractures and improved function. The improvements in implant
      design of the Gamma3 nail provide compelling rationale for the conduct of a large, definitive
      trial, and therefore a pilot study is being conducted to confirm or refute our ability to
      recruit patients and assess the consistency between site estimates and actual recruitment,
      determine the degree to which site investigators can adhere to trial protocol, confirm or
      refute our anticipated ability to achieve close to 100% follow- up, assess our ability to
      maintain 100% data quality, field test our case report forms for clarity and appropriateness,
      and to determine whether we can successfully manage the logistics of coordinating trial
      activities across multiple sites.

      This trial is a pilot, multi-center, concealed randomized controlled trial. Surgeons will use
      one of the two surgical strategies in patients who have sustained a trochanteric fracture;
      the Gamma3 intramedullary nail or the sliding hip screw. Clinical assessments will occur at
      the time of hospital admission, 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery.

    <description>Revision surgery is classified as any unplanned surgery done to promote fracture healing, relieve pain, treat infection, or improve function include the following: 1) implant removal prior to fracture healing (to achieve union); 2) revision surgery with another internal fixation implant; 3) revision surgery to arthroplasty; 4) incision and drainage for deep infection at the bone implant interface; 5) correction of malunion; and 6) repair of a femoral shaft fracture.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HRQL will be measured using using self-administered and interview-administered questionnaires. Functional outcome questionnaires will include a generic health status measurement instrument (SF-12v2), a hip function and pain questionnaire (WOMAC), a generic utility measure (EQ-5D), the Merle d'Aubigne (MDA) pain and function score, and the Parker mobility score.</description>

    <measure>Fracture healing rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A fracture is to be considered healed when there is obliteration of the fracture lines by newly formed bone along the cortices and within the trabecular bone on anteroposterior and lateral (or oblique) radiographs.</description>

    <measure>Complications</measure>

    <description>Complications include mortality, femoral shaft fracture, avascular necrosis, nonunion, malunion (shortening, varus deformity, valgus deformity and rotational malunion), implant breakage or failure, and infection (i.e., superficial and deep).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult men or women aged 50 years and older (with no upper age limit).

          -  An trochanteric fracture (stable or unstable) confirmed with anterior and posterior
             lateral hip radiographs, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  Operative treatment within 3 days (i.e., 72 hours) after the trauma.

          -  Patient was ambulatory prior to fracture, though they may have used an aid such as a
             cane or a walker.

          -  Anticipated medical optimization of the patient for operative fixation of the proximal
             femur.

          -  Provision of informed consent by patient or proxy.

          -  Low energy fracture (defined as a fall from standing height).

          -  No other major trauma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Associated major injuries of the lower extremity (i.e., ipsilateral or contralateral
             fractures of the foot, ankle, tibia, fibula, knee, or femur; dislocations of the
             ankle, knee, or hip; or femoral head defects or fracture).

          -  Retained hardware around the affected hip.

          -  Infection around the hip (i.e., soft tissue or bone).

          -  Patients with disorders of bone metabolism other than osteoporosis (i.e., Paget's
             disease, renal osteodystrophy, or osteomalacia).

          -  Moderate or severe cognitively impaired patients (i.e., Six Item Screener with three
             or more errors).

          -  Patients with Parkinson's disease (or dementia) severe enough to increase the
             likelihood of falling or severe enough to compromise rehabilitation.

          -  Likely problems, in the judgment of the investigators, with maintaining follow-up. We
             will, for example, exclude patients with no fixed address, those who report a plan to
             move out of town in the next year, or intellectually challenged patients without
             adequate family support.

          -  If the attending surgeon believes that a patient should be excluded from REGAIN
             because the patient is enrolled in another ongoing drug or surgical intervention
             trial.

          -  If the attending surgeon believes that there is another reason to exclude this patient
             from REGAIN. This reason will be documented on the case report forms.
