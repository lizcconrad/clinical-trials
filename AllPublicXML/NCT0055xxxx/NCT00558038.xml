    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the experimental
      drug AST-120 compared to lactulose in patients with mild hepatic encephalopathy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, four week trial comparing AST-120 to lactulose in
      patients with mild (Stage 1-2) hepatic encephalopathy.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups:

        -  Lactulose

        -  AST-120

      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will take either AST-120 or lactulose for 4 weeks (28
      days). AST-120 will be distributed in 2 gram sachets to be taken four times daily. Lactulose
      will be taken in the same formulation, at the same dose and frequency as previously
      prescribed for the individual patient.

      Lactulose naïve patients who are randomized to lactulose will receive an initial dose of 30cc
      twice a day. The dose should be titrated at the discretion of the investigator until the
      patient is experiencing 2-3 soft stools per day.

      Patients randomized to AST-120 will receive 2 grams four times a day for the duration of the
      study. Titration of AST-120 will NOT be allowed.

      Patients will be evaluated throughout the study for efficacy and safety. A follow-up visit
      will be scheduled 1 week after the end of the 4 week treatment period.
