  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate potential candidates for future clinical research studies related to
      diagnosed or undiagnosed genetic eye disorders or diseases. It will not test any new
      treatments, but it may arrange for standard treatments for existing eye disorders. The
      purpose of the study is to train eye doctors and medical researchers at the National
      Institutes of Health in appropriate methods and procedures for treating patients with genetic
      eye diseases, and to expand the pool of possible participants for future research studies and
      trials on eye health.

      Volunteers for this study may be adults and minor children who have been diagnosed with or
      are at risk for having a genetic eye disease. Candidates may not have any other medical
      conditions that would interfere with the researchers' ability to perform the examinations and
      procedures required for this study.

      Participants will give a complete medical and family history and undergo a series of tests
      and procedures as part of this research study. The procedures include a full eye examination
      and vision testing, electrooculography and an electroretinogram to examine the function of
      the retina, and flourescein angiography to provide information on the flow of blood in the
      participant's eyes. Participants will provide research material for further studies by giving
      a blood sample to be held for genetic testing and analysis, and adult participants will also
      undergo a skin biopsy to provide cell tissue for additional research material. At each clinic
      visit, participants will receive treatment for their genetic eye disease as needed, including
      medications or surgical procedures. Participants may remain a part of this study for up to
      three years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Eye Institute is conducting a study to evaluate participants with either
      diagnosed or undiagnosed genetic conditions who may be eligible and wish to participate in
      other NEI clinical research studies. The primary purpose of this evaluation and treatment
      protocol is to provide a resource of patients for specific new research protocols and for
      staff and fellowship training. A secondary purpose is to provide long-term follow-up and
      treatment for a variety of genetic eye diseases so that the genetic specialists at NEI will
      be better able to identify research hypotheses for these diseases, which may lead to ideas
      for future protocols. Finally, the ability to provide long-term follow-up and care will also
      facilitate referral efforts for new NEI protocols. As a by-product of this research activity,
      the participants will help the investigators to maintain their clinical skills.
