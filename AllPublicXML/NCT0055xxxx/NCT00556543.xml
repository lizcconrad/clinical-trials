  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information about a device used to help fix broken
      ribs.

      Hypothesis: Rib fracture repair with the U-plate system is clinically durable and safe for
      the indications of flail chest repair, acute pain control, chest wall defect repair, and rib
      fracture non-union.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are a painful and disabling injury commonly found among trauma patients.
      According to the National Center for Health Statistics, approximately 300,000 people with rib
      fractures were treated in emergency and ambulatory care departments in the United States in
      the year 2004. Rib fracture patients are significantly more disabled at 30 days post-injury
      than patients with chronic medical illness and lose an average of 70 days of work or usual
      activity during their acute recovery.

      The rationale for conducting this study is to demonstrate in a prospective study that the
      U-plate repair system is durable and safe. Although this clinical outcome data is not
      required by the FDA to market and implant this prosthesis, the investigators believe that in
      order for the U-plate to be widely accepted, prospectively collected outcome data are
      necessary.

      With the goal of improving the durability of fixation of rib fractures over the techniques
      currently available and with the additional goal of developing a minimally invasive
      technique, a U-shaped plate was developed. The design of the U-plate theoretically overcomes
      the inherent softness of the human rib by grasping the rib over its superior margin and by
      securing the plate with anterior to posterior locking screws that do not rely on screw
      purchase in bone. Thus much of the strength and durability of the fixation is transferred
      from the relatively soft rib to the plate itself.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Subjects must have one of the four clinical indications listed below:

               1. Flail chest with failure to wean from ventilator (&gt; 5 days post-injury) and
                  Paradoxical chest wall movement visualized; no significant pulmonary contusion
                  and no significant brain injury

               2. Painful, displaced rib fractures (acute pain control) and failure of narcotics or
                  epidural pain catheter to control pain; fracture movement exacerbates pain (after
                  7 - 10 days) and minimal associated injuries

               3. Chest wall defect/severely displaced fractures and non-repair defect may result
                  in pulmonary hernia and severely displaced fractures are significantly impeding
                  lung expansion in hemi-thorax

               4. Symptomatic rib fracture non-union and CT scan evidence of fracture non-union at
                  least 2 months post-injury

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are enrolled in another investigational treatment trial

          -  Subjects who have received an investigational drug or device within 30 days of
             enrollment

          -  Subjects who are unable to complete the follow-up questionnaires

          -  Subjects with severe head injuries or other severe associated injuries

          -  Subjects who are not expected to survive the follow-up period

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant

        <description>The RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey measures physical and mental health. Study subjects completed the questionnaire at 2 month intervals for 6 months to evaluate net change over time. All questions are scored on a scale from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning. Aggregate scores are compiled as a percentage of the total points possible, using a RAND scoring table. This health survey was developed at Rand Health as part of the Medical Outcomes Study.</description>
