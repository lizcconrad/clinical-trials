  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between SIRS (Systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome) and the infection associated with the use of central venous catheters at
      Critical Care center in National Defense Medical College, Japan.

    <textblock>
      The doctor would remove the inserted catheter from the patient, if the patient shows SIRS. At
      the same time, the tip of used catheter and blood from the patient are checked whether the
      pathogenic bacteria exists or not by general bacterial protocol and blood culture test on a
      routine application. Unfortunately, these tests not always clarified their cause of SIRS.
      Therefore we conduct this investigation to establish the useful protocol for pathogenic
      bacteria. We check the pathogenic bacteria not only tip but through the whole catheter in
      Central Venous Catheter using general bacterial protocol and SEM observation. Additionally,
      we compared that sputum, urine, skin and blood from the patient for bacteria check.
