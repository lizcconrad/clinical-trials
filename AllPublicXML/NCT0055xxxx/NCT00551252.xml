      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antitumor activity of a combination of Imatinib
      mesylate and Gemcitabine in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma expressing

      TITLE &quot;A phase II study of the association of Glivec® (Imatinib mesylate, formerly known as
      STI 571) plus Gemzar® (Gemcitabine) in patients with unresectable, refractory, malignant
      mesothelioma expressing either PDGFR-beta or C-Kit&quot;

      PURPOSE Primary objective of the phase II

      ➢ Efficacy, i.e., response rate to study drugs

      Secondary objectives of the phase II

        -  Duration of response

        -  Time to progression

        -  Toxicity profile

        -  Overall survival

      PRIMARY VARIABLE The primary efficacy variable for the phase II part of the study is Best
      Overall Tumor Response, evaluated using the &quot;Modified RECIST criteria for assessment of
      response in malignant pleural mesothelioma&quot;

      SECONDARY VARIABLES

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) form 1st administration onwards

        -  Overall survival

        -  Safety criteria, according to NCI-CTC criteria version 3.0

      EFFICACY Objective tumor response assesed using the &quot;Modified RECIST criteria for assessment
      of response in malignant pleural mesothelioma&quot; SAFETY

        -  Adverse events

        -  Vital signs

        -  Clinical and biohumoral findings

      TREATMENT SCHEDULE

        -  Gemzar 500 mg/m2, i.v., days 1 and 8 of a 21-days schedule, plus

        -  Glivec 400 mg/die., per os

      STATISTICAL DESIGN The study follows a two-stage design, according to the Simon model. We
      assume that with a response rate of 5% (H0) or less the drug is likely to be ineffective, and
      also, that, for the drug to be effective, a target response rate of 15% (H1) is required.
      With a probability errors alfa of 5% and beta 20%, the calculated sample size is as reported
      in &quot;PLANNED NUMBER OF PTS.&quot;

      PLANNED NUMBER OF PTS. 23 or 56 patients, evaluable for efficacy. The number depends on the
      response rate. When 2 or more objective responses, i.e., CR or PR, are observed in the first
      23 patients, the total number of patients will be increased to 56, otherwise the study will
      be stopped

      STATISTICAL EVALUATION Efficacy and safety variables will be evaluated descriptively. Indeed,
      ORR estimates and its exact 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Kaplan-Meier method
      will be used to estimate duration of response, PFS and OS

      DURATION OF TREATMENT All patients are scheduled to receive at least two cycles of
      chemotherapy unless there is unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease, or the patient
      requires or asks for withdrawal from the study Responding patients will receive treatment for
      6 cycles or earlier if progression or unbearable toxicity Disease status will be re-evaluated
      every two cycles, using the same imaging procedures used at baseline, i.e., CT or NMR
