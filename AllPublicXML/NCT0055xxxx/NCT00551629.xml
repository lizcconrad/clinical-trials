  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 4
      different formulations of the HR5I vaccine (Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate,
      recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, diphtheria, tetanus, 5-component acellular
      pertussis, and inactivated poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3). The primary hypothesis is that at
      least 1 of the 4 formulations of HR5I administered as a primary series at 2, 3, and 4 months
      of age will be acceptable (similar to targeted rates) with respect to Postdose 3 antibody
      responses to all antigens.

      Participants will be randomized into 4 arms:

      AR51 (12, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 12 mcg of polyribosylribitol
      phosphate (PRP) conjugates to tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) and 10 mcg of Hepatitis B surface
      antigen (HBsAg)

      PR51 (3, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 3 mcg of PRP conjugated to the
      outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitides (PRP-OMPC) and 10 mcg of HBsAg

      PR51 (6, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 6 mcg of PRP-OMPC and 10 mcg of
      HBsAg

      PR51 (6, 15): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 6 mcg of PRP-OMPC and 15 mcg of
      HBsAg
