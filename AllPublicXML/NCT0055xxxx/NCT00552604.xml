      Study Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of a standardised extract of Cannabis
      sativa given orally 2 times daily as compared to placebo for the relief of muscle stiffness
      and pain in multiple sclerosis for a period of 12 weeks.

      Study Patients: 400 patients with multiple sclerosis (age 18-64, stable disease during
      previous 6 months, ambulatory or not, antispasticity medication and physiotherapy stabilised
      ≥ 30 days) with experiencing muscle stiffness ≥ 4 on a 11-point numerical Likert scale at
      baseline.

      Study treatment:

      Group 1: Cannabis extract (delta-9-THC 2.5mg, CBD 1.25 mg per capsule), flexible dosing
      between 5 mg and 25 mg THC/d, administered twice daily, additionally to previous
      antispasticity and analgesic medication.

      Group 2: Matched placebo, twice daily, additionally to previous antispasticity and analgesic
      medication.

      Treatment Schedule: Start dose 5 mg THC/d, individual dose titration with increase of 5 mg
      THC every 3 days, maximal total daily dose 25 mg THC, administered as 2 equal doses based on
      tolerability. Treatment duration: 12 weeks.

      Study sites: 20 neurological clinics in the United Kingdom.
