  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a severe lung complication that can occur in the days
      after lung transplant surgery. This study will analyze blood samples to determine if high
      levels of certain chemicals may increase the risk of developing PGD after a lung transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PGD is a severe complication that affects up to 25% of lung transplant patients following
      surgery. Pulmonary edema, which is an abnormal build-up of fluid in the lungs, and hypoxemia,
      which is low blood oxygen levels, are two common symptoms that individuals with PGD
      experience. Treatment for PGD is often expensive, and it is the leading cause of death
      following lung transplantation. Many potential lung donors and recipients are considered
      unsuitable for lung transplantation because of concern for the development of PGD. Increased
      levels of chemicals that are involved in bleeding and clotting, including protein C, and
      certain markers of oxidant stress, which can cause damage to the body's cells and tissues,
      may increase a person's risk of developing complications following a lung transplant. The
      purpose of this study is to analyze blood samples to determine if elevated levels of certain
      chemicals may be associated with an increased risk of developing PGD after lung
      transplantation.

      This study will enroll individuals who are undergoing lung or heart and lung transplantation.
      Blood samples will be collected from participants prior to surgery, immediately following
      surgery, and 24 hours after surgery. Study researchers will also review participants' medical
      records. There will be no additional study visits.
