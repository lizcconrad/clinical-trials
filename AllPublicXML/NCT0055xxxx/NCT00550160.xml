  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster randomised trial is proposed to assess the clinical impact of adding a seasonal
      intermittent preventive treatment (IPTc) schedule for children aged 3 -59 months to a home
      management of malaria (HMM) programme using AQ+AS in Ghana. The study will be conducted in
      the Kwaso sub district of the Ejisu-Juaben district of Ghana in which 6 communities will be
      randomised to implement an IPTc schedule alongside the HMM programme or HMM programme alone.

      The study will run in three phases; a preparatory phase to set up and obtain baseline
      morbidity data from a cross-sectional survey; an intervention phase and a post intervention
      phase of cross-sectional survey and data evaluation and dissemination. A cohort of 546 study
      children randomly selected will receive three full treatment courses of AS+AQ intermittently
      during the April - Nov 2007 transmission season. Community-based drug distributors (CDDs)
      will administer all courses of IPTc. The first dose of each course will be directly observed
      by the CDDs who will educate mothers or caregivers to administer subsequent doses
      appropriately at home. Follow up visits to homes will be done by CDDs and field supervisors
      to ascertain adherence and to monitor adverse drug events. The incidence of clinical malaria
      and other secondary outcomes will be compared with those of another cohort of 546 study
      children who will not receive IPTc but may be treated under the HMM strategy alone with AS+AQ
      when necessary during the observation period.

    <description>Under the Home Management of Malaria (HMM) strategy the Community Drug Distributors (CDD) will treat all children under 5 years presented to them with measured fever or a history of fever with AQ plus AS co-administered. Children under 12 months receive 75mg of AQ co-administered with 25mg of AS daily for three days. Children who are 12 to 59 months old receive 150mg of AQ and 50mg of AS co-administered daily for three days.
Asymptomatic children under 5 years in the Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTc) clusters will receive additional AQ plus AS co-administered during high malaria transmission season. Those under 12 months will receive 75mg of AQ co-administered with 25mg of AS daily for three days; and children who are 12 to 59 months old receive 150mg of AQ and 50mg of AS co-administered daily for three days.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A child in the study cohort will be eligible to receive a course of IPTc (active or
             placebo) if the child has NO fever (a temperature of 37â€¢5o C or above) or history of
             fever in the last 24 hours. However, fever is only a temporary exclusion criterion. If
             a child has fever when he/she is due for an IPTc course, treatment will be given for
             the fever and the IPTc course given one month after the fever has subsided. This
             interval between treatment of fever episodes and administration of an IPTc course is
             proposed in order to minimise the risk of overdosing since the same drug is used for
             both HMM and IPTc.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A child in the study cohort will not be eligible to receive a course of IPTc if:

               -  The child has a clinical condition that may be classified as severe according to
                  IMCI guidelines.

               -  The child is known to suffer from chronic disease(s) e.g. sickle cell disease
                  that might adversely affect the interpretation of study results.

               -  The mother/caregiver withdraws consent.
