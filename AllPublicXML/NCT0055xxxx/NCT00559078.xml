  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This qualitative interview-based study will investigate the impact that living with
      congenital adrenal hyperplasia has for women in the following areas: health-related quality
      of life (HRQL), psychological health, and health-seeking behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia is a chronic-illness requiring life-long treatment and is
      caused by an inherited enzyme deficiency that leads to an overproduction of hormones produced
      by the adrenal glands, which in turn, masculinizes the female genitalia before birth. While
      the mechanisms by which CAH influences physiological development are understood, the impact
      of this hormonal elevation on health-related quality of life (HRQL), psychological health,
      and health-seeking behaviors is less clear. This study is guided by three research questions:
      (1) how does CAH influence HRQL domains (physical, functional, emotional and
      interpersonally), (2) how does CAH influence the mental health of women diagnosed with CAH,
      and (3) how does CAH influence decisions to seek help from a counselor? Semi-structured
      qualitative interviews will be conducted with women with CAH. Interviews will be analyzed
      through the Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) methodology.
