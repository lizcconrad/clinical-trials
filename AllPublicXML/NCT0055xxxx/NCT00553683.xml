      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Poly ICLC may
      stop the growth of liver cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving the drug directly
      into the arteries around the tumor may kill more tumor cells. Giving cyclophosphamide and
      radiation therapy together with poly ICLC may be an effective treatment for liver cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving cyclophosphamide,
      radiation therapy, and poly ICLC together and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with unresectable, recurrent, primary, or metastatic liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To study the safety and effectiveness of a strategy to establish robust anticancer
           immunologic body defenses by using low-dose radiation therapy to the liver cancer in
           order to increase tumor targetability; inject a body defense activator,
           polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid polylysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC, hiltonol,
           oncovir), into and around the cancer to activate sentinel dendritic cells to alarm body
           defenses; and shut down local production of factors that suppress the body's natural
           anticancer defenses by starving the cancer of its blood supply within the liver.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-21 and undergo
      3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy on days 21-23. On day 24, patients undergo an intra- or
      peri-tumoral polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid polylysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC)
      injection directly into the tumor followed by trans-hepatic artery embolization to the
      designated tumor. Patients receive poly ICLC subcutaneously on days 26, 35, 37, 42, 44, 49,
      and 51. Treatment repeats every 57 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.
