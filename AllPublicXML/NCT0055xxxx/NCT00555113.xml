  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a disease whom frequency is estimated about 1/50000 to 1/100 000.
      There is a female preponderance with a sex-ratio of 2:1. PXE is transmitted according either
      to an autosomal dominant mode or to an autosomal recessive one. Mutations in the ABCC6 gene
      on chromosome 16p13.1 have recently been identified causing PXE. The elastic fibers slowly
      become mineralized mainly in the skin, the eyes, and the cardiovascular system. PXE is a
      multisystem disease that includes a spectrum of clinical manifestations affecting the skin,
      the eye or the cardiovascular system as well as other tissues. It can be responsible for
      severe and life threatening complications. Skin changes are usually the first manifestations
      and begin in early childhood. The vital prognosis of PXE depends on the severity of the
      cardiovascular lesions that could be responsible for sudden death in children and young
      adults.

      Ocular manifestations are quite constant and include chorioretinal scarring, pigmentary
      changes or angioid streaks. The natural evolution of the angioid streaks leads to their
      enlargement or to the occurrence of subfoveal choroidal neovascularizations and hemorrhages
      leaving macular scares. A self-monitoring is recommended since early treatment of subfoveal
      CNV is the only way to minimize their pejorative consequences. The gold standard treatment of
      the CNV consists in the photocoagulation. New therapeutics has been developed including
      photodynamic therapy or intravitreal injection of anti-angiogenic agents and they seems to be
      effective to reduce the immediate complications of a limited CNV. This evolution explains
      that 50 to 70 % of the patients have a poor vision or legal blindness of one or both eyes.
      However, little is known about the age of occurrence of visual impairment in PXE patients.
      That is the reason why we decided to review the ophthalmologic status and visual history of
      our population of PXE patients according to their age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective review of all cases of PXE patients referred by the Department of Genetics
      should be performed. This ophthalmologic examination has been conducted as part of the usual
      follow up for such PXE patients or for the needs of a treatment of complications of angioid
      streaks such as CNV complications.

      As we studied the age of poor vision occurrence, we propose to take in account the first
      examination when a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) under 20/50 was observed. All past
      medical events obtains from the data of the patients will be recorded, especially
      ophthalmologic ones.
