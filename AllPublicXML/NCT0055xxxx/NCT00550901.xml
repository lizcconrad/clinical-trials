      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexrazoxane and cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may help kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of dexrazoxane when
      given together with cisplatin in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose of a 96-hour continuous infusion of dexrazoxane
           hydrochloride and a single-dose, one-hour infusion of cisplatin in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of dexrazoxane hydrochloride and cisplatin when given
           concurrently.

        -  To describe the toxicities of infusional dexrazoxane hydrochloride and cisplatin given
           in combination.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV continuously over 96 hours beginning
      on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected periodically during course one for pharmacokinetic studies. DNA isolated
      from the samples is also analyzed for oxidative DNA damage by gas chromatography/mass
      spectrometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
