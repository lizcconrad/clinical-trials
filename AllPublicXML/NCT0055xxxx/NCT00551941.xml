    <textblock>
      The researchers propose a prospective, randomised partially-blinded study to investigate the
      clinical and radiological outcome, effect on quality of life and socio-economic impact of
      non-union of diaphysary tibial fractures treated with BMP-7 in adjunct to fresh frozen
      allograft, in comparison to treatment with allograft together with DBM (demineralised bone
      matrix).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diaphysary tibial non-unions will be included (9 months after first surgery)

          -  Major surgery includes exchange nailing, bone grafting, internal fixation, amputation
             and soft-tissue coverage procedures, such as delayed primary closure and free flaps

          -  Surgery is classified as minor for removal of external fixator pins for local
             infection and removal of a static locking screw from intramedullary nails, a procedure
             known as dynamization

          -  ASA 1 and ASA 2

          -  Gap length/bone contact detected (1-5 cm): largest cortical gap in any radiographic
             incidence

          -  Subject or legal guardian is willing and able to understand, sign and date the study
             specific Patient Informed Consent, which has been approved by the Institutional Review
             Board

          -  Agrees to participate in post-operative evaluations and required rehabilitation
             regimen

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to the active substance or collagen

          -  Gap more than 5 cm

          -  Immature skeleton

          -  Known auto-immune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome and dermatomyositis/polymyositis

          -  Active infection on unhealed site or active systemic infection

          -  Non-healing resulting from pathological fractures, tumours or metabolic bone diseases

          -  Presence of tumour in vicinity of non-union

          -  Patients receiving chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunosuppressant treatment or
             excessive steroids

          -  Patients with severely compromised soft tissue coverage or vascularisation at the
             non-union site, sufficient to impair bone healing

          -  Patients with congenital non-union

          -  Pregnancy and lactation

          -  Non-union of multiple bones interfering with walking

          -  Patients with neuromuscular diseases or conditions interfering normal weight bearing

          -  Patients who, judged by the surgeon, are candidates for just internal fixation alone
