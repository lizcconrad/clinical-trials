      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Dasatinib in relapsed or refractory
           non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients and to determine the safety of Dasatinib in NHL.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the complete and overall response rates for all Phase I and Phase II patients
           and to determine overall survival and event free survival for all Phase I and Phase II
           patients.

        -  To assay the levels of kinase activity in NHL specimens and correlate this activity to
           patient outcomes.

           and to assay the levels of kinase activity in NHL specimens and correlate this activity
           to patient outcomes.

        -  To determine overall survival and event free survival for all Phase I and Phase II
           patients.

      Treatment Plan

      This study has two phases of treatment, Phase I and Phase II. The Phase I portion of the
      trial will consist of a dose escalation plan with 3-6 patients being enrolled into each dose
      cohort. The doses of Dasatinib used in Phase I are 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg. The dose that
      is found to be tolerated the best and also has the best treatment results will be used for
      Phase II. An additional 29 patients will be enrolled into Phase II.

      All patients will receive Dasatinib in this study. Dasatinib will be administered orally (by
      mouth) once daily for 28 day cycles. A cycle will be considered 28 days. Dosing will be
      continuous with no interruptions, unless instructed to interrupt treatment by the treating
      physician.

      The patient will be restaged after every 2 cycles of therapy, every even cycle. Therapy may
      continue as long as there are no clinical signs of NHL progressing and the patient is
      tolerating the treatment with no side effects related to the therapy. If the patient is
      removed from study for any reason, he/she will be followed for survival until death.

    <description>Dasatinib will be orally administered once daily for 28 day cycles.
There will be three dose cohorts for the Dasatinib in the Phase I portion of this trial. A minimum of three patients will be enrolled into each of the following dose cohorts:
Dose cohort # 1 will be 100 mg per day
The MTD will be determined in the Phase I portion of this trial. An additional 29 patients using the Two-Stage Simon design will be enrolled into Phase II using the MTD determined in Phase I.</description>
