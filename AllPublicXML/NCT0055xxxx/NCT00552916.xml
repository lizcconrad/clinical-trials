  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a form of exercise,known as electrical
      stimulation can improve walking function and other important health outcomes. The hypothesis
      is that electrical stimulation can enhance the ability to walk for stroke survivors who are
      unable to walk on their on their own.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A stroke is a devastating life event, that can result in permanent disability. Many people
      who survive a stroke will experience paralysis on one side of their body. The muscles in one
      leg may become weaker or stiff to the point that the person can barely walk. Functional
      electrical stimulation (FES) is an intervention that applies short current pulses to muscles
      and causes them to contract. Previous work done by our team has used FES in the spinal cord
      injured population to help restore functions such as walking and grasping by contracting
      groups of paralyzed muscles in an orchestrated manner. This study seeks to explore whether a
      thrice weekly FES-assisted walking intervention for a 8 week period can stimulate or improve
      walking ability in individuals with severe lower extremity paralysis secondary to a stroke.
      This will subsequently promote opportunities for enhanced social participation and quality of
      life i.e. enhanced balance, increased independence of activities of daily living etc. for
      stroke consumers. Comparison: 40 individuals with severe hemiplegia will be randomized to
      either a thrice weekly control (false) FES training regimen OR a thrice weekly intervention
      (true) FES training regimen. Prior to randomization, participants will be stratified
      according to their ability to ambulate (walk). This study will determine if FES can improve
      or enhance walking ability associated with stroke after 8 weeks of training, and after
      4-month follow-up period.
