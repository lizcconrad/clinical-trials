      Primary objective:

      To determine the Tumor Response Rate of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with
      the combination chemotherapy of Eloxatin+5-FU/LV

      Secondary objective:

      To evaluate time to progression, 6month survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability
      of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with the combination chemotherapy of
      Eloxatin+5-FU/LV
