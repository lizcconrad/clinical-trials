  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the presented study is: Telmisartan induces an increase of eNOS activity in
      RBC resulting in an enhanced intravascular NO bioavailability, an ameliorated RBC
      deformability and a reduction of RBC and platelet aggregation. This could be a potential
      mechanism of the improvement of microcirculatory disorders, especially in patients with
      diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension, treated with Telmisartan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, it could be shown that the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) influences different
      signal transduction pathways within the red blood cells (RBC). This includes the Na+/H+
      exchange activity, the Ca2+-ATP-ase mediated Ca2+efflux, the erythropoietin- dependent
      production of RBC, the RBC deformability, RBC aggregation and the interaction of RBC and
      platelets. Recent studies and experiments, done by our group, focus on the oxidative and
      nitrosative metabolism of NO within the blood. The interactions of the RAS and endothelial NO
      are well known and described in detail. Based on a wide experience in this research field of
      NO metabolism, we characterized recently an active endothelial-type NO-synthase in RBC on the
      biochemical, functional and molecular level. Erythrocyte-derived NO formation serves
      important regulatory functions essential for adequate passage of blood through the
      vasculature. Here we aimed to treat patients with diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension
      with Telmisartan as an angiotensin receptor antagonist. Efficacy parameters studied in this
      study should be: i) RBC deformability, RBC aggregation, ii) RBC dependent production of
      nitric oxide as well as detection of eNOS activity in RBC and iii) indices of
      microcirculatory perfusion. This project could broaden the view of effects of Telmisartan in
      the treatment of microcirculatory disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus and arterial
      hypertension, who exhibit a reduced NO bioavailability and RBC function.
