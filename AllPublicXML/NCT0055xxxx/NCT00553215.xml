      RATIONALE: Studying quality of life in patients with bladder cancer may help determine the
      long-term effects of bladder cancer and may help improve the quality of life for patients in
      the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying quality of life in patients with bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To study the effects of recurrence and progression on health-related quality of life
           (HRQL).

        -  To study the effects of repeat cystoscopy on HRQL.

        -  To study the patients' assessments of a hypothetical prognostic model and how this
           affects their preference for the mode of surveillance.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Quality-of-life questionnaires developed by the European Organization for Research and
      Treatment for Cancer (EORTC) will be used. The EORTC QLQ-BLS24 with 24 questions specific to
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and the EORTC QLQ-BLM30 with 30 questions specific to
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer will be combined and used in conjunction with the general
      cancer questionnaire QLQ-C30.

      Assessments using the QLQ-C30 will be made at baseline in the entire cohort of patients.
      Follow-up assessments using the QLQ-C30, QLQ-BLS24, and QLQ-BLM30 167 will be made at first
      routine follow-up and annually until the end of study.
