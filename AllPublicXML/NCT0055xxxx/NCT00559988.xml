      The IMPACT Study will investigate the potential clinical benefit of the combined use of
      BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring (HM) technology and a predefined anticoagulation plan compared to
      conventional device evaluation and physician-directed anticoagulation in patients with
      implanted dual-chamber defibrillators or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are common cardiac arrhythmias associated
      with an increased incidence of stroke in patients with additional risk factors. Oral
      Anticoagulation (OAC) reduces stroke risk, but because these arrhythmias are frequently
      intermittent and asymptomatic, start of OAC therapy is often delayed until
      electrocardiographic documentation is obtained.

      Technological advances in implanted dual-chamber cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac
      resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices allow early detection and real time
      verification of AF/AFL with intracardiac electrograms (IEGM) automatically transmitted to the
      clinicians. Such remote diagnostic capability might be particularly relevant in patients with
      asymptomatic AF by allowing timely treatment. Compared to conventional periodic, (e.g.,
      quarterly) office device evaluation, daily remote monitoring may prove superior for diagnosis
      of AF and prophylactic treatment of thromboembolism.

      The start, stop and restart of OAC based on a predefined atrial rhythm-guided strategy in
      conjunction with a standard risk-stratification scheme could lead to better clinical outcomes
      compared with conventional clinical care. The study is designed to demonstrate a risk
      reduction of both thromboembolism proximate to episodes of documented AF/AFL and bleeding
      potentiated by chronic OAC in the absence of AF. Verification of this premise would impact
      the clinical practice, providing evidence to physicians for the use of HM to guide OAC in
      patients with AF/AFL. The results of this study should demonstrate the clinical value of
      wireless remote surveillance of the cardiac rhythm and may define the critical threshold of
      AF/AFL burden warranting OAC or antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients at risk of stroke

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life was evaluated using the SF-36 v2 Health Survey. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores which correspond to the following sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Responses are recoded per a scoring key with each question having a value from 0 to 100. Scores from items in the same scale are averaged together per the scoring key to create the section and subsection (physical health and mental health) scores. For all reported scores, the lowest possible value is 0 (representing the highest disability) and the highest possible value is 100 (representing no disability). Therefore, a positive change from baseline to 1 year represents an improvement in disability, while a negative change represents a worsening of disability.</description>

    <description>Home Monitoring is fully enabled and continuous remote surveillance data is available to investigators. Patients will be treated according to a predefined anticoagulation plan, which uses the total duration of AF/AFL combined with patients' CHADS2 score to determine the start, stop, and restart of OAC.</description>

    <description>In Control (Group 2), Home Monitoring is active for Safety Net alerts, but the remote AF/AFL data is not revealed to the patient or treating physician. These patients receive physician-directed OAC consistent with current standards of care.

VT/ VF Detection Inactive

    <description>Active monitoring for atrial episodes through the automatic HM notifications (email, fax, short message service) is required. If the total duration over 48 consecutive hours reaches the predefined anticoagulation condition, and AF/AFL diagnosis is confirmed using the IEGM online, the site instructs the patient by telephone to start OAC. Clinicians continue to monitor patients using HM, and if freedom from AF/AFL reaches the predefined interval, stop of OAC therapy is requested over the telephone. Following stop of anticoagulation, any recurrence of AF/AFL requires restart of OAC therapy.

          <description>The primary endpoint is to demonstrate whether early detection of atrial arrhythmias based on BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring technology combined with a predefined anticoagulation plan in the Home Monitoring Guided OAC group is superior to the Physician-Directed OAC group reflecting conventional care and physician directed treatment of AF in terms of risk reduction of the primary composite endpoint including stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding events.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life Score</title>
        <description>Quality of Life was evaluated using the SF-36 v2 Health Survey. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores which correspond to the following sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Responses are recoded per a scoring key with each question having a value from 0 to 100. Scores from items in the same scale are averaged together per the scoring key to create the section and subsection (physical health and mental health) scores. For all reported scores, the lowest possible value is 0 (representing the highest disability) and the highest possible value is 100 (representing no disability). Therefore, a positive change from baseline to 1 year represents an improvement in disability, while a negative change represents a worsening of disability.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Study stopped early when primary endpoint met futility criteria. Continuation may have changed the outcome; however, unlikely to demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit. Interpretation of secondary endpoints should be approached with caution.</limitations_and_caveats>
