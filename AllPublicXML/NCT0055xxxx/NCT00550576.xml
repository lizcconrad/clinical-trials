      Subjects suffering from bipolar disorders treated with specific medications will give their
      informed concent and will receive intravenously only one dose of Digoxin antibodies (Fab).
      Their response to this therapy will be measured accordingly.Previous medications will be not
      changed A base line serum Endogenous Digitalis-like Compounds (DLC)levels will be measured
      using a specific laboratory technique and these compounds will be measured at 6 and 24 hours
      after Fab therapy.

      Patients also will be followed using clinical and psychological tests
