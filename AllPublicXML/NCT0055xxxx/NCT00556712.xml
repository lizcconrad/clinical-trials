  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Tarceva,
      compared with placebo, following platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced,
      recurrent, or metastatic NSCLC who have not had disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      during chemotherapy. Following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, eligible patients
      will be randomized to receive either Tarceva 150mg po daily, or placebo daily. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression; the target sample size is
      500+ individuals.

For non-target lesions (NTLs), PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs.

The 95% CI was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</description>

    <description>Deterioration in quality of life (QoL) was defined as a clinically meaningful decline in the total FACT-L score, the sum of the TOI, Social/Family Well-Being (SWB) and Emotional Well-Being (EWB) of the FACT-L questionnaires. TOI (PWB + FWB + LCS), SWB and EWB scores were obtained from 7-item (6-item in the case of EWB) questionnaires from the FACT-L V 4. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms on a scale from 0-4, where 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; Higher score indicated more severe symptoms. A clinically meaningful decline in FACT-L score was defined as at least a 6 point decline from BL. Participants without a clinically meaningful decline in TOI at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last FACT-L.</description>

    <description>Total FACT-L score=sum of TOI, SWB, and EWB of FACT-L questionnaires. TOI (PWB+FWB+LCS), SWB, and EWB scores obtained from 7-item (6-item for EWB) questionnaires from FACT-L V4. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms (scale 0-4; 0=&quot;not at all&quot; and 4=&quot;very much&quot;). Higher score=more severe symptoms.

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to PD or death, whichever occurred first. For TLs, PD was defined at least a 20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from BL more the appearance of one or more new lesions.

          <title>Probable Percentage of Participants in the EGFR IHC Negative Population Remaining Alive and Free of Disease Progression at 6 Months (Data Cutoff 17 May 2008)</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to PD or death, whichever occurred first. For TLs, PD was defined at least a 20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For NTLs, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Participants without PD or death were censored at the date of last tumor assessment where non-progression was documented. The 95% CI was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</description>

          <description>For TLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs; PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of the TLs, taking as a reference the BL SLD; SD was defined as neither sufficient decrease in SLD to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in SLD to qualify for PD; and PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started. For NTLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels; SD/incomplete response was defined as the persistence of 1 or more NTLs and/or maintenance of tumor marker levels above normal limits; and PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. The 95% CI for one sample binomial was determined using the Pearson-Clopper method.</description>

        <description>LCS scores were obtained from a 7-item questionnaire from the FACT-L V 4. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms commonly reported by lung cancer patients; such as shortness of breath, loss of weight, and tightness in chest; on a scale from 0-4, where 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; The participants' responses were summed to result in an overall score, where a higher score indicated more severe symptoms. A change of 2 to 3 points in score was determined to be a clinically meaningful decline. The 95% CI was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</description>

        <title>Probable Percentage of Participants Remaining Without Deterioration in TOI at 6 Months (Data Cutoff 17 May 2008)</title>
        <description>TOI was defined as the sum of the scores of the PWB, FWB, and LCS. PWB, FWB, and LCS scores were obtained from 7-item questionnaires from the FACT-L V 4. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms on a scale from 0-4, where 0 = &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much.&quot; Higher score indicated more severe symptoms. A clinically meaningful decline in TOI score was defined as at least a 6 point decline from BL. Participants without a clinically meaningful decline in TOI at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last FACT-L assessment. The 95% CI was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</description>

Participants who completed all 4 cycles of chemotherapy run-in without PD according to RECIST were randomized to receive erlotinib, 150 mg/day, PO as tablets from randomization until PD, death, unacceptable toxicity, or end of study, up to 27 months.</description>

          <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) Scores (Data Cutoff 17 May 2008)</title>
          <description>Total FACT-L score=sum of TOI, SWB, and EWB of FACT-L questionnaires. TOI (PWB+FWB+LCS), SWB, and EWB scores obtained from 7-item (6-item for EWB) questionnaires from FACT-L V4. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms (scale 0-4; 0=&quot;not at all&quot; and 4=&quot;very much&quot;). Higher score=more severe symptoms. The 7-item LCS assessed symptoms such as shortness of breath, loss of weight, tightness in chest. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms (scale: 0-4; 0=&quot;not at all&quot; and 4=&quot;very much&quot;). Scores from 0-35; higher score=more severe symptoms. The 27 items of FACT-G were scored in the following domains: PWB (7 items, total score 0-28), SWB (7 items; total score 0-28), EWB (6 items, total score 0-24), and FWB (7 items; total score 0-28), higher scores=better QoL. Participants responded to items on 5-point Likert scale (0=&quot;Not at all&quot; to 4=&quot;Very much&quot;; total score: 0-108). Higher score=better QOL. TOI score=PWB+FWB+LCS; Total TOI score: 0-92; higher scores=better QOL.</description>

        <description>Total FACT-L score=sum of TOI, SWB, and EWB of FACT-L questionnaires. TOI (PWB+FWB+LCS), SWB, and EWB scores obtained from 7-item (6-item for EWB) questionnaires from FACT-L V4. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms (scale 0-4; 0=&quot;not at all&quot; and 4=&quot;very much&quot;). Higher score=more severe symptoms. The 7-item LCS assessed symptoms such as shortness of breath, loss of weight, tightness in chest. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms (scale: 0-4; 0=&quot;not at all&quot; and 4=&quot;very much&quot;). Scores from 0-35; higher score=more severe symptoms. The 27 items of FACT-G were scored in the following domains: PWB (7 items, total score 0-28), SWB (7 items; total score 0-28), EWB (6 items, total score 0-24), and FWB (7 items; total score 0-28), higher scores=better QoL. Participants responded to items on 5-point Likert scale (0=&quot;Not at all&quot; to 4=&quot;Very much&quot;; total score: 0-108). Higher score=better QOL. TOI score=PWB+FWB+LCS; Total TOI score: 0-92; higher scores=better QOL.</description>
