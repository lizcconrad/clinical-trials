      Primary objective:

      * Immunogenicity To demonstrate that the influenza vaccine administered by intradermal route
      at least as immunogenic as the adjuvanted influenza vaccine administered by intramuscular
      route at the same dosage in term of HA antibody titres

      Secondary objectives

        -  Immunogenicity

             -  To describe the immune response 21 days after vaccination with the influenza
                vaccine administered by ID route versus the adjuvanted influenza vaccine
                administered by IM route..

             -  To describe the compliance of both vaccines administered with the European Medicine
                Agency (EMEA) Note for Guidance immunogenicity criteria, specific for elderly
                subjects

        -  Safety

           - To describe the safety profile after vaccination in each group

        -  Acceptability

             -  To describe the pain at the injection site

             -  To describe the comfort of the injection
