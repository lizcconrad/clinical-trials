    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of single subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) doses of 300 mg
      natalizumab to intravenous (IV) administration of 300 mg natalizumab in multiple sclerosis
      (MS) participants. The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety, tolerability and
      PK of repeated natalizumab doses administered SC and IM, to investigate the immunogenicity of
      repeated natalizumab doses administered SC and IM, to explore proof of concept within the
      secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) population using change from baseline in
      clinical measures including: expanded disability status scale (EDSS), multiple sclerosis
      functional composite scale (MSFC), symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), visual analogue scale
      (VAS), and visual function test; and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures
      including: number of new or newly-enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, number of new T1
      hypointense lesions, number of new gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, whole brain atrophy,
      magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to observe the
      effect of natalizumab administered IV and SC on brain MRI measures in participants with
      relapsing forms of MS.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in expanded disability status scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 20, and 32</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>

    <measure>Change form Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite Scale (MFSC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 20, and 32</time_frame>
    <description>The MFSC consists of 3 tests: 1. Timed 25-Foot Walk, a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test where the participant is timed while walking for 25 feet; 2. 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), a quantitative test of upper extremity function that measures the time it takes to place 9 pegs into 9 holes and then remove the pegs. 3. 3 Second Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT 3). The MSFC is based on the concept that scores for these 3 dimensions - arm, leg, and cognitive function are combined to create a single score that can be used to detect change over time. A composite z-score is created, which represents the number of standard deviations (SDs) a participant's test result is higher (z &gt; 0) or lower (z &lt; 0) than the average test result (z = 0) of the reference population.</description>
