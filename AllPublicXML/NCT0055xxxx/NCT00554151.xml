      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females aged greater or equal to 18 to less than or equal to age 75.

          -  Patients with indications to undergo mitral valve repair consistent with ACC/AHA
             recommendations; including greater or equal to 2+ regurgitation by pre-operative TEE
             or TTE assessment.

          -  Candidate for cardiopulmonary bypass.

          -  A Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction greater or equal to 40%.

          -  Able and willing to comply with all study requirements, including the required study
             follow-up visits.

          -  Able and willing to five consent and follow study instructions.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized or more than one
             year postmenopausal), with a negative pregnancy test (serum beta-hCG) within 24 hours
             prior to mitral valve surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous cardiac surgery.

          -  Any interventional cardiology procedure within six months prior to study to include
             all patients that have had a drug eluting stent (DES) implanted within 6 months.

          -  Evidence of an acute Myocardial Infarction (MI) within 7 days of the intended
             treatment with the investigational device.

          -  Prior mitral valve surgery or valvuloplasty or currently implanted prosthetic valve.

          -  Restricted mobility of the mitral apparatus that results in a valvular area less than
             3.0 cm2.

          -  Recent or evolving bacterial endocarditis or patients under current antibiotic
             therapy.

          -  Patients with ICD's.

          -  Any angiographic or clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the
             patient at increased risk with the placement of the device or concurrent medical
             condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.

          -  Patients who are immunocompromised or with autoimmune diseases.

          -  Patients suffering from renal insufficiency (Creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL) or patients with
             chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis.

          -  Co-morbid conditions that place the subject at an unacceptable surgical risk (e.g.
             sever chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic failure, immunosuppressive
             abnormalities, haematological abnormalities).

          -  Significant mitral annular calcification.

          -  Use of Coumadin, IIbIIIa inhibitors, Clopidigrel (Plavix) or other anti-coagulants
             within (5) five days prior to surgery.

          -  Participation in any study involving an investigational drug or device within the past
             month, or ongoing participation in a study with an investigational device.

          -  Intolerance or hypersensitivity to anaesthetics.

          -  Patients in whom transesophageal echo/Doppler is contraindicated.

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  History of stroke within the prior 6 months

          -  Subjects to undergo concomitant cardiac repair or replacement other than CABG (less
             than or equal to 3 vessels) mitral annuloplasty, tricuspid valve repair and ablation
             therapy for correction of atrial fibrillation. Excluded concomitant procedures are:
             aortic valve replacement, LV remodeling, surgery and congenital repair.

          -  Patients with Euroscore &gt; 10.
