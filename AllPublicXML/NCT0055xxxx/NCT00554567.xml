    <textblock>
      This community-based clinical trial based in two districts of rural Maharashtra, India
      compares utilization of an intervention model of &quot;fully-decentralized,&quot; or rural primary
      clinic-based, HIV testing and care services, with a control model of the Indian government's
      partially-decentralized HIV services, offering rural referral clinic testing and urban-based
      HIV care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      India has one of the highest estimated number of HIV cases globally. Sixty percent of its HIV
      cases occur in rural residents, yet there is no system of HIV testing or care services for
      them. Preliminary studies have identified very low HIV testing utilization among men and
      recently pregnant women in rural Maharashtra, even though these are, by government policy,
      high-priority target groups for rural HIV testing, diagnosis, and prevention.

      This study will compare two models of rural HIV testing and care services in two districts of
      Maharashtra, India. The &quot;Control&quot; model is the Indian government's current strategy of
      &quot;partially decentralized&quot; rural-based HIV testing services at a secondary-level Community
      Health Center clinic, which serves a village group population of 30,000. HIV care including
      antiretroviral therapy is provided a the rural district headquarters in the district urban
      center. The &quot;Intervention&quot; model is a novel model of &quot;fully decentralized&quot; rural-based HIV
      testing which will be offered at the Community Health Center, two Primary Health Centers, and
      eight village-level sub-center clinics, and HIV care offered at a rural-based clinic.

      The primary outcomes of this trial are to assess and compare utilization rates for these two
      types of HIV services models among rural adult men age 18-49 and pregnant women age 18 and
      older. Additionally, the secondary outcomes include comparing HIV clinical and behavioral
      risk characteristics of services utilizers in each model, and characteristics of utilizers
      versus non-utilizers between and within each model. Clinical care outcomes include WHO
      Clinical stage at time of HIV diagnosis and at first clinical care visit, and birth outcomes
      for HIV-infected pregnant women.
