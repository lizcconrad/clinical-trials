  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidisciplinary antimicrobial utilization teams (AUT) have been proposed as an effective
      mechanism for improving antimicrobial use, but data on their efficacy remain limited. The
      researchers postulated that a multi-disciplinary AUT would improve antimicrobial use in a
      teaching hospital when compared to the standard of care (no AUT intervention).

      Design: Randomized-controlled intervention trial. Setting: A 953-bed urban teaching hospital.

      Patients: Patients admitted to internal medicine ward teams who were prescribed selected
      antimicrobial agents (piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, or vancomycin) during the
      10month study period.

      Intervention: Eight internal medicine ward teams were randomized monthly to academic
      detailing by the AUT while 8 internal medicine ward teams were randomized indication-based
      prescription of broad spectrum antimicrobials.

      Measurements: Proportion of appropriate empiric, definitive, and end antimicrobial usage
      (antimicrobial use from the initiation of therapy until definitive therapy is prescribed).

      This study was conducted when Bernard C Camins, MD (BCC), one of the investigators, was still
      employed at Emory University. The principal investigator is no longer at Emory University.
      This trial is being registered by one of the investigators, BCC, so we can submit the
      manuscript for publication. BCC is now at Washington University and this study was conducted
      while he was at Emory University.

    <description>Physicians caring for patients who were prescribed one of three antimicrobials were randomly assigned to academic detailing by the AUT. The AUT would review the antimicrobial prescription and provide consultation to the ordering physician if the prescription is appropriate and provide feedback on a better alternative if inappropriate.</description>
