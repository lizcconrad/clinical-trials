  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of treatment with XP19986
      Sustained Release (SR) Tablet compared to placebo in subjects with spasticity due to spinal
      cord injury

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple-dose, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of the efficacy and
      safety of XP19986 SR1 in subjects with spasticity due to spinal cord injury. Three cohorts of
      subjects are randomized to receive XP19986 SR1 10 mg every 12 hrs or 20 mg every 12 hrs or 30
      mg every 12 hrs in one treatment segment and placebo every 12 hrs in the alternate treatment
      segment. Each subject serves as their own control in this cross-over study.

    <description>Following a 7 day run-in period in which participants take placebo twice a day (BID), participants are randomized to the cohort that will take XP19986 SR1 10 mg BID treatment crossing over to placebo treatment (or the reverse order). Each treatment segment follows the same pattern: 3-9 days of titration, 7 days at target dose, 3-9 days of tapering, followed by a 3-day placebo washout.</description>
