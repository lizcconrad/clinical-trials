  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major goal in public health is to find effective, feasible and simple programs for
      overweight prevention among children. This controlled intervention study evaluates a simple
      environmental and behavioral modification for its efficacy in preventing overweight of
      children in the school setting. The intervention strategy focuses solely on the promotion of
      drinking tap water. The study was conducted in 32 elementary schools including about 3000
      children in two German cities over 1 school year.

    <textblock>
      Soft drinks and other caloric beverages are supposed to be involved in the development of
      overweight and obesity in children. The intervention strategy of our study was to promote
      water consumption by facilitating access to tap water in schools assuming a concomitant
      decrease in caloric soft drinks at least at school. The environmental modification of
      installing a water dispenser at school and delivering a special bottle to each child in the
      intervention schools was supported by a few educational lessons. These lessons were held by
      the class teachers who received a prepared 6-hour curriculum dealing with the importance of
      water for the body and of water intake. For the study 17 randomly selected schools were
      assigned to the intervention group, 15 schools to the control group that did not receive any
      intervention. Body weight and height to calculate BMI as primary outcome were assessed at
      baseline and after the intervention period of 1 school year. As secondary outcome drinking
      and physical activity habits were evaluated at baseline and after the intervention. The water
      flow of the dispenser was measured at regular intervals. In addition, data of process
      evaluation was collected to measure acceptance and feasibility of the intervention in the
      school setting.

      To analyze the efficacy of this primarily environmental and behavioral intervention,
      incidence and prevalence was compared between intervention and control group.
