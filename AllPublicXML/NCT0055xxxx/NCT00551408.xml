  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction ultimately represents an imbalance between the magnitude of injury
      and the capacity for repair.

      Current evidence established that endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) participate in several
      models of vascular disease as acute coronary syndromes, stroke, diabetes, peripheral artery
      disease, etc. However EPC in the setting of PAH is less well established. The target of this
      study is to demonstrate if the number of EPC is increased in a mexican population of patients
      with PAH.
