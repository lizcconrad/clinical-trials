    <textblock>
      Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) provides a novel approach for cancer treatment.
      LBH589, an oral HDAC inhibitor, has been well tolerated in phase I trials and has shown
      activity against several types of cancer. In this nonrandomized phase II trial, we are
      investigating the activity of LBH589 in the treatment of patients with refractory clear cell
      renal carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) provides a potential target for cancer treatment.
      Histones are components of the core proteins of nucleosomes, and acetylation and
      deacetylation of these proteins play a role in the regulation of gene expression. HDAC
      activity is known to be increased in many types of malignant cells; HDAC inhibitors have been
      shown to induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in cultured tumor cells.
      Since this tumor-associated mechanism is common to many types of cancer, HDAC may have a
      broad role in cancer treatment.
