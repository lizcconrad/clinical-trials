  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy has become the single most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease.

      On a molecular level, at least five major pathways have been implicated in glucose-mediated
      vascular and renal damage and all of these could reflect a single hyperglycaemia-induced
      process of overproduction of reactive oxygen species.

      Recent studies have shown that inflammation, and more specifically pro-inflammatory cytokines
      play a determinant role in the development of micro- vascular diabetic complications, most of
      the attention has been focused on the implications of TNF-Î± in the setting of diabetic
      nephropathy.

      Glutathione is the most abundant low-molecular-weight thiol, and Glutathione/ glutathione
      disulfide is the major redox couple in animal cells.

      N-acetylcysteine is effective precursors of cysteine for tissue Glutathione synthesis.

      Not only does N-acetylcysteine exhibit antioxidant properties, but it may also counteract the
      glycation cascade through the inhibition of oxidation.

      N-acetylcysteine can also reduce the apoptosis elicited by reactive oxygen species .

      Indeed, N-acetylcysteine has been shown to inhibit reactive oxygen species induced mesangial
      apoptosis and to be able to protect cells from glucose-induced inhibition of proliferation.
