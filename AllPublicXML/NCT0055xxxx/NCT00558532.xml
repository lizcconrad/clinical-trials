  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in plasma,
      blood and abdominal fat before and after bariatric surgery to provide guidance for future
      studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The omega-3 fatty acids are essential for human growth, development and well-being. Numerous
      studies have shown that a relatively high intake of the omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial in
      brain and visual development, psychiatric disorders, rheumatic disorders, inflammatory
      responses and cardiovascular disease. As an example, low levels of tissue omega-3 fatty acids
      are associated with a markedly higher rate of death from cardiac causes compared to patients
      with relatively high concentrations of the omega-3 fatty acids. Obese patients often have an
      unhealthy dietary intake and evidence of increased inflammatory processes. After a gastric
      bypass patients will have decreased absorption of fats from the gastrointestinal tract and
      may become fatty acid deficient. While gastric bypass may decrease death from cardiovascular
      disease in morbidly obese patients, cardiovascular disease is still the most common cause of
      death after a gastric bypass. There are numerous nutritional deficiencies which occur after
      gastric bypass and many of these are well documented. However, there are no data concerning
      the plasma and tissue levels of omega-3 fatty acids in morbidly obese patients either before
      or after operation.
