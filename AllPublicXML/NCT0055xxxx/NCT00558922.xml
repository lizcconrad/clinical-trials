    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multicenter, phase 1-2 study. Following determination of the
      recommended AEG35156 dose in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in the initial Phase
      1 part of this study, additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2 part of the study
      to assess the activity of the combination in advanced non small cell lung cancer.

    <textblock>
      Apoptotic induction in cancer cells is a sought after therapeutic goal. Most successful
      anticancer agents activate apoptosis pathways in the cancers they treat. Apoptotic pathways
      in cells appear to converge on a single family of enzymes, the caspases, which are proteases
      that dismantle the cell in an orderly, non-inflammatory fashion, resulting in cell death. The
      X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP) is the only known cellular inhibitor of caspases, its
      over expression thereby blocking the principal means of apoptosis. A wide range of evidence
      indicates that cellular overexpression of members of the IAP family is a fundamental means by
      which many cancer cells evade death, even in the presence of strong extrinsic (death
      receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) apoptotic cues. The inhibition of
      cellular XIAP activity, specifically in cancer cells under stress and primed for apoptosis by
      chemotherapeutic agents, is viewed as a powerful means of tipping the balance towards cell
      death. In particular, XIAP down regulation has been shown to enhance taxane cytotoxicity
      preclinically. AEG35156 is a second generation antisense which targets XIAP mRNA to lower
      XIAP levels and the apoptotic threshold of cancer cells, enhancing their sensitivity to
      intrinsic death and chemotherapy. AEG35156 may thus enhance the anticancer activity of
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer
