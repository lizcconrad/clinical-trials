      The primary objective of this study is to compare the Apnea- Hypopnea Index in HF patients
      with concomitant CSA, after 12 weeks of CRT alone to CRT in combination with one night of
      overdrive pacing. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of a single night of
      overdrive pacing applied after 12 weeks of CRT vs. CRT alone on breathing events, sleeping
      events, and neurohormonal markers. An additional secondary objective of the study is to
      compare the efficacy of CRT in HF patients with concomitant CSA to HF patients without
      concomitant CSA.

    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a common and often undiagnosed disorder associated with substantial
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In recent years studies have been published
      presenting the relationship between heart failure (HF) and central sleep apnea (CSA). CSA
      associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a form of periodic breathing in which central
      apneas and hypopnea alternate with periods of hyperventilation, characterized by a regular
      crescendo-decrescendo oscillation of tidal volume, which is thought to be caused by
      dysfunction of central respiratory control. Unlike, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CSA likely
      arises as a consequence of HF.Since 2002, several results have reported on the benefit of
      atrial overdrive (AOP) pacing in patients suffering from sleep apnea. These results could not
      be confirmed for obstructive sleep apnea in several subsequent studies. Cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been proposed as another potential therapeutic pacing
      approach for CSA by two recently published investigations.The combined therapeutic impact of
      AOP and CRT (CRT+AOP) so far has not been investigated.We aimed to evaluate the effect of CRT
      alone and CRT+AOP on CSA in patients with CHF.
