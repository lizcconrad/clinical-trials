  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin on the
      incretin effect in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a meal, gut-produced incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the circulation. Because
      GLP-1 and GIP mediate grossly 60% of the insulin-stimulatory action, the so-called incretin
      effect, both are crucial components of a natural endogenous system guaranteeing glucose
      homeostasis. In addition, GLP-1 lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells and
      delays nutrient delivery from the stomach by inhibiting gastric emptying. The rise in insulin
      concentration enhances glucose clearance in peripheral tissues such as muscle, and the lower
      glucagon concentration combined with the rise in insulin reduces hepatic glucose production.
      By enhancing glucose clearance and lowering hepatic glucose production, the post-meal glucose
      excursion is reduced.

      Both GLP-1 and GIP are degraded by the enzyme dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4). Inhibition of
      DPP-4 by the specific DPP-4 inhibitor Sitagliptin increases plasma levels of both GLP-1 and
      GIP, and reduces postprandial glycemia.

      Although important in healthy subjects, the role of the incretin hormones in patients with
      T2DM is unclear. In T2DM the insulinotropic efficacy of GIP is reduced and the postprandial
      release of GLP-1 is diminished.

      Therefore, the aim of this study in T2DM is to quantify the incretin effect with and without
      the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin. The specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin(9-39) will be
      used to quantify the contribution of both GLP-1 and GIP to the incretin effect in patients
      with T2DM.
