    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate efficacy of certolizumab pegol in inducing
      clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease as compared with
      placebo based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score at Week 6.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects in Clinical Remission at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects in clinical remission at Week 6 (clinical remission is defined as a total Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of 150 points or less). CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease. A score of 150 points or below indicates clinical remission and a score above 450 points indicates extremely severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving a Clinical Response at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects achieving a clinical response at Week 6 (clinical response is defined as at least a 100-point decrease from the Week 0 Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score). CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease. A score of 150 or below indicates clinical remission and a score above 450 points indicates extremely severe disease.</description>

    <description>The percentage of subjects in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) remission at Week 6 (IBDQ remission is defined as a total IBDQ score of 170 points or more). The IBDQ Global Score is the sum of 32 responses, each ranging from 0 to 7, thus the Global Score ranges from 0 to 224; a higher score indicating a better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The change in Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) score from Week 0 to Week 6. HBI score consists of clinical parameters of general well-being (0 to 4), abdominal pain (0 to 3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0 to 3), and complications (score 1 per item). The first three items are scored for the previous day. Lower scores indicated better well being.</description>

          <description>The change in Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) score from Week 0 to Week 6. HBI score consists of clinical parameters of general well-being (0 to 4), abdominal pain (0 to 3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0 to 3), and complications (score 1 per item). The first three items are scored for the previous day. Lower scores indicated better well being.</description>
