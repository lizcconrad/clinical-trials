  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that CPAP + pharmaceutical treatment, compared to
      pharmaceutical treatment alone, improves the respiratory and hemodynamic status of the
      patients before H2 after the inclusion time and decreases the rate of death and tracheal
      intubation during the first 48 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are included at home after informed consent by the emergency medical team and
      transported during the following 2 hours to a cardiac intensive care unit were the treatment
      is purchased as well. Randomization process has been done previously with envelopes ; group A
      : pharmaceutical treatment alone , B pharmaceutical plus CPAP. Medical treatment includes
      furosemide and nitroglycerin (continuous perfusion and bolus), inotropes if needed, and all
      other specific treatment required (ex : anti antiarrhythmic drugs). Doses are free, adapted
      to the clinical response for respiratory and hemodynamic distress. CPAP is a passive high
      flow venturi system device alimented by a hyperbaric oxygen. FiO2 can be controlled and
      adapted to the pulsed oxygen saturation. PEP must be initially celled at least at 7.5 cmH2O
      and increased to 10 if well tolerated.
