  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will rigorously test whether modulation of the motor cortex by transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) is an effective treatment for patients with chronic pelvic pain through
      the following specific aims:

      A) The primary aim of this study is to determine whether transcranial direct current
      stimulation applied to the motor cortex in patients with chronic pelvic pain induces a
      significant decrease in the pain or symptoms as compared with sham tDCS. We will also measure
      changes in the clinical symptom scores of multiple pelvic organs, drug intake (narcotic),
      anxiety, depression, traumatic stress, as well as overall improvement in the quality of life
      to assess the effects of this treatment.

      B) Determine the duration of the clinical effects of tDCS. We will therefore compare the
      amelioration of pain and related symptoms between active and sham tDCS for one year following
      treatment.

      C) Determine whether tDCS changes the threshold for pain detection as compared with sham
      tDCS. Patients with chronic pelvic pain have a lower threshold for pain as compared to
      healthy subjects and we hypothesized that this threshold will increase after stimulation with
      tDCS.

      D) Finally, we will examine whether 5 days of tDCS treatment is safe for use in chronic
      pelvic pain patients. Safety will be assessed through neuropsychological tests and adverse
      event reporting.
