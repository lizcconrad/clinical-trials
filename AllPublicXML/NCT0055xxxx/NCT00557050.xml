      A common soft tissue injury in sports involving sprinting and jumping is the hamstring
      strain.

      Not much evidence-based research has been carried out on prevention of hamstring strains.

      Most studies suggest that hamstring strains occur during the later part of the swing phase
      when the player is sprinting. In this phase the hamstring muscles are working to decelerate
      knee extension - that is, the muscle develops tension while lengthening. This means that the
      muscles change from functioning eccentrically to concentrically. We hypothesize that it is
      during this rapid change from eccentric to concentric function that the muscles are most
      vulnerable to injuries, and that the injuries can be prevented by increasing the eccentric
      muscle strength in the hamstring.

      This randomized clinical trial will examine the effect of a 10-week preseason
      strength-training program in Danish elite soccer. The strength-training program focuses on
      eccentric hamstring training.

      60 elite teams (1200 soccer players) will be cluster-randomized to either ordinary training
      or ordinary training combined with eccentric hamstring strength training. The training group
      will start the training program in the pre-season (10 weeks) and continue the training once a
      week during the following season.

      Suspected hamstrings strains during the season will be examined within 3 days using
      ultrasound. Ultrasound verified hamstring strains will be registered, and players will start
      a standardized rehabilitation program.
