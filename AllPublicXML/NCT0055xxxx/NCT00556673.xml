    <measure>Change From Period Baseline to 24 Hour Post-dose (Trough) Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose for each Treatment Period (Days 1, 8 and 15) and 24-hours post-dose for each Treatment Period (Days 2, 9 and 16).</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. Change from the period baseline to 24 hour post dose trough FEV1 after 1 day of treatment was modeled using a linear mixed effect model fitting treatment, sequence and period as fixed factors, patient within sequence as a random factor and pre-dose FEV1 as covariate.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. Peak FEV1 is defined as the peak FEV1 between 0 and 4 hours post-dose. The change from baseline in peak FEV1 was modeled using a linear mixed effect model fitting treatment, sequence and period as fixed factors, patient within sequence as a random factor and pre-dose FEV1 as covariate.</description>

    <description>Trough FEV1 was measured 24 hours post-dose. The FEV1 percent predicted expresses FEV1 as a percentage of the &quot;predicted values&quot; for participants of similar characteristics (height, age, sex, and sometimes race and weight). A positive change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted indicates improvement in lung function. Change from baseline in trough FEV1 % predicted was modeled using a linear mixed effect model fitting treatment, sequence and period as fixed factors, patient within sequence as a random factor and pre-dose value as covariate.</description>

    <description>The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of an expiration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female adult patients aged 18-75 years with persistent asthma

          -  Patients with persistent asthma, diagnosed according to the Global Initiative for
             Asthma guidelines (GINA) and who additionally met the following criteria:

               1. Patients receiving daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroid up to the maximum
                  dose per day indicated in the package leaflet, in a stable regimen for the month
                  prior to Visit 1.

                  of the predicted normal value. This criterion for FEV1 had to be demonstrated
                  after a washout period of at least 6 hours during which no short acting
                  β2-agonist had been inhaled, and a minimum of 48 hours for a long acting
                  β2-agonist.

               3. Patients who demonstrated an increase of ≥12% and ≥200 mL in FEV1 over their
                  pre-bronchodilator value 30 minutes after inhaling a total of 200 μg of
                  salbutamol (or albuterol) via metered dose inhaler (MDI) (the reversibility
                  test). Reversibility had to be demonstrated after an appropriate washout period
                  of at least 6 hrs prior to the evaluation for a shortacting β2-agonist. The
                  administration of salbutamol (or albuterol) for the reversibility test was to be
                  within 30 minutes after pre-bronchodilator spirometry. Reversibility had to be
                  demonstrated at Visit 1 or between Visits 1 and 2, in order for patients to be
                  included in the trial.

               4. For each patient, the smaller value of the Visit 1 FEV1 or the Visit 2 FEV1
                  pre-dose value had to be at least 85% of the larger value.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m^2 and weight &gt;50 kg.

          -  patients using local contraception

             of study start

          -  Patients with frequent rescue medication (&gt;8 puffs/day for two consecutive days)

          -  Clinically relevant laboratory abnormality or a clinically significant condition

          -  Active cancer or a history of cancer with less than 5 years disease free survival time

          -  History of long QT syndrome or with long QTc interval prior to dosing

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the study drugs or to drugs with similar chemical
             structures

          -  Use of certain medications

          -  Use of other investigational drugs

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result

          -  History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive human immumodeficiency
             virus (HIV) test result.

          <title>Change From Period Baseline in Peak Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</title>
          <description>Peak FEV1 was defined as the peak FEV1 up to 4 hours post-dose. The FEV1 percent predicted expresses FEV1 as a percentage of the &quot;predicted values&quot; for participants of similar characteristics (height, age, sex, and sometimes race and weight). A positive change from baseline in FEV1 % predicted indicates improvement in lung function. Change from baseline in peak FEV1 % predicted was modeled using a linear mixed effect model fitting treatment, sequence and period as fixed factors, patient within sequence as a random factor and pre-dose value as covariate.</description>
