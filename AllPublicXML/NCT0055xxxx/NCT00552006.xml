  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the aftermath of traumatic experiences like natural disasters or man-caused traumatic
      events, such as war experiences, a substantial part of the affected individuals develop a
      number of psychological symptoms. The characteristic symptom pattern occurring in the
      aftermath of traumatic events is called posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and includes
      functional impairment of the affected individuals. The investigators want to test whether
      Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is an effective tool in reducing trauma related symptoms in
      formerly abducted children and youths and former child soldiers, when applied by lay
      personnel.

    <intervention_name>Narrative Exposure Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is based on Testimony Therapy in combination with cognitive behavioural exposure techniques and elements of client-centered counselling. In cooperation with the therapist the clients can restore their autobiographic memories about their traumatic experiences. In this way fragmentary memories are transformed into a coherent narrative structure. This practice enables the processing of painful emotions and the construction of clear contingencies of dangerous and safe conditions, generally leading to significant emotional recovery. Therapeutic aims are the reduction of PTSD-Symptomload via activation of fear-network and habituation of fear and the placement of traumatic experiences in a reconstructed, detailed and consistent autobiography.
NET will be applied in eight sessions (90-120min/session) in a standardized, manualized manner.</description>

    <description>Missing time in educational life is one major issue for formerly abducted people. The Academic Counseling (AC) intervention is an active Control condition and improves English skills and works at the same time on concentration, learning and memory abilities. The clients will gain some of the abilities and skills they might have lost or developed weaknesses in due to their abduction.
AC will be applied in eight sessions (90-120min/session) in a standardized, manualized manner.</description>
