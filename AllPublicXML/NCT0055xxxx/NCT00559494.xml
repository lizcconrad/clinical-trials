  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While research in animal models of spinal cord injury have provided many promising insights,
      human studies have failed to produce effective therapies. We propose to investigate the drug
      Minocycline (a metalloproteinase inhibitor) for the treatment of spinal cord injured patients
      aiming to limit neurological injury and improve neurological outcome. This drug influences
      several secondary injury mechanisms implicated in spinal cord injury and has been effective
      in improving outcome after spinal cord injury in animal models. We also propose to examine
      the safety and feasibility of spinal cord perfusion pressure augmentation with a protocol of
      IV fluids and inotrope medications versus standard maintenance of mean arterial pressure in
      subjects who exhibit a decrease in perfusion pressure to less than 75 mmHg. The purpose of
      this pilot study is 1) to evaluate the feasibility of a clinical trial protocol for
      Minocycline in patients with acute spinal cord injury, and 2) to ensure adequate drug dosing
      and metabolic effect. After undergoing a process of informed consent, patients agreeing to
      participate in the study will be randomized to placebo or treatment groups in a double-blind
      fashion. Clinical neurological examinations, patient-reported quality of life, and functional
      independence categorization will be combined with serum and cerebrospinal fluid laboratory
      investigations to establish some of the pharmacological properties and the safety profile of
      this medication in this group of patients. In addition, patient tolerance to the dosing
      regimen will be assessed. The results of this study will provide the preliminary data
      necessary to plan for a larger prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical
      trial to assess efficacy and to further assess safety.
