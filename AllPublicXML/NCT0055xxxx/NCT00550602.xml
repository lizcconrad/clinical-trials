  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate respiratory symptoms and their impact in the quality
      of life and after treatment of the respiratory condition (tracheobronchomalacia - TBM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TBM is an abnormal collapse of the tracheal and bronchial walls. It is characterized by
      flaccidity of the supporting tracheal and bronchial structures and a significant reduction of
      airway diameter on expiration seen in the trachea and/or in the mainstem bronchi. Currently
      there is no available data on the efficacy of central airway stabilization for treating TBM.

      Our study would provide this important information and would establish the effect of central
      airway stabilization on symptoms, functional status, quality of life, lung function and
      exercise capacity in patients with symptomatic and severe TBM.
