      To report the short term anatomic and visual acuity response after intravitreal injection of
      bevacizumab (Avastin, Roche, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) in patients with choroidal
      neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a retrospective study of 500 eyes with choroidal neovascularization secondary to
      age-related macular degeneration who were treated with at least two (initial and one month
      after) intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab and had a follow-up of at least 2
      months. Patients underwent Snellen visual acuity testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      imaging and ophthalmoscopic examination at baseline and follow-up visits.
