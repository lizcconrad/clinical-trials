  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zactima will be used in this study to determine the highest dose that can be given safely as
      well as the side effects of Zactima when in combination with two FDA approved drugs;
      gemcitabine and capecitabine. This combination will be given to patients with advanced solid
      tumors. Once the highest dose of the combination has been determined, additional patients
      with biliary cancers (cholangiocarcinomas and gallbladder cancer) and locally advanced or
      metastatic pancreatic cancer will be treated at the highest determined dose for further
      studies.

      This phase I study will access a novel regimen using a multi-targeted anti-angiogenic agent
      which targets the tyrosine kinase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 and
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in combination with cytotoxic agents: gemcitabine and
      capecitabine. The rationale is based on observations that there is an additive / synergistic
      effect when cytotoxic agents are combined with angiogenesis inhibitors. There is also
      evidence that EGFR mediated signaling pathways are potent stimulators of VEGF production.
      Also the concept of dual targeting of tumor and endothelial cells may provide more
      encouraging results.

    <description>To evaluate the safety profile and determine the MTD dose of ZACTIMA in combination with Gemcitabine and Capecitabine in patients with advanced malignancies. Toxicity will be graded per Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) Version 3.0 and adverse event reporting for this study will be performed via Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS). All patients who receive any amount of the study drug will be evaluable for toxicity.</description>
