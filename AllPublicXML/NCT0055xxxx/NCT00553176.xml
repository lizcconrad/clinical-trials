  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term clinical, economic and humanistic
      outcomes of various treatment regimens, including infliximab, in Crohn's disease in real
      world medical practice.

    <textblock>
      The TREAT (The Crohn's Therapy, Resource, Evaluation, and Assessment Tool) registry is a
      prospective, observational, multicenter, long-term registry featuring clinical, economic, and
      humanistic measures characterizing the treatment of Crohn's disease. The physicians will
      track treatments and patient outcomes over at least a 5-year period. Physicians are expected
      to manage patients as they would under normal practice conditions. No predefined schedule of
      visits or medical procedures are required. Data are collected on a semi-annual basis by
      physicians documenting assessment of disease severity, medication use, and adverse events.
      Upon enrollment, patients complete a health assessment questionnaire. As this is an
      observational study, no study drugs are administered. Through the course of the Registry,
      analyses will be performed to support submissions to health authorities, and questions of
      academic interest.
