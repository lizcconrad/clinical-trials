  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the largest contributor to morbidity and mortality in the
      Western world and is associated with high-calorie diet, high body mass, and a variety of
      other factors. CHD can lead to myocardial infarction (MI) and other embolic events. In some
      areas such as France, though, a paradox of high-cholesterol diets but low CHD and MI
      incidence have been found. This paradox has been traced to the consumption of red wine.
      Further research suggests that components of the grapes used in red wine may be the source of
      the cardio-protective factors that have resulted in the French paradox. These components are
      also present in purple grape juice (PGJ). PGJ has been shown to have a variety of potential
      cardio-protective effects, including inhibition of platelet aggregation. Since PGJ does not
      contain alcohol it may provide an additional benefit by avoiding the physical and social
      implications of alcohol abuse. Since most of the research of PGJ has been in vitro, though,
      and the few studies in vivo have been in cross-over studies and over very short durations of
      7 to 14 days, additional research is required to determine whether the long-term consumption
      of PGJ is of additional and sustained benefit, similar to long-term use of red wine in
      France. The proposed study is a 2 arm randomized, controlled (double-blind) study of PGJ and
      a calorically-matching placebo drink in 100 healthy individuals.

      The study treatment period will be 90 days (13 weeks, or 3 months) and the treatment dose
      will be 7 mL/kg/day. The treatment dose is a standard dose previously worked out in other
      research and was used in a variety of other clinical research (27, 32). Study randomization
      will be performed in a double-blind fashion with study investigators and participants unaware
      of group assignment. Randomization order will be created using a randomized blocked design.
      After volunteer consent is provided, the clinical study coordinator will open a
      sequentially-numbered envelope containing the study group assignment and provide a 4 week
      supply of study beverage.

      Participants will be seen for follow-up study visits at approximately 4 week intervals after
      the baseline enrollment visit. Compliance with study treatment (PGJ or placebo) will be
      assessed by interview at visits 2, 3, and 4. At the conclusion of visits 2 and 3, a supply of
      study beverage will be provided to the participant for consumption during the ensuing 4
      weeks. Study beverage supplies remaining at the end of the 90-day study period will be
      donated to each participant.

      Platelet Aggregation testing will be performed by ThromboVision (Salt Lake City, UT) using
      multiple platelet agonists, including ADP, collagen/epinephrine, PMA, and TRAP. Each of these
      aggregation inducers target a separate platelet activation pathway.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The volunteer (male or non-pregnant female, any ethnicity) must be &gt; 18 years of age.

          2. The volunteer has no history of a physician diagnosis of atherosclerosis such as
             carotid, peripheral, or coronary artery disease (CAD).

          3. The volunteer has no history of a physician diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), MI,
             or stroke.

          4. The volunteer must sign a written informed consent, prior to the procedure, using a
             form that is approved by the local Institutional Review Board.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis if diabetes mellitus.

          2. The limitations for specific medications, supplements and food items are exceeded as
             follows:

        More than 1 normal dose of the following medications and/or supplements once a week during
        the 3 months prior to enrollment:

          -  aspirin • ibuprofen • fish-oil extracts

          -  antioxidants • vitamins

        More than 1 normal serving per week in the 3 months prior to enrollment:

          -  other grape juices • tea • wine

          -  beer • alcoholic drinks • grapes

        More than 5 servings per day in any combination in the 7 days (1 weeks prior to enrollment:

          -  non-grape juices • garlic • broccoli

          -  apples • any type of berries • onions Volunteer is pregnant or lactating at the time
             of enrollment.

        Secondary Exclusions:

          1. Use of any of the above listed items during the 12 week course of study treatment will
             be documented and excess use 3 times or more will result in an administrative
             withdrawal of the volunteer from the study prior to the measurement of the next
             monthly platelet aggregation laboratory values (although those values will be measured
             for exploratory evaluation and the participant will remain under treatment until the
             end of the 12 week period).

          2. Routine consumption of fruit juices, or of &gt;5 servings per day of referenced fruits or
             vegetables, will result in administrative withdrawal of the participant from the
             study's primary aim.

          3. Although it is unlikely the use of PGJ or look alike/ taste alike (placebo) beverage
             will harm the pregnant or lactating woman, the dietary restrictions placed on the
             participant for the duration of the study may conflict with dietary recommendations
             for pregnant or lactating women. Women of child bearing potential, therefore, will
             meet a secondary exclusion if they become pregnant.
