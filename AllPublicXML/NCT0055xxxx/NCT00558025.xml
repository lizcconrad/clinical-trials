    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial conducted in early Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are:

        -  To assess if patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) can be successfully switched
           (overnight switching) from Pramipexole (PPX) Immediate Release (IR) to Pramipexole
           Extended Release (ER). A successful switch at a specific visit is defined as no
           worsening of the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) parts II+III score by
           more than 15% from baseline and no drug-related adverse events leading to withdrawal;

        -  To establish if this successful switch can be obtained with or without dose-adaptation;

        -  To provide information about the conversion ratio (mg:mg) from Pramipexole IR to
           Pramipexole ER.
