  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-dose interleukin 2 (Proleukin, Novartis) (IL-2) is approved by the U.S Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer and is a standard
      treatment of this disease. At the present time, IL-2 is the only therapy for kidney cancer
      that can produce a remission of disease that lasts after treatment is completed. However,
      most patients who receive IL-2 do not benefit and all patients experience potentially
      dangerous side effects.

      Recent research has suggested that certain patients may respond better to IL-2 than others.
      The Cytokine Working Group is currently conducting a clinical trial that aims to identify and
      confirm this research and narrow the application of IL-2 to those patients most likely to
      benefit.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine, in a prospective fashion, if the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for
           patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and &quot;good&quot; pathologic predictive features
           is significantly higher than a historical, unselected patient population.

      Secondary

        -  To determine, in a prospective fashion, the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients
           with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and &quot;poor&quot; pathologic predictive features and to
           compare this response rate to the response rate of patients with &quot;good&quot; pathologic
           predictive features.

        -  To determine if components of other predictive and prognostic models (e.g MSKCI or UCLA
           criteria) can help to further define the optimal population to receive high-dose IL2 for
           metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

        -  To identify features of the baseline immune function (arginine, arginase, T cell zeta
           chain) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that are associated with
           response to high-dose IL-2.

        -  To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated with
           high-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapy
           to those who will benefit the most.

    <measure>Objective Response in ISM Good Risk Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and during weeks 8 and 12 of each course. Participants received up to 3 courses of 12 weeks duration each. Median (range) days on treatment: 20 (1-262).</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on treatment based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. [Miller et al. Cancer 1981] Per WHO, evaluation of tumor measurements of measurable lesions centers on the percent change from baseline in the sum of the perpendicular diameters. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all clinical and laboratory evidence of disease; Partial Response (PR) is a &gt;/= 50% decrease. PR status also requires no simultaneous increase in the size of any metastatic lesion, absence of one or more new metastatic lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. CR and PR status needs confirmation within 4 weeks. Response status was determined by investigator assessment of radiographs.</description>

One course generally consisted of 5 days of treatment, 9 days of rest, 5 more days of treatment, and 9 weeks of rest, followed by up to two additional courses of HD IL2 for patients who benefited and tolerated most of the planned IL2 doses. A treatment delay of up to 4 weeks was allowed for resolution of side effects between courses. Patients were eligible to receive a maximum of three courses of treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma that is metastatic or
             unresectable.

          -  If patients have measurable disease restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic
             nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.

          -  Patients must provide access to tissue blocks containing adequate tumor for
             interpretation and analysis.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease.

          -  Patients must have good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1; Karnofsky PS 100-80%).

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function.

          -  Patients must have no contraindication of vasopressor agents.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received systemic therapy for metastatic disease.

          -  Patients with organ allografts.

          -  Patients who require or are likely to require systemic corticosteroid therapy for
             intercurrent illness.

          -  Patients with any significant medical disease other than the malignancy (e.g. COPD,
             patients with ascites or pleural effusions), which in the opinion of the investigator
             would significantly increase the risk of immunotherapy.

          -  Patients with a history of another malignancy within the past 5 years other than
             surgically cured non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma-in-situ or Stage I carcinoma of
             the cervix.

          <description>Participants received high-dose (HD) IL2, 600,000 IU/kg/dose (Prometheus Laboratories Inc.) i.v. every 8 hours for 5 days (maximum of 14 doses) beginning on day 1 and again on day 15. One course generally consisted of 5 days of treatment, 9 days of rest, 5 more days of treatment, and 9 weeks of rest, followed by up to two additional courses of HD IL2 for patients who benefited and tolerated most of the planned IL2 doses. A treatment delay of up to 4 weeks was allowed for resolution of side effects between courses. Patients were eligible to receive a maximum of three courses of treatment.</description>

        <title>Objective Response in ISM Good Risk Group</title>
        <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on treatment based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. [Miller et al. Cancer 1981] Per WHO, evaluation of tumor measurements of measurable lesions centers on the percent change from baseline in the sum of the perpendicular diameters. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all clinical and laboratory evidence of disease; Partial Response (PR) is a &gt;/= 50% decrease.

        <title>Objective Response Rate by UCLA SANI Score</title>
        <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on treatment based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. [Miller et al. Cancer 1981] Per WHO, evaluation of tumor measurements of measurable lesions centers on the percent change from baseline in the sum of the perpendicular diameters. Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all clinical and laboratory evidence of disease; Partial Response (PR) is a &gt;/= 50% decrease. PR status also requires no simultaneous increase in the size of any metastatic lesion, absence of one or more new metastatic lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. CR and PR status needs confirmation within 4 weeks. Response status was determined by independent assessment of radiographs.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and during weeks 8 and 12 of each course. Participants received up to 3 courses of 12 weeks duration each. Median (range) days on treatment: 20 (1-262).</time_frame>

        <description>Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from treatment start to date of disease progression (PD) or death. Per WHO criteria: PD is a &gt;/=25% increase in the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions. Further, PD is the appearance of one or more new metastatic lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Participants who were event-free were censored at the date of their last disease evaluation.</description>
