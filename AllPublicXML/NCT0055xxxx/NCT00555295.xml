      Laparoscopic procedures for Colorectal Carcinoma are taking place in the modern era of
      surgery, It was not proven yet to show pure advantage over the open colectomies.

      These Procedures require highly skilled stuff with long learning curve, Financial
      sources,Increasing operation length.

      This retrospective study intends to show that the outcome of the overall survival is better
      in Laparoscopic patients.

      All data about patients who had laparoscopic colectomies due to carcinoma in Surgery A
      department in Souraski Medical Center was recorded prospectively since the operation day till
      discharge.

      The retrospective follow up will be collected from the outpatient clinic, the Oncology clinic
      and by questionnare to the patients.

      We wish to show that patients who were operated laparoscopy have better survival, better
      quality of life postoperatively.
