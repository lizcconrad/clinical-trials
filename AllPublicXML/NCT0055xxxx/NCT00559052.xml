  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EPI leading to maldigestion is a frequent finding in many diseases of the pancreas, such as
      chronic pancreatitis (CP). Steatorrhea is the most important digestive manifestation in EPI.
      The current treatment of EPI includes enzyme supplementation with porcine pancreatic enzyme
      concentrate, consisting mainly of lipase, amylase and protease. An enzyme preparation able to
      deliver appropriate enzyme levels to the duodenum instead of the mid gut or distal small
      bowel, would appear to be clinically efficacious for the treatment of steatorrhea in subjects
      with CP suffering from EPI.

      Day of screening: Subjects will undergo screening procedures prior to entry into the study.

      Day 0: Subjects will be admitted to the facility. Day 1: Subjects will undergo a first
      perfusion/aspiration procedure. Day 2: Subjects will rest. Day 3: Subjects will undergo a
      second perfusion/aspiration procedure. Day 4: Subjects will be discharged.
