  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NIDCAP based developmental care is a method of looking after preterm infants that is guided
      by the infant's behavioural cues, and that actively involves parents in the care of their
      infant. There is limited evidence that outcomes for infants are improved if they receive
      NIDCAP based care. This study evaluates the effects of introducing NIDCAP based care to a
      level III neonatal intensive care unit, in the post - surfactant era, and also evaluates its
      effects on developmental outcomes at age 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This RCT differs from previous trials in that it is conducted in the post - surfactant era
      [an intervention that has greatly changed clinical neonatology]. The number of infants
      required to demonstrate a clinically relevant outcome [Length of Hospital Stay] has been
      calculated a priori. The infants will be tracked for outcome data after transfer to
      peripheral nurseries [a reality in today's healthcare environment], allowing generalisability
      of results to other high risk, referral Neonatal Intensive Care units. Neurodevelopmental
      outcomes will be evaluated at 18 months; [these data are sparse from previous studies]. This
      RCT will therefore demonstrate whether NIDCAP based care is truly an effective intervention
      for the very low birth weight infant.

    <description>Infants in the intervention arm will receive care in the NICU by nursing staff who have received basic education in NIDCAP - based developmental care. They will also have NIDCAP behavioural observations performed by NIDCAP - Certified staff [this includes 3 of the investigators], at intervals during their stay at the study site NICU. These behavioural observations form the basis for behaviourally guided &quot;baby -friendly&quot; care, so that the timing and pace of caregiving is synchronised to the infant's readiness. Parents are actively encouraged to become the infant's primary caregiver in the NICU.</description>
