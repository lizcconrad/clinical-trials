  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive falls prevention programs have been shown to be effective in reducing falls;
      however, a number of practical programs, based in community setting have not been successful
      at reducing rate of falls. The purpose of this study was to test, in a randomized, controlled
      trial, the efficacy of this intermediate-intensity, individual, multifactorial model to
      reduce falls. It was hypothesized that more contacts would lead to greater adherence and
      efficacy in reducing falls.

    <description>The intervention model is of a community-based multifactorial intervention that links participants to existing medical care and service networks. The intervention used an algorithm based on the University of Wisconsin Falls Prevention Clinic, designed to identify predisposing factors for falls; induce risk reduction changes in medical conditions, medications, behavior, physical status, and home environment through recommendations to participants and their physicians; and make sure these changes are long-lasting through follow-up and linkages to other care networks.</description>
