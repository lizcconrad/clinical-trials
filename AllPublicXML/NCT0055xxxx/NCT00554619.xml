    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of long-term administration of
      GSK1325760A in patients with PAH.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate long-term administration of
      GSK1325760A on:

        -  Improvement in exercise capacity (six-minutes walk distance: 6MWD), change in WHO
           Functional Classification and time to clinical worsening of PAH

        -  Change in the Borg Dyspnea Index (assessed immediately following the six-minute walk
           test [6MWT])

        -  Change in plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels

        -  Cardiopulmonary hemodynamics parameters (as measured by echocardiography)

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>For 140.57 weeks at maximum, starting from Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events Categorized by Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>For 140.57 weeks at maximum, starting from Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of adverse events was assessed by the investigator; events were assigned to one of the following categories: mild, an event that was easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities; moderate, an event that was sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities; and severe, an event that prevented normal everyday activities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Six Minutes Walk Distance (6MWD) at Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, and 156</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, and 156</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline was calculated as each value at Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, and 156 minus the baseline value. 6MWD was measured by a 6-minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a participant can walk in a period of 6 minutes. Imputation technique was last observation carried forward, which was used in an attempt to compensate for missing data. For each participant, missing values were replaced with the last observed value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Borg Dyspnea Index (BDI) at Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, and Withdrawal/Completion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, and Withdrawal/Completion (up to Week 159.85)</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI was calculated by using a 10-point scale (0 = None, 10 = Maximum) and indicates the degree of breathlessness after completion of the 6-minute walk test. The BDI scale was assessed by each participant. Change from baseline was calculated as each value at Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, and Withdrawal/Completion minus the baseline value. Observed data analysis (no imputation technique).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline in Their World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Classification (FC) at Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, and Withdrawal/Completion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, 156, and Withdrawal/Completion (up to Week 164.14)</time_frame>
    <description>There are four grades for the WHO FC (Class I = none, Class IV = most severe). The WHO FC indicates the severity of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association classification. It was assessed by the investigator. Observed data analysis (no imputation technique).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Event, as an Assessment of Time to Clinical Worsening of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH), Assessed as the First Occurrence of a Particular Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 164.14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to clinical worsening was defined as the time from baseline to the first occurrence of death, lung transplantation, hospitalization for PAH treatment, atrial septostomy (a surgical procedure in which a small hole is made in the wall between the left and right atria of the heart), or study discontinuation due to change to other PAH treatment. Time to clinical worsening was measured as the number of participants who experienced these events up to 164.14 weeks.</description>

    <description>mPAP is a measure of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics (echocardiography).

        <description>Change from baseline was calculated as each value at Weeks 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, and 156 minus the baseline value. 6MWD was measured by a 6-minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a participant can walk in a period of 6 minutes. Imputation technique was last observation carried forward, which was used in an attempt to compensate for missing data. For each participant, missing values were replaced with the last observed value.</description>
