  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) Mircera when
      administered for the maintenance of hemoglobin (Hb) levels in participants with chronic renal
      anemia. Individuals currently receiving maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa or
      darbepoetin alfa will receive monthly injections of Mircera, with the starting dose (120,
      200, or 360 micrograms [mcg] IV injection) derived from the dose of epoetin alfa or
      darbepoetin alfa they were receiving in the week preceding study start.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Average Hb Within Plus/Minus (±) 1 g/dL of Reference Hb and Within Target Range During the Efficacy Evaluation Period (EEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1,and 0; pre-dose (0 hours) during Weeks 18, 20, 22, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment stability assessment (Weeks -4 to 0). During the EEP (Weeks 17 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. The average Hb during the EEP was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The percentage of participants who had average Hb during the EEP in the target range of 10.5 to 12.5 g/dL and within ±1 g/dL of their individual reference Hb was determined as the primary endpoint. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>

    <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment stability assessment (Weeks -4 to 0). During the EEP (Weeks 17 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. The average Hb during the EEP was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The mean change in Hb value between reference (i.e., &quot;Baseline&quot;) Hb and the EEP average Hb was calculated and expressed in g/dL.</description>

    <description>During the EEP (Weeks 17 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with CERA/Mircera. The percentage of participants who maintained each single Hb measurement in the target range of 10.5 to 12.5 g/dL was determined. The 95% CI was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>

    <measure>Mean Time Spent in the Target Range for Hb During the EEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0 hours) during Weeks 18, 20, 22, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>During the EEP (Weeks 17 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. Time spent in the target range of 10.5 to 12.5 g/dL was defined as time from first on-target Hb to time of last known on-target Hb, as collected during the EEP. Time spent in the target range was averaged among all participants and expressed in days.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Required Any Dose Adjustment of Mircera/CERA During the Dose Titration Period (DTP) and EEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Study drug administration occurred monthly during the DTP (Weeks 0 to 16), which began with a pre-specified dose of Mircera/CERA according to the dose of ESA administered during Week -1. Subsequent doses could be adjusted throughout the study including during the EEP (Weeks 17 to 24) on the basis of Hb levels or other modification criteria. The percentage of participants who required a dose adjustment for any reason was calculated during the DTP and EEP.</description>

    <description>The number of participants who were prematurely withdrawn from the study to receive a blood transfusion during treatment, including the DTP (Weeks 0 and 16) and/or EEP (Weeks 17 to 24), was reported.</description>

    <description>Participants with chronic renal anemia who have been previously treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy will receive IV Mircera every 4 weeks for a total of 24 weeks in this single-arm study. The first dose of 120, 200, or 360 mcg will be determined by the dose of ESA received prior to administration of study treatment. Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain Hb concentrations within target of 10.5 and 12.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL).</description>

        <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment stability assessment (Weeks -4 to 0). During the EEP (Weeks 17 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. The average Hb during the EEP was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The percentage of participants who had average Hb during the EEP in the target range of 10.5 to 12.5 g/dL and within ±1 g/dL of their individual reference Hb was determined as the primary endpoint. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>

          <description>Participants with chronic renal anemia who were previously treated with ESA therapy received intravenous Mircera/CERA, every 4 weeks for a total of 24 weeks in this single-arm study. The first dose of 120, 200, or 360 mcg was based upon the dose of ESA received prior to administration of study treatment, while subsequent doses were adjusted to maintain Hb concentrations within target of 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL.</description>
