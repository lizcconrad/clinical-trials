      This study is planned to objectively assess the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine
      maintenance therapy after symptoms of mood episode had been stabilised by open-label
      treatment with lamotrigine alone or in combination with other psychotropic medication in
      patients with bipolar I disorder.

          <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item questionnaire that detects change and measures illness severity. Individual items are rated on a scale of 0-4, 0-3, and 0-2 with the total HAMD-17 score ranging from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill). Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 26/Withdrawal value minus the baseline value (at the time of randomization).</description>

        <description>The number of participants with intervention for a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode was measured. The necessity of the intervention was determined by the Investigator’s discretion. This outcome measure was added post-hoc because no data are being reported for the Placebo or Lamotrigine groups regarding time to intervention for manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode (TIMan). Data from participants who had not met TIMan were defined as censored.</description>
