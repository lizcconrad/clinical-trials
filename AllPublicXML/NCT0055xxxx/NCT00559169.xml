  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in 3 epilepsy patients have refractory seizures. This drug resistance is likely related
      to the over expression of multidrug resistance proteins (MDR). Progesterone is a known
      inhibitor of MDRs and the low level of this hormone during the menstrual cycle may exacerbate
      seizures, perhaps explaining catamenial epilepsy; i.e. seizures occurring during the
      menstrual cycle. Verapamil suppresses seizures in animal models of epilepsy perhaps by
      inhibiting MDRs and thus may help patients with refractory seizures. If the study shows
      improved seizure control, the results will help establish the role of MDRs in refractory
      epilepsy.
