  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the blood levels of a drug (conjugated
      estrogens) in the body from one dosage form compared to another. The four formulations of the
      study drug that eligible participants will receive will contain the same amounts of the same
      medications. In addition, information will also be obtained regarding the safety and
      tolerability of the formulations given to healthy postmenopausal women.
