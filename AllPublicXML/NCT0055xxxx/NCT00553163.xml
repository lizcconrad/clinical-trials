      There is increasing evidence that worsening of ulcerative colitis (UC) can be provoked by
      psychological stresses. As yet, there have been no proper scientific studies to find out
      whether stress reduction can improve the course of UC. Hypnotherapy is a technique by which a
      practitioner induces a temporary trance-like state in patients: while they are in this state,
      the practitioner uses suggestion to induce relaxation as well as beneficial modification of
      the way in which the patient experiences the gut working. In previous studies in our lab, we
      have shown that a single 50 minute session of hypnosis can reduce special indicators of
      inflammation both in the blood-stream and in the lining of the lower bowel (rectum). Further
      more, in earlier work by others, hypnosis has been shown to be effective in the treatment of
      patients with irritable bowel syndrome, duodenal ulcer and indigestion unassociated with
      ulcers.

      Many patients with UC need to take the immunosuppressive drug, azathioprine, in addition to a
      5ASA drug, to keep their disease under control. While azathioprine is usually effective in
      maintaining remission of UC, it does require regular drug checks and carries the risk of
      possible side-effects. We now plan to undertake a study of hypnotherapy to see whether it can
      prevent relapse (worsening) of UC in patients who normally need to take azathioprine to keep
      their UC inactive. To do this, we shall ask 66 patients who agree to participate in the trial
      to stop their azathioprine. They will then be allocated to receive either gut-focussed
      hypnotherapy (44 patients) or, as a control, non-emotive educational sessions (22 patients)
      once a month for 3 months, with intervening self-hypnosis daily in the active arm. We shall
      then record the numbers of patients in each group who develop relapse of their UC after 6
      months and after a year. We shall diagnose relapse from patients' own diaries recording
      diarrhoea and bleeding, and by sigmoidoscopy. As part of these studies, we shall also do
      particular blood tests and take specimens from the lining of the rectum during the
      sigmoidoscopy to assess by special laboratory testing how hypnotherapy might be working to
      reduce inflammation in the bowel.

      It is hoped that this clinical trial will identify a new drug-free way of reducing the
      chances of relapse in patients with UC. It should also shed further light on the ways in
      which the brain can affect the function of the inflamed bowel

      SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACT There is increasing evidence that relapse of ulcerative colitis (UC) can
      be provoked by psychological stress. As yet, there have been no proper scientific studies to
      find out whether stress reduction can improve the course of UC. Hypnotherapy is a technique
      by which a practitioner induces a temporary trance-like state in patients: while they are in
      this state, the practitioner uses suggestion to induce relaxation as well as beneficial
      modification of the way in which the patient experiences the gut working. In previous studies
      in our lab, we have shown that a single session of hypnosis can reduce measures of
      inflammation at both systemic and rectal mucosal levels. Thus, 50min of gut-focussed hypnosis
      reduced serum interleukin-6 (IL6) and non-killer (NK) cell numbers in circulating blood, as
      well as rectal mucosal release of interleukin-13 (IL13), substance P and histamine.
      Furthermore, in earlier work by others, hypnosis has been shown to be effective in the
      treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome, duodenal ulcer and indigestion
      unassociated with ulcers.

      Many patients with UC need to take the immunosuppressive, azathioprine, in addition to a
      5ASA, to keep their disease in remission. While azathioprine is usually effective in
      maintaining remission of UC, it does require regular drug checks and carries the risk of
      possible side-effects. We now plan to undertake a study of hypnotherapy to see whether it can
      prevent relapse of UC in patients who normally need to take azathioprine to keep their UC
      inactive. To do this, we shall ask 66 patients who agree to participate in the trial to stop
      their azathioprine. They will then be allocated to receive either gut-focussed hypnotherapy
      (44 patients) or, as a control, non-emotive educational sessions (22 patients) once a month
      for 3 months, with intervening self-hypnosis daily in the active arm. We shall then record
      relapse rates in each group after 6 months and at 1 year. We shall diagnose relapse from
      patients' diaries recording the Simple Clinical Activity Index, and by Baron score &gt;1 at
      sigmoidoscopy. We shall also measure routine blood tests (including CRP), serum IL6 and IL13
      concentrations, as well as rectal mucosal release of substance P, tumour necrosis factor
      (TNFα), IL13 and histamine at 0, 1 month and 1 year to assess how hypnotherapy might reduce
      mucosal inflammation.

      It is hoped that this clinical trial will identify a new drug-free way of reducing the
      chances of relapse in patients with UC withdrawing from treatment with azathioprine. It
      should also shed further light on the ways in which the brain affects the function of the
      inflamed bowel.
