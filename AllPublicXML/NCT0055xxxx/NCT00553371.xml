      RATIONALE: Learning about long-term effects in patients with testicular cancer may help
      doctors plan better treatment and follow-up care.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is using CT scans to follow patients who have been treated for
      metastatic testicular cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the frequency of relapse or recurrent abnormalities detected by CT scan in
           patients on long-term follow-up for metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumour (NSGCT).

        -  To assess the utility of CT scan-assessment in these patients.

        -  To assess the prognostic factors predictive of late relapse in NSGCT.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are screened by CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for detectable
      abnormalities or indications of late relapse. Scans are classified as positive or negative,
      according to standard CT criteria, by a radiologist with expertise in testicular cancer
      imaging. Patients with negative scans are followed yearly by clinical examination and tumor
      marker assessment, and every 5 years by CT imaging. Additional follow-up is performed at the
      discretion of the attending physician. Patients with positive scans undergo confirmation of
      relapse, whenever possible, by surgical excision or biopsy and treatment is initiated
      according to best clinical practice. If the follow-up scan is equivocal, patients are advised
      to have a follow-up scan of the affected region in 6 months.
