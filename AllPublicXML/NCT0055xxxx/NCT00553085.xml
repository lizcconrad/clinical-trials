      Project summary Anxiety disorders (AD's) in childhood are common and may cause great
      suffering.Childhood AD's may persist into adulthood and knowledge of important risk factors
      for development and maintenance of these disorders is essential.The development of AD's is
      due to a complex interaction between biological and environmental factors.This study will
      examine the relationship between AD's and two biological risk factors:1.Neurodevelopmental
      delays/disorders (NDD`S) in motor and cognitive function and 2.Temperament/personality.To
      date a few studies have consistently found that motor impairment is associated with childhood
      anxiety and predicts persistent anxiety in adolescence.The association between AD's and NDD's
      in cognitive functions such as language and attention is far less studied. In contrast, there
      is a huge research literature on temperament as a risk factor for AD's.The temperamental
      trait &quot;behavioural inhibition&quot; has been shown to be particularly associated with
      AD's.However, very few studies have examined the interplay between NDD's, temperament and
      anxiety.The study is a clinical case-control study of children aged 7-13 years with AD's
      referred to three different out-patient clinics.The participants will be assessed by
      diagnostic interviews, neuropsychological tests and temperament/personality
      instruments.Comparison groups are:1.children with ADHD (to compare AD's with another mental
      disorder related to NDD's) and 2.Non-referred children without a mental disorder. Follow-up
      at 6 months,1 and 5 years.A pilot study at two of the three out-patient clinics to be
      included,showed a sufficient sample size.Anticipated implications of the study include
      increased knowledge of biological risk factors and of latent neurological brain correlates,as
      well as treatment implications.Children with NDD's are often met with demands they cannot
      cope with due to their neurodevelopmental immaturity.To adjust the demands to the child's
      actual level of functioning is important.
