  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Mircera and subcutaneous
      darbepoetin in the treatment of renal anemia in participants with chronic kidney disease who
      are not on dialysis and not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA). Participants
      will be randomized to receive either Mircera once every 4 weeks, at a starting dose of 1.2
      micrograms/kilogram (mcg/kg), or darbepoetin alfa once weekly, at a starting dose of 0.45
      mcg/kg (or once every two weeks, 0.75 mcg/kg). The anticipated time on study treatment is
      3-12 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Hemoglobin (Hb) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Hb response was an observed increase in Hb greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL) from baseline and an Hb concentration &gt;= 10.0 g/dL before the end of the study without red blood cells (RBC) transfusion before response.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hemoglobin (Hb) Concentration Between Baseline and Evaluation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (measurements at Week -2, Week -1 and Day 1) and Evaluation Period (Week 22, Week 24, Week 26, Week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>A time adjusted average baseline Hb concentration was calculated using the trapezoid rule from all available Hb measurements taken during the baseline period. The average evaluation period Hb concentration for each individual was calculated using the same method, from all their available measurements taken during the 2 month evaluation period (Week 21 to 28). The change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation period was calculated by subtracting the baseline Hb from the evaluation period Hb. All blood samples for Hb measurements were taken prior to study drug administration.</description>

    <measure>Hemoglobin (Hb) Concentration Over the Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, and final visit (Week 29)</time_frame>
    <description>The hemoglobin concentration was measured in g/dL every 2 weeks and at final visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Hemoglobin Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Hb response is defined as the number of study days until the first occurrence of an Hb response. Participants without events were censored at the time of evaluation. Median and 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis. Hb response was an observed increase in Hb &gt;=1.0 g/dL from baseline and an Hb concentration &gt;= 10.0 g/dL before the end of the study without RBC transfusion before response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who received RBC transfusions during the titration and evaluation periods were reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Had at Least 1 Hemoglobin Value Exceeding 12.0 g/dL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants having at least one Hb value greater than (&gt;) 12 g/dL during the first 8 weeks of the study was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Stable Hemoglobin Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was defined as having achieved a stable Hb response, if at least 75 percent (%) of the scheduled Hb values were between 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL and &gt;=1.0 g/dL from baseline for any 8-week time period, regardless of the requirement for dose adjustment for Hb maintenance. Achievement of stable response was determined using a moving 8-week time window, moving forward by 14 days in each iteration starting at Day 15, searching to see if the following conditions were met: 1) At least 3 scheduled Hb values (75% of the scheduled Hb values) in any 8-week time window were &gt;=1.0 g/dL from baseline (as calculated above) and within the range of 10.0 g/dL to 12.0 g/dL. 2). There were at least 3 recorded Hb values within the time window.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Required Dose Adjustments to Achieve a Stabilized Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of dose adjustments needed to achieve stabilized response was calculated from Day 1 until the first 8-week time window in which response was achieved. A participant was defined as having achieved a stable Hb response, if at least 75% of the scheduled Hb values were between 10.0 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL and &gt;=1.0 g/dL from baseline for any 8-week time period, regardless of the requirement for dose adjustment for Hb maintenance. Achievement of stable response was determined using a moving 8-week time window, moving forward by 14 days in each iteration starting at Day 15, searching to see if the following conditions were met: 1) At least 3 scheduled Hb values (75% of the scheduled Hb values) in any 8-week time window were &gt;=1.0 g/dL from baseline (as calculated above) and within the range of 10.0 g/dL to 12.0 g/dL. 2) There were at least 3 recorded Hb values within the time window.</description>

        <description>A time adjusted average baseline Hb concentration was calculated using the trapezoid rule from all available Hb measurements taken during the baseline period. The average evaluation period Hb concentration for each individual was calculated using the same method, from all their available measurements taken during the 2 month evaluation period (Week 21 to 28). The change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation period was calculated by subtracting the baseline Hb from the evaluation period Hb. All blood samples for Hb measurements were taken prior to study drug administration.</description>

Achievement of stable response was determined using a moving 8-week time window, moving forward by 14 days in each iteration starting at Day 15, searching to see if the following conditions were met: 1) At least 3 scheduled Hb values (75% of the scheduled Hb values) in any 8-week time window were &gt;=1.0 g/dL from baseline (as calculated above) and within the range of 10.0 g/dL to 12.0 g/dL. 2).
