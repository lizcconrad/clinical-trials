      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works in treating
      young patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. The purpose of this study is to improve the outcome of
      adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The objectives of the
      study are described below.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To describe the outcomes (i.e., complete response rate, event-free survival,
           disease-free survival [DFS], and overall survival [OS]) of adolescents and young adults
           with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with a pediatric
           chemotherapy regimen by adult hematologists/oncologists at multiple sites.

        -  To explore the feasibility of extending the &quot;pediatric approach&quot; to adult patients up to
           40 years of age.

        -  To estimate the DFS and OS of these patients.

        -  To describe the toxicities observed in these patients.

        -  To compare the outcomes of patients treated on this protocol with appropriate similar
           patients (by age and disease characteristics) treated by pediatric oncologists on
           protocol COG-AALL0232.

        -  To evaluate the adherence of adult hematologists/oncologists and their patients to a
           &quot;pediatric&quot; ALL treatment regimen and identify reasons for variances.

        -  To analyze and describe the outcomes of patients treated on this study according to
           pretreatment characteristics such as age, gender, white blood cell count, other
           hematologic parameters, blood chemistry, immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular
           genetic characteristics, and treatment variables such as treatment site (academic center
           or community), and protocol adherence.

        -  To analyze and describe the outcomes of patients treated on this study according to
           baseline psychosocial characteristics, demographics, and family support.

      The courses of treatment for the research study are described below.

        -  Remission induction therapy: Patients receive intrathecal (IT) cytarabine on day 1;
           vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; prednisone IV or orally twice daily on days
           1-28; daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; pegaspargase IV or
           intramuscularly (IM) on day 4 or 5 or 6; and IT methotrexate on days 8 and 29*. Patients
           undergo bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and biopsy on day 29 to assess induction response and
           minimal residual disease status. Patients with M1 marrow (&lt; 1% lymphoblasts) proceed to
           remission consolidation therapy. Patients with M2 marrow (&gt; 5% but &lt; 25% lymphoblasts)
           proceed to extended remission induction therapy. Patients with M3 marrow are removed
           from protocol therapy.

      NOTE: *Patients with CNS3 disease also receive IT methotrexate on days 15 and 22.

        -  Extended remission induction therapy: Patients receive prednisone IV or orally twice
           daily on days 1-14; vincristine IV on days 1 and 8; pegaspargase IM or IV on day 4 or 5
           or 6; and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1. Patients undergo BMA and biopsy on day
           15. Patients with M1 marrow proceed to remission consolidation therapy. Patients with M2
           or M3 bone marrow are removed from protocol therapy.

        -  Remission consolidation therapy: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 1 and 29;
           cytarabine IV or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-4, 8-11, 29-32, and 36-39; oral
           mercaptopurine on days 1-14 and 29-42; vincristine IV on days 15, 22, 43, and 50;
           pegaspargase IM or IV on days 15 and 43; and IT methotrexate on days 1, 8, 15*, and 22*.
           Once blood counts recover, patients proceed to interim maintenance therapy.

      NOTE: *Patients with CNS3 disease do not receive IT methotrexate on days 15 and 22.

        -  Interim maintenance therapy: Patients receive vincristine IV and methotrexate (Capizzi
           methotrexate) IV on days 1, 11, 21, 31, and 41; pegaspargase IM or IV on days 2 and 22;
           and IT methotrexate on days 1 and 31. Once blood counts recover (ANC ≥ 750/mm^3 and
           platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm^3), patients proceed to delayed intensification therapy.

        -  Delayed intensification therapy: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 43,
           and 50; dexamethasone IV or orally twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21; doxorubicin
           hydrochloride IV on days 1, 8, and 15; pegaspargase IM or IV on day 4 or 5 or 6 AND day
           43; cyclophosphamide IV on day 29; cytarabine IV or SC on days 29-32 and 36-39; oral
           thioguanine on days 29-42; and IT methotrexate on days 1, 29, and 36. Once blood counts
           recover, patients proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 29, and 57;
           dexamethasone IV or orally twice daily on days 1-5, 29-33, and 57-61; mercaptopurine
           orally on days 1-84; IT methotrexate on day 1*; and oral methotrexate on days 8, 15, 22,
           29**, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78.

      Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for 2 years from the start of interim maintenance (for
      female patients) or 3 years from the start of interim maintenance (for male patients).

      NOTE: *IT methotrexate is also given on day 29 of the first 4 courses of maintenance therapy.

      NOTE: **Oral methotrexate is held on day 29 of the first 4 courses of maintenance therapy
      (when IT methotrexate is given).

        -  Radiotherapy: During the first course of maintenance therapy, patients with testicular
           disease undergo concurrent radiotherapy to the testes 5 days a week for 2.5 weeks (total
           dose 2400 cGy given in 12 daily fractions); patients with CNS3 disease undergo
           concurrent cranial radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2 weeks (total dose of 1800 cGy given
           in 10 daily fractions); and patients with T-cell ALL undergo concurrent cranial
           radiotherapy (total dose of 2400 cGy given in 10 daily fractions) 5 days a week for 2
           weeks.

      Patients may complete surveys at the end of courses 1, 2, and 4, at the end of all protocol
      treatment, and at 6 and 18 months after the end of all protocol treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 1-3 months for 3 years and
      then every 6 months for 7 years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligibility Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis

               1. Newly diagnosed patients with either B-precursor or T-precursor acute
                  lymphoblastic leukemia (WHO criteria). Burkitt type leukemia as defined per
                  protocol is not eligible. Patients known to have Ph+ ALL at time of diagnosis are
                  not eligible.

               2. CALGB patients entered on CALGB 10403 who are later found to meet the following
                  criteria for Ph+ ALL should have treatment on this trial discontinued and should
                  be encouraged to enroll on CALGB 10001 or its successor trial:

                    -  BCR-ABL fusion transcript determined by FISH or RT-PCR

                    -  t(9;22)(q34;q11) or variant determined by cytogenetics

             Non-CALGB study participants who are later found to be Ph+ should have treatment on
             this trial discontinued and should be encouraged to enroll on an appropriate clinical
             trial specifically designed for Ph+ ALL.

          2. Age: 16 - 39 years

          3. ECOG Performance Status 0-2

          4. Patients with Down Syndrome are excluded from this study due to the likelihood of
             excessive toxicity resulting. These patients should be treated in consultation with a
             pediatric oncologist.

          5. Prior Therapy - No prior therapy except for limited treatment with corticosteroids or
             hydroxyurea and a single dose of intrathecal cytarabine.

               1. No prior therapy for acute leukemia except emergency therapy (corticosteroids or
                  hydroxyurea) for blast cell crisis, superior vena cava syndrome, or renal failure
                  due to leukemic infiltration of the kidneys. When indicated, leukapheresis or
                  exchange transfusion is recommended to reduce the WBC.

               2. Single-dose intrathecal cytarabine is allowed prior to registration or prior to
                  initiation of systemic therapy for patient convenience. This is usually done at
                  the time of the diagnostic bone marrow or venous line placement to avoid a second
                  lumbar puncture. Systemic chemotherapy must begin within 72 hours of this
                  intrathecal therapy.

               3. Patients receiving prior steroid therapy are eligible for study. The dose and
                  duration of previous steroid therapy should be carefully documented on case
                  report forms.
