      As the principal objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      treatment measuring the changes in a symptom score, the patient will be asked to fill in a
      patient diary. This diary will evaluate the week before the patient comes back to receive the
      treatment. Nose (sneeze, blockage and running), eye (itching, redness and swelling) and chest
      (breathlessness, wheeze, chest tightness), are scored on a scale from The patient will be
      instructed to daily assess each one of the symptoms, recording them on an individual symptoms
      follow-up diary.

      The study drug is a sublingual immunotherapy (vaccine) with allergenic extract of grass
      pollen (Lolium perenne (50%) + Cynodon dactylon (50%)). Sublingual immunotherapy has been
      available on the European market to treat patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis
      (itching, sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose) for many years. In this study it will be used as
      drops under the tongue. At the beginning of the study, you will be given a card that
      documents that you are taking part. Please carry this with you at all times, in case
      treatment is necessary at another location. The drops will be given at two doses. The drops
      are held under the tongue for 2 minutes prior to swallowing.Sublingual Immunotherapy has been
      shown to be safe and effective in reducing the symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis
      (nasal allergy and allergy of the eyes).
