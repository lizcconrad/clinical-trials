      The purpose of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of this Differential Wraparound
      model, in 5 Children's Aid Societies within Hamilton-Niagara Region, in preventing
      maltreatment cases from either becoming ongoing protection cases, or the children ending up
      in out-of-home of out-of community placements, as well as reducing the amount of time in
      Children's Aid Society care as compared to usual Children's Aid Society risk assessment and
      protection service alone.

    <textblock>
      The number of children in child welfare care has increased from 10,000 in the early 1990s to
      over 18,000. Ontario spends over $1.1 billion a year on direct child welfare services, more
      than twice as much as spent in the late 1990s, with the majority of these resources spent on
      investigation instead of treatment. In response to this situation, Differential Response
      models, sometimes called alternative, multiple or integrated system responses, have been
      implemented in the US, Australia and Canada and are all at the beginning stages of systematic
      evaluation. These models will help prevent maltreatment cases from becoming ongoing
      protection cases, or the children ending up in out of home or community placements, and
      reduce the amount of time in Children's Aid Society care. This research will show the
      benefits and costs of a Differential Response approach to Children's Aid Society care,
      specifically in the Hamilton-Niagara Region
