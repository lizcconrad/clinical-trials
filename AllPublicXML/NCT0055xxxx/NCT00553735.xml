    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Restasis is an effective treatment for
      preventing the occurrence and progression of dry eye syndrome in patients who have recently
      received a bone marrow transplant and are at risk to graft-versus-host disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if early treatment using Restasis eye
      drops can prevent the development or delay the progression of dry eye syndrome in allogeneic
      bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients.
