      Determine if a novel levodopa/carbidopa formulation results in a better clinical response on
      Parkinson's Disease patients compared to the reference formulation of levodopa/carbidopa in
      terms of motor complications, onset of action and response duration.

    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to demonstrate a better clinical response profile of novel
      levodopa/carbidopa formulation vs. the reference formulation of levodopa/carbidopa in
      patients with Parkinson's Disease as judged by motor performance and to describe
      pharmacokinetic profile for the novel formulation compared to the reference.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnostic of Parkinson's Disease, with a Hoehn and Yahr Staging within 2-4,

          -  at least 2years of L-Dopa therapy

          -  Patients with the ability to differentiate between &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; periods

          -  Patients who have been receiving stable doses of L-Dopa between 600 and 1600 mg/day,
             for at least 2 months prior to the screening visit using a dosing regimen not higher
             that 5 times a day, and not expected in the investigator's opinion to need any dose
             modifications over the duration of the study

          -  Patients presenting a score of at least 2 in the UPDRS IVa, item 32 and/or a score of
             at least 2 in the UPDRS IVb, item 39, at screening and randomization visits based on
             clinical records for the first visit and daily diary cards at randomization time.

          -  Willing and able to understand and sign Informed Consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

             toxin or drug-induced, metabolic or infectious, etc) or other neurodegenerative
             disorder with parkinsonism (Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Corticobasal Degeneration,
             Multiple System Atrophy, etc).

          -  Patients receiving other concomitant anti-Parkinsonian pharmacological therapies
             affecting L-dopa or dopamine metabolisom (COMT inhibitors or MAO inhibitors)

             be adapted to a q.i.d. regimen.

          -  Patients with unstable or clinically significant known medical illness; such as
             cardiac, pulmonary, kidney, hepatic and/or gastrointestinal disease that would, in the
             investigator's judgment, interfere with the safe course of the study.

             of the study.

          -  Blood donation, or blood products, or participation to a clinical trial with serial
             blood withdrawals, within twelve weeks prior to the start of the trial, or intention
             to donate blood or blood products within three months following the study completion.

             no more than 7 treatment-drug elimination half-lives of entry time: Dopamine D2
             receptor antagonists , isoniazid, anti-epileptic drugs, IMAO A or B, pyridoxine,
             ferrous salts or methyldopa.
