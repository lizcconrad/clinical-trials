  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the activity of TPI 287 as single agent
      therapy for patients with advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer after failure of
      gemcitabine-containing therapy. Activity of TPI 287 will be determined by the 6-month
      survival rate.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single arm Phase 2 study in patients with advanced,
      unresectable pancreatic cancer who have received prior gemcitabine-based chemotherapy for
      their disease. Patients will receive TPI 287 administered as a 60-minute (± 10 min) IV
      infusion.

      The primary endpoint of the trial will be the 6-month survival rate. Additional efficacy
      endpoints will be response rate, duration of response and stable disease, and 6-month
      progression free survival. Responses will be assessed by reduction in radiographically
      measurable disease as defined by the RECIST criteria. Time to worsening of clinical status
      will be based on reductions in pain and/or analgesic use and changes in tumor markers (CA
      19-9) will also be followed.

      Patients will remain on study until tumor progression or death, unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent or discontinuation based on Investigator discretion. Patients will be
      followed for survival for up to 1 year after enrollment on the study.
