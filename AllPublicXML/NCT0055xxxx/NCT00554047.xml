  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands a rapidly increasing number of multidisciplinary memory clinics (MMC)
      currently diagnose 25% of the patients with dementia. Following the diagnostic work-up, MMCs
      are increasingly involved in post-diagnosis treatment and coordination of care, which
      probably is very important for patients and caregivers, but also very time consuming and
      expensive. This study will focus on the important question whether this complex
      post-diagnosis treatment and care coordination, evaluated both on effectiveness and costs,
      should be carried out by MMCs (intervention) or by General Practitioners (GPs) (control) as
      pivot of delivery of health care for these patients.

      Objectives: To determine MMCs' effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in post-diagnosis
      treatment and care-coordination for dementia-patients and their caregivers compared to the
      post-diagnosis treatment and care coordination by GPs.

      Time schedule: 12 months for including patients and their caregivers and 12 months of
      follow-up.

      Annex Study: Specifically for the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) methodology study the
      main study will be extended with some experimental proxy measurements and alternative
      measurement approaches.

      The objective of this Annex-study is to explore the feasibility and validity of Health
      Related Quality of Life (HRQL) value measurement in dementia patients. And to study the
      characteristics of proxy rating in HRQL research in dementia and the suitability and validity
      of yielding HRQL measurements by proxy assessment. Furthermore to explore the validity,
      reliability, and feasibility of the EQ5D and EQ6D in dementia research (in patients and in/by
      proxies); response shift, and alternative (more simple) methods of HRQL measurement and
      validate the Dutch versions of the QOL-AD and the use of the CarerQol-7D in dementia
      research.
