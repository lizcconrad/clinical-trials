      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the administration, safety and immunologic
      effectiveness of an experimental vaccine for colorectal cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination, usually administered by a traditional intradermal
      route, is a new treatment option for cancer patients. While the previous DC-based vaccination
      trials have shown the safety of this approach and its ability to induce objective clinical
      responses, the overall efficacy of DC-based vaccines is still disappointing (Rosenberg et
      al., 2004). We hypothesize that the two likely causes of such limited clinical activity are:
      A) suboptimal type of DCs used as a vaccine and B) suboptimal modes of use of such vaccines
      that do not allow the vaccinated patients to fully benefit from DC biology.

      We will conduct a pilot evaluation of the therapeutic vaccination with DC1s loaded with
      autologous tumor material, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that have been
      resected to no or minimal evidence of disease.The proposed evaluation of the novel
      intralymphatic route of DC-based vaccination will allow us to administer the vaccine in a way
      that is more physiologic with respect to the kinetics of antigen appearance to the lymph
      nodes and is feasible to be performed in repetitive fashion, without damaging local lymph
      nodes.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer with minimal
             evidence of disease or resectable metastases (to include extra-hepatic metastases).

          -  Availability of metastatic tumor material, from hepatic metastasis and additional
             sites, that can be resected under sterile conditions for autologous vaccine
             preparation (not all tumors harvested will be of sufficient quantity or quality to
             make vaccine, therefore some subjects may not receive vaccine).

          -  No chemotherapy, radiotherapy, major surgery, or biologic therapy for their malignancy
             in the 4 weeks prior to the vaccine administration and must have recovered from all
             side effects.

          -  An ECOG performance standard of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and a PT &lt; 2 seconds
             of the upper limit of normal.

          -  Age equal to 18 years or older and greater than 30 kg.

          -  Platelet counts greater than 100,000, a hematocrit &gt; 27.0, a white blood count &gt;
             3000/Âµl, and a creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or a creatinine clearance of
             &gt; 60 mL/min.

          -  Aware of the neoplastic nature of his/her illness, the experimental nature of the
             therapy, alternative treatments, potential benefits and risks, and willing to sign an
             informed consent.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects currently treated with systemic immunosuppressive agents, including steroids,
             are ineligible until 4 weeks after removal from immunosuppressive treatment. Subjects
             on maintenance steroids because of adrenal insufficiency are eligible.

          -  Subjects with severely abnormal liver function tests [AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), GGT,
             Alk.Phos, LDH, and total bilirubin greater than 2 X ULN]

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled pain.

          -  Subjects with active autoimmune disease, positive serology for HIV, HBV, or HCV
