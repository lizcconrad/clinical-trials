        Exclusion Criteria.

          -  Patient is currently receiving antiviral, immunomodulatory, cytotoxic or
             corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Patients previously treated with interferon within the previous 6 months.

          -  Patients previously treated with clevudine, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir,
             telbivudine or any other investigational nucleoside for HBV infection.

          -  Patient has a history of ascites, variceal hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy.

          -  Patient is coinfected with HCV, HDV or HIV.

          -  Patient with clinical evidence of decompensated liver disease or hepatocellular
             carcinoma

          -  Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Patient is unwilling to use an &quot;effective&quot; method of contraception during the study
             and for up to 3 months after the use of study drug ceases.

             formula: (140-age in years) (body weight [kg])/(72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) [Note:
             multiply estimates by 0.85 for women]
