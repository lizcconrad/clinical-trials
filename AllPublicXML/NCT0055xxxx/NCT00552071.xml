  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the difference in drug levels of Sandostatin after
      IM injection of Sandostatin LAR without ultrasound guidance (as is the standard of care)
      compared to drug levels of Sandostatin after IM injection of Sandostatin LAR with ultrasound
      guidance in subjects with Acromegaly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IM intragluteal injections have been reported to be inaccurate in their placement in the
      intramuscular compartment when performed as dictated by the current standard of care. This
      inaccuracy of placement may have an effect on the efficacy of drugs delivered by the IM
      route. Furthermore, the inaccuracy of IM injections was found to be directly related to BMI
      and was found to be more inaccurate in female subjects. Ultrasound guidance of IM injections
      will improve the accuracy of placement of IM injections and may improve drug levels and
      efficacy of Sandostatin LAR in the treatment of Acromegaly.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients â‰¥18 years old

          -  Patients with active acromegaly due to a pituitary adenoma. Historical data indicating
             a diagnosis of acromegaly based on circulating IGF-I concentration elevated compared
             to age and gender matched controls OR GH &gt;1 mcg/l at 120 Minutes of a two hour OGTT.

          -  Currently being treated with Sandostatin LAR and have been treated with a stable dose
             for 3 months prior to entry into the study.

          -  Patients with diabetes may be included, blood glucose and diabetic treatments are to
             be monitored closely during the trial in these subjects

          -  Patients have provided written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

             drug or compound

          -  Patients with current gallstones

          -  Patients with a past or current history of cancer, except for basal cell carcinoma or

             interfere with the evaluation of efficacy or safety) Interruption or discontinuation
