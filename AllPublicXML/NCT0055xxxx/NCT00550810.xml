  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal is to determine whether the experimental agent has clinically promising
      activity that would merit progression to a formal phase III trial.

      Patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer after docetaxel chemotherapy have limited
      treatment options and no systemic treatment has been proven to be effective. Because of its
      action, safety and simple administration SU011248 has potential for effectiveness in this
      disease setting. Promising activity in this study would provide the necessary
      proof-of-principle for a larger confirmatory study in this population, and potentially in
      earlier stages of this common disease.

    <description>SU011248 (study medication) will be given at 50 mg/day as a single agent for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2 week rest period to form a complete cycle of 6 weeks. Study medication will be orally self administered once daily without regard to meals beginning on Day 1 of the study. Cycles will be repeated in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression</description>
