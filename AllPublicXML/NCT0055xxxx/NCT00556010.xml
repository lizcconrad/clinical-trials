  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle fractures are common injuries that are being operated routinely. In order to restore
      the long term function and prevent arthritis of the ankle the broken fragments should be put
      in place precisely. Inadequate reduction can result in pain and long term disability.
      Recently, based on MRI studies and clinical studies, a significant number of ankle fractures
      are apparently fixed with less than optimal results. We suggest that the use of a new device
      that enables better three dimensional imaging will improve the quality of operations
      performed for ankle fractures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with unstable ankle fractures (as classified by the AO as 44B 44C by Lauge
             Hansen PER4 or SER4) amenable to open reduction and internal fixation.

          2. Patients with syndesmotic rupture as evident from the injury films or during clinical
             testing in the OR be included in the study.

          3. Intraoperative testing will include both a cotton Test and a stress view obtained
             after bimalleolar fixation has been attained.

          4. A positive syndesmotic injury will be defined by the criteria of Pettrone et al as
             follows: a tib/fib clear space &gt;5mm or tib/fib overlap of &lt;10mm (on the AP view), or a
             tib/fib overlap of &lt;1mm on the mortise view.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a pilon fracture (i.e. plafond fractures AO type 43B and C) will be
             excluded even if associated with a fibula fracture and syndesmosis disruption.

          2. Patients with contraindications to operative treatment and diabetics

          3. Women of childbearing age will be excluded if they present with a positive pre-op Beta
             HCG test or if they refuse a B HCG test.
