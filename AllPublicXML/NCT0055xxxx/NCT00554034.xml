      The purpose of this study is to determine the minimal number of patches needed to get an
      effective response. Patients enrolled in the study will be given 1, 2, 3 or 4 patches in a
      cycle by the order they enter the study. After the first 20 patients [5 cycles], the effect
      of the number of patches will be tested. If there is no distinct reduction of beta
      glucuronidase in the GCF or of gingival index at the tested sites, more patients will be
      enrolled. Patients will be added one cycle at a time with results being tested and analyzed.
      The enrollemnts of patients will stop when a dose response will be noticed or 15 cycles have
      been reached.
