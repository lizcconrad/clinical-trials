      The benefits of artificial tears to relieve dry eye symptoms include, but are not limited to:
      stabilizing the tear film layer, fluid supplement action, improving visual acuity, and
      comfort. Studies have found a relationship between some of these benefits. For example,
      stabilization of the tear film is important not only to increase the tear break up time
      (TBUT), but is key in improving and maintaining visual acuity. These studies have alluded to
      the fact that there may or may not be a relationship between residence time and visual
      performance. Viscosity is one reason behind the uncertainty. Some solutions contain polymers
      which influence the ocular surface when contacted. This can impact residence time and
      ultimately visual performance. No prior research has explored the direct relationship between
      residence time and visual performance.

      Residence time refers to the duration at which the artificial tear resides on the eye.
      Methods have been developed to assess residence time by admixing fluorescent tracers to the
      solution and then measuring the amount of fluorescence over time. The caveat to methods using
      certain tracers has lead to uncertainty in elimination measurements due to corneal
      penetration or differing molecular weights (MW) from the active vehicle ingredient in the
      solution. For example, low-MW tracers can be eliminated at a different rate than higher-MW
      polymers. In addition, the low-MW tracers may be able to penetrate the corneal epithelium
      giving a false pre-corneal residence time. Meadows, Paugh, Joshi, and Mordaunt addressed this
      issue by developing a technique using a polymer which did not penetrate the cornea and had
      the same MW as the active ingredient in the solution FITC-dextran. Based on the assumption
      that similar weights are eliminated at the same rate, this technique has shown to be more
      economic, manageable, and amendable than previous procedures measuring residence time.

      Any ophthalmic drop has the potential to impact visual acuity upon instillation due to the
      effect it has on the tear layer components. Studies have observed that taking artificial
      tears continuously over time tends to stabilize the tear layer thus minimizing the immediate
      drop in contrast sensitivity upon instillation. Measuring the visual effect of artificial
      tears, using contrast sensitivity as a measure, provides valuable information about the
      therapeutic effect of artificial tears that are meant to stabilize the tear film, thus
      improving visual acuity in dry eye patients.

      But what about the patient? There is a difference between residence time and retention of
      effect- which is often what matters the most for patients. Retention of effect refers to the
      beneficial effect of the drop. Currently there is no real measure of retention of effect.
      Doctors can assess the tear film objectively, but there have been no strong correlations
      between subjective dry symptoms and tear film stability. A possible reason for the lack of
      correlation may be due to the fact that subjectivity is difficult to quantify. However,
      scales like the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) have been
      established in an attempt to quantify subjective experiences such as visual quality. We will
      be using the NRS to gauge the comfort of the drop upon the initial application to get a
      general idea of the comfort the drop provides to the user.

      Although there have been several studies done on residence time and visual effect of
      ophthalmic formulations separately, there is no current research correlating these two
      aspects of therapeutic efficacy. This study will be the first to concurrently investigate
      residence time (using FITC-dextran) and visual effect of an ophthalmic formulation.

        The subjects for this investigation will be sourced from an existing, secure dry eye
        subject database. These subjects will have been screened for dry eye using a consistent
        protocol (Diagnostic monograph, J. Paugh, January 2007). Subjects who have taken part in a
        prior study undergoing this same eligibility visit protocol within the past 18 months will
        not be required to repeat the visit.
