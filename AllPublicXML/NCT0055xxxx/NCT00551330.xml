    <textblock>
      Vicriviroc (vye-kri-VYE-rock) is an investigational drug (not yet approved by Government
      Regulatory Authorities for commercial use) that belongs to a new class of drugs, called CCR5
      receptor blockers. This group of drugs blocks one of the ways HIV enters T-cells (the cells
      that fight infection). Previous smaller studies in HIV treatment-experienced patients, have
      shown that vicriviroc is safe and effective. The purpose of this study is to investigate in
      subjects with detectable dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4-tropic HIV whether vicriviroc when added to
      other appropriate HIV drugs can decrease the level of HIV (viral load) in the blood and that
      it is well tolerated.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of
      vicriviroc maleate in HIV subjects infected with dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4-tropic virus and who
      have documented resistance to at least 2 of the 3 antiretroviral drug classes (NRTI, NNRTI or
      PI) or at least 6 months experience with at least 2 of the following: one NRTI, one NNRTI, or
      one PI (excluding low-dose ritonavir) and failure on their current stable regimen. The study
      will compare the virologic benefit of adding vicriviroc to an optimized background regimen to
      a control group receiving placebo plus the new optimized background therapy. The optimized
      background regimen will be chosen by the investigator based on results of drug susceptibility
      tests performed at Screening, history of prior antiretroviral drug use by the patient, and
      drug toxicity. Primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed
      48 weeks of treatment. An interim analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed
      24 weeks of treatment. Subjects who complete 48 weeks of treatment, or who discontinue early
      but are deemed eligible upon rescreening, will be offered participation in the open-label
      segment of the study, and will receive vicriviroc 30 mg once daily, if appropriate, until
      commercially available or until the sponsor terminates the clinical development of
      vicriviroc.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be at least 16 years of age (or minimal age that defines an adult as
             determined by local regulatory authorities or legal requirements), of either sex and
             of any race, with dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4 tropic HIV infection.

          -  Subjects must have treatment failure (defined by plasma HIV RNA [ribonucleic acid]
             &gt;1000 copies/mL) on an existing regimen.

          -  Subjects must be antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced and have documented
             genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to at least one drug in 2 of the following 3
             drug classes: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), nonnucleoside reverse
             transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or protease inhibitor (PI)

        OR

          -  Antiretroviral class experience for at least 6 months (sequential or cumulative) with
             at least two of the following:

               -  one NRTI

               -  one NNRTI

               -  one PI (excluding low dose ritonavir).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the best treatment regimen for the subject must be
             an optimized ART regimen consisting of &gt;=3 drugs, the optimized regimen must contain
             at least 2 active drugs, one of which must be a ritonavir-boosted PI (&gt;=100 mg
             ritonavir). With the exception of etravirine, NNRTIs may not be a component of the
             optimized regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition likely to increase the risk of seizures.

          -  CD4 count &lt;100 cells/mm^3.

          -  Current or prior history of malignancy.
