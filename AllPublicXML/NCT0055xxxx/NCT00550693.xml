  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no published data on the efficacy of the chlorhexidine-impregnated foam
      dressing to reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections (BSI) in hemodialysis patients.

      The researchers perfomed a cross-over intervention trial on patients who were dialyzed
      through central venous catheters at two outpatient dialysis centers were enrolled. The use of
      a chlorhexidine-impregnated foam dressing was incorporated into the catheter care protocol
      during the intervention period. A nested cohort study of all patients who received the foam
      dressing was also conducted to determine independent risk factors for development of BSI.

      The primary outcomes were the catheter-related bloodstream infection rates in the
      intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes include the clinical sepsis rates between
      the two groups and risk factors for development of bloodstream infection despite the use of
      the foam dressing.
