  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, dose escalation, safety and pharmacokinetic
      study. The study will be conducted in approximately 8-10 centers in the United States and
      Switzerland. Up to 32 patients who have undergone major cardiovascular surgery will
      participate. Patients will receive a single IV injection of I5NP or placebo following
      cardiovascular surgery. I5NP will be administered 4 hours (+/- 30 minutes) following removal
      of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine (CBM).

      The duration of the study is approximately 44 days, inclusive of a 14 day screening period.
      Patients will be contacted by phone at 6 and 12 months for follow-up questions. Patient
      visits are screening, day of surgery, hospital in-patient Days 1, 2, 3 and Day 7 or hospital
      discharge. Safety follow-up will continue until 30 days post-surgery. 2 phone calls will be
      made at 6 and 12 months after date of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug (I5NP) is a small interfering RNA that is being developed to protect patients from
      acute kidney injury after cardiac bypass surgery. This first-in-man study will test the
      safety of I5NP and measure how long the drug stays in the blood stream after injection. This
      study is not meant to test if I5NP protects kidneys from the damage that may occur in rare
      cases during surgery. Another purpose of this dose escalation study is to find out the right
      dose of the experimental drug to be given to study subjects in future studies. Even though
      there were no harmful effects seen in the animals tested, we do not know what side effects
      the experimental drug might cause in humans.
