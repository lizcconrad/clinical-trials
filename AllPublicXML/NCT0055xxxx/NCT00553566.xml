      RATIONALE: Learning about the long-term effects of dietary, lifestyle, and environmental
      factors on the risk of cancer progression and recurrence may help the study of bladder cancer
      in the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how dietary, lifestyle, and environmental factors
      affect patients with early-stage bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To examine if common and potentially modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and environmental
           exposures affect the risk of recurrence and progression in bladder cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Detailed information will be collected about the patients' lifestyle and their exposure to
      risk factors associated with bladder cancer using semi-structured questionnaires. A baseline
      questionnaire will be administered at the time of diagnosis and will collect information
      about socio-demographics, environmental exposures, medical history, diet, health-related
      quality of life, and social support.

      Further questionnaires will be administered at regular follow-up visits to capture
      information relating to changes in exposure. A postal questionnaire will be used to collect
      historical information that may require the patient to check records or consult family or
      friends. Patients will also be asked to keep a 1-week food, fluid, and micturition diary.

      Patients continue to complete questionnaires at 3 months and then annually for up to 5 years.
