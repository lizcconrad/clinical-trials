      A prospective randomized double blinded placebo controlled comparative trial will be
      performed at HIV clinic of the Muhimbili National Hospital/MUCHS where 220 HIV positive
      patients presenting with oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) on antiretroviral (ARVs) treatment
      or not will be included.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of single dose fluconazole
      (750mg) and two weeks course of fluconazole (150mg once daily)in the treatment of OPC in HIV
      positive patients. It is hypothesised that the two regimens are equally effective in the
      treatment of OPC.

      A structured standard questionnaire will be used to systematically collect essential data
      including demography, treatment history and concomitant infections and treatment.

      General and oral examination, collection of oral isolates, mycological, hematological and
      biochemical investigations will be done at baseline and at end of treatment day 13-14.

      All Patients will be followed up to 30 days after end of treatment for relapse
