        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening history, physical or
             laboratory examination, or any other medical condition or circumstance making the
             volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study.

          -  Subjects who metabolize carvedilol poorly based on CYP2D6 genotyping as determined at
             screening.

          -  Treatment with any prescription or non-prescription drugs (including vitamins, herbal
             and dietary supplements, as well as grapefruit-containing products) within 7 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to first dose of study medication and until the
             end of the study. Treatment with any CYP2D6 inhibitors such as but not limited to
             quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine, and terbinofine at least 14 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 of Session 1 and until the end of the
             study.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) preceding Day 1 of Session 1.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

             hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          -  Positive urine drug screen (UDS) including alcohol at screening. A minimum list of
             drugs that will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  Urine Na/creatinine ratio &lt; 0.08 meq/mg.

          -  Positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential.

          -  Resting heart rate of ≤ 50 beats per minute (bpm) at screening.

          -  Abnormalities on 12-lead ECG during screening

          -  Documented history of low blood pressure (average SBP ≤ 110 mm Hg and/or DBP ≤ 50 mm
             Hg) or blood pressure below these values at time of screening.

          -  Orthostatic hypotension diagnosed at screening (orthostatic hypotension will be
             defined as a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more and/or a
             reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more for standing vs. supine
             measurements. (See Section 6.2.6).

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within a 56-day period including approximately
             350 mL of blood to be drawn during this study.

          -  History of asthma, COPD and/or hypersensitivity to β-adrenergic blocking agents.

             to any of the study medications or components thereof.

          -  History of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic reactions or severe allergic responses to
             drugs.
