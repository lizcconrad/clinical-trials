    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the clinical effect of midodrine
      hydrochloride (ProAmatineÂ®) compared to placebo in patients with orthostatic hypotension by
      measuring the time to onset of near syncopal symptoms and assessing several cardiovascular
      measurements, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG, using the tilt table test.

    <measure>Time to Onset of Near-syncopal Symptoms During Tilt Table Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The tilt table test is a 10-minute assessment performed using a manual or automated tilt table in a specialized laboratory. Subjects were moved onto the horizontal table and secured to the table with straps to prevent injury. After an equilibration period of at least 10 minutes with the subject at rest, the test began and the head of the tilt table was elevated to a 70-degree angle over a period of up to 30 seconds. The head-up tilt table test in this study was conducted 1 hour after administration of the study medication. The endpoint was a confirmed report of a near-syncopal symptom(s) (of sufficient severity that caused the patient to ask that the tilt table be returned to the horizontal position). Symptoms of near syncope were defined as dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like the subject might black out.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset of Near-syncopal Symptoms During Tilt Table Testing</title>
        <description>The tilt table test is a 10-minute assessment performed using a manual or automated tilt table in a specialized laboratory. Subjects were moved onto the horizontal table and secured to the table with straps to prevent injury. After an equilibration period of at least 10 minutes with the subject at rest, the test began and the head of the tilt table was elevated to a 70-degree angle over a period of up to 30 seconds. The head-up tilt table test in this study was conducted 1 hour after administration of the study medication. The endpoint was a confirmed report of a near-syncopal symptom(s) (of sufficient severity that caused the patient to ask that the tilt table be returned to the horizontal position). Symptoms of near syncope were defined as dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like the subject might black out.</description>

        <title>Total Score of the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment (OHSA)</title>
        <description>The OHSA measures the severity of six symptoms/symptom complexes associated with orthostatic hypotension. Subjects rated symptoms experienced during the tilt table test on an eleven-point scale from ânoneâ to âworst possibleâ. The OHSA total score is the sum of six subscales, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 60 (worst possible symptoms). The OHSA was completed after the tilt table test was over, but was answered with reference to symptoms experienced during testing. The tilt table test is a 10-minute assessment performed using a manual or automated tilt table in a specialized laboratory. Subjects were moved onto the horizontal table and secured to the table with straps to prevent injury. After an equilibration period with the subject at rest, the test began and the head of the tilt table was elevated to a 70-degree angle over a period of up to 30 seconds. Symptoms of near syncope were defined as dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like the subject might black out.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Improvement of Clinician Clinician's Global Impression- Improvement (CGI-I) Scores After Tilt Table Test</title>
        <description>The CGI-I instrument assesses the overall impression of the subjectâs orthostatic hypotension during the tilt table test by using a 7-point scale, with 1 being Very much improved; 2, Much improved; 3, Slightly improved; 4, No change; 5, Slightly worse; 6, Much worse; and 7, Very much worse. The clinician completed the CGI-I after each of the tilt table tests. A patient was assessed as &quot;Improved&quot; if the score was 1, 2, or 3. The tilt table test is a 10-minute assessment performed using a manual or automated tilt table in a specialized laboratory. Subjects were moved onto the horizontal table and secured to the table with straps to prevent injury. After an equilibration period of at least 10 minutes with the subject at rest, the test began and the head of the tilt table was elevated to a 70-degree angle over a period of up to 30 seconds. Symptoms of near syncope were defined as dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like the subject might black out.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Improvement of Clinician Clinician's Global Impression- Improvement (CGI-I) Scores After Tilt Table Test</title>
          <description>The CGI-I instrument assesses the overall impression of the subjectâs orthostatic hypotension during the tilt table test by using a 7-point scale, with 1 being Very much improved; 2, Much improved; 3, Slightly improved; 4, No change; 5, Slightly worse; 6, Much worse; and 7, Very much worse. The clinician completed the CGI-I after each of the tilt table tests. A patient was assessed as &quot;Improved&quot; if the score was 1, 2, or 3. The tilt table test is a 10-minute assessment performed using a manual or automated tilt table in a specialized laboratory. Subjects were moved onto the horizontal table and secured to the table with straps to prevent injury. After an equilibration period of at least 10 minutes with the subject at rest, the test began and the head of the tilt table was elevated to a 70-degree angle over a period of up to 30 seconds. Symptoms of near syncope were defined as dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like the subject might black out.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset of Near-syncopal Symptoms During Tilt Table Testing Analysis #2</title>
        <description>The tilt table test is a 10-minute assessment performed using a manual or automated tilt table in a specialized laboratory. Subjects were moved onto the horizontal table and secured to the table with straps to prevent injury. After an equilibration period of at least 10 minutes with the subject at rest, the test began and the head of the tilt table was elevated to a 70-degree angle over a period of up to 30 seconds. The head-up tilt table test in this study was conducted 1 hour after administration of the study medication. The endpoint was a confirmed report of a near- syncopal symptom(s) (of sufficient severity that caused the patient to ask that the tilt table be returned to the horizontal position). Symptoms of near syncope were defined as dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like the subject might black out. In this outcome measure, the data analyzed are the same as for Outcome Measure 1 but the summary data are presented as least squares mean (standard error).</description>

        <description>For biochemistry, blood samples (10.0mL) were taken at screening, admission (if greater than 14 days since screening) and discharge/early termination. The following parameters were assessed: sodium, potassium, calcium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/Urea, creatinine, albumin, total protein and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio, globulin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, glucose, chloride, and creatine kinase.

        <title>Time to Onset of Near-syncopal Symptoms During Tilt Table Testing-Re-analysis With The Koch Procedure</title>
        <description>The tilt table test is a 10-minute assessment performed using a manual or automated tilt table in a specialized laboratory. Subjects were moved onto the horizontal table and secured to the table with straps to prevent injury. After an equilibration period of at least 10 minutes with the subject at rest, the test began and the head of the tilt table was elevated to a 70-degree angle over a period of up to 30 seconds. The head-up tilt table test in this study was conducted 1 hour after administration of the study medication. The endpoint was a confirmed report of a near-syncopal symptom(s) (of sufficient severity that caused the patient to ask that the tilt table be returned to the horizontal position). Symptoms of near syncope were defined as dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like the subject might black out. The Koch procedure is a 3-step process to analyze results while utilizing the available information on magnitude of differences.</description>
