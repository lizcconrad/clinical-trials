        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests). Subjects below the age of 21
             years must have consent from either a parent or guardian in countries having this
             requirement.

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 18 to 30 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;45 kg
             (99 lbs).

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the trial.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy).

          3. A positive urine drug screen.

          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          5. History or evidence of habitual tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3
             months of screening or a positive urine or serum cotinine test.

          6. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days preceding the first dose of
             study medication.

          7. 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at Screening.

          8. Sitting blood pressure ?140 mm Hg systolic or ?90 mm Hg diastolic on a single
             measurement [confirmed by a single repeat, if necessary] following at least 5 minutes
             of rest at Screening.

          9. Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or
             unable to use an acceptable method of non-hormonal contraception as outlined in this
             protocol from at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication until
             completion of follow-up procedures.

         10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, vitamins and dietary supplements within
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study
             medication. Herbal supplements and hormonal methods of contraception (including oral
             and transdermal contraceptives, injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants,
             progesterone-releasing IUDs, postcoital contraceptive methods) and hormone replacement
             therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication.
             Depo-Proveraï¿½ must be discontinued at least 6 months prior to the first dose of study
             medication. As an exception, acetaminophen may be used at doses of ?1g/day. Other
             exceptions may be granted by a qualified member of Pfizer study management.

         11. Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

         12. Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol.

         13. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
