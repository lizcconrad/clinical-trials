      The aim of the project is to study pathogenetic mechanisms in severe asthma and compare those
      mechanisms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in order to test the hypothesis
      that severe asthma and COPD develop into similar chronic degenerative changes.

      The BIOAIR project focuses on the sub-group of asthma patients that suffer from severe or
      difficult-to-control asthma, and who have frequent asthma exacerbations ('attacks'). This
      sub-group of asthma patients consists of around 10% of all asthma patients, but accounts for
      more than half of the total community costs for asthma. It is as yet unknown why these
      patients are so much more severely ill compared to the majority of asthma patients that have
      controlled disease. No adequate treatment has yet been established. The BIOAIR study was
      initiated in order to find out more about the mechanisms underlying severe asthma. Since some
      of the changes that occur in severe asthma are similar to patients with chronic obstructive
      lung disease (COPD), a group of COPD patients was included and will be studied as well. A
      group with controlled mild-to-moderate asthma was included for comparative reasons.

             obstruction, as documented during the last 5 years before the study or at screening
             visit:

               1. An increase in FEV1 more than 9% of predicted (or improvement by 200 mL) after
                  administration of 4 puffs of 100 microg salbutamol dose-aerosol inhaler via a
                  spacer, or after additional inhalation of four puffs of 20 microg ipratropium

             states that are considered to interfere with study conduct or scientific
             interpretations.

          5. The patient cannot read or comprehend written material, or is in the opinion of the
             investigator, for other reasons unlikely to understand and follow the study
             procedures.

          6. The patient is mentally or legally incapacitated preventing informed consent from
             being obtained.

        Exclusions because of pulmonary disorders

          1. The patient is unable to perform acceptable spirometry, peak flow measurements and/or
             complete diary cards in a satisfactory way during the period between visit 1 and visit
             3B (optimisation period and prednisolone/placebo trial). If the patient is unable to
             use the electronic Peak Flow meters/Diary cards, it is acceptable to use an ordinary
             mechanical meter (e.g. Mini-Wright) together with a paper version of the diary card.
             Patients that are unable to use the mechanical meter and paper diary card during the
             period between visit 1 and 3B cannot enter the follow-up year.

          2. The patient has, in addition to asthma or COPD, any other pulmonary disorder that
             according to the investigator would interfere with the study procedures or scientific
             evaluation (e.g. tuberculosis).

          3. The patient suffers from chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure as indicated by an
             elevated pCO2 (&gt;47 mm Hg or 6,25 kPa). In case of doubt this should be confirmed with
             pulse oximetry or blood gas sampling.

        Exclusions because of medications

          1. The patient has received immunosuppressants other than corticosteroids (i.e.,
             methotrexate, gold, troleandomycin, cyclosporin or any other experimental
             anti-inflammatory drug) within three months of study entry.

          2. The patient is currently undergoing immunotherapy.

          3. The patient receives chronic oxygen therapy.

        Specific exclusion criterion for patients with asthma (groups 1 &amp; 2)

        1. The patient has smoked more than five (5) pack years.

        Specific exclusion criterion for patients with mild asthma (group 1) 1. The patient
        requires treatment with long-acting beta-agonists.

        Specific exclusion criteria for patients with severe asthma (group 2)

          1. The patient is not treated with high doses of inhaled steroids (see above).

          2. The patient has not had an exacerbation of asthma during the last year.

          3. The patient does not require treatment with long-acting beta-agonists or theophylline
             as documented during one year.

        Specific exclusion criterion for patients with COPD (group 3)

        1. The patient has a history of asthma confirmed by a specialist in pulmonary medicine.

        Specific exclusion criteria for bronchoscopy (all groups)

          1. The patient has had a severe exacerbation of asthma requiring high doses of oral
             steroids during the last three (3) months.

          2. The patient has had a severe exacerbation of COPD requiring intensive outpatient
             treatment or hospitalisation during the last three (3) months.

          3. The patient has had three or more severe exacerbations of asthma or COPD during the
             last year.

          4. The patient displays more than 10% fall in FEV1 at 2 minutes after inhalation of 0.9%
             saline (during induction of sputum at visit 2).

          5. The patient has shown signs of uncontrolled disease during the last three days, e.g.
             the patient has required more than four puffs/day of rescue medication above baseline
             use during the last three days. (In the case criteria 1-4 are not met, such patients
             may be rescheduled for bronchoscopy in two weeks time. The start of the oral
             prednisolone intervention will then be postponed by the number of days passing before
             the bronchoscopy).

          6. If a patient who otherwise has qualified for bronchoscopy has received more than 6 mg
             per kg BW of lidocaine during the preparation for the procedure, the bronchoscopy must
             be terminated and cannot be continued the same day.

          7. Patients who have experienced severe bronchoconstriction or other adverse reactions at
             previous attempts to perform bronchoscopy.

          9. Do not start or proceed bronchoscopy if:

               -  Transcutaneous oxygen saturation by pulse-oximeter &lt; 90% (despite giving oxygen
                  by nasal cannula when saturation is &lt; 94%)

               -  Heart frequency &gt; 130

               -  Heart rhythm disturbances.

        Specific exclusion criteria for induced sputum (all groups)

          1. A post-bronchodilator (after administration of 4 puffs of 100 microg salbutamol
             dose-aerosol inhaler via a spacer) FEV1 percent of predicted being less than 60%, or
             in absolute values less than 1.0 L.

          2. A peak flow variability of more than 30% during the previous four days.

          3. Patients who display more than a 15% fall in FEV1 at 2 minutes after inhalation of
             saline (0.9% NaCl) during induction of sputum..
