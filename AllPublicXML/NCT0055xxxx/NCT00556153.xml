      The first phase of the study will investigate if there is increased uptake of [F-18]FDOPA in
      pediatric brain tumors when compared to normal brain tissue. Tne subjects between ages 5 and
      17 years will be studies, to determine if there is increased uptake of [F-18]FDOPA in
      pediatric brain tumors when compared to normal brain tissue. Drug safety will also be
      monitored.
