  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to test a null hypothesis that a combined modality treatment of
      esophageal cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is equivalent to surgery
      alone and what are the benefits from adding irradiation to chemotherapy in neoadjuvant
      treatment of esophageal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The choice of the most beneficial method of treatment in esophageal cancer remains
      controversial and is the subject of vigorous debate. Surgery is still regarded as the
      principle modality among treatment strategies, with longterm survival achieved mainly in less
      advanced cases. More advanced cases, diagnosed more frequently, are more problematic in
      selection of the optimal therapeutic method. One of the options for improving treatment
      outcome in patients with advanced esophageal cancer is combined modality treatment with
      chemo- and chemoradiotherapy. Currently available RCTs have tested preoperative chemotherapy
      or chemoradiotherapy separately in comparison to surgery alone. Moreover, we do not know from
      these trials what is the added value of irradiation in a combined modality therapy over a
      preoperative chemotherapy. Another drawback of available RCTs is combining 2 different
      biological cancer entities: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus as
      well as carcinoma of the esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction. That were the reasons for
      designing our trial testing 3 principal modes of esophageal cancer therapy: surgery vs.
      chemotherapy + surgery vs. chemoradiotherapy + surgery on homogenous population of esophageal
      cancer patients with single pathological type - squamous cell carcinoma affecting thoracic
      esophagus.
