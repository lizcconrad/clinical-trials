  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 specialised clinics and 420 office based gynaecologists or oncologists will
      participate in this in practice evaluation program (NIS). The clinic and approximately 7
      office based physicians will collaborate within their breast centre networks to conduct this
      program. A breast centre network should be able to recruit in this program approximately 80
      patients (approximately 40 patients per year). It is planned to enroll approximately 4674
      patients in this NIS (2337 patients per arm). The patient population will include
      postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive primary breast cancer scheduled for
      upfront adjuvant endocrine treatment with anastrozole according to the current standard
      medical procedures.
