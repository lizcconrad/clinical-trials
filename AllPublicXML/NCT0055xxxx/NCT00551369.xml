      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue near the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well stereotactic body radiation therapy works
      in treating patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer that can be removed
      by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether treatment with radiotherapy involving a high biological dose with
           limited treatment volume (using stereotactic body radiotherapy [SBRT] techniques)
           achieves acceptable primary tumor control (i.e., ≥ 90% at 2 years) in patients with
           resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether treatment with radiotherapy involving a high biological dose with
           limited treatment volume (using SBRT techniques) achieves acceptable treatment-related
           toxicity.

        -  Estimate the disease-free survival and the overall survival rate at 2 years.

        -  Observe patterns of failure in the first 2 years.

        -  Assess the level of comorbidity burden on morbidity and efficacy.

        -  Determine if blood markers prior to, during the course of treatment (between the second
           and the last dose of SBRT), and at the first follow-up after SBRT predict 2-year primary
           tumor control and predict for grade ≥ 2 treatment-related toxicities

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy over 14 days. Patients with
      disease progression undergo surgical resection as salvage local therapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years and then annually thereafter.

    <time_frame>From start of treatment to 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Primary tumor control is defined as the absence of primary tumor failure by 2 years after the start of SBRT. Primary tumor failure was considered as the development of either failure within the SBRT treatment fields (in-field failure) or failure within 1.0 cm of the treatment field (marginal failure). An acceptable tumor control rate at 2 years was considered to be 90% (monthly hazard of 0.00439), and an unacceptable rate was 70% (monthly hazard of 0.01486). A one-sided type 1 error of 0.05 and statistical power of 90% was used. A one-sided Z-test was used to determine if the difference between the logarithm of the observed hazard rate and the logarithm of the hypothesized hazard rate of 0.01486 was statistically significant.</description>

    <time_frame>From start of treatment to 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>PTF: the development of either failure within the SBRT treatment fields (in-field failure) or failure within 1.0 cm of the treatment field (marginal failure) within the first two years after start of SBRT. RF: the development of measurable tumor within lymph nodes along the natural lymphatic drainage typical for the location of the treated primary disease only with dimension of at least 1.0 cm on imaging studies (preferably CT scans) within the lung, bronchial hilum, or the mediastinum within the first two years after start of SBRT. MD: the appearance after protocol therapy of cancer deposits characteristic of metastatic dissemination from non-small cell lung cancer within the first two years after start of SBRT. DFS: the state of being alive without development of progressive disease, with failure considered the earliest development of either progression or death. OS: the state of being alive, with failure is considered death due to any cause.</description>

    <description>Assess if blood markers prior to, during the course of treatment (between the second and the last dose of SBRT), and at the first follow-up after SBRT predict 2 year primary tumor control and predict for grade ≥ 2 treatment-related adverse events. Unfortunately, there were not enough specimens submitted to perform this analysis. The specimens that were collected remain in the NRG Oncology Biobank and are available to be combined with other specimens from other studies for an appropriately powered project.</description>

        <title>Primary Tumor Control at 2 Years</title>
        <description>Primary tumor control is defined as the absence of primary tumor failure by 2 years after the start of SBRT. Primary tumor failure was considered as the development of either failure within the SBRT treatment fields (in-field failure) or failure within 1.0 cm of the treatment field (marginal failure). An acceptable tumor control rate at 2 years was considered to be 90% (monthly hazard of 0.00439), and an unacceptable rate was 70% (monthly hazard of 0.01486). A one-sided type 1 error of 0.05 and statistical power of 90% was used. A one-sided Z-test was used to determine if the difference between the logarithm of the observed hazard rate and the logarithm of the hypothesized hazard rate of 0.01486 was statistically significant.</description>

MD: the appearance after protocol therapy of cancer deposits characteristic of metastatic dissemination from non-small cell lung cancer within the first two years after start of SBRT.
