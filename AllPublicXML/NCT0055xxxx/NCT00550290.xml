      This randomized prospective study will specifically investigate the efficacy of a 24 hour
      post-operative course of broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics - namely Cefazolin - in
      preventing wound infection and wound breakdown following vulvectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infectious morbidity in gynecologic oncology has not been thoroughly investigated to date.
      Included in the literature are several studies that highlight substantial numbers of
      post-surgical infectious complications. Specifically among patients undergoing radical
      vulvectomy, the incidence of post-operative wound complication is as high as 58%. Surgery is
      the treatment of choice for vulvar cancer, but few studies establish protocols or management
      strategies to prevent the complications of post-operative wound infection and breakdown. This
      proposed randomized prospective study would specifically investigate the efficacy of a 24
      hour post-operative course of broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics - namely Cefazolin - in
      preventing wound infection and wound breakdown following vulvectomy. This same regimen has
      been described by a leader in the field of gynecology in his text - TeLinde's Operative
      Gynecology. This study will utilize two arms - one as the treatment arm utilizing 24 hours of
      prophylactic antibiotics and the other as control.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All female patients 18 years of age or older undergoing surgery for vulvar carcinoma
             (this includes female patients undergoing any form of vulvectomy - radical, vulvectomy
             without groin node dissection, and partial vulvectomy)

          -  Disease State will not affect inclusion in the study. Women with previous surgery for
             vulvar carcinoma will be included as will those undergoing initial operation.

          -  Number of subjects: 160

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women simultaneously undergoing treatment for other forms of cancer

          -  Women under the age of 18

          -  Pregnant patients
