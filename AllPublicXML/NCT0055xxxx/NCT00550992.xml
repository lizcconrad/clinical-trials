      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of
      cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem
      cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help
      the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
      Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's
      normal cells. Giving cyclosporine, methotrexate, leucovorin, and antithymocyte globulin
      before and after transplant may stop this from happening. It is not yet known which treatment
      regimen is most effective in treating acute leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well different therapies work in
      treating infants with newly diagnosed acute leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare an early intensification regimen comprising two &quot;acute myeloid leukemia&quot;
           induction therapy blocks with a standard protocol IB regimen administered directly after
           induction therapy in medium-risk (MR) and high-risk (HR) patients with newly diagnosed
           acute lymphoblastic or biphenotypic leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  To compare through a randomized study the role of these regimens in treating these
           patients.

        -  To compare the overall outcome of the Interfant-06 study with outcomes in the historical
           control series, especially in the Interfant-99 study.

        -  To compare the outcomes of low-risk, MR, or HR patients in this study with those of
           patients in the historical control series Interfant-99 study.

        -  To study which factors have independent prognostic value in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  To assess the role of stem cell transplantation in HR patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy:

             -  Prednisone phase: Patients receive prednisone orally or IV three times daily on
                days 1-7 and methotrexate (MTX) and prednisolone (PRDL) intrathecally (IT) on day
                1. Patients then proceed to remission induction therapy.

             -  Remission induction phase: Patients receive dexamethasone (DEXA) IV or orally three
                times daily on days 8-28 followed by a taper to 0 over 1 week; vincristine (VCR) IV
                on days 8, 15, 22, and 29; cytarabine (ARA-C) IV over 30 minutes on days 8-21;
                daunorubicin hydrochloride (DNR) IV over 1 hour on days 8 and 9; asparaginase (ASP)
                IV over 1 hour or intramuscularly (IM) on days 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, and 33; MTX IT
                on days 1 and 29*; and ARA-C IT on day 15. Patients also receive PRDL or
                therapeutic hydrocortisone (HC) IT on days 1, 15, and 29.

      NOTE: *Patients with CNS involvement at initial diagnosis also receive MTX IT on days 8 and
      22. If CNS leukemia is still present at day 29, then patients receive weekly MTX IT until the
      CNS is free of leukemia.

      After completion of induction therapy, patients are stratified according to risk group
      (low-risk [LR] vs medium-risk [MR] vs high-risk [HR]). Patients with low-risk disease are
      assigned to treatment arm I. Patients with MR or HR disease that is in complete remission
      (CR) on day 33 are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. These patients are stratified
      according to status (MR with rearranged MLL vs MR with unknown MLL vs HR).

                on days 1-28; ARA-C IV on days 3-6, 10-13, 17-20, and 24-27; ARA-C IT on day 10;
                and MTX IT on day 24. Patients also receive PRDL or therapeutic HC IT on days 10

                     IT on days 2 and 9. Patients also receive PRDL or therapeutic HC IT on days 2
                     and 9.

                  -  Part II: Patients receive HD ARA-C IV over 3 hours twice daily with 12-hour
                     intervals on days 15, 16, 22, and 23; and pegaspargase (PEG-ASP) IV over 1

             -  MD: Patients receive CsA as in group MSD; MTX IV on days 1, 3, and 6; leucovorin
                calcium IV on days 2, 4, and 7; and ATG IV on days -3 to -1.

        -  Allogeneic SCT: Patients undergo infusion of bone marrow, peripheral blood, or cord
           blood hematopoietic stem cells on day 0.
