  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the framework of the epidemiological study, local psychologists are trained in Butare in
      carrying out diagnostic interviews with orphans and widows who experienced the Rwandan
      genocide. With the aid of standardized questionnaires they will assess trauma related
      symptoms as well as Prolonged Grief Disorder. Under the supervision of clinical experts from
      the University of Konstanz the local psychologists will carry out a randomized house to house
      survey (Phase 1).

      As a second step, a controlled randomized clinical trial will be carried out. Local
      psychologists will be trained in applying Narrative Exposure Therapy and Interpersonal
      Psychotherapy. Genocide survivors that will be identified with a PTSD diagnosis will randomly
      be assigned to either the treatment condition or a waiting list. The treatment group will
      receive 5 individual sessions of NET in addition to 3 individual IPT sessions. Subsequent
      3-months and 6-months post-tests will serve to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment module
      in alleviating trauma related symptoms and symptoms of prolonged grief. We expect a
      significant symptom reduction in the experimental group and no significant symptom reduction
      in the waiting list. After the 6-months post-test, the trained psychologists will train other
      psychologists in applying this treatment module under the supervision of clinical experts
      from the University of Konstanz. Afterwards, they will apply therapy to the victims from the
      waiting list.

      A 12-months follow-up will serve to evaluate the long-term effect of the NET/IPT combination.
