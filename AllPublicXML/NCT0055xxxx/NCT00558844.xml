  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the safety and tolerability of 28 days of daily dosing of 560 mg
      of Arikace™ versus placebo in patients who have Cystic fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a gentic disease resulting from mutations in a 230 kb gene on
      chromosome 7 known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Study
      subjects with CF manifest pathological changes in a variety or organs that express CFTR. The
      lungs are frequently affected, the sequelae being chronic infections and airway inflammation.
      The principal goal of both treatment of subjects with CF is to slow the chronic deterioration
      of lung function.

      Study subjects will be randomized to receive either study drug or placebo (1.5% NaCl) by
      inhalation via a PARI eFlow nebulizer. Each subject will complete 28 days of daily dosing.
      All study patients will be followed for safety, pharmacokinetics, clinical and microbiologic
      activity for 56 days post completion of study treatment. The total study period will be up to
      84 days, with screening visit occurring within the preceding 14 days prior to study day 1.
      Patients will be clinically evaluated during the first 48 hours post first study dose and
      weekly for the 28 day treatment period and during the follow up visits at study days 35, 42,
      49, 56, 70 and 85 days to determine safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      clinical and microbiologic activity.

      Clinical laboratory parameters, audiology testing, clinical adverse events and pulmonary
      function will be evaluated for all study subjects in order to determine the qualitative and
      quantitative safety and tolerability of Arikace™ compared to placebo. Serum, urine and sputum
      specimens will be collected at periodic intervals to assess PK. Additionally, sputum samples
      will be collected to determine changes in bacterial density. Pulmonary function testing and
      CFQ-R measurements will be assessed at selected time points throughout the study. An
      exploratory evaluation of a Cystic Fibrosis Symptom Diary (CFSD) will also be implemented.
