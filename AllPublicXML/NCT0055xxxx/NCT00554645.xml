  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The difficulties in loosing weight may not stem from lack og knowledge about nutrition, as
      implied by the standard treatment but from difficulties in following the advice. The
      hypothesis is, that revealing and addressing these difficulties psychotherapeutically may be
      more efficient in obtaining weight reduction. The effect of psychological group treatment of
      severely overweight children and their parents is compared with traditional nutritional
      information. In other words: Which is better: back-up or enlightenment?

  <detailed_description>

      At on-set the children get a medical examination, blood-tests, measurement of height, weight,
      skin-fold, waist and hip. Children and parents fill out questionnaires on social and
      educational background as well as motivation and expectations to the treatment. All Children
      are thereafter randomised into two groups:multi-disciplinary group intervention versus
      traditional information. The randomisation is stratified according to gender and degree of
      overweight (135%-145% and &gt;145%) supposing that the degree of overweight may mirror the
      difficulties in loosing weight. The experimental intervention consists of one lecture of
      general nutrition, weekly psychological group sessions for the children followed by physical
      exercise, and separate bi-monthly group sessions for the parents. After six months children
      and parents go to separate group sessions once a month for six months. The control group is
      offered nutritional advice once with a brief follow-up after one month. The height and weight
      of the children is measured every month, and the fat % is measured with DEXA-scanning at
      on-set, after six months, and after twelve months
