      We evaluated whether voriconazole is a superior treatment to natamycin for filamentous fungal
      keratitis in a randomized, masked, controlled trial. This is a therapeutic exploratory study
      to investigate the safety and feasibility of conducting a larger study and to generate
      preliminary data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fungal ulcers tend to have very poor outcomes with the most common treatments, amphotericin B
      and natamycin. There has been only a single randomized trial of anti-fungal therapy for
      fungal ulcers and no new medications have been approved by the FDA since the 1960s. There are
      studies that indicate that the newer triazoles, such as voriconazole, are more effective in
      vitro against filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus spp., a common cause of fungal
      keratitis1-3. Despite a number of case reports and in vitro studies, there has been no
      systematic attempt to determine whether it is more or less effective clinically than
      natamycin, the only commercially available FDA-approved agent. There is little data available
      for physicians to make an informed, evidence-based decision on choice of antifungal.

      We evaluated whether voriconazole is a superior treatment to natamycin for filamentous fungal
      keratitis in a randomized, masked, controlled trial. This is a therapeutic exploratory study
      to investigate the safety and feasibility of conducting a larger study and to generate
      preliminary data. The primary outcome is visual acuity at 3 months from enrollment. A subset
      of patients will be followed at 4 years from enrollment.

    <measure>Best Spectacle Corrected Visual Acuity (BSCVA) 3 Months After Enrollment, Adjusting for Enrollment BSCVA in a Multiple Linear Regression Model</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was BSCVA at 3 months in the study eye, using a linear regression model with 3-month BSCVA measured in logMAR (logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution) as the outcome variable and treatment arm (voriconazole vs natamycin) and enrollment logMAR BSCVA and corneal de-epithelialization (yes or no) as covariates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Resolution of Epithelial Defect</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Resolution of epithelial defect was defined as the absence of an epithelial defect with administration of fluorescein. The time to re-epithelialization was compared between the voriconazole and natamycin groups using the Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for baseline epithelial defect size.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Size of infiltrate/scar post-treatment was analyzed in a linear regression model using enrollment infiltrate/scar size as a covariate. No differentiation was made between infiltrate and scar when measuring infiltrate/scar size (measured in mm). For analysis, infiltrate/scar size was characterized by the geometric mean of the longest dimension and the longest perpendicular.</description>

    <description>Two subgroup analyses were conducted by causative organism: 1) best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) by treatment arm among Fusarium ulcers; 2) best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) by treatment arm among Aspergillus ulcers.</description>

      <recruitment_details>From November 27, 2007 to May 12, 2008, all patients with a corneal ulcer presenting to Aravind Eye Hospital’s cornea clinics in Madurai and Pondicherry, India, were evaluated for eligibility. The Aravind Eye Care System is both a primary and tertiary care eye hospital in South India with a well-established cornea subspecialty clinic.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients with a corneal ulcer had corneal scrapings using a Kimura spatula for Gram stain and potassium hydroxide wet mount and had cultures plated on blood, chocolate, and potato dextrose agar. If all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria were met, the patient was enrolled in the study.</pre_assignment_details>
