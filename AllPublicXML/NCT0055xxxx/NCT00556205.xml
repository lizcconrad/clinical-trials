      The purpose of this research study is to further define an effective strategy for people with
      renal cell carcinoma and to learn the safety and effectiveness of two different types of
      sunitinib-refractory treatments: Bevacizumab alone or a combination of sunitinib and
      bevacizumab. Sunitinib is an FDA approved drug and is currently one of the standard
      treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma. However, some people who receive this treatment
      do not respond to treatment or they stop responding to treatment. Bevacizumab is an FDA
      approved drug used for the treatment of several cancers however, is not yet approved for use
      in renal cell carcinoma.

      -  Participants will receive one of two treatment possibilities. Since no one knows which
           of the study options is best, participants will be &quot;randomized&quot; to one fo the three
           treatment groups.

        -  Group 1 will stop their current treatment with sunitinib and receive a dose of
           bevacizumab once every 2 weeks. Group 2 will receive the standard treatment of sunitinib
           with the addition of bevacizumab.

        -  All study participants will undergo the same study procedures. These study procedures
           will include the following at intervals specified in the protocol: medical history
           review; vital signs; physical exam; urine analysis; EKG and CT scan.
