    <textblock>
      Background: Residual pulmonary regurgitation following repair of tetralogy of Fallot, in
      particular the use of a transannular patch, has been shown to correlate with the development
      of right ventricular dysfunction. Optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement, therefore,
      is important to preserve right ventricular function. Several recent studies suggested that a
      threshold of right ventricular end-diastolic volume for intervention, in order to preserve
      the likelihood of adequate reverse remodeling, is in the region of 150 to 200 ml/m2 body
      surface area. However, there is evidence that right ventricular function does not always
      recover following pulmonary valve replacement even if the end-diastolic volume is below this
      cut-off.

      In addition, previous studies suggested that early dysfunction may be present before symptoms
      occur. However, early dysfunction is difficult to assess.

      Methods: Analysis of right ventricular function by pressure-volume loops has been extensively
      evaluated in experimental studies and is generally considered the optimal way to quantify
      right ventricular function.

      By recording a family of pressure-volume loops during reduction of preload, achieved by
      temporary balloon occlusion of the inferior caval vein, the contractility can be calculated
      by the slope of the endsystolic pressure-volume relation (elastance). Changes of
      contractility following dobutamine infusion could be noted by changes of elastance. The
      increase of the slope during dobutamine demonstrates the contractility reserve of the right
      ventricle.

      Purpose: To evaluate the right ventricular contractility reserve to determine early
      ventricular dysfunction after repair of tetralogy of Fallot.
