    <textblock>
      In patients with type 2 diabetes who have not been on insulin therapy before the study will
      achieve better glycemic control by the treatment regiment consisting of two times daily
      insulin lispro mix 25 than by the treatment regiment with consisting of one time daily
      injection of insulin glargine. Improved glycemic control will be compared by the fasting
      plasma glucose and blood glucose excursions 2 hours after breakfast.

      The objective of this study is to investigate which type of insulin regimen is the best way
      to achieve best glycemic control in early type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes mellitus
      type 2 with a duration of diabetes between 1 and 10 years without previous insulin therapy
      will be randomized on insulin lispro mix 25 or insulin glargine therapy. Glycemic control
      will be compared by the between treatment difference in fasting plasma glucose and 2h
      postprandial blood glucose excursions (preprandial -postprandial excursions) after breakfast.
