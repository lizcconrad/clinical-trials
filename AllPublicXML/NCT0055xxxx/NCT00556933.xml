  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 x 2 sequential factorial study evaluates two potential improvements to the standard
      immunosuppression regimen used at the investigators' institution to prevent rejection of
      transplanted kidneys. These two potential improvements are each applied in sequence to half
      of the study patients, creating 4 study arms; the other half receive the standard treatment.
      The two potential improvements are:

        1. Administering the immunosuppression induction agent rATG (&quot;rabbit anti-thymocyte
           globulin&quot;) in a single dose at the time of transplantation, instead of in the usual
           series of 4 smaller doses over 6 days.

        2. After 6 months, modifying the maintenance immunosuppression used to prevent rejection by
           replacing the drug tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

      The two interventions, spaced sequentially six months apart, enable independent analysis of
      the two treatments so long as it can be shown that there is no synergistic interaction
      between them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two treatment innovations in this study of immunosuppression in kidney transplantation
      are aimed at making the transplanted kidney function sooner and last longer than is usual
      with standard immunosuppression regimens, but without increasing the likelihood of rejection.

      The first innovation, delivering the induction agent rATG in a single large dose rather than
      as a series of smaller doses over 6-8 days, is expected to produce better graft function
      right away, possibly by reducing some of the injury to the kidney that accompanies the
      restoration of blood flow during transplantation (&quot;reperfusion injury&quot;). Some evidence has
      been developed by investigators elsewhere to suggest this will happen.

      The second innovation, replacing tacrolimus with MMF after 6 months, is intended to eliminate
      a well-established major cause of ongoing toxic damage to the kidney. While tacrolimus does a
      good job of preventing rejection, the cost in continuing toxic injury to the kidney is high,
      leading inevitably to eventual graft failure, the inability of the transplanted kidney to
      continue filtering the blood and making adequate volumes of high-quality urine.

    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>Protocol kidney biopsies collected at approximately 12 and 24 months were scored by a transplant renal pathologist blinded to treatment group assignment for evidence of rejection, BK virus nephropathy, antibody-mediated rejection, recurrent disease, inflammation, and Banff 2005 categories of chronic renal injury. Chronic injury categories were arteriolar hyaline thickening (ah), allograft glomerulopathy (cg), interstitial fibrosis (ci), tubular atrophy (ct), and vascular fibrous intimal thickening (cv). Severity scores within each category could be 0 (&lt;5%; none or minimal), 1 (&gt;5% - &lt;25%; mild), 2 (&gt;25% - &lt;50%, moderate), or 3 (&gt;50%, severe). The proportions of patients in each severity grade (0, 1, 2, and 3) for both the individual categories and a composite were compared using Fisher's exact test.</description>

    <description>A single 6 mg/kg dose of rATG administered intravenously over 24 hours, beginning before kidney transplantation. Administration of the drug is begun as early as practical, usually after general anesthesia has been established but before surgery has started. The rATG is therefore administered for about two hours before blood flow is restored to the kidney undergoing transplantation.</description>

          <title>Single Dose rATG (6 mg/kg x 1) and Tacrolimus/Sirolimus</title>
          <description>Kidney transplant patients receive 6 mg/kg of rATG as a single dose administered intravenously over &lt;24 hours, beginning before kidney transplantation. Administration of the drug is begun as early as practical, usually after general anesthesia has been established but before surgery has started. The rATG is therefore administered for about two hours before blood flow is restored to the kidney undergoing transplantation. Chronic maintenance immunosuppression is with tacrolimus and sirolimus.
Sirolimus, oral maintenance immunosuppressant administered daily, dose adjusted according to measured serum trough levels, continued indefinitely to prevent kidney rejection
Tacrolimus: Oral maintenance immunosuppressant, taken daily, dose adjusted to maintain target blood trough levels, required indefinitely to prevent kidney rejection.</description>

          <title>Divided-dose rATG (1.5mg/kg x 4) and Tacrolimus/Sirolimus</title>
          <description>Kidney transplant patients receive 6 mg/kg rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin delivered in 4 doses of 1.5 mg/kg each, the first administered at the time of kidney transplantation. Subsequent doses are administered on days 2, 4, and 6. Chronic maintenance immunosuppression is with tacrolimus and sirolimus.
Sirolimus, oral maintenance immunosuppressant administered daily, dose adjusted according to measured serum trough levels, continued indefinitely to prevent kidney rejection

          <description>Kidney transplant receive the same treatment as in Group 1, until tacrolimus is replaced with mycophenolate mofetil after about 6 months.
Patients are switched approximately 6 months after kidney transplantation from maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus and sirolimus to maintenance with mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus. The drug is administered orally, taken daily, with dose adjusted in proportion to measured blood levels, and is required indefinitely to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney.

          <title>Adult Cadaver Donor Nyberg Grade</title>
          <description>Nyberg et al (AmJourTrans 2001; 1: 162–170) developed a deceased-donor kidney grading system to predict early graft dysfunction and failure; developed from seven donor variables (cause of death, 0–6 points; history of hypertension, 0–6; final creatinine clearance before procurement, 0–6; age, 0–6; history of diabetes mellitus, 0–3; cold ischemia time, 0–3; and severity of renal artery plaque, 0–3). It stratifies deceased-donor kidneys by score: grade A, 0–5 points; grade B, 6– 10; grade C, 11–15; and grade D, 16–32. Risk of delayed graft function was 17% in Group A and 62% in group D.</description>

        <description>Protocol kidney biopsies collected at approximately 12 and 24 months were scored by a transplant renal pathologist blinded to treatment group assignment for evidence of rejection, BK virus nephropathy, antibody-mediated rejection, recurrent disease, inflammation, and Banff 2005 categories of chronic renal injury. Chronic injury categories were arteriolar hyaline thickening (ah), allograft glomerulopathy (cg), interstitial fibrosis (ci), tubular atrophy (ct), and vascular fibrous intimal thickening (cv). Severity scores within each category could be 0 (&lt;5%; none or minimal), 1 (&gt;5% - &lt;25%; mild), 2 (&gt;25% - &lt;50%, moderate), or 3 (&gt;50%, severe). The proportions of patients in each severity grade (0, 1, 2, and 3) for both the individual categories and a composite were compared using Fisher’s exact test.</description>

rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin: A single 6 mg/kg dose of rATG administered intravenously over 24 hours, beginning before kidney transplantation. Administration of the drug is begun as early as practical, usually after general anesthesia has been established but before surgery has started. The rATG is therefore administered for about two hours before blood flow is restored to the kidney undergoing transplantation.
sirolimus: Oral maintenance immunosuppressant administered daily, dose adjusted according to measured serum trough levels, continued indefinitely to prevent kidney rejection

The proportions of patients in each severity grade (0, 1, 2, and 3) for both the individual categories and a composite were compared using Fisher’s exact test.</description>
