  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The classic Goldmann applanation tonometer has been further developed. The applanation
      principle has been retained, while the internal force transmission and the pressure gauging
      have been optimized, and the display of results digitized.

      The purpose of the study is to compare the standard Goldmann applanation tonometer AT900 with
      the new version of the device, and to test the reliability and reproducibility of
      measurements, as well as its safety.

      measurements, as well as its safety.

      Patients at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bern, will be included after
      informed consent. The study has been approved by the local ethical committee. Routine
      ophthalmologic examination will be performed and inclusion criteria evaluated. Measurements
      will be taken with the two tonometers in random order. Prior to pressure measurement, central
      corneal thickness will be measured with a non-contact method (Optical Low Coherence
      Reflectometry, OLCR pachymeter, Haag-Streit, Koeniz, Switzerland).
