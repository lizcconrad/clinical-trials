    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this thirteen-week, open-label study is to test the hypothesis that
      quetiapine in combination with Oros methylphenidate will reduce aggressive symptoms in
      children and adolescents who have shown inadequate response to OROS methylphenidate alone.

      Informed consent will be obtained from the subject and parent or legal guardian before any
      study procedures begin. Study procedures will include the verification of inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, and completion of assessments and safety measures (physical examination,
      vital signs, adverse events and concomitant medication review, AIMS, laboratory tests, ECG,
      pregnancy test) as indicated in the Schedule of Events. All laboratory and electrocardiogram
      results must be reviewed by a physician before the subject returns for Visit 2.

      Study Period II (Visits 2-5)

      All subjects meeting entry criteria will initially receive Oros methylphenidate beginning at
      Visit 2. The Oros methylphenidate will be titrated over 3 visits according to the following
      schedule:

        -  Visit 2 dose of 18 mg QAM

        -  Visit 3 dose of 36mg QAM

        -  Visit 4 dose of 54mg QAM.

        -  At Visit 5, any subjects unable to tolerate continuation of the Oros methylphenidate
           dose of 54mg QAM or subjects that meet improvement criteria as defined above will be
           discontinued from the study. Subjects able to tolerate the daily dose of 54mg Oros
           methylphenidate and who do not meet improvement criteria at Visit 5 will begin receiving
           quetiapine in addition to continuing Oros methylphenidate at 54mg QAM for the balance of
           the study. The initial dose of quetiapine dispensed at Visit 5 will be 25mg QAM for one
           day with an increase to 25mg BID until Visit 6.

      At each visit safety and efficacy information will be completed according to the Schedule of
      Events.

      Study Period III (Visits 6-10) Quetiapine will be titrated at Visits 6 - 9 according to the
      parameters in the quetiapine dosing schedule and the completion of safety and efficacy
      measures listed in the Schedule of Events. A telephone follow-up with the parent or legal
      guardian will be made 7-9 days after Visit 8 for physician review of subject adverse events
      and safety.

      At visit 10 subjects will be given clinical recommendations for follow-up care from a
      physician investigator after completion of all study procedures (labs/EKG, vital signs,
      physical exam, AIMS, ADHD-RS-IV, CGI-I, CGI-S, RAAPP, MOAS, SNAP, CCPT)

    <measure>RAAPP: Rating of Aggression Against People and/or Property Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>See Arm/Group - Repeated Measures</time_frame>
    <description>The RAAPP is a global rating scale of aggression that is completed by a clinician based on interview and observation data. It is scored from 1 (no aggression reported) to 5 (intolerable behavior).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CGI-S: Clinical Global Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>See Arm/Group - Repeated Measures</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 1-7 investigator rating of overall severity of target behavioral symptoms, which will be completed at each visit as a secondary efficacy measure of global behavioral functioning. A score of 1 indicates &quot;normal, not ill at all&quot; and a score of 7 indicates &quot;among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>See arm/group - repeated measures</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS) is a clinician-rated scale of aggressive outbursts experienced in the past week. Weightings are assigned for severity and frequency of aggression. MOAS total severity score will be completed as a secondary efficacy measure of aggressive behavior. The range for the MOAS is 0-235. A score of 0 indicates &quot;no aggression&quot; and a score of 235 indicates &quot;the most severe and frequent aggressive outbursts&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Swanson, Nolan and Pelham IV (SNAP-IV) Oppositional-Defiant Disorder Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>See arm/group - repeated measures analysis</time_frame>
    <description>The Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP-IV) is a 90-item, parent-completed questionnaire consisting of symptoms of ADHD, aggression, depression, and mania. Parents rate each item from 0(not at all) to 3 (very much) based on their child's behavior during the past week. The scores from the Oppositional-Defiant Disorder section of this questionnaire will be used as secondary efficacy measures of parent-reported aggressive behavior. These scores range from 0-24.</description>

    <measure>Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale -IV- Parent Version (ADHDRS-IV-Parent Version)</measure>
    <time_frame>See Arm/Group - repeated measures</time_frame>
    <description>The Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale -IV- Parent Version (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv) (Faries, Yalcin, Harder, &amp; Heiligenstein, 2001) is an interviewer-administered semi structured interview with the parent, focusing on the 18 DSM-IV symptoms. Ratings are made on a 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often) scale. The range of the ADHDRS-IV is 0-54. A zero (0) scores indicates no ADHD symptoms and 54 indicates most severe ADHD symptoms. The ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv provides an overall severity score, symptom count, and ADHD diagnosis for the child.</description>

          <description>This is the Baseline Visit, immediately after enrollment and prior to taking any medication. All enrolled subjects start taking OROS methylphenidate until Visit 5. At visit 5, if there is significant improvement (decrease in aggressive symptoms), then subject is discontinued from the study. If there is not significant improvement, then subject continues in study and begins taking OROS methylphenidate plus quetiapine. 24 of 30 subjects entered the OROS methylphenidate and quetiapine arm. 4 subjects made significant improvement at visit 5 and were discontinued from the study; 2 subjects were withdrawn from the study prior to visit 5. Therefore, 6 of 30 subjects did not enter the OROS methylphenidate and quetiapine arm. Only 24 of 30 subjects entered this arm.

Therefore, 6 of 30 subjects did not enter the OROS methylphenidate and quetiapine arm. Only 24 of 30 subjects entered this arm.</description>

        <title>Swanson, Nolan and Pelham IV (SNAP-IV) Oppositional-Defiant Disorder Subscale</title>
        <description>The Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP-IV) is a 90-item, parent-completed questionnaire consisting of symptoms of ADHD, aggression, depression, and mania. Parents rate each item from 0(not at all) to 3 (very much) based on their child's behavior during the past week. The scores from the Oppositional-Defiant Disorder section of this questionnaire will be used as secondary efficacy measures of parent-reported aggressive behavior. These scores range from 0-24.</description>

        <population>Participants were those who qualified for the augmentation portion of the study (inadequate response to Oros MPH alone). Analysis was per protocol (intent-to-treat, LOCF).</population>

        <description>The Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale -IV- Parent Version (ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv) (Faries, Yalcin, Harder, &amp; Heiligenstein, 2001) is an interviewer-administered semi structured interview with the parent, focusing on the 18 DSM-IV symptoms. Ratings are made on a 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often) scale. The range of the ADHDRS-IV is 0-54. A zero (0) scores indicates no ADHD symptoms and 54 indicates most severe ADHD symptoms. The ADHDRS-IV-Parent:Inv provides an overall severity score, symptom count, and ADHD diagnosis for the child.</description>

          <description>All enrolled subjects start taking OROS methylphenidate. At visit 5, if there is significant improvement (decrease in aggressive symptoms), then subject is discontinued from the study. If there is not significant improvement, then subject continues in study and begins taking OROS methylphenidate plus quetiapine. Therefore enters the OROS methylphenidate and quetiapine arm. 24 of 30 subjects entered the OROS methylphenidate and quetiapine arm. 4 subjects made significant improvement at visit 5 and were discontinued from the study, and, therefore, did not enter the OROS methylphenidate and quetiapine arm. 2 subjects were withdrawn from the study prior to visit 5, and, therefore, did not enter the OROS methylphenidate and quetiapine arm. Therefore, 6 of 30 subjects did not enter the OROS methylphenidate and quetiapine arm. Only 24 of 30 subjects entered this arm.</description>
