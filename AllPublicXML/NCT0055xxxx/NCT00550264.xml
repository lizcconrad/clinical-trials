  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to inpatient medicine services often require early hospital readmission,
      and often they are readmitted to different physician or team, potentially without the
      knowledge of the prior physician or team. Thus, physicians may lose the opportunity to share
      valuable information about readmitted patients, which may be detrimental to continuity of
      care and patient safety. The purpose of this study is to determine baseline awareness and
      communication rates among physicians regarding readmissions, and then measure the effect of
      automatic notification on these rates.
