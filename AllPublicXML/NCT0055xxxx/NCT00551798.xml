      Predicting response to chemotherapy in patients with Hodgkin's disease or lymphoma high-grade
      malignant de novo or recurrence.

      The non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and high-grade Hodgkin's disease may show resistance to
      chemotherapy, regardless of their initial extension. The failure of treatment is most often
      correlated with an incomplete answer or lack of response to chemotherapy as a result
      chemoresistance. This drug, which may involve the gene MDR1 (multidrug resistance) encoding
      the protein PGP, can be studied in vivo by MIBI scan. The MIBI is behind a tracer
      perfusionnel used routinely to explore myocardial perfusion, but it has other characteristics
      of fixing, which can be used in oncological imaging (fixation by glial tumors of high
      grade).Prospective Study, which includes conducting a tomoscintigraphie 30 minutes after
      injection of 20 mCi of 99mTc-MIBI in initial stock or relapse of high-grade lymphoma and
      Hodgkin's disease any stage (I-IV). Fixing the MIBI is compared with morphological
      abnormalities detected by CT and the setting of lesions by 18FDG. Patients will be treated in
      a traditional way, without changes in treatment protocols used in routine. Patients with a
      negative MIBI scan, will be watched with particular attention in order to detect insufficient
      response to chemotherapy. The only change, the care of patients, only for the achievement of
      an initial consideration of non-invasive imaging, further, which is the tomoscintigraphie the
      MIBI. Of the tumor samples, will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry, the expression of PGP
      and the MRP1 (two proteins associated with the drug). On blood, may be carried out genotyping
      of MDR1, MRP1 and MRP2 to the patient.
