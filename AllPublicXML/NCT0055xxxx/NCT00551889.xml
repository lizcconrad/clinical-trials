      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Celecoxib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving cyclophosphamide together with celecoxib may help kill more
      cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of celecoxib when
      given together with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To describe the toxicities of oral cyclophosphamide when administered with escalating
           doses of celecoxib in patients with advanced malignancies.

        -  To evaluate the effects of this regimen on plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth
           factor.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of celecoxib.

      In the first course, patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-35 and oral
      celecoxib twice daily on days 8-35. In all subsequent courses, patients receive oral
      cyclophosphamide once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, periodically during treatment, and at time of tumor
      progression. Samples are analyzed for vascular endothelial growth factor levels and stored
      for future analysis of circulating DNA of angiogenic biomarkers.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
