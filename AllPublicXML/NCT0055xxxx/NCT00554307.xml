  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how the medications which are used to close the
      patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants affect brain, kidney and gut blood flow
      when compared to infants that are not treated with these medications. The medications being
      used for PDA closure are indomethacin and neoprofen.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All babies requiring medical treatment of their PDA will receive up to 3 doses of medication.
      For babies enrolled in the control group of this study, she/he will not be treated with
      either of these medicines.
