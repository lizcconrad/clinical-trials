      Some HIV-infected individuals have a white blood cell marker known as HLA-B*57 that appears
      to help control the progress of the disease; however, not all who have the HLA-B*57 marker
      are able to control the infection. This study will examine the effects of giving white blood
      cells with HLA-B*57 from an individual who controls HIV infection to an individual who cannot
      control HIV infection, as a form of HIV treatment. All candidates will be screened with a
      medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.

      Both donor and recipient volunteers must be HIV-positive individuals 18 years of age or older
      who have the HLA-B*57 marker and are receiving care. Donor candidates must have positive HIV
      antibody tests for at least seven years with a recent CD4 cell count greater than 400
      cells/mm?, HIV viral load less than 50 copies/mL, and no previous HIV viral load greater than
      1,000 copies/mL. Recipient candidates must have positive HIV antibody tests with a recent CD4
      cell count less than 400 cells/mm? and HIV viral load greater than 10,000 copies/mL, and must
      have failed at least two prior combination antiretroviral regimes and are willing to receive
      or resume combination antiretroviral therapy. Donor volunteers will be excluded if they have
      taken certain antiretrovirals drugs, have a medical history of cancer or of other blood-borne
      illnesses, or have other medical conditions that might interfere with the study. Recipient
      volunteers will be excluded if they have a medical history of malignant cancer or other
      medical conditions that might possibly interfere with the study.

      Donors will undergo apheresis to separate white blood cells from circulating blood before the
      red blood cells and plasma are returned to the bloodstream. The procedure will take up to
      five hours, and donors will be required to return for additional tests. Donors may be asked
      to return for further white blood cell donations, a maximum of six procedures per year.

      Recipients will undergo apheresis to obtain stem cells for possible use in the study, and
      will be admitted to an NIH Clinical Center inpatient unit to receive an infusion of white
      blood cells and undergo a series of blood tests both before and after the infusion. The
      infusion process will take two hours. After being discharged, recipients will be asked to
      return to the Clinical Center for monitoring and follow-up tests, and may receive further
      infusions.

      Improvements in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)
      treatments in the United States have made the disease in many cases a chronic illness.
      However, many individuals have failed multiple lines of standard therapy, and thus,
      development of new modes of salvage treatment is crucial. Restriction of viral replication,
      mediated by CD8+ cells, appears to play an important role in control of HIV replication. A
      subset of individuals, many of whom possess human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*57 exhibit
      restriction of HIV type 1 viral replication to less than 50 copies/mL, presumably by a
      mechanism that is CD8+ T-cell mediated, and become elite long-term non-progressors (LTNP),
      who have no evidence of progressive immunodeficiency and no development of opportunistic
      complications during many years of follow-up. Other individuals, including those with
      HLA-B*57 show no evidence of control of HIV replication, and without antiretroviral therapy
      will develop progressive immunodeficiency and HIV-related opportunistic complications. In
      this exploratory study, we are investigating a novel cell transfer strategy: up to 3 patients
      with HIV infection have failed at least 2 standard regimens of antiretroviral therapy, have a
      CD4+ count under 200 cells/mm (3), and a plasma HIV viral load of greater than 10,000
      copies/mL, will be administered 10 (10) peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained by
      lymphapheresis from an &quot;elite&quot; LTNP matched to the recipient on at least one HLA-B allele. Up
      to 70 patients may be enrolled for screening to identify 3 donors and 3 recipients. Up to 3
      infusions may be administered per patient, with each infusion occurring no more frequently
      than every 3 months. The primary endpoints will be the safety of the infusions and the
      survival of donor cells in the recipient. Changes in the recipient s CD4+ and CD8+ cell
      number, other immune parameters, and plasma HIV viral load will also be monitored closely for
      evidence of anti-HIV activity.
