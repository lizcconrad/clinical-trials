  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a validated target for the treatment of
      cancer, and agents targeting EGFR such as erlotinib (Tarceva®) are approved by the FDA for
      treatment of various solid tumors. AV-412 is a novel inhibitor of the EGFR-tyrosine kinase,
      with added activity against Her2 and other oncogenic kinases. Based on evidence of
      preclinical activity in various solid tumors, AV-412 is being developed as a possible novel
      treatment for cancer in humans.

      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of AV-412, and
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of AV-412 when administered orally three times weekly.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation trial, and all subjects will receive oral AV-412
      administered three times weekly or once weekly for 4 weeks (1 cycle) to evaluate safety and
      tolerability of AV-412. Treatment duration will be a minimum of 2 consecutive dosing cycles
      (8 weeks), if tolerated.

        -  Upon completion of the 2 cycles, subjects with documented stable disease or an objective
           response may continue to receive therapy at the same dose and schedule previously
           utilized, as long as tolerability is acceptable, for up to 1 year. Treatment beyond 1
           year from the time of enrollment will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis between the
           sponsor and investigator.

        -  Subjects experiencing unacceptable toxicities or with documented disease progression
           will be discontinued from further participation in the study Accrual to next cohort will
           occur only after acceptable tolerance has been demonstrated throughout Cycle 1, and only
           after consultation with medical monitor.
