  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study prospectively compares two treatment algorithms for newly diagnosed Crohn's
      disease: one 'aggressive' treatment with early introduction of immunomodulators and
      biologicals and one 'standard treatment' with corticosteroids and only later introduction of
      immunosuppressives and biologicals if disease activity requires that.

      This two year open-label randomized trial compares the early use of combined
      immunosuppression to conventional management in patients with active Crohn's disease who have
      not previously received glucocorticoids, antimetabolites, or infliximab. Patients assigned to
      combined immunosuppression receive azathioprine and 3 infusions of 5 milligrams per kilogram
      of body weight of infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Retreatment with infliximab and, if
      ultimately necessary, corticosteroids are used to control disease activity. Patients assigned
      to conventional management receive corticosteroids followed, in sequence, by azathioprine and
      infliximab. The primary outcome measure is remission without corticosteroids and without
      bowel resection at weeks 26 and 52.

    <description>Patients received three infusions of infliximab 5 milligrams per kilogram (weeks 0, 2 and 6) in combination with azathioprine 2-2.5 milligrams per kilogram per day from day 0 onwards. If the patients responded and tolerated both drugs, azathioprine was continued for the duration of the trial. Patients who were intolerant to azathioprine received methotrexate at an initial dose of 25 milligrams administered subcutaneously each week for 12 weeks with dose reduction to 15 milligrams per week thereafter. Following initial therapy, patients who developed worsening symptoms were retreated with additional infusions of infliximab. If symptoms persisted methylprednisolone was initiated and azathioprine or methotrexate was continued.</description>

    <description>Induction with methylprednisolone (MP) or budesonide (BUD): MP 32 mg/day for 3 weeks was followed by tapering by 4 mg per week to 0; BUD 9 mg per day for 8 weeks with tapering to 0 by 3 mg per week thereafter.Patients who worsened during the tapering had the dose increased to the initial dose and tapered again. If patients worsened, azathioprine (2-2.5 mg per day) was introduced. Patients who relapsed following withdrawal of steroids received a second course in combination with azathioprine. For patients who failed 4 weeks of steroids, MP dose was given at 64 mg/day for 2 weeks, tapered by 8 mg per week; azathioprine was added. Patients who remained symptomatic despite 16 weeks of azathioprine received infliximab (5 mg/kg IV at weeks 0, 2 and 6). Patients who relapsed despite methotrexate or those intolerant to both azathioprine and methotrexate also received infliximab, without antimetabolite therapy. Infliximab was repeated upon relapse of symptoms in these patients.</description>
