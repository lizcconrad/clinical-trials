  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, interventional, multi-center, randomized, assessor-blind,
      active-comparator, dose-finding study to evaluate a new investigational long-acting follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH) in oligo-anovulatory women undergoing ovulation induction (OI).
      This study will compare 4 doses of the investigational drug versus a currently marketed drug
      follitropin alfa (Gonal-f ®) prefilled pen with regards to ovulation rate.

      The study was terminated after Merck Serono had taken the decision not to pursue the
      development of AS900672-enriched in ovulation induction (OI). This decision was not related
      to any safety or efficacy concerns over the use of AS900672-Enriched in OI.
