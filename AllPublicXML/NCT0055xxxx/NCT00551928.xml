             for the duration of the study.

          -  Negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-HCG) pregnancy test both 24 hours
             prior to beginning of therapy and then at 4 weeks intervals in women with regular
             menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles during
             study treatment for subjects of childbearing potential

          -  Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or
             abstinence) during study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks
             after discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy.

          -  Patient was diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma based on standard criteria
             (9), and has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum monoclonal

          -  Previous treatment with anti-myeloma therapy (does not include radiotherapy,
             bisphosphonates, or a single short course of steroid; &lt; to the equivalent of
             dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days).

          -  Any serious medical condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities,
