      The use of these catheters is associated with infectious complications that are an important
      iatrogenic source of morbidity and mortality. Certofix® protect is a catheter with a surface
      modified in order to reduce colonization by bacteria. This clinical trial is performed to
      compare the safety and efficacy of the coated central venous catheter, Certofix® protect,
      with that of the non-coated standard catheter Certofix®.

    <textblock>
      Central venous catheters are an essential part of patient management in the ICU (Intensive
      Care Unit). The use of these catheters is associated with infectious complications that are
      an important iatrogenic source of morbidity and mortality. Many catheters become colonized
      with bacteria but only a proportion of colonised catheters go on to cause bacteriemia and
      sepsis. It is currently impossible to prospectively identify which of the catheters will
      become colonized and lead to sepsis. Various types of antiseptic or antimicrobial vascular
      catheter coatings have been developed. Studies showed that the coated catheters were
      effective in limiting the catheter colonization rate and that they may decrease the risk of
      catheter-related bloodstream infections. The &quot;Certofix protect&quot; was developed by B.Braun to
      reduce the risk of catheter related infections. It is a catheter with a modified surface that
      consists of a high molecular weight polymer which is non-covalently linked to the
      polyurethane catheter material. This clinical trial is performed to compare the safety and
      efficacy of the coated central venous catheter, Certofix® protect, with that of the
      non-coated standard catheter Certofix®.
