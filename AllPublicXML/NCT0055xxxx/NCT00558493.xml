          -  Patients who have compensated liver disease (Child-Pugh score =&lt;6)

          -  Patients without LMV resistant mutation by RFMP assay

          -  Patients who have NOT experienced viral breakthrough at consecutive two measurements
             (at least one month apart) during lamivudine monotherapy

          -  Patients who can submit the written consent and comply with the claims postulated of
             this clinical trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently receiving antiviral except LMV or corticosteroid therapy

          -  Patients that previously received antiviral treatment for hepatitis B other than
             lamivudine in the proceeding 12 months

          -  Previous treatment with interferon or other immunomodulatory therapies must have ended
             at least 6 months preceding the study screening

          -  Treatment with nephrotoxic drugs, competitors of renal excretion, and/or hepatotoxic

          -  Serious concurrent medical conditions

          -  Prior organ transplantation

          -  Patient has creatinine clearance less than 60mL/min as estimated by the following
             formula:

        [(140-age in years) (body weight [kg])] / [(72) (serum creatinine] [mg/dL])[Note: multiply
        estimates by 0.85 for women]
