    <measure>Change From Baseline in Adenoid/Choana (A/C) Index Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (visit 2), Weeks 4 (visit 3), Week 8 (visit 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in adenoid size were assessed by nasopharyngoscopic examination and were determined using the Adenoid/Choana (A/C) Index. Grades were assigned to intervals of A/C ratio percentages: grade I (0-25%), II (26-50%), III (51-75%) and IV (76-100%). Changes in adenoid size were expressed as the mean difference between grades at baseline and study visit. Positive values indicated a decrease in adenoid size, a 0 value indicated that size remained the same, and negative values indicated an increase in adenoid size.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Adenoid/Choana (A/C) Index Grade</title>
        <description>Changes in adenoid size were assessed by nasopharyngoscopic examination and were determined using the Adenoid/Choana (A/C) Index. Grades were assigned to intervals of A/C ratio percentages: grade I (0-25%), II (26-50%), III (51-75%) and IV (76-100%). Changes in adenoid size were expressed as the mean difference between grades at baseline and study visit. Positive values indicated a decrease in adenoid size, a 0 value indicated that size remained the same, and negative values indicated an increase in adenoid size.</description>

        <title>Total Severity Symptom Scores: Morning and Evening (AM &amp; PM)</title>
        <description>Symptoms were assessed by whole-number linear scale to grade their severity. Scores were recorded AM &amp; PM (a difference of 12 hours) &amp; were based on severity within 12 hours of prior recording. The following symptoms were evaluated: Snoring; Nasal obstruction &amp; discharge; Breathing difficulty; Oral respiration; Ear pain. Severity was graded according to the following scale: 0=absent; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe. Severity was scored individually and summed to obtain the Total Symptom Severity Score. The maximum total score possible was 36 daily; 18 for both AM (6 symptoms times max severity of 3)and PM.</description>

        <title>Acoustic Rhinometry Results- Minimal Cross-Sectional Area: Left and Right Nasal Fossa</title>
        <description>Acoustic rhinometry examination of the left &amp; right Nasal Fossa was performed by principal investigators at baseline &amp; each visit throughout treatment in participants ages 7-11 years. Acoustic rhinometry is a technique intended for assessment of the geometry of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx and for evaluating nasal obstruction. The technique is based on an analysis of sound waves reflected from the nasal cavities.
Measurements were taken for each side of the nose (nasopharyngeal minimum cross-sectional area) &amp; were reported in cm^3.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ)- Impact on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) Results of: Mild, Moderate, or Severe</title>
        <description>PSQ consists of 90 variables divided into 3 different factors:snoring, somnolence, and behavior. All positive Snoring and Somnolence answers scored with Yes=1 and No=0, and scores averaged to obtain a total score between 0.00 and 1.00. Behavior factor scored between 1-3, and scores averaged for total score of 1 to 3. Increased scores indicate increasing abnormality of sleep. Based on determined cut-offs, participants were categorized as having mild, moderate, or severe discomfort due to interference of sleep.</description>

        <description>The impact on quality of life (QOL) was measured by a general pediatric health questionnaire. Versions were self-administered &amp; answered by participants' parents. This modular instrument consists of 21 items using a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. 4 dimensions (physical, emotional, social, &amp; school functioning) are scored. Total score is sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the scales. Higher scores indicate a better health related QOL.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life Questionnaire (PedsQL) Total Score (Ages 8-12)</title>
        <description>The impact on quality of life (QOL) was measured by a general pediatric health questionnaire. Versions were self-administered &amp; answered by participants' parents. This modular instrument consists of 23 items using a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. 4 dimensions (physical, emotional, social, &amp; school functioning) are scored. Total score is sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the scales. Higher scores indicate a better health related QOL.</description>

        <title>Obstructive Sleep Apnea-18 (OSA-18) Questionnaire Total Score</title>
        <description>18 items of the survey were graded on a 7-point ordinal scale. Caregivers were asked to describe how often in the last 4 weeks had the child exhibited specific symptoms according to the following scale: 1: none of the time; 2: hardly any of the time; 3: a little of the time; 4: some of the time; 5: a good bit of the time; 6: most of the time; 7: all of the time. All scores were summed (total score: 18-126).
Grading was as follows:
Scores &lt; 60 suggest a slight impact on health related quality of life (HRQL)
Scores 60-80 suggest a moderate impact
Scores over 80 suggest a great impact</description>
