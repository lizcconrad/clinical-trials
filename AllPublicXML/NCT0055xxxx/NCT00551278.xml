      The purpose of this trial is to show adequate assay performance on clinical samples tested in
      real time at the clinical site.

      This study will determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and
      positive predictive value of the GeneSearch™ BLN Assay in patient samples by comparing its
      performance to that of the current methods -- permanent section Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E)
      staining with IHC. Additional marker testing using probes associated with nodal metastases
      may be used in the assay performance calculations. The observed performance measures will be
      compared to those obtained in the larger U.S. registration trial to show that there are no
      differences in the assay's performance.

    <description>For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The GeneSearch™ Breast Lymph Node (BLN) Assay is a qualitative, in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid detection of greater than 0.2 mm metastases in nodal tissue removed from sentinel lymph node biopsies of breast cancer patients. Results from the assay can be used to guide the intra‑operative or post-operative decision to remove additional lymph nodes.
Post-operative histological evaluation of permanent sections of the tissue specimen, in accordance with usual diagnostic practice and using the Veridex lymph node cutting scheme, is required.</description>
