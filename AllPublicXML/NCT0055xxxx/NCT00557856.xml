  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of PF-03446962 when given
      as a single agent. Tumors require new blood vessels to support their ability to grow and to
      spread (metastasize). New treatments aimed at preventing these blood vessels have the ability
      to improve the clinical management of cancer.

    <time_frame>Cycle 1 of Day 1 up to 28 days after the last dose of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Seriousness of an AE was assessed as serious adverse event (SAE) and non-serious adverse event (non-SAE). An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Non-SAE included all AE minus SAE. Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response: Part 1 and Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline then 6 weeks after Cycle 1 of Day1 thereafter every 6 weeks up to Day 490</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions. PR defined as &gt;=30 % decrease in sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions.</description>

    <description>Participants who achieved either a confirmed complete Response or confirmed partial response or a Stable disease lasting at least 12 weeks from the first dose was defined as achieving disease control. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR: disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions. PR: &gt;=30 % decrease in sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD and stable disease: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the LD according to RECIST associated to non-progressive disease response for non-target lesions. Percentage of participants achieving disease control was calculated out of the participants participating in the exploratory phase.</description>

TTP was calculated as (first event date or last known progression-free date minus the date of treatment plus 1) divided by 30.44. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD] per RECIST). PD: &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the LD of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the LD or the appearance of one or more new lesions and as unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions. TTP was calculated out of the participants participating in the exploratory phase.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) Based on Severity: Part 1 and Part 2</title>
        <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed according to severity; Grade 0 (no change from normal); grade 1 (mild AE which did not cause any significant problem, no dose adjustment required); grade 2 (moderate AE which caused problem that did not interfere significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, dose adjustment needed due to adverse event); grade 3 (severe AE which caused problem that interfered significantly with usual activities or the clinical status, study drug stopped due to adverse event); grade 4 (life threatening AE) and grade 5 (death). Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Seriousness of an AE was assessed as serious adverse event (SAE) and non-serious adverse event (non-SAE). An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Non-SAE included all AE minus SAE. Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <title>Circulating Endothelial Cells (CEC)and Circulating Endothelial Progenitors (CEP): Part 1 and Part 2</title>
        <description>Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are noninvasive marker of vascular damage, remodeling, and dysfunction. Blood samples for the assessment of CECs and circulating CEPs were collected to analyze effects of therapy on the number, viability/apoptotic state, and/or target activity/expression in CECs. Circulating Cells were classified as CEPs if cluster differentiation 133 positive cells (CD133+) were detected.</description>
