      The purpose of this study is to determine whether HPN-100 is safe and tolerable in subjects
      with Urea Cycle Disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When protein is broken down in the body, nitrogen is formed. In healthy individuals, the body
      combines this nitrogen with other molecules to create a harmless substance called urea, which
      is excreted in the urine. Patients with Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) are unable to create as
      much urea from nitrogen, and therefore, toxic levels of nitrogen can accumulate in the body,
      causing harm. To treat these patients, doctors usually have the patient consume less protein
      and supplement certain amino acids that may be lacking. A drug called Buphenyl® is sometimes
      prescribed as an adjunctive treatment for the chronic maintenance of UCD patients in order to
      keep ammonia levels down. Some issues with Buphenyl® include a high pill burden (up to 40
      pills per day), bad taste and odor, and high sodium content. Like Buphenyl®, HPN-100 provides
      an alternate way for the body to dispose of nitrogen, other than through the urea cycle.
      Unlike Buphenyl®, HPN-100 is an odorless, tasteless, concentrated oil that does not contain
      large amounts of sodium.

    <description>Buphenyl treatment for one week was followed by dose escalation to HPN-100. Dose of Buphenyl was gradually decreased while HPN-100 dose was gradually increased until subject reached dosing of 100% HPN-100.

    <description>Subjects will be taking prescribed dose of Buphenyl® TID (not to exceed 20g/day) at least two weeks prior to enrollment. Subjects will take prescribed dose of Buphenyl® TID for first week of study, and then switch over to HPN-100 TID during a dose-escalation phase. The dose of HPN-100 will be increased and the dose of Buphenyl® will be decreased each week by 50 mg/kg until entire daily dose of phenylbutyrate is HPN-100. Target HPN-100 dose will contain the same amount of phenylbutyrate as the subject's prescribed daily dose of Buphenyl®. Subject will take HPN-100 alone for one week and then switch back to previous dose of Buphenyl for the last week of the study.</description>
