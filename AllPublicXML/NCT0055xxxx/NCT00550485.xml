  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ABCB1-gene product P-glycoprotein is an integral membrane protein that actively
      transports substrates out of the intracellular compartment. One of the major sites of its
      action is the blood-brain-barrier. It is highly expressed in brain capillary endothelial
      cells and involved in limiting the access of substrates such as antidepressants to the
      central nervous system. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the ABCB1-gene was recently
      identified showing a different treatment response to antidepressant drugs depending on the
      genotype. Therefore, it is assumed that healthy subjects with different genotypes of that SNP
      will be associated with significantly different brain levels of the antidepressant
      escitalopram after 6 days of intake. Sleep recordings are a useful bio-marker for effects of
      antidepressants on the CNS. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. escitalopram) cause
      a suppression of REM sleep and a stronger fragmentation of sleep compared to untreated
      subjects. Higher plasma levels of antidepressants affected the sleep to a greater extent than
      lower levels. In line with this finding, we suppose that sleep EEG recordings of healthy
      subjects with different genotypes of the above mentioned SNP will be differently affected
      after taking 6 days escitalopram. In addition, effects of drug intake on the gene expression
      in lymphocytes and metabolic changes will be assessed.
