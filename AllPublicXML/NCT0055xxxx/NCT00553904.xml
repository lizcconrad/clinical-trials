    <textblock>
      A pilot study of 15 subjects will be completed to determine whether acute consumption of
      cranberry juice has an effect on endothelial function. We will then complete a randomized,
      double blind, placebo controlled crossover study designed to investigate the effects of
      cranberry juice consumption on endothelial function. Participants (n=40) will drink 480 ml of
      double strength cranberry juice or a similar appearing and tasting placebo per day for four
      weeks. After a two week rest period, they will cross over to the other beverage. We will
      examine endothelial function before and after each of the two treatment periods. The study
      will provide information about the chronic vascular effects of cranberry juice.

          -  Coronary artery disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant and lactating women

          -  Clinical history of other major illness including end-stage cancer, renal failure,
             hepatic failure, gastrointestinal disorders that may impair absorption, or other
             conditions that in the opinion of the principal investigator make a clinical study

          -  History of a psychological illness or condition such as to interfere with the

          -  Treatment with Vitamin E, Vitamin C, beta carotene, lipoic acid, or other food or
             herbal supplements within 2 weeks of enrollment (subjects taking multivitamins or
             other forms of vitamin E and C in doses that do not exceed two times the RDA will not
             be excluded).
