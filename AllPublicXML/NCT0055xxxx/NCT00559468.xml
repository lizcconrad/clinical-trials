      The objective of the trial was to show equivalence in recovery from neuromuscular block after
      a single dose of 4.0 mg.kg-1 Org 25969, administered at T1 3-10% after continuous infusion of
      rocuronium, between subjects receiving maintenance anesthesia using propofol and subjects
      receiving sevoflurane, to investigate the safety and to compare the plasma levels of
      rocuronium in subjects after continuous infusion of rocuronium and before the administration
      of Org 25969, under either propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects at least 20 years but under 65 years of age;

          -  Subjects of ASA class 1-3;

          -  Subjects scheduled for a surgical procedure under general anesthesia requiring
             neuromuscular relaxation with the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) with an
             anticipated duration of surgery between 2 and 5 hours;

          -  Subjects scheduled for a surgical procedure in supine position;

          -  Subjects who had given written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have a (family) history of malignant hyperthermia;

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have an allergy to medications used during general
             anesthesia;

          -  Subjects receiving medication interfering with NMBAs, such as antibiotics,
             anticonvulsants and Mg2+; based on the dose and time of administration;

          -  Pregnant or lactating females;

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential not using any birth control or using only
             hormonal contraception as birth control;

             Org 25959;

          -  Subjects who had participated in another clinical trial, not pre-approved by Organon,
             within 30 days of entering into CT 19.4.312.
