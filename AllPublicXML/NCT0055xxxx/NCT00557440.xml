  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide data about the 24 hours FEV1 profile, safety and
      tolerability of indacaterol/mometasone TWISTHALER device compared to placebo and using
      fluticasone/salmeterol as an active control.

    <measure>Change From Period Baseline to 24 Hour Post-dose (Trough) Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose for each Treatment Period (Days 1, 8 and 15) and 24-hours post-dose for each Treatment Period (Days 2, 9 and 16).</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. Change from the period baseline to 24 hour post dose trough FEV1 after 1 day of treatment was analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for treatment, period, sequence and center with period baseline as a covariate and patient nested within sequence as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Standardized Area Under the Curve (AUC) Between Baseline (Pre-dose) and 24 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 5, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4 hours, 11 hours 10 minutes, 11 hours 45 minutes, 12 hours 30 minutes, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 hours, 23 hours 10 minutes, and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dosing.</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. FEV1 was measured pre-dose and up to 24 hours post-dose. The FEV1 standardized area under the curve (AUC) was analyzed for four time intervals:
Baseline (pre-dose) to 4 hours (hr) post-dosing;
Baseline (pre-dose) to 23 hours, 45 minutes (min) post-dosing;
11 hours, 10 minutes to 12 hours, 30 minutes post-dosing;
11 hours, 10 minutes to 23 hours, 45 minutes post-dosing.
AUC for FEV1 was analyzed using Analysis of Covariance adjusting for treatment, period, sequence and center with period baseline as a covariate and patient nested within sequence as a random effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Peak Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. Time to peak FEV1 is calculated in minutes from the time of inhalation of study drug to the time of the peak FEV1 during the first 4 hours post-dose.
Time to peak FEV1 is based on log-transformed analysis of variance adjusted for treatment, period, sequence and center, with patient nested within sequence as a random effect. Geometric Mean was obtained by taking anti-logs of the adjusted means from the model and standard error was calculated using the delta method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Single Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>5, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4 hours, 11 hours 10 minutes, 11 hours 45 minutes, 12 hours 30 minutes, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 hours, 23 hours 10 minutes, and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dosing.</time_frame>
    <description>Vital capacity is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible.
FVC was analyzed using ANCOVA adjusting for treatment, period, sequence and center with period baseline as a covariate and patient nested within sequence as a random effect.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. FEV1 was measured pre-dose and up to 24 hours post-dose. The FEV1 standardized area under the curve (AUC) was analyzed for four time intervals:
Baseline (pre-dose) to 4 hours (hr) post-dosing;
Baseline (pre-dose) to 23 hours, 45 minutes (min) post-dosing;
11 hours, 10 minutes to 12 hours, 30 minutes post-dosing;
11 hours, 10 minutes to 23 hours, 45 minutes post-dosing.
AUC for FEV1 was analyzed using Analysis of Covariance adjusting for treatment, period, sequence and center with period baseline as a covariate and patient nested within sequence as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Time to Peak Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</title>
        <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. Time to peak FEV1 is calculated in minutes from the time of inhalation of study drug to the time of the peak FEV1 during the first 4 hours post-dose.
Time to peak FEV1 is based on log-transformed analysis of variance adjusted for treatment, period, sequence and center, with patient nested within sequence as a random effect. Geometric Mean was obtained by taking anti-logs of the adjusted means from the model and standard error was calculated using the delta method.</description>
