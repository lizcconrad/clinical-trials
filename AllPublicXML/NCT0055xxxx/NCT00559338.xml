  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an 8hr infusion of nesiritide in the emergency
      department in the Acutely decompensated heart failure patients will decrease 30 day
      recidivism.

    <textblock>
      In view of the high return admission rate to our county ED for heart failure, we hypothesized
      that our higher risk patient population might realize a decrease in the return admission rate
      as a benefit from early ED administration of nesiritide. We also acknowledged that the safety
      of nesiritide in our patient population had not been well established. Thus, we opted to test
      the hypothesis that an 8-hour ED infusion of nesiritide [in addition to protocol specified
      standard therapy] in ADHF patients from an urban patient population consisting of
      predominately African Americans and Hispanics will decrease 30-day readmission rates without
      provoking harm.
