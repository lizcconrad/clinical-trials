  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase Ib study designed to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of SGN-40 when combined with rituximab in patients
      with relapsed CD20-positive, follicular or marginal zone NHL who have received at least one
      prior rituximab-containing regimen.
