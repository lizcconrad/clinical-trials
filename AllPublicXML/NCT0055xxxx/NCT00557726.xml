      This protocol is being established to cover the admission of patients with inflammatory
      and/or infectious diseases which are not covered under previously existing protocols. The
      purpose of such a protocol is that frequently patients are referred to us with either
      diagnosed or undiagnosed illnesses which would be of interest to our teaching program or
      which would serve as a source of patients to subsequently be entered into established,
      ongoing protocol studies. Such patients will be admitted and handled according to accepted
      medical practice of diagnosis and treatment.
