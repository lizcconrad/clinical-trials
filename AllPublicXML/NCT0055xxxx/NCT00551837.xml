  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response to a routine influenza
      vaccination. Influenza vaccination is given as part of routine standard of care in these
      individuals and is not part of the study protocol. The study will evaluate for a change in
      response to common antigens over time after influenza vaccination to determine if changes are
      related to the development of chronic rejection after solid-organ transplantation. We
      hypothesize that the influenza vaccine contributes to the alloreactivity of T cells verses
      common HLA types in the donor pool.
