      The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrences of respiratory symptoms risk factors
      and abnormalities in lung function in young children (3-6 years old) with hemato-oncologic
      diseases at presentation (before treatment) and up to 3 years follow-up (study period).

      Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are a part of the routine follow-up of patients receiving
      anti-cancer treatment. Treatment is frequently associated with diverse pulmonary damage which
      may become functionally and clinically evident many years later. PFTs may help to quantify
      the damage in the lungs; help to evaluate the point at which lung function deviates from
      normal to allow early intervention before irreversible lung damage occurs and thereby to
      reduce morbidity and mortality.

      Reliable PFTs in the preschool age have traditionally been difficult to perform, but recent
      publications have demonstrated that the majority of preschool children can produce
      reproducible forced expiratory flow volume (FEVC) curves with proper coaching techniques.
      This recent development may enable studying the long term effect (years) of treatment on lung
      function in young children suffering from hemato-oncologic diseases.

        All pediatric patients (age 3-7 years) with hemato-onclogic diseases that were treated at
        the Hemato-Oncology Department, and were sent to the pediatric pulmonary unit at the Safra
        children's hospital, Sheba medical center, Ramat-Gan, Israel, to perform lung function
