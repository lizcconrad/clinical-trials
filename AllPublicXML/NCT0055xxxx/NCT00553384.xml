      The reason for doing this research is to understand why different people show different
      responses when they smell an odor called androstadienone. Androstadienone is a chemical found
      in male sweat. Other studies have shown that smelling this chemical can cause people to
      experience sweating, changes in skin temperature, and changes in a stress hormone call
      cortisol. These responses, which are called &quot;physiological effects,&quot; are stronger in some
      people than in others.

      We are interested in finding out whether these individual differences are genetic, that is
      caused by differences in our genes. Humans have about 1000 genes for odorant receptors. These
      are the molecules that bind and detect odor molecules in our nose and allow us to respond to
      so many different odors. It has been shown that some of these genes exist in two forms: a
      functional one and one that has been mutated and is therefore no longer functional.

      We think that people who do not respond to a specific odor may carry the non-functional form
      of the gene for the receptor that detects the odor molecule. To test this idea we want to
      find people who respond strongly to a specific smell, and compare their odorant receptor
      genes with those of people who respond weakly to the odor.

      The study consists of five visits. The first visit is a screening visit at which the
      eligibility of the subject is determined and a blood sample is taken. At this visit, the
      subject is also given ovulation test strips and instructions to perform urine-based ovulation
      self-tests at home for a period of several days following the onset of menstruation. The
      subject is instructed to test her urine at home until an LH surge is detected.

      When the subject ovulates and is available for a visit she will come to the Rockefeller
      University Hospital within one day of detecting an LH surge for the first of four Test
      Sessions.

      The four Test Sessions are identical with the exception that the subject is exposed to a
      different odor stimulus.

      We will be measuring:

        1. skin temperature

        2. sweating, as measured by skin conductance

        3. salivary cortisol levels.

        4. mood
