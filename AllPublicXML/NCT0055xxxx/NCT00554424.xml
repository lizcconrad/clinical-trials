  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether injecting local anaesthetic into the vaginal
      tissues,just prior to transvaginal egg collection,will decrease the amount of pain
      experienced by women having their eggs collected on an IVF cycle. All women will also receive
      intravenous sedation as required as well as a sleeping tablet thirty minutes prior to the
      procedure which is our routine procedure for egg collection.

      Transvaginal oocyte retrieval is the most common method of oocyte collection in IVF cycles. A
      variety of different methods are used to provide analgesia/anesthesia for oocyte collection.
      Our unit has always used an oral pre-medication followed by intravenous fentanyl during the
      procedure but this doesn't seem to provide adequate analgesia for some women. The aim of this
      study was to compare the addition of intravaginal local anaesthetic injection versus saline
      placebo to our usual analgesia regime to see whether less intravenous fentanyl was required
      and whether the women experienced less pain during oocyte collection.
