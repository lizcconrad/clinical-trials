      Hypothesis: Changing to Travatan Z therapy increases the tear film break up time of subjects
      on Xalatan therapy presenting with ocular surface disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been taking Xalatan monotherapy to treat their glaucoma and presenting with
      ocular surface disease will be advised to switch their medication to Travatan Z. Test results
      will be recorded at the day that the medication was changed and at follow-up to determine if
      there is a measurable change in tear film break up, corneal staining and in the Ocular
      Surface Disease Index.
