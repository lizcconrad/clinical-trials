    <textblock>
      This is a registry for patients who have a risk-reduction mastectomy (&quot;prophylactic
      mastectomy&quot;) due to being at high risk for developing breast cancer, followed by breast
      reconstruction. Eligible patients include those who have a breast cancer-related gene, a
      strong family history of breast cancer, or a personal history of high-risk conditions such as
      cancer in the other breast or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Patients are enrolled in the
      registry before surgery, and are followed for up to ten years afterwards. In addition to
      studying medical outcomes, we will periodically survey patients for quality-of-life issues
      and psychological well-being. There is no compensation for being enrolled in this registry.
      This registry is conducted through the Department of Plastic Surgery at Georgetown University
      Hospital, and is a sub-registry to the Fisher Familial Cancer Registry at the Lombardi
      Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University.
