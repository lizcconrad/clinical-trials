  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we want to find out more about polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS). This is a
      common problem in about 7% of teenage girls. Problems may include irregular periods, extra
      hair on the face, chest and back areas. It seems that PCOS is related to a high level of male
      hormones and to another problem called metabolic syndrome(MBS). People with MBS may have high
      blood pressure, low good cholesterol, high blood fats and extra fat around the waist. Girls
      with MBS are at high risk for getting diabetes and heart disease.

      Once enrolled in the study, you will have a physical exam done. This includes getting a
      medical history, height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate. We will also listen to your
      heart and lungs. We will also look at your skin and determine what stage of puberty you are
      in by looking at your breast growth and body hair. You will also have two (maybe three) blood
      tests. The first one is an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). During this test, we will have
      you drink an orange sugary drink and then we will draw your blood. The second test is a
      frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). During this test, we will give
      you insulin through one IV catheter and then we will draw blood from another IV catheter. The
      third test that you might have done is an ACTH test. During this test, we will draw your
      blood and then you will be given a dose of cortrosyn (a hormone that your body already makes)
      and then we will draw your blood again. You will also have two scans of your body done during
      your visit. There will be a Dual Energy X-Ray Scan (DEXA) and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      Scan (MRI). You will be placed in the machines and then the scanner will move over your body.
