      Pilot study completed - power calculation performed. Now formal double blind randomized study
      comparing active with placebo wristbands for nausea in palliative care patients to be carried
      out.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Terminally ill hospice in-patients suffering with nausea will be randomized to active or
      placebo acupressure bands. The study will last 3 days and they will be allowed to continue
      regular or have PRN anti-emetics during the study.

      Assessors and patients will both be blinded to whether they patients are receiving active or
      placebo bands.
