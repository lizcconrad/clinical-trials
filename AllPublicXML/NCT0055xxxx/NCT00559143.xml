  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of present study is to examine the short and long-term results of pacing from right
      ventricular apex and to compare them with those of biventricular pacing.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study all subjects to be studied will have atrioventricular conduction disturbances
      that require permanent artificial pacing. In all subjects a biventricular pacemaker will be
      implanted. Moreover the subjects will be randomized in a biventricular or conventional pacing
      mode and will be observed for a long term period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects between the age of 18 to 75 years with classic indication for permanent
             artificial pacing in which it is expected very high percentage of ventricular pacing,
             (pacing systoles constitute the 80% and more of the total).

          -  Physiologic or mildly affected systolic function of left ventricle, LVEF&gt; 40%.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the Clinical Investigational Plan and to
             remain available for follow-up visits, through study closure.

          -  Subject (or if allowed by local law/regulations: subject's legally authorised
             representative) is willing and able to sign and date the study Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with classic indication for Biventricular Pacing - (European Guidelines
             2007).

          -  Permanent atrial fibrillation.

          -  Cardiovascular surgery within the last three months prior to enrollment.

          -  Myocardial infarction within the last three months prior to enrollment.
