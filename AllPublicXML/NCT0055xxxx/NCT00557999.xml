      The following objectives were used for comparison: 1) primary objective: reintubation rate
      during hospitalization; 2) secondary objectives: length of hospitalization at the Coronary
      Care Unit; time from intubation to start of weaning; time from start of weaning to
      extubation; time from SBT and extubation; presence of respiratory infection in patients
      requiring reintubation; mortality of patients requiring reintubation.

      Once the cause leading to the need of MV was resolved, patients from both groups underwent a
      daily clinical evaluation in the mornings, to determine whether they were ready for
      mechanical ventilation weaning, according to the following clinical SBT criteria: 1) Cause of
      MV: resolution of the cause and abnormalities leading to MV; 2) neurological stability:
      patient awake, without or with minimal infusion of sedatives/narcotics, with effective cough
      and Glasgow scale ≥ 9; 3) cardiovascular stability: mean blood pressure (MBP) ≥ 60 mm Hg,
      without vasopressors or with low vasopressor doses, heart rate (HR) ≤ 140 / min, hemoglobin
      (Hb) ≥ 8,0 - 10,0 g/L, partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) ≥ 60 mm Hg with fraction of
      inhaled oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 0.4, oxygenation index (PaO2 / FiO2) ≥ 150 - 300 without significant
      respiratory acidosis; 4) metabolic stability: temperature &lt; 37.8° C (armpit) and lack of
      hydroelectrolytic disorders.
