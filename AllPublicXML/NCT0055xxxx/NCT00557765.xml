  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After exposure to an active case of tuberculosis (TB), close contacts may be infected. They
      are then considered as having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Detecting LTBI is the
      main goal of contact tracing procedures after exposure to TB. Until recently, the only test
      available for detecting LTBI was the tuberculin skin test (TST). More recent tests are now
      available (Interferon-gamma release assays: IGRA), which are more specific and sensitive than
      the TST. This study compares the TST and an IGRA in the routine activity of contact tracing
      in our area.

      Setting: A TB clinic in Geneva, Switzerland, a low incidence area for TB with a high
      immigrant population.

      Aim of study: to compare results of an IGRA test (T-SPOT.TB, Oxford Immunotec, UK) and the
      TST, and their correlation with exposure scores in subjects exposed to cases of contagious
      TB.

      Methods: Prospective study of all contacts screened in our area, and accepting to be
      included. Simultaneous recording of age, gender, origin, history of recent travels or
      exposure, BCG vaccination status, infectiousness of index case, 5 different exposure scores,
      TST, and result of the T-SPOT.TB blood test. Univariate and multivariate analysis.
