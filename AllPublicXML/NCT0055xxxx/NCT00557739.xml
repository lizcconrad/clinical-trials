  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CRx-191 is a proprietary synergistic combination drug candidate being evaluated by
      CombinatoRx for topical psoriasis therapy. CRx-191 was identified via a proprietary screening
      assay for novel drug combinations demonstrating enhanced inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-
      alpha and interferon-gamma release, cytokines that are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      psoriasis.

      This clinical trial will assess the effectiveness of CRx-191 in reducing the psoriatic
      infiltrate band thickness as measured by transdermal ultrasound. All subjects will receive
      all treatments in separate test fields, with intra-individual comparison of the treatments.
