  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a controlled, cluster randomised, interventional trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a workplace cognitive and physical program (Intervention), in reducing the
      frequency of head and neck pain in an extensive working population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies were performed to assess the efficacy of non invasive physical interventions in
      the treatment of different types of headache and cervical pain. However the evidence on their
      effectiveness is still limited and the results of recent studies are conflicting.

      In a previous non-randomized-controlled study in which the cognitive and physical programme
      was applied to a consistent number of office workers, a significant reduction of frequency of
      pain in the head and neck areas and of analgesic drug consumption was obtained. The present
      study was designed to confirm the data in a much more extensive working population and
      applying a randomised design.

      The primary objective is to confirm the effectiveness of a workplace cognitive and physical
      programme (Intervention), in reducing the frequency of pain involving the head and neck area
      in a large working community using a randomized design.The Intervention consists of brief
      shoulder and neck exercises to be performed several times a day, a relaxation exercise and
      instructions of how to reduce parafunction and hyperfunction of the craniofacial and cervical
      muscles during the day.

      Secondary objectives:

      To confirm the effectiveness of the Intervention, in reducing the intensity of pain involving
      the head and neck area in a large working community using a randomized design.

      To confirm the reduction in analgesic drugs consumption after the Intervention in a large
      working community using a randomized design.

      To evaluate the persistence of the effectiveness of the Intervention after 12 months in a
      large working community using a randomized design.

      Comparison(s): Group of employees that will receive a cognitive/physical programme
      (Intervention), compared to a similar group of employees that will not receive the
      Intervention (Controls); (frequency of headache and neck and shoulder pain).
