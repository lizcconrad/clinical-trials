    <textblock>
      The debilitating effects of immobilisation on muscle strength and size in young individuals
      are well documented. Moreover, sarcopenia has long been recognized as a major cause of muscle
      strength loss in old age, however, changes in muscle mass and architecture with
      immobilisation in the elderly has not previously been investigated. This is contrasted by the
      fact that the elderly population more often undergoes periods of immobilization and disuse
      not only due to joint pain but also due to a higher degree of co morbidity and
      hospitalisation.The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of a 2 week period
      of unilateral immobilisation on the physiological muscle cross sectional area, maximal
      isometric muscle strength, specific force, muscle fascicle length and muscle fibre pennation
      angle in young and old healthy men.
