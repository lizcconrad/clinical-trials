      RATIONALE: Physical activity sessions may help improve physical function, quality of life,
      and symptoms caused by chemotherapy in older patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well physical activity works in improving
      quality of life in older patients with acute myelogenous leukemia undergoing chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To test the feasibility of conducting a physical activity intervention in hospitalized
           older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing induction or reinduction
           chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To obtain preliminary data regarding the effectiveness of a physical activity
           intervention on physical function, quality of life, and treatment-related symptoms in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a baseline evaluation in week 1 focusing on basic demographics,
      health, physical function and quality-of-life assessments. These assessments include the
      Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB); the Hand Grip Test of Muscular Strength; the
      Demographics and Physical Activity History; the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      (FACT-Leu); the Distress Thermometer; the Short-form Positive Affect Schedule (PANAS-SF); the
      Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL); the FAST-23 Disability Measure; the Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Short Form (CES-D); the Self-efficacy for Physical
      Activity Scale; the Intervention Feedback Form; and the Pre-Post Session Ratings. Some
      medical data may be obtained from the patient's medical record to assist in these
      assessments.

      Beginning in weeks 2-5, patients undergo a 30-minute orientation to the exercise sessions
      that will be tailored to individual needs and abilities. Patients undergo a 30- to 45-minute
      group physical activity session twice a week, and a supervised individual session following
      the same format as the group session, once a week for 4 weeks. After completion of the
      physical activity intervention, patients complete an activities packet and repeat the
      physical function and quality of life assessments in weeks 5-6 and again upon readmission for
      consolidation therapy in weeks 9-13 .

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed for 4 months.
