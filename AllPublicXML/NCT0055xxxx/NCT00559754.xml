  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of a combination of Avastin and
      docetaxel following cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, in patients with HER2 negative operable
      breast cancer. Patients will receive 4 x 3 week cycles of chemotherapy with doxorubicin
      (60mg/m2 iv on day 1 of each cycle) and cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 iv on day 1 of each
      cycle). They will then receive 4 x 3 week cycles of docetaxel (75mg/m2 on day 1 of each
      cycle) in combination with Avastin (15mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle). The anticipated time on
      study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>After Week 24 (surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with pCR was determined by anatomopathological study after completion of 8 cycles of study treatment. The anatomopathological study of the surgical piece was performed and assessed according to the Miller-Payne criteria: 1) the primary tumor was Grade 5 (no malignant cells identified at the location of the primary tumor (ductal carcinoma in situ may be present); 2) no involvement was identified in the lymph nodes; 3) the tumour size at evaluation of the surgical piece was 0 centimeters (cm); and 4) the pathological staging of the tumour from the surgical piece was pT0pN0pM0, the stage is not applicable (NA). It will only be considered pCR in the case of absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast and lymph nodes.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 28 days of enrollment, Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Overall clinical response is the best response obtained through physical examination and/or radiological tests after completion of chemotherapy cycles. The percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and was categorized as clinical response (CR+PR) or clinical benefit (CR+PR+ no change [NC]). Per RECIST, CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥)30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Complete and partial responses must have been confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with pCR was determined by anatomopathological study after completion of 8 cycles of study treatment. The anatomopathological study of the surgical piece was performed and assessed according to the Miller-Payne criteria: 1) the primary tumor was Grade 5 (no malignant cells identified at the location of the primary tumor (ductal carcinoma in situ may be present); 2) no involvement was identified in the lymph nodes; 3) the tumour size at evaluation of the surgical piece was 0 centimeters (cm); and 4) the pathological staging of the tumour from the surgical piece was pT0pN0pM0, the stage is not applicable (NA). It will only be considered pCR in the case of absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast and lymph nodes.</description>

The percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and was categorized as clinical response (CR+PR) or clinical benefit (CR+PR+ no change [NC]). Per RECIST, CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥)30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Complete and partial responses must have been confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With pCR by KISS1 Protein Expression</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with pCR was determined by anatomopathological study after completion of 8 cycles of study treatment. The anatomopathological study of the surgical piece was performed and assessed according to the Miller-Payne criteria. It was only considered pCR in the case of absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast and lymph nodes. KISS1 protein expression was defined as 0 (no expression), 1 (normal), 2 (augmented expression), or NE (not evaluated).</description>

          <description>The percentage of participants with pCR was determined by anatomopathological study after completion of 8 cycles of study treatment. The anatomopathological study of the surgical piece was performed and assessed according to the Miller-Payne criteria. It was only considered pCR in the case of absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast and lymph nodes. ENOS protein expression was defined as 0 (no expression), 1 (normal), 2 (augmented expression), or NE (not evaluated).</description>

          <description>The percentage of participants with pCR was determined by anatomopathological study after completion of 8 cycles of study treatment. The anatomopathological study of the surgical piece was performed and assessed according to the Miller-Payne criteria. It was only considered pCR in the case of absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast and lymph nodes. HIF gene expression was defined as below the housekeeping reference level (&gt;0), above the housekeeping reference level (&lt;0), or equal to the housekeeping reference level (0).</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with pCR was determined by anatomopathological study after completion of 8 cycles of study treatment. The anatomopathological study of the surgical piece was performed and assessed according to the Miller-Payne criteria. It was only considered pCR in the case of absence of invasive tumour cells in the breast and lymph nodes. RKISS1 gene expression was defined as below the housekeeping reference level (&gt;0), above the housekeeping reference level (&lt;0), or equal to the housekeeping reference level (0).</description>
