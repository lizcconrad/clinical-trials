  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy of
      BRL29060A (paroxetine hydrochloride hydrate, hereafter paroxetine) administered orally over
      the dose range of 20 mg to 50 mg once daily after supper for 12 weeks in Japanese patients
      with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as assessed by the change from baseline in CAPS-SX
      total score. Also the effect of paroxetine on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) induced by
      subthreshold emotional arousing (or symptom stimulating) tasks will be determined using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for exploratory assessment of the correlation
      between the change in rCBF and the efficacy.

      The sample size is 30 subjects. The study period consists of 4 weeks of run-in phase, 12
      weeks of treatment phase, 0-3 weeks of taper phase and follow-up examination at 2 weeks after
      the last dose, for a total of 18-21 weeks.

      Subjects will visit the clinic at the start of run-in phase, Week -2, the start of treatment
      phase, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 of treatment, and follow-up examination.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview for assessing PTSD diagnostic status and symptom severity. The CAPS assesses both the frequency and intensity of individual PTSD symptoms on separate five-point (0-4) rating scales, and these ratings can be summed to create a nine-point (0-8) severity score for each symptom. The total CAPS score can range from 0 to 136, with a higher value indicating increased severity. A minus value for change from baseline indicates an improvement of symptom severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in regional blood flow (rCBF) measured by fMRI represents altered neuronal responses in PTSD patients and is considered to be the biomarker for treatment response. fMRI measures are provided as blood oxygeneration level-dependent (BOLD) signals (z-score). To trigger neuronal activation, 2 visual stimuli were used: MVA-task (consisting of MVA-related and unpleasant pictures) and face-task (consisting of a variety of facial expressions [e.g., neutral, happy, fear]). Week 0 and 12 rCBF data from 1 participant were invalid (involuntary movement in the fMRI machine); no analysis was done.</description>

If the investigator/subinvestigator judges that a sufficient response is achieved, Drug 2 will be continued for the remaining period. If a sufficient response is not achieved with Drug 2 but treatment is well tolerated, the dose will be titrated to one step higher level until a sufficient response is achieved [i.e., Drug 3 (30 mg/day or placebo) → Drug 4 (40 mg/day or placebo) → Drug 5 (50 m/day or placebo)] at intervals of at least two weeks by once daily administration after supper. Once a sufficient response is achieved, that dose will be continued.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to assignment to the 12-week treatment phase, all participants received placebo in a single-blind manner in a 4-week run-in phase. Participants completing the run-in phase were then randomized to receive either placebo or paroxetine for the remainder of the study. Two participants were withdrawn from the study before randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview for assessing PTSD diagnostic status and symptom severity. The CAPS assesses both the frequency and intensity of individual PTSD symptoms on separate five-point (0-4) rating scales, and these ratings can be summed to create a nine-point (0-8) severity score for each symptom. The total CAPS score can range from 0 to 136, with a higher value indicating increased severity. A minus value for change from baseline indicates an improvement of symptom severity.</description>

        <description>Change in regional blood flow (rCBF) measured by fMRI represents altered neuronal responses in PTSD patients and is considered to be the biomarker for treatment response. fMRI measures are provided as blood oxygeneration level-dependent (BOLD) signals (z-score).

Week 0 and 12 rCBF data from 1 participant were invalid (involuntary movement in the fMRI machine); no analysis was done.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline in CAPS-SX (Clinician-Administered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD] Scale One Week Symptom Status Version) Total Score at Weeks 4 and 8</title>
        <description>The Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview for assessing PTSD diagnostic status and symptom severity. The CAPS assesses both the frequency and intensity of individual PTSD symptoms on separate five-point (0-4) rating scales, and these ratings can be summed to create a nine-point (0-8) severity score for each symptom. The total CAPS score can range from 0 to 136, with a higher value indicating increased severity. A minus value for change from baseline indicates an improvement of symptom severity.</description>

        <description>The Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview for assessing PTSD diagnostic status and symptom severity. The CAPS assesses both the frequency and intensity of individual PTSD symptoms on separate five-point (0-4) rating scales, and these ratings can be summed to create a nine-point (0-8) severity score for each symptom. The total CAPS score can range from 0 to 136, with a higher value indicating increased severity. A minus value for change from baseline indicates an improvement of symptom severity.</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS): All participants who received at least one dose of study medication for the treatment phase and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. Participants who failed to satisfy major entry criteria measured prior to randomization (e.g., participant with disease other than PTSD) were excluded.</population>
