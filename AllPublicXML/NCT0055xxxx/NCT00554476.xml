      Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: Boo-Ali and Baqyiatallah Hospital in Tehran.
      Patients: 50 randomly selected patients, in two groups of 25 subjects. Interventions:
      Corticosteroid injections with elbow cast versus icing and NSAIDs.

      Outcome measures: Patients were evaluated for outcomes, complications and patients'
      satisfaction at 2nd, 4th, and 12th week after beginning of treatment. We measured the pain
      severity by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
