    <textblock>
      Patient on an intermittent androgen deprivation protocol for biochemical recurrence after
      radical local therapy for prostate cancer,the addition of continuous dutasteride treatment,
      significantly prolongs the duration of the off treatment interval and time to androgen
      independence.

    <textblock>
      The study is to assess the effect of therapy with repeat oral daily dosing of dutasteride 05
      mg on the length of the off treatment interval in men receiving intermittent androgen therapy
      for localized prostate cancer.
