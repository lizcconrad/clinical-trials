      The investigators propose to determine esophageal Doppler goal-directed fluid requirements in
      lean, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese patients with the goal of developing a body mass
      index (BMI)-specific fluid replacement strategy. Specifically, th investigators will test the
      hypothesis that perioperative fluid requirements on a per-kg basis varies as a function of
      BMI. Individuals scheduled for elective, open abdominal surgeries, vaginal hysterectomies or
      genital prolapse repair will be eligible to participate

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that goal-directed fluid management using stroke volume (blood
      ejected by the heart) is the most physiologic approach for fluid replacement. We propose to
      develop a body mass index (BMI)-specific fluid replacement formula based on stroke volume
      guidance.

      Arterial pulse pressure variation (dPP) induced by mechanical ventilation is a proposed
      predictor of fluid responsiveness as well. We will therefore also investigate if stroke
      volume (measured by esophageal Doppler monitoring) and pulse pressure variation comparably
      predict fluid responsiveness by simultaneously measuring both parameters.

      Adequate tissue oxygenation is essential to maintain normal physiologic functions. Fat tissue
      oxygenation is critically low in the obese surgical patient. It is likely that poor fat
      tissue oxygenation results in part from inadequate fluid replacement. We propose to determine
      if fat tissue oxygenation is comparable from lean to morbidly obese patients when fluid
      replacement is optimized.

      Individuals scheduled for elective, open abdominal surgeries, vaginal hysterectomies or
      genital prolapse repair will be assigned to six groups according to BMI, from lean to
      morbidly obese categories. The primary aim will be to develop a statistical equation for
      predicting fluid requirements as a function of BMI. A maximum of 100 patients will be able to
      detect an R-squared of 10% or more with 90% power at the 0.05 significance level, and will
      enable adequate estimation of the relationship of interest.
