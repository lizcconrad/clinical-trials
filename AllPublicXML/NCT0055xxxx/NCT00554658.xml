    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to assess the effect of quetiapine treatment in neuroleptic naive,
      first-episode schizophrenic patients on aspects of functional and structural neuroplasticity
      assessed by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation and voxel-based morphometry. Main
      outcome measure is a change in gray matter density under quetiapine treatment from baseline
      to steady-state-treatment after 3 weeks.
