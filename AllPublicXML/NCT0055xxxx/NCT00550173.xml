  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the combination of erlotinib and pemetrexed versus
      either pemetrexed alone and erlotinib alone, in terms of progression-free survival (time
      until the objective worsening of the disease) in patients who have never smoked and have
      locally advanced or metastatic Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer who have failed a
      first-line chemotherapy treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to measured PD up to 38 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first date of progressive disease (PD; either objectively determined or clinical progression) or death from any cause. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 guidelines. Time to disease progression was censored at the date of death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) [Tumor Response Rate (TRR)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to measured disease progression up to 38 months</time_frame>
    <description>TRR was defined as the number of responders (complete or partial) divided by the number of participants qualified for tumor response, as assessed using the RECIST version 1.0 guideline, multiplied by 100. RECIST guidelines: CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm) and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to date of death from any cause up to 45.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to 39 months</time_frame>
    <description>A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events (AEs), which include AEs reported for pharmacological toxicity, is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With CR, PR, and Stable Disease (SD) - Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to disease progression up to 38 months</time_frame>
    <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with CR, PR, or SD divided by the number of randomized and treated participants as assessed using the RECIST criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; PR was defined as 1) at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions or 2) complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence (but not worsening) of 1 or more non-target lesions; PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; SD was defined as small changes that did not meet the above criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Worsening of Symptoms (TWS) on Lung Cancer Symptoms Scale (LCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to first date of worsening of any of 6 LCSS symptom specific items or up to 12.4 months</time_frame>
    <description>TWS assessed using the LCSS a participant rated lung cancer instrument which consisted of 9 disease related symptoms and quality of life (QoL) items, with 6 subscales related to major lung cancer symptoms (appetite, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain) and 3 summation items related to QoL (activity status, symptomatic distress, and overall QoL). Each item is marked on a visual analog scale (VAS) 0 (low symptoms/QoL items) to 100 (high symptoms/QoL items). The mean of the 6 subscales is used to calculate the average symptom burden index. TWS was measured from the date of study enrollment to the first date of a worsening in any 1 of the 6 LCSS symptom-specific items (as defined by a VAS 15-mm increase from baseline in the patient-reported score for any of these 6 items).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Mutated or Non-Mutated Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Genotype Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to date of PD or death up to 38 months</time_frame>
    <description>EGFR mutation status was defined as: participants with any mutations detected were categorized as mutated and participants without any mutations detected were categorized as non-mutated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Probability of OS at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>OS time is censored at the date of last contact for participants who were still alive or lost to follow-up.</description>

        <title>Time to Worsening of Symptoms (TWS) on Lung Cancer Symptoms Scale (LCSS)</title>
        <description>TWS assessed using the LCSS a participant rated lung cancer instrument which consisted of 9 disease related symptoms and quality of life (QoL) items, with 6 subscales related to major lung cancer symptoms (appetite, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pain) and 3 summation items related to QoL (activity status, symptomatic distress, and overall QoL). Each item is marked on a visual analog scale (VAS) 0 (low symptoms/QoL items) to 100 (high symptoms/QoL items). The mean of the 6 subscales is used to calculate the average symptom burden index. TWS was measured from the date of study enrollment to the first date of a worsening in any 1 of the 6 LCSS symptom-specific items (as defined by a VAS 15-mm increase from baseline in the patient-reported score for any of these 6 items).</description>
