      The research project was designed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a
      Computerized Decision Support System for depression (CDSS-D) during acute care in a primary
      care setting. The basic experimental design was a two-group, two-site study design. Three
      different clinics with a total of 4 primary care physicians agreed and provided informed
      consent and participated in the study. Half of the physicians used the CDSS-D to treat
      patients with MDD and the other half provided Usual Care (UC) treatment.

      The intervention, CDSS-D, incorporated a pre-existing depression treatment algorithm (Texas
      Medication Algorithm Project for Depression, Trivedi et al) with computer decision support
      programming, providing the treatment group physicians with a computerized algorithm.

    <description>The CDSS for depression was based on an up-to-date model of the Texas Medication Algorithm Project that employs the principles of Measurement Based Care (MBC), while at the same time having a user interface for providers that is easy-to-use. MBC is the systematic use of measuring clinical outcomes at routine visits to guide treatment management. These outcomes may include symptoms, side effects, and medication adherence. Recent efforts from the large, multi-site effectiveness study, Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D), show that a treatment plan guided by MBC is integral in implementing algorithm based care.</description>

    <description>Usual Care was up to the discretion of the study physician and the patient treated. These physicians were provided with up-to-date treatment protocols for depression, but were not instructed to strictly adhere to a treatment algorithm. Therefore, they treated depressed patients as they &quot;usually&quot; would.</description>
