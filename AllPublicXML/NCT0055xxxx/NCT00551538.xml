  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if twice-daily Lispro low mixture (75/25) will
      result in lower post prandial blood glucose readings versus once-daily glargine plus oral
      diabetic medications.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that a twice daily insulin
      regimen consisting of insulin lispro (mix 75/25)plus OAMs will result in a lower 2 hour
      postprandial plasma glucose, averaged across the morning and evening meals, compared with
      once daily insulin glargine plus OAMs at bedtime following 12 weeks of treatment.
