  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SB-742457 is a 5HT6 receptor antagonist that is in development for the symptomatic treatment
      of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease . To date, all clinical trials have been conducted
      using a capsule formulation of SB-742457. However, it is intended to conduct all futures
      studies with a tablet formulation. The aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic
      profile of SB-742457 and its major metabolites following single doses of both the capsule and
      tablet formulations.

             excretion of drugs.

          -  The subject has received an investigational drug or participated in another research
             trial within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect
             of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.

          -  Known or suspected history of seizures, including febrile seizures, unexplained recent
             loss of consciousness or history of significant head trauma with loss of
