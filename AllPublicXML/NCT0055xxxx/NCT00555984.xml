  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If the anesthetic regimen can influence the serum level of inflammatory cytokines and if the
      levels of cytokines are related to the incidence of post operative complications, these
      complications may be a function of the anesthetic method. In an effort to find the best
      anesthetic regimen for patients undergoing craniotomy for intracranial tumors, the
      researchers will compare the effect of volatile anesthetic with that of total intravenous
      anesthesia (TIVA) on cytokine levels. The researchers will also compare the composite
      incidence of some common major post-operative complications after craniotomy for intracranial
      malignancy.

      This is a randomized blinded clinical trial. Patients will be randomized into one of two
      groups. One group will receive a volatile anesthetic (sevoflurane)while the other group will
      receive intravenous anesthetics (propofol + remifentanil) for maintenance of General
      Anesthesia.

      The anesthesia team will know the result of randomization at induction. Postoperative data
      will be gathered by research personnel who will be blinded to the anesthetic method used.
      Patients will be blinded to the anesthetic they receive until after the 4-week outcomes are
      collected, when they will have the option to be unblinded.

      Peripheral blood samples will be taken a total of 7 times; pre-induction to anesthesia, 15
      minutes after surgical positioning, after the tumor is extracted, and at 6,12,18, and 24
      hours after emergence from anesthesia.

      Patients will be called for follow up every week for 4 weeks following discharge.
