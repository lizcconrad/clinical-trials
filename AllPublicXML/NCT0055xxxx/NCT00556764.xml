      The main objectives of this protocol are as follows:

        1. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of ANAM-PD in detecting cognitive status in
           patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and healthy controls (HC).

        2. To validate the specific individual domains of the ANAM-PD cognitive battery by
           comparisons to available standardized cognitive evaluation scales administered to the
           patients with Parkinson disease with and healthy control subjects.

        3. To evaluate the reliability of the ANAM-PD battery of tests by comparing repeated
           administrations of the ANAM-PD battery on a sub-set of subjects with Parkinson disease
           and healthy controls.

        4. To characterize cholinergic neurotransmission through imaging the vesicular
           acetylcholine transporter binding with 123Iodobenzovesamicol (IBVM) and SPECT in PD
           patients and healthy controls.

      General Design and Methods The overall goal of this proposal is to validate ANAM-PD as an
      assessment tool for cognitive status in PD. We propose a comprehensive strategy to evaluate
      the sensitivity and specificity of ANAM-PD in detecting cognitive changes in patients with a
      diagnosis of PD (n=50) and healthy controls (n=25). The specific testing domains of the
      ANAM-PD battery will be validated against standardized neuropsychological testing, described
      in detail below. The reliability of the ANAM-PD battery will be evaluated through a
      test-retest procedure in a subset of 50 subjects (25 PD and 25 HC). This strategy will enable
      us to evaluate the individual domains of the ANAM-PD computerized cognitive test and
      establish a battery as a standard test to efficiently measure cognitive changes in PD. We
      also propose to explore functional neuroimaging of the cholinergic system using [123I] IBVM
      and SPECT, a marker of vesicular acetylcholine transporter and a measure of the integrity of
      the cholinergic neuronal system. Identifying and validating ANAM-PD as an efficient tool for
      assessing cognitive changes in PD and exploring the cholinergic transporter system in PD
      through functional neuroimaging could predict sub-sets of PD patients 'at risk' for
      developing dementia and help elucidate the neurochemistry related to cognitive decline in PD
