  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last decades there has been an increase in the relative proportion and life
      expectancy of elderly people in the industrialised countries. Consequently the amount of
      elderly with diseases and disabilities related to aging has increased. It therefore appears
      paramount to gain a better understanding of how disuse and immobilisation affects
      neuromuscular properties in the elderly, as well as to identify training regimes that ensures
      an effective rehabilitation.The population of interest in the present study was elderly
      individuals with long term hip-osteoarthritis undergoing a hip-replacement operation. The
      study was divided in two parts, a cross-sectional study and an intervention study.

      The cross-sectional study investigated muscle size, maximal muscle strength, specific force,
      neural drive and explosive muscle force characteristics in elderly individuals who were
      affected by unilateral prolonged disuse due to hip-osteoarthritis. The data clearly indicated
      that the side with hip-osteoarthritis was affected by a marked decrease in muscle mass,
      maximal muscle strength, neural drive and explosive muscle force characteristics compared to
      the unaffected side.

      The intervention study investigated if elderly patients that undergo hip-replacement surgery
      could benefit from additional training in the early postoperative phase. The data clearly
      demonstrated that resistance training was an effective and safe way to increase muscle mass,
      maximal muscle strength, neuromuscular activity, functional performance and decrease the
      hospitalisation period compared to regimes of conventional rehabilitation regimen or
      electrical muscle stimulation. Additionally the intervention study demonstrated that
      resistance training effectively induced marked increases in explosive muscle force
      characteristics in elderly subjects compared to rehabilitation regimes using electrical
      muscle stimulation or conventional rehabilitation. Furthermore, the gains in maximal muscle
      strength and explosive muscle force characteristics were accompanied by significant increases
      in EMG amplitudes. Furthermore, the demonstration that explosive muscle force capacity of the
      neuromuscular system remains trainable in elderly recovering from prolonged limb disuse and
      major surgery may have important implications for future rehabilitation programs, especially
      when considering the importance of rapid muscle force capacity on postural balance, maximal
      walking speed and other tasks of daily life actions.
