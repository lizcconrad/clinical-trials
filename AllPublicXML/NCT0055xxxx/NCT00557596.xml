    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multicenter, phase 1-2 study. Following determination of the
      recommended AEG35156 dose in combination with gemcitabine in the initial Phase 1 part of this
      study, additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2 part of the study to assess the
      activity of the combination first-line in advanced pancreatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      Apoptotic induction in cancer cells is a sought after therapeutic goal. Most successful
      anticancer agents activate apoptosis pathways in the cancers they treat. Apoptotic pathways
      in cells appear to converge on a single family of enzymes, the caspases, which are proteases
      that dismantle the cell in an orderly, non-inflammatory fashion, resulting in cell death. The
      X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP) is the only known cellular inhibitor of caspases, its
      over expression thereby blocks the principal means of apoptosis. A wide range of evidence
      indicates that cellular overexpression of members of the IAP family is a fundamental means by
      which many cancer cells evade death, even in the presence of strong extrinsic (death
      receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) apoptotic cues. The inhibition of
      cellular XIAP activity, specifically in cancer cells under stress and primed for apoptosis by
      chemotherapeutic agents, is viewed as a powerful means of tipping the balance towards cell
      death. In particular, XIAP has been shown to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer and to
      play an important role in gemcitabine resistance. AEG35156 is a second generation antisense
      which targets XIAP mRNA to lower XIAP levels and the apoptotic threshold of cancer cells,
      enhancing their sensitivity to intrinsic death and chemotherapy. AEG35156 may thus enhance
      the anticancer activity of gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

             adenocarcinoma who are candidates for first-line gemcitabine therapy

          -  Karnofsky performance &gt;70%

          -  One or more metastatic tumors measurable by RECIST criteria on CT scan or MRI (Phase 2
             part only)

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Age &gt; 18 years
