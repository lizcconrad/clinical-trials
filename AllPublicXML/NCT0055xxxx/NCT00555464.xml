  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Prednisolone and
      Vincristine for treatment of large, complicated infantile hemangiomas. The diagnostic,
      therapeutic and response criteria experimentally determined in this study will be used as a
      framework for future infantile hemangioma studies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with large hemangiomas are often treated systemically with oral steroids
      (Prednisolone) to prevent complications. The best treatment for hemangiomas is not known and
      there are no medications approved by the FDA for treatment of hemangiomas. Also, the best
      method to measure the response of hemangioma to treatment is not known. Patients enrolling on
      this study will be randomly assigned to receive either daily Prednisolone by mouth or weekly
      Vincristine in a vein. Response to treatment will be monitored by clinical exams every two
      weeks and by an MRI at study entry and six and twelve weeks later. Patients with evidence of
      progressive disease (larger hemangiomas) on the week 6 MRI will be switched to the other drug
      to complete a total of 12 weeks of therapy. Side effects of each medication will be monitored
      closely determined from histories, physical exams, blood tests and other studies as
      necessary. Participation in this study will last up to 12 weeks and follow up for protocol.

    <description>Response of IH not confined to the dermis will be coded using the following criteria: Progressive disease: &gt;40% increase in volume by MRI, Partial response: &gt;65% reduction in volume by MRI, Complete response: no visual or radiographic evidence of disease, Stable disease: none of the above or &lt;40% increase or &lt;65% decrease in volume by MRI.
Response of superficial IH will be coded using the following criteria (based on RECIST): Progressive disease: &gt;30% increase in IH size, Partial response: &gt;30% reduction in size, Complete response: no evidence of disease, Stable disease: none of the above.
Our first 3 patients showed limits to using MRI volume to measure IH size/response to therapy. Unlike other solid tumors, the superficial distribution of some IH made getting volume by MRI difficult, resulting in smaller tumor estimation compared to clinical assessment. Based on these observations, we amended the protocol to report response based on RECIST criteria instead of change in IH volume.</description>

    <description>Vincristine is a drug that has been used to treat cancers in children (including infants). It has been effective in treating a small number of infants with hemangiomas, most of whom failed previous therapies including steroids. Vincristine must be administered into a vein. Given the encouraging response data and documented safety record, Vincristine is a good choice for a clinical trial treating infants with complicated hemangiomas.</description>

    <description>The standard treatment for hemangioma at most centers is oral steroids (Prednisolone). Prednisolone has been used to stop the growth of infantile hemangiomas that are life threatening, that could harm important functions, or are likely to result in severe disfigurement (scarring) without treatment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children age 0-6 months old.

          -  Infants with infantile hemangiomas with complications that require systemic therapy to
             control their growth. To be eligible for enrollment infants must have clear
             indications for systemic treatment.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of infantile hemangioma confirmed by tissue biopsy positive for
             GLUT-1 Immunohistochemical staining. If the risk of bleeding or permanent
             disfigurement from biopsy is believed to be too great then clinical and radiological
             characteristics may be used to establish the diagnosis after discussion with the study
             PI. Patients with GLUT-1 negative vascular tumors such as Kaposiform
             hemangioendothelioma, tufted angioma, and angiosarcoma are not eligible.

          -  Hemangiomas must be greater than or equal to 50 cm2 clinically measured by taking the
             product of the two largest perpendicular diameters and have one of the following
             complications: ulceration, impairment of vision, impairment of hearing, obstruction of
             the airway, high output cardiac failure, bleeding, abdominal distention and/or
             compartment syndrome, compression of the spinal cord, or high risk of permanent
             disfigurement.

          -  Adequate liver function defined as:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age, and

               -  SGPT(serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase) (ALT) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal
                  (ULN) for age.

          -  Patients who have received topical or intralesional corticosteroids are eligible to be
             enrolled. A washout of one week is required prior to study enrollment. Patients who
             have undergone surgical resection are eligible if they meet all inclusion criteria
             after surgery.

          -  All patients' parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent. All
             institutional and FDA requirements for human studies must be met.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children greater then 6 months old.

          -  Contraindications to Vincristine: previously diagnosed neuropathy including sensory
             neuropathy type 1, Charcot- Marie-Tooth or childhood poliomyelitis.

          -  Hemangioma involving the central nervous system (CNS) as Vincristine has poor CNS
             penetration.

          -  Infants who have received prior systemic therapy with corticosteroids (oral or
             intravenous), interferon or Vincristine are not eligible for enrollment.

          -  Patients receiving Vincristine who concomitantly require oral steroids for treatment
             of non-hemangioma indications such as asthma or atopic dermatitis will be removed from
             study.

          -  A life-threatening intercurrent infection.

          -  Infants with an underlying illness that would require use of general anesthesia (as
             opposed to sedation) for the MRI.

        <title>Response of Hemangioma (IH) to Treatment</title>
        <description>Response of IH not confined to the dermis will be coded using the following criteria: Progressive disease: &gt;40% increase in volume by MRI, Partial response: &gt;65% reduction in volume by MRI, Complete response: no visual or radiographic evidence of disease, Stable disease: none of the above or &lt;40% increase or &lt;65% decrease in volume by MRI.
Response of superficial IH will be coded using the following criteria (based on RECIST): Progressive disease: &gt;30% increase in IH size, Partial response: &gt;30% reduction in size, Complete response: no evidence of disease, Stable disease: none of the above.
Our first 3 patients showed limits to using MRI volume to measure IH size/response to therapy. Unlike other solid tumors, the superficial distribution of some IH made getting volume by MRI difficult, resulting in smaller tumor estimation compared to clinical assessment. Based on these observations, we amended the protocol to report response based on RECIST criteria instead of change in IH volume.</description>

            <title>Vincristine Treatment Group</title>
            <description>Vincristine is a drug that has been used to treat cancers in children (including infants). It has been effective in treating a small number of infants with hemangiomas, most of whom failed previous therapies including steroids. Vincristine must be administered into a vein. Given the encouraging response data and documented safety record, Vincristine is a good choice for a clinical trial treating infants with complicated hemangiomas.
Vincristine : Vincristine (0.05 mg/kg/dose) will be administered into a vein (PICC line) every week for 12 weeks. If assigned to receive Vincristine, a PICC line will be placed by a doctor who is a specialist in this procedure, an interventional radiologist. This will require sedation and when possible, will be coordinated with sedation for the MRI.</description>
