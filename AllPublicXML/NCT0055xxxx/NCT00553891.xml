    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to document the long-term effect
      of treatment with mometasone furoate nasal spray in moderate to severe adenoids hypertrophy
      as reflected by the need for removal of the adenoids within one year of the treatment
      regimen. Subjects will be assigned treated with either mometasone furoate nasal spray or
      placebo for 3 months. Subjects will be followed for an addition 12 months. Serious AEs will
      be followed starting first dose-till 30 days after study treatment period completion.

      This study was terminated - Please see &quot;P04367 - Lebanon&quot;

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Should be between 2 and 11 years.

          -  Should have nasal obstruction for at least 3 months.

          -  Should have evidence of adenoids hypertrophy by nasopharyngoscopy, which cause &gt;50%
             obstruction of the posterior choanae.

          -  May have concomitant allergic rhinitis, by history, &amp; and specific blood studies;
             however, the symptoms should be under control during the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with less than 50% obstruction of the post choanae.

          -  Patients with history of recurrent epistaxis or immunodeficiency.

          -  Patients with severe septal deviation.

          -  Patients with unilateral or bilateral choanal atresia, large nasal polyps or any nasal
             mass.

          -  Known allergy to the drug.

          -  Presence of chronic otitis media defined as: otorreha + perforation (concomitant
             otitis media with effusion, or recurrent otitis media are not excluded).

          -  Cystic fibrosis &amp; other causes responsible for nasal obstruction.

          -  Infection (ie; sinusitis).

          -  History of recent surgery or trauma to nose, unless all wounds have healed.
