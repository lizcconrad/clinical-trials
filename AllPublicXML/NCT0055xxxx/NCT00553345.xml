      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use
      of selenium and vitamin E may stop cancer from growing or coming back.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving selenium together with vitamin E
      to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing cancer progression and
      recurrence in patients with early-stage bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate whether selenium and/or vitamin E (α-tocopherol) supplementation reduces
           the risk of recurrence and progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by recurrence risk group (high
      vs intermediate) and treatment center and randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral selenium tablet and oral vitamin E capsule once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral selenium tablet and oral placebo capsule once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo tablet and oral vitamin E capsule once daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo tablet and oral placebo capsule once daily.

      In all arms, treatment continues for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed every 6 months for 5 years.
