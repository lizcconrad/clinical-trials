    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human trial to establish the safety, tolerability, Recommended Phase II
      Dose (RP2D), pharmacodynamic, and clinical activity of MK-8033.

      Parts A and B of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D. Part C
      of the study will be a single panel crossover study to determine the effect of omeprazole, a
      gastric pH modifier, on the pharmacokinetics of MK-8033.

    <description>MK-8033 will be administered as an oral formulation in sequentially rising dose levels starting at 50 mg and continuing at 100% dose increments until dose level 4 (800 mg total daily dose). Dose levels 5 to 11 will be escalated at ~40% dose increments until 3000mg (total daily dose). The daily dose of MK-8033 will be divided into two equal doses. MK-8033 will be administered in a first cycle of 14 days (continuous drug administration from Day 1 through Day 14), followed by a 1 week drug holiday (Cycle 1, Day 15 through Day 21). Subsequent cycles of MK-8033 will be administered for 14 days (Cycles 2 to 4) and 28 days (Cycle 5 and beyond).

    <description>Part C will occur at only one of the investigational sites.
In Cycle 1, patients will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences, A/B or B/A, over two treatment periods. Treatment A: 770 mg MK-8033 twice daily with co-administration of 20 mg omeprazole once daily. Treatment B: 770 mg MK-8033 twice daily. After Cycle 1 is complete, patients may continue to receive MK-8033 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Enrollment for Part C has been suspended.</description>
