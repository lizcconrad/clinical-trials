      RATIONALE: A positron emission tomography scan is a procedure in which a small amount of
      radioactive sugar is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed,
      computerized pictures of areas inside the body where tumor cells are found. This study is
      looking at whether the drug zoledronic acid interferes with the ability of a PET scan to find
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well positron emission tomography works when
      given together with zoledronic acid in finding tumor cells in patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the PET response rate after zoledronic acid in patients with non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 dose of zoledronic acid on day 1 followed by
      3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine/PET to determine standardized uptake value.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
