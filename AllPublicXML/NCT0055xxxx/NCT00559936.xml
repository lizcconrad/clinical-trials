      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of Topical Bevacizumab
      (Avastin) for treatment of corneal neovascularization.

    <textblock>
      Primary outcomes measures included neovascular area (NA), defined as the area of the corneal
      vessels themselves; vessel caliber (VC), defined as the mean diameter of the corneal vessels;
      and invasion area (IA), defined as the fraction of the total cornea into which the vessels
      extend. The occurrence of ocular and systemic adverse events was closely monitored throughout
      the course of the study.

          -  Ability to understand and provide informed consent to participate in this study and
             willingness to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits.

          -  All female patients of childbearing potential will be excluded. A female is considered
             to be of childbearing potential unless she is postmenopausal and without menses for 12
             months or without a uterus and/or both ovaries.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or recent (≤ 1 month) systemic corticosteroid therapy or periocular
             corticosteroid injections to the study eye

          -  Current or recent (≤ 3 months) intravitreal drug injection to the study eye; recent (≤
             1 month) change in dose and frequency of topical steroids and/or non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory agents

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure of ≥ 150 mmHg or
             diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 90 mmHg; history of a thromboembolic event, including
             myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident

          -  Patients age 75 or older; history of renal abnormalities

          -  Recent (≤ 3 months ) or planned surgery

          -  History of coagulation abnormalities, including end stage liver disease or current
             anticoagulation medication other than aspirin (warfarin, heparin, enoxaparin, or
             similar anticoagulant agent)

          -  All female patients of childbearing potential (a female is considered to be of
             childbearing potential unless she is postmenopausal and without menses for 12 months
             or without a uterus and/or both ovaries)

          -  Any condition (including language barrier) that precludes patient's ability to comply
             with study requirements including completion of study
