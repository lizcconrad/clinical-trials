  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction is associated with a higher incidence of adverse cardiovascular
      events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD patients also show impaired
      function and number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs, adult stem cells) which circulate
      in adult blood and contribute to endothelial repair. Clinical studies suggest that
      endothelial function can be improved in CAD patients by consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa.
      Yet, the mechanism is not known. It is also not known whether flavanol-rich cocoa provides an
      additive, positive effect in patients who are already receiving the maximal recommended
      therapies for risk factor modification. Therefore, the researchers propose to perform an
      investigator-initiated, randomized controlled cross-over study administering flavanol-rich
      cocoa or a placebo for two months in CAD patients on optimal medical therapy. An improvement
      of endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) will be the primary
      endpoint of this study. The researchers propose to also measure determinants of FMD such as
      microvascular response, inflammatory markers, metabolites of nitric oxide, as well as the
      number and function of EPCs in the blood. Importantly, detailed food questionnaires and
      plasma flavanols/metabolites will help to further support a causal link between
      flavanol-intake and improved vascular function.
