  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall aim is to examine if ultrasound is as accurate as MRI and/or CT in the evaluation
      of dural venous sinuses. We hypothesize that sonography will be accurate (accuracy &gt;80%) for
      diagnosing specific anatomic findings of dural venous sinuses.

      Cranial ultrasound is an established technique for evaluation of the neonatal brain. However
      its role in the evaluation of cerebral dural venous sinuses in neonates has not been
      established. It is very important to evaluate the cerebral dural venous sinuses, as cerebral
      sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is an increasingly recognized condition in neonates.

      There is an obvious clinical need for systematically evaluating the role of ultrasound with
      doppler in the evaluation of cerebral venous sinuses. Advances in diagnostic imaging have led
      to rapid clinical implementation of newer technologies like MR and CT for evaluation of
      venous sinuses. However technological advances in older imaging methods like ultrasound which
      have advantages of being non-invasive and being performed at the bedside have not been
      evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All neonates (up to 28 days old) and preterm infants, hospitalized at HSC who need
             clinically indicated brain MR and MRV as part of their diagnostic workup. Clinical
             indications for MR could include birth asphyxia, seizures, irritability, lethargy,
             abnormal neurological examination, etc.

          2. Neonates and preterm infants &amp; who are clinically considered stable to undergo the
             ultrasound study. This will be determined at the bedside by the neonatology team in
             attendance.

          3. Where consent is available from parents.

          4. Only neonates and preterm infants who have undergone a technically adequate MRI study
             which includes vascular MR venography sequences or CT with contrast will be included.
             Assessments for technically adequacy will be made by the technologist or the
             supervising radiologist, as per clinical protocols currently used in the department of
             diagnostic imaging. This will be determined by referring to notes made on the request
             form and also by direct communication between the supervising radiologist and team
             members obtaining consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Vital signs will be monitored in the usual manner by the nurses in attendance in the
             neonatal unit. If the neonate is unstable, an ultrasound study will not be done.

          2. If after starting the ultrasound, any signs of instability are noted during the study,
             the ultrasound study will discontinued.

          3. If consent from parent or guardian is not available, the research ultrasound study
             will not be done.

          4. If the ultrasound cannot be done within a 10 hours window of the CT or MR study (due
             to technical problems with machine or skilled personnel not being available).

          5. Neonates &amp; preterm infants who have undergone technically inadequate MR and/or CT will
             not be included. Such technical inadequacy will be determined by referring to notes
             made by the technologist on the request form and by direct communication with the
             supervising radiologist.

          6. Neonates &amp; preterm infants undergoing repeat CT and/or MRs will be excluded from the
             study.
