      The purpose of the study is to determine whether familiar vocal stimulation, provided during
      coma recovery, improves outcomes for persons who are unconscious after severe TBI. The
      primary hypothesis is that unconscious persons who receive standard rehabilitation (SR) plus
      a high-dose of Familiar Voice stimulation (FVs) compared to unconscious persons who receive
      SR plus a sham stimulation (Sham Group) will demonstrate:

        1. Significantly more neurobehavioral functioning post-intervention compared to
           pre-intervention.

        2. Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), significantly higher average
           measures of volumetric activity in the whole brain, middle temporal gyrus bilaterally,
           primary auditory area, bilateral pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and/or the cerebellum
           post-intervention compared to pre-intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical advances have improved the odds of surviving a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      thereby increasing demands for rehabilitation. Medical rehabilitation management during coma
      recovery, however, has been hampered by a paucity of rigorous clinical trials examining
      rehabilitation effectiveness. This randomized clinical trial addresses this knowledge gap.
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a high dose of familiar vocal stimulation
      (FVs) improves outcomes for persons who are unconscious after severe TBI. The research
      objectives are to:

        1. Determine whether neural responses elicited with FVs improve neurobehavioral outcomes
           and/or elicit activations in expected regions.

        2. Examine the relationship between neurobehavioral and neurophysiological responses to
           high doses of FVs during coma recovery.

      There are two study cohorts and each group receives standard rehabilitation. The experimental
      group will be exposed daily to 40 minutes of FVs for 6 weeks. The Sham Group (Control Group
      2) will receive 40 minutes of sham treatment, or silence, daily for 6 weeks.

      The 40 minutes of FVs treatment will be provided in four 10 minute sessions. Each FV session
      will start with the subject hearing a familiar voice call the 'Subject's Own Name' aloud and
      then that same voice re-telling a memory or an event familiar to the subject. The person
      re-telling the event will be a person who experienced the event with the subject and who
      interacted with the subject on a daily basis for at least 1 year prior to injury.

    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after treatment ends (6 weeks after Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome, the DOCS, is a reliable, valid and precise measure of global neurobehavioral functioning shown to remain stable over six weeks.The DOCS-25 starts with a systematic observation followed by administration of 25 sensory stimuli. Best responses to each stimulus are rated on a scale of 0 to 2 and total raw scores range from 0 (worst) to 50 (best). The DOCS change was calculated as the value at endpoint (6 weeks after Baseline) minus the value at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Coma Near Coma Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after the 8th CNC assessment (4 weeks after Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The CNC scale measures arousal and awareness and test stimuli are administered to elicit a specified behavior. Presence/absence of this behavior is scored as 0, 2 or 4. Total raw scores range from 0 (consistently responsive) to 36 (extreme coma). The CNC change score was calculated as the 8th CNC measure minus the Baseline CNC measure. Since 2 CNC measurements were collected per week, the 8th CNC measure occurred in Week 4. To calculate the change, we used the eighth CNC measure because two patients (one per group) recovered full consciousness after the eighth CNC measure. In the second statistical analysis, all CNC measures were used to calculate the slope; this includes the Baseline CNC and CNC measures 2-8. Again, we used the first 8 CNC measures (instead of all 12 collected over 6 weeks of treatment) because two patients recovered full consciousness after the eighth CNC measure.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>All patients with possible impairment in sound conduction were withdrawn prior to randomization. In total, 5 participants were withdrawn prior to randomization: 1 participant failed the auditory pathway screen, 2 participants recovered full consciousness, and 2 participants were placed in hospice by LAR.

        <description>The primary outcome, the DOCS, is a reliable, valid and precise measure of global neurobehavioral functioning shown to remain stable over six weeks.The DOCS-25 starts with a systematic observation followed by administration of 25 sensory stimuli. Best responses to each stimulus are rated on a scale of 0 to 2 and total raw scores range from 0 (worst) to 50 (best). The DOCS change was calculated as the value at endpoint (6 weeks after Baseline) minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Coma Near Coma Scale</title>
        <description>The CNC scale measures arousal and awareness and test stimuli are administered to elicit a specified behavior. Presence/absence of this behavior is scored as 0, 2 or 4. Total raw scores range from 0 (consistently responsive) to 36 (extreme coma). The CNC change score was calculated as the 8th CNC measure minus the Baseline CNC measure. Since 2 CNC measurements were collected per week, the 8th CNC measure occurred in Week 4. To calculate the change, we used the eighth CNC measure because two patients (one per group) recovered full consciousness after the eighth CNC measure. In the second statistical analysis, all CNC measures were used to calculate the slope; this includes the Baseline CNC and CNC measures 2-8. Again, we used the first 8 CNC measures (instead of all 12 collected over 6 weeks of treatment) because two patients recovered full consciousness after the eighth CNC measure.</description>

      <desc>A Data Safety Monitoring Plan was completed each day of study participation. Baseline vital signs/safety indicators were recorded on the Day 1 of admission. Changes in severity of vital signs/safety indicators were recorded. If changes were noted, the degree of severity was indicated by referring to the severity definition for each indicator.</desc>

Familiar Voice Stimulation High Dose: The High Dose intervention is 1,680 minutes of Familiar Vocal Stimulation (FVs) provided in 40 minute daily segments at least 2 hours apart and for 6 weeks. Four CDs with 10 minutes of FVs preceded by the familiar voice calling out the subject's name, will be played (1 at a time) each day for 6 weeks providing 1,680 minutes of FVs.</description>
