      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of dark chocolate with green tea in
      healthy subjects on clot formation (platelet activity) cholesterol profile and markers of
      inflammation in two groups.

      The first group will be on a regimen of dark chocolate, and the second group will be on a
      regimen of green tea. Clinical outcomes will be determined after seven days of each treatment
      and both groups will undergo both treatments subsequently and serve as their own control.

      The hypothesis is that both green tea and dark chocolate will reduce platelet activity and
      reduce LDL, hsCRP and increase HDL.

      Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds ubiquitous in fruits and vegetables. They appear in
      especially high concentrations in the form of flavanols in green tea as well as in cocoa, and
      are known to have beneficial antioxidant effects in vitro. Flavonoids have been proposed as a
      key protective dietary component, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, including the
      reduction of elevated blood pressure in persons with hypertension and capable of decreasing
      LDL.

      The aim of this prospective single cross-over study is to assess the effect of green tea and
      dark chocolate consumption on inhibiting platelet activation, Lipid levels, and hsCRP in
      healthy volunteers.

      This research will be done at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore and will include 35 subjects who
      will be randomized equally between the two groups.

      All blood work will be processed at the Sinai Center for Thrombosis Research. Clinical
      outcomes will be recorded using a standard case report form.

    <description>The green tea group consumed first daily one liter of green tea infusate made of 4 bags left in boiling water during 3 minutes.
After a four week washout-time they were switched over to the dark chocolate treatment, which included consumption of 3.5 ounces 70% dark chocolate.
Blood was drawn before and after each intervention, to check platelet activity with flow cytometry, HDL, LDL and hsCRP Levels</description>
