  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project pretends to demonstrate that a psychoeducative program implemented in
      the context of PC can produce a significant increase in the quality of life of patients with
      FM, as well as a decrease in the use of sanitary and social services, compared to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most fibromyalgic patients are attended at primary care (PC). However, the effectiveness of
      the treatments prescribed by general practitioners is usually scarce. The main objective of
      the present research is to assess the efficacy of a structured psychoeducative intervention,
      combined with relaxation, developed to improve the quality of life of patients suffering
      fibromyalgia (FM). The second objective is to assess the cost-effectiveness of this
      multimodal intervention.

    <description>Randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up involving two groups, one of which is the intervention group that includes patients receiving a psychoeducative program and the other is the control group formed by patients treated for FM in the usual way.
Setting. Three urban PC centers in the province of Barcelona (Spain) Sample. The total sample comprises 218 patients (over 18 years of age) suffering FM, selected from a database (Rheumatology service-Viladecans hospital) of patients with this illness. Only those patients introduced in the database between the years 2005 and 2007 are included in the selection. Selected patients are asked for written informed consent to participate in the study.</description>
