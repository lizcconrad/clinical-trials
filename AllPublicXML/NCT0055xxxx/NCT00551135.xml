    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether pregabalin added to the standard of care with
      dosing starting preoperatively and continuing for 1 week post surgery will decrease the
      intensity of acute post-operative pain following inguinal hernia repair.

             surgery.

          -  The subject will be available for a visit within 72 hours of the day of surgery if not
             admitted the night before for baseline assessments before taking any study medication,

        <description>OR-SDS: a self-administered assessment of 10 common opioid-related side effects (symptoms). A CME is a severe or very severe symptom (or moderate or greater severity symptom of confusion). The Total Distinct CME score is the sum of CMEs across symptoms (range: 0 [none] to 10 [10 CMEs]); the Cumulative Total Distinct (CT Distinct) CME score is the sum of Total Distinct CME scores at observation and prior observations. The Total CME score is the same as the Total Distinct CME score except that only 1 CME is counted if both nausea and vomiting (or retching) occur (range: 0 [none] to 9 [9 CMEs]).</description>

        <description>Anxiety VAS is a single-item self-administered continuous measure of anxiety using a 100-millimeter (mm) line on which the subject is asked to place a mark indicating the intensity of current anxiety. The score is the distance in mm from the left-most point on the line to the subject’s mark; range: 0 (Not at all anxious) at the left-most point to 100 (Extremely anxious) at the right-most point. Performed prior to blood draws.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D is a self-administered questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in 5 domains (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression). Scores from the 5 domains are used to calculate a single index value: the Health State Profile Score; range: 0.0 (death) to 1.0 (perfect health), higher scores indicating better health state.</description>

        <description>The PCS is a self-administered questionnaire with 13 items, each scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time) for extent to which participant catastrophizes postoperative pain. Total score is sum of scores for all questions (range: 0 to 52); Subscale scores: Rumination (sum of scores for 4 items; range: 0 to 16); Magnification (sum of scores for 3 items; range: 0 to 12); and Helplessness (sum of scores for 6 items; range: 0 to 24); higher scores mean a greater extent of pain catastrophizing.</description>

        <description>m-BPI-sf: a self-administered 11-point Likert rating scale to rate pain in the past 24 hours. Pain interference index score is mean of 7 individual item scores for interference of pain with functional activities (general activity, mood, walking ability, relations with other people, sleep, normal work, and enjoyment of life); range: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes with functional activities). Pain severity index score is mean of 4 individual item scores for pain severity (pain right now, and worst, least, and average pain); range: 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).</description>
