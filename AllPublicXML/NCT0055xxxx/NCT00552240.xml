  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of ritonavir
      (RTV)-boosted atazanavir with nevirapine, each on a background of emtricitabine and tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (DF).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited from 28 Sep 2007 through 23 Mar 2009 at 18 sites throughout the US. The sites were comprised of medical centers or private practice physicians.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was a 28 day screening period where a genotype report was run. If patients were resistant to any of the study medication, they were not to be randomized into the study. Patients also needed to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to be eligible. 154 patients were enrolled but 2 were not treated, leaving 152 in full analysis set.</pre_assignment_details>
