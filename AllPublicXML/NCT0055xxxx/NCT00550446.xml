    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety, over 6 months, of 5
      doses of CP-690,550 for the treatment of adults with active rheumatoid arthritis. Five out of
      seven subjects will receive CP-690,550. One out of seven will receive adalimumab (HumiraÂ®)
      and one out of seven will only receive inactive substances (placebo.)

    <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

    <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

        <description>The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. Normal range of CRP is 0 milligram per liter (mg/L) to 10 mg/L. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement.</description>

        <description>The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. Normal range of CRP is 0 mg/L to 10 mg/L. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

          <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

DAS28-4 (ESR) &lt;= 3.2 implies low disease activity and &gt; 3.2 to 5.1 implies moderate to high disease activity, and &lt; 2.6 = remission.</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline measure. Here, 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. n=number of participants evaluable at specific time points for each arm group, respectively.</population>

        <title>Euro Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D)-Health State Profile Utility Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQoL Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 24/ ET</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline measure. Here, 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. n=number of participants evaluable at specific time points for each arm group, respectively.</population>

          <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQoL Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Medical Outcome Study- Sleep Scale (MOS-SS)</title>
        <description>Participant-rated questionnaire to assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. Consists of a 12-item based on 7 sub scales: sleep disturbance (SD), snoring (Sno), awakened short of breath (ASOB) or with headache, sleep adequacy (Ade), and somnolence (Som) (range:0-100); sleep quantity (Qua)(range:0-24), and optimal (Opt) sleep (yes: 1, no: 0)and nine item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide composite scores: sleep problem summary (SPS) and overall sleep problems (OSP). Except sleep adequacy, optimal sleep and quantity, higher scores=greater impairment. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range* 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Medical Outcome Study- Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) at Week 2, 12 and 24/ET</title>
        <description>Participant-rated questionnaire to assess key constructs of sleep over the past week. Consists of a 12-item based on 7 subscales: sleep disturbance (SD), snoring (Sno), awakened short of breath (A SOB) or with headache, sleep adequacy (Ade), and somnolence (Som) (range: 0-100); sleep quantity (Qua) (range: 0-24), and optimal (Opt) sleep (yes: 1, no: 0) and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance were constructed to provide 2 composite scores: sleep problem summary (SPS) and overall sleep problems (OSP). Except sleep adequacy, optimal sleep and quantity, higher scores=greater impairment. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range*100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</description>

        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline measure.

        <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale</title>
        <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 12, 24/ ET</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline measure. Here, 'N' (Number of Participants Analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. n=number of participants evaluable at specific time points for each arm group, respectively.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale at Week 2, 12 and 24/ET</title>
        <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>
