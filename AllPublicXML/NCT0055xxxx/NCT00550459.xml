      elderly subjects with chronic sub-clinical (i.e., asymptomatic) hyponatremia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized, with stratification by baseline sodium &lt;130 or ≥ 130
      mEq/L[mmol/L] to receive either tolvaptan 15 mg tablet or matching placebo tablet at doses of
      15, 30 or 60 mg for 21 days. During this period, fluid restrictions should be loosened or
      suspended, until the subject's response to therapy can be evaluated, typically over the first
      few days of therapy. Fluid restriction may be reinstituted at any time in subjects whose
      sodium fails to improve or worsens with study therapy. A forced-titration up to 60 mg of
      study drug by day 3 to 7 will be based on the subject's serum sodium Subjects entering the
      study with a serum sodium concentration less than 130 mEq/L[mmol/L] may be fluid restricted
      if necessary at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects should be monitored closely
      during the first 24 hours of treatment for dosing titration. The total dosing duration will
      be up to 21 days (plus 3 day treatment window). Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 22
      (+3 days) for assessments and will complete a follow-up visit on Day 28 (+2 days).

The ability to stand upright without moving is assessed using the SWAY meter that is modeled on the Wright Ataxiameter. A cord from the meter is attached to the subject who is required to stand as still as possible with feet apart and eyes closed for 1 minute. The test is then repeated with eyes open for 1 minute. The outcomes of these tests are combined and measured as a movement Z-score. Higher result=better postural stability); ITT population</description>

          -  Subjects with serum sodium concentrations ≥118 and ≤122 mEq/L[mmol/L] at screening and
             baseline may be entered into the trial based on consultation and approval from the
             study medical monitor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Conditions or history which may present a safety concern to the subject or their
             offspring or extreme susceptibility to hypotension with sudden fluid loss (aquaresis).

          -  Hyponatremia that is acute, easily reversible, artifactual, or due to a condition not
             associated with vasopressin excess or likely to respond to aquaretic therapy.

          -  Conditions associated with an independent imminent risk of morbidity and mortality.

          -  Conditions which may confound the assessment of endpoints, history of poor compliance,
             participation in a clinical trial believed by the PI or Sponsor likely to confound
             endpoint assessments.
