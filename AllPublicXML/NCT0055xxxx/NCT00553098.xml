      This phase II trial studies fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation with or without
      alemtuzumab followed by donor stem cell transplant to see how well it works in treating
      patients with immunodeficiency or other nonmalignant inherited disorders. Giving
      chemotherapy, such as fludarabine phosphate, a monoclonal antibody such as alemtuzumab, and
      radiation therapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal
      cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells.
      The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining
      abnormal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Improve donor chimerism levels in patients with inherited nonmalignant disorders
      undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using a reduced intensity conditioning
      regimen either through the addition of Campath (alemtuzumab) or a slightly higher dose of
      total-body irradiation (TBI).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Decrease the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
      through use of marrow as the stem cell source and Campath.

      II. Assess disease response following HCT.

      III. Immune reconstitution following HCT.

      IV. Incidence of infections.

      V. Overall survival.

      VI. Percent of patients with cluster of differentiation (CD)33/CD19 donor chimerism &gt; 50%.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients with no life-threatening viral or fungal infections within 1
      month before the planned hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) receive alemtuzumab
      intravenously (IV) over 6 hours on day -10 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on
      days -4 to -2. They also undergo low-dose TBI on day 0. Patients with hemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked
      (IPEX) syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, or life-threatening viral or fungal infections within 1
      month before the planned HCT receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to
      -2 and undergo 2 low doses of TBI on day 0.

      HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo HCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally (PO) 2-3 times daily beginning
      on day -3 and continuing until day 100 followed by a taper until day 180. They also receive
      mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO 3 times daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 40
      followed by a taper until day 96.

      After completion of HCT, patients are followed up at day 84, at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months
      post-transplantation, and then once a year for 3 years.

    <description>The study will be considered a success and the protocol worthy of further study if there is sufficient evidence that this rate is greater than the 50% rate observed in the most recently transplanted patients with nonmalignant disorders. Analyses will be carried out separately for the alemtuzumab recipients and the TBI recipients. We will be 80% confidence of success if a one-sided 80% confidence interval for the proportion of patients with successful chimerism exceeds 50%. Cumulative incidence will be used to evaluate the probability of chimerism.</description>

             function and the degree of portal hypertension; patients will be excluded if they are
             found to have: fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal
             hypertension, bridging fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, a history of

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Fertile men or women who are unwilling to use contraceptives during HCT and up to 12
             months post-treatment

             amphotericin formulation or mold-active azoles for greater than 1 month will not be
             eligible for this protocol (either regimen A or B)

          -  Donors: Identical twin

          -  Donors: Pregnancy

          -  Donors: HIV positive

          -  Donors: A positive anti-donor cytotoxic cross match is absolute donor exclusion

          -  Donors: If a patient is homozygous at a particular loci, mismatching at that loci is
             not allowed due to an isolated graft rejection vector, i.e., patient A*0101 and the
             donor is A*0101, A*0201; such a mismatch may increase the risk of graft rejection; if
             patient and donor pairs are both homozygous at a mismatched loci, they are considered
             a two-HLA antigen mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the donor is A*0201, and
             this type of mismatch is not allowed

          <description>CONDITIONING REGIMEN: *Patients with no life-threatening viral or fungal infections within 1 month before the planned HCT receive alemtuzumab IV over 6 hours on day -10 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2. They also undergo low-dose TBI on day 0. Patients with HLH, IPEX syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, or life-threatening viral or fungal infections within 1 month before the planned HCT receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2 and undergo 2 low doses of TBI on day 0.
HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo HCT on day 0. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or PO 2-3 times daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 100 followed by a taper until day 180. They also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO 3 times daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 40 followed by a taper until day 96.

        <description>The study will be considered a success and the protocol worthy of further study if there is sufficient evidence that this rate is greater than the 50% rate observed in the most recently transplanted patients with nonmalignant disorders. Analyses will be carried out separately for the alemtuzumab recipients and the TBI recipients. We will be 80% confidence of success if a one-sided 80% confidence interval for the proportion of patients with successful chimerism exceeds 50%. Cumulative incidence will be used to evaluate the probability of chimerism.</description>

            <description>CONDITIONING REGIMEN: *Patients with no life-threatening viral or fungal infections within 1 month before the planned HCT receive alemtuzumab IV over 6 hours on day -10 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2. They also undergo low-dose TBI on day 0. Patients with HLH, IPEX syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, or life-threatening viral or fungal infections within 1 month before the planned HCT receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2 and undergo 2 low doses of TBI on day 0.
HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo HCT on day 0. IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or PO 2-3 times daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 100 followed by a taper until day 180. They also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO 3 times daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 40 followed by a taper until day 96.
