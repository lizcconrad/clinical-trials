  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation study of 3-hour IV infusions of
      RH-1 administered to patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

      Treatment will continue until a patient meets criteria for discontinuation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven advanced solid tumors or NHL, relapsed or refractory to
             conventional treatment, or for which no conventional therapy exists or is considered
             acceptable for the patient.

          2. Tumor accessible for biopsy (required in expanded cohort of 24 patients only; optional
             in all other patients).

          3. At least 18 years of age.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

          5. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.

          6. Adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function as defined by the following:
             absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, total
             bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (AST/ALT ≤ 5 × ULN if documented
             hepatic involvement), creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or if serum creatinine is elevated then
             patient has a calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min.

          7. Toxic manifestations of previous treatment(s) have resolved, with the exceptions of ≤
             Grade 2 fatigue if stable for &gt; 2 months, ≤ Grade 2 alopecia and/or other Grade 1
             toxicities, which in the opinion of the investigator should not exclude the patient
             (eg, palmar erythema; stable Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy).

          8. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to the first day of study treatment. Women who are postmenopausal for at
             least 1 year (defined as &gt; 12 months since last menses) or are surgically sterilized
             do not require this test. Women of child-bearing potential and their male partners
             must agree to practice a medically acceptable contraceptive regimen from study
             treatment initiation until at least 30 days after the last administration of RH-1.
             Adequate methods of contraception are double barrier methods (condoms with spermicidal
             jelly or foam, and diaphragm with spermicidal jelly or foam), oral, depot and
             injectable contraceptives, and intrauterine device (IUD). RH-1 should not be
             administered to women who are breast feeding.

          9. Men who are not surgically sterile must agree to practice a medically acceptable
             contraceptive regimen from study treatment initiation until at least 90 days after the
             last administration of RH-1.

         10. Given written informed consent (IC).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active concurrent malignancy, with the exception of adequately treated carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix and/or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. If there is a
             history of prior malignancy, the patient must be disease-free for ≥ 5 years.

          2. Receipt of any investigational or conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
             endocrine therapy, or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study treatment or planned
             use during the course of the study. Hormonal therapy (gonadotropin-releasing hormone
             analog [leuprolide] for prostate cancer, somatostatin analog [octreotide] for
             carcinoid tumor, and anti-estrogens for breast cancer) will be allowed if the drug
             administration has been stable for ≥ 4 weeks.

          3. Use of any radiation therapy (RT) within 28 days prior to study treatment or planned
             use during the course of the study.

          4. Requires therapeutic levels of anticoagulation therapy.

          5. Failed treatment with a bone marrow transplant.

          6. Active uncontrolled infection, underlying medical condition such as patients at poor
             medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease, or other serious illness that
             would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment.

          7. Known to be positive for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV).

          8. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases or lesions for which treatment is
             required.

          9. Major surgery within 4 weeks of planned start of treatment.

         10. Previous exposure to RH-1.
