      Rational: The possible contribution of methacholine challenge test via spirometry to the
      clinical diagnosis of young children with various respiratory symptoms, the most appropriate
      spirometry index, and the proper cutoff point concentration that will define airway
      sensitivity have not yet been explored. Objectives: To assess airway reactivity by spirometry
      in a large group of children aged 3-6years with various respiratory symptoms.

      We aimed to gather information concerning methacholine challenge test performed in children
      previously diagnosed with asthma (asthmatics) and 48 had prolonged cough (coughers) from the
      pediatric clinic at Meyer Children's Hospital.

      Tests were performed by inhalation of triple-concentration increments (0.06
      to13.9mg/ml/methacholine).

      Spirometry was determined at baseline and after each inhalation in duplicate sets. End of
      test was defined by a fall of 20%FEV1 baseline (PC20-FEV1). PC20-FEV1&lt;4.0mg/ml was considered
      positive). Results from the challenge were related to data from questionnaires concerning
      respiratory symptoms were analyzed at the end of the studies.
