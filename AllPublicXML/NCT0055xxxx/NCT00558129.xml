      of conventional laminectomy in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis as measured by the Zurich
      Claudication Questionnaire.

      The clinical study described herein aims to compare surgical outcomes of X-STOP® Interspinous
      Process Decompression® (IPD) system implantation and conventional laminectomy in subjects
      requiring surgical intervention due to symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and a
      confirmed diagnosis on MRI, X-ray or CT. Patients with LSS meeting entry criteria will be
      randomized to either X-STOP® IPD or laminectomy treatment. Patients will remain blinded to
      the procedure received. The primary study outcome is group differences in the Zurich
      Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) at 12 months post-operative. In addition, each subject will
      undergo follow-up assessment at 2 weeks and 2, 12 and 24 months post-operative. The secondary
      objective is to compare safety profiles and the radiographic outcomes between groups using
      pre- and post-operative MRI and flexion/extension X-rays, to measure changes in canal and
      neuroforaminal cross sectional areas and spinal stability, respectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 50

          2. Has completed at least 6 months of conservative therapy which may include but is not
             limited to epidural steroid injection, oral steroids, NSAIDS, analgesics, physical
             therapy, and/or spinal manipulation.

          3. Symptoms of leg/buttock/groin pain with or without back pain that are exacerbated by
             lumbar extension and relieved in flexion. If back pain is also present it must be
             partially relieved when the patient flexes.

          4. Diagnosis of NIC due to lumbar stenosis at 1 or 2 lumbar levels confirmed by X-ray,
             MRI or CT.

          5. Subject is a surgical candidate with disease severity justifying that BOTH laminectomy
             and X-STOP IPD placement are clinically appropriate treatment options.

          6. Baseline score of &gt;2.0 in the Physical Function domain of the Zurich Claudication
             Questionnaire (ZCQ). Because this is a post-market study, the Inclusion Criteria are
             consistent with FDA approved X-STOP indication for use (moderately impaired physical
             function), which requires a ZCQ physical function score of &gt;2.0.

          7. Subject is able to walk at least 50 feet.

          8. Subject is willing and able to comply with required follow-up testing and expected to
             be physically able to return for evaluation at scheduled follow-up visits.

          9. Subject is able to understand the risks and benefits of participating in the study.

         10. Subject understands and has signed the study informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Spinal stenosis involving more than 2 lumbar levels.

          2. Any previous lumbar spine surgery.

          3. Subject has unremitting pain in any spinal position or axial back pain only without
             leg/buttock/groin pain.

          4. Evidence that subject's symptoms are due to vascular claudication.

          5. Subject has significant instability of the lumbar spine, e.g., isthmic
             spondylolisthesis or degenerative spondylolisthesis greater than Grade 1 (on a scale
             of 1 to 4).

          7. Subject has significant scoliosis (Cobb angle is greater than 25 degrees).

          8. Subject has cauda equina syndrome defined as neural compression causing neurogenic
             bowel (rectal incontinence) or bladder (bladder retention or incontinence)
             dysfunction.

          9. Subject has a fixed motor deficit or known peripheral neuropathy.

         10. Subject has a degenerative neurologic disease.

             (e.g., vertebral, hip, wrist) OR subject has severe osteoporosis of the spine or hip,
             defined as bone mineral density (BMD) in the spine or hip more than 2.5 SD below the
             mean of adult normals. If the Investigator suspects osteoporosis, a DEXA scan should
             be done.

         15. Subject has a known allergy to the implant materials (this includes titanium or
             titanium alloy and polyetheretherketone for X-STOP IPD).

         16. Subject has a bleeding disorder or an active systemic disease such as HIV, hepatitis,
             etc.
