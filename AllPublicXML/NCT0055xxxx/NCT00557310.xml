  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use imaging technologies to demonstrate the effects of
      teriparatide on bone structure following 18 to 24 months of therapy in postmenopausal women
      with osteoporosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As teriparatide is approved for up to 24 months of treatment in the US, patients will be
      given the option to continue in a 6-month extension phase upon completion of 18 months of
      teriparatide treatment. This extension will allow for collection of additional bone quality
      data. In Canada, the use of teriparatide is currently approved for 18 months. Patients in
      Canada may be given the opportunity to participate in the 6-month extension phase, contingent
      upon Health Canada approval of the use of teriparatide treatment for 24 months.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Surface-to-Curve Ratio (SCR) in the Distal Radius at Month 18 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>SCR is a measure of the computed ratio of plate-like to rod-like structures in a given volume of trabecular bone and reflects the integrity of the trabecular network. The higher the value for SCR, the more intact the trabecular network. Least squares (LS) mean of the percent change from baseline to 18 months is from a mixed model repeated measurements analysis. The model included terms for investigator site, prior bisphosphonate use, visit and baseline.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Surface-to-Curve Ratio (SCR) in the Distal Radius at Month 18 Endpoint</title>
        <description>SCR is a measure of the computed ratio of plate-like to rod-like structures in a given volume of trabecular bone and reflects the integrity of the trabecular network. The higher the value for SCR, the more intact the trabecular network. Least squares (LS) mean of the percent change from baseline to 18 months is from a mixed model repeated measurements analysis. The model included terms for investigator site, prior bisphosphonate use, visit and baseline.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Surface-to-Curve Ratio (SCR) in the Distal Radius at Month 24 Endpoint</title>
        <description>SCR is a measure of the computed ratio of plate-like to rod-like structures in a given volume of trabecular bone and reflects the integrity of the trabecular network. The higher the value for SCR, the more intact the trabecular network. Least squares (LS) mean of the percent change from baseline to 24 months is from a mixed model repeated measurements analysis.
