    <measure>Depression and Psychosis Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This response rate refers to the percentage of patients who experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in symptoms. Specifically, this refers to a 50 percent reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 (HAM-D-17) scores from baseline and no psychotic symptoms as measured by the Structured Clinical Interview for DMS-IV psychosis module. HAM-D-17 scores range from 0-50 with a score of &gt;23 considered severely depressed and &lt;7 to be mildly to not at all depressed.</description>

    <description>Everyone in this study will receive aripiprazole and an antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). There is only one arm for this study.
Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic medication that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia.
You will receive aripiprazole (Abilify) and one of the following SSRI antidepressant medications that will be determined by the study doctor and you: sertraline (Zoloft), citalapram (Celexa), or escitalopram (Lexapro). The dose of aripiprazole (Abilify) will be 10 milligrams a day, and the starting doses for the SSRI anti-depressants will be: sertraline (Zoloft) 50 milligrams a day, citalopram (Celexa) 20 milligrams a day, and escitalopram (Lexapro) 10 milligrams a day.</description>
