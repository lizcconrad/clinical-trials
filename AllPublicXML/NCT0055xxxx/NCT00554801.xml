  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of central auditory dysfunction in war fighters who are exposed to
      high-explosive blasts while serving in combat have not been clearly determined. The
      objectives of this study are to determine whether central auditory processing (CAP) disorders
      are associated with exposure to high-explosive blasts. This study will also examine the
      incidence, magnitude and timing of spontaneous recovery of CAP function from blast exposure.
      The information provided by this study will help guide clinicians in both the military and VA
      health care systems regarding the likelihood of central auditory processing disorders in
      soldiers returning from deployment and suggest some clinical rehabilitative strategies for
      the treatment of these patients with CAP deficits.

      The incidence and nature of central auditory dysfunction in combat soldiers who are exposed
      to high-explosive blasts have not been determined. Using a battery of behavioral and
      neurophysiological auditory tests, we propose to evaluate central auditory function in
      soldiers who recently have been exposed to explosive blasts while deployed in Iraq or
      Afghanistan. In collaboration with the Army Audiology &amp; Speech Center at Walter Reed Army
      Medical Center (WRAMC), the research will be coordinated at the National Center for
      Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) at the Portland VA Medical Center, and data
      collection will take place both at the NCRAR and at WRAMC. The study objectives are to
      determine if specific central auditory processing disorders are often associated with
      exposure to high-explosive blasts, and if these disorders spontaneously recover or remain
      over time. One hundred patients who have suffered a blast exposure, but have either no brain
      damage or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), will be recruited at WRAMC to participate in
      this research study. A battery of central auditory processing tests will be administered to
      participants as soon as possible after their arrival at WRAMC. Patients who demonstrate
      aspects of central auditory processing disorder will be invited to participate in further
      testing nine to twelve months later. Those subjects will be brought to the NCRAR at the
      Portland VA Medical Center or will return to WRAMC for two days of auditory testing, where
      they will undergo the same battery of tests administered initially. Control subjects who do
      not have a history of blast exposure and who are matched in age, gender, and audiometric
      configuration with the experimental subjects will also be tested at the NCRAR site. Data
      extracted by interview and from medical records, including details of the blast exposure,
      scores on overall tests of brain function administered by the WRAMC TBI team, presence or
      absence of post traumatic stress disorder, as well as self-report questionnaires regarding
      quality of life, presence of tinnitus and/or balance problems, will be used in the
      interpretation of results.

          <description>The study group includes soldiers who have recently been exposed to a high-explosive blast while stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan. They will be recruited at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC.
Audiological testing: Subjects will take part in a battery of audiological tests meant to evaluate the function and status of the auditory system. These tests are similar to the kinds of testing carried out routinely in audiology clinics, and include behavioral tests of pure tone hearing, speech perception, and central auditory function, and electrophysiological testing of the middle ear and of the central auditory system.</description>
