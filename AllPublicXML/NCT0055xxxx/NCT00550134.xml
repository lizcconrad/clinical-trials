  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer often complain that their &quot;mind does not seem to be clear.&quot; This can be
      due to stress, depression, anxiety, or physical problems caused by cancer or the treatments
      used to control symptoms. There are many purposes for this study; one of them is to learn
      about the effects of cancer treatments on the brain, and another is to identify useful tools
      to detect these effects. The results of this study may stimulate new research comparing
      different treatments to the current treatment so the researchers may learn how to treat
      symptoms more effectively and improve patient quality of life. We would also like to learn
      more about the effects chemotherapy may have on DNA.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal study to examine time-dependent neurocognitive changes in
      patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. This study will assess
      chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction. The researchers will recruit patients with
      localized breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for the first time and will test the
      effects of chemotherapy on patients' cognitive function utilizing a standardized
      neuropsychological battery. Patients scheduled for chemotherapy will be given a battery of
      neuropsychological undergo MRI evaluation prior to beginning chemotherapy and one month
      following completion of treatment.
