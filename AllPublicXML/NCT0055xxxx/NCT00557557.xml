      Subjects who are planning to undergo surgery for placement of HAI therapy pump will be
      considered for enrollment. Standard HAI therapy requires a laparotomy and placement of an
      intrahepatic arterial catheter that is connected to one of several commercially available
      subcutaneous electronic pumps. The pump is then used to deliver FUDR directly to the liver,
      usually beginning four weeks after surgery and lasts on average for a period of six to twelve
      months after the study. Current HAI therapy regimens often alternate FUDR with systemic
      chemotherapy. This study will examine the addition of a one hour isolated hepatic perfusion
      with 5-FU and Oxaliplatin prior to this standard treatment. Subjects will be given the
      consent form to review and after sufficient time to review the information, interested
      subjects will have the opportunity to ask questions of the investigators. Subjects interested
      in enrolling in the trial will then sign informed consent and clinical data will be collected
      from their chart to ensure that they meet eligibility requirements. The study will consist of
      a one hour isolated liver perfusion that will be performed at the time of the laparotomy to
      place the HAI therapy pump. Following surgery subjects will be monitored in the ICU for 24-48
      hours and potentially in the hospital for an additional 5-7 days. Subjects will be free to
      start standard HAI therapy regimens four to six weeks following surgery. The duration of
      treatment, dose of HAI therapy and the decision to combine HAI with systemic chemotherapy
      will be at the discretion of the treating physician.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven measurable metastatic colorectal cancer limited
             to the parenchyma of the liver by preoperative radiological studies. Limited
             resectable extrahepatic disease is acceptable if the liver is felt to be the dominate
             site of life threatening disease.

          -  No chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy for their malignancy in the 4 weeks
             prior to the liver perfusion and must have recovered from all side effects.

          -  An ECOG performance standard of 0, 1 or 2 for 24 hours prior to surgery.

          -  Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and a PT &lt; 2 seconds
             greater than the upper limit of normal.

          -  Age equal to 18 years or older and greater than 30 kg.

          -  Platelet counts greater than 100,000, a hematocrit &gt; 27.0, a white blood count &gt;
             3000/µl, Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/μL and a creatinine less than or equal to
             1.5 mg/dL or a creatinine clearance of &gt; 60 mL/min. Patients with elevations in
             hepatic transaminases secondary to the presence of metastatic disease in the liver are
             eligible.

          -  Adequate hepatic function as evidenced by:

               -  Serum total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

             informed consent.

          -  The disease in the liver must be considered unresectable as defined by greater than
             three sites of disease in the liver, bilobar disease, and tumor abutting major
             vascular or ductal structures making anatomic resection with preservation of liver
             function impossible.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential and their partners must agree to use an effective
             form of contraception during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant patients and nursing mothers will be excluded due to the unknown effects of
             oxaliplatin on the fetus or newborn.

          -  Patients with active CNS metastases. Patients with stable CNS disease, who have
             undergone radiotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to the planned first protocol treatment

             manifested by ascites, esophageal varices on endoscopy, or radiologic studies showing
             significant collateral vessels around the organs drained by the portal venous system
             will be excluded.

          -  Patients with ischemic cardiac disease or history of congestive heart failure with an
             LVEF &lt; 40% will be excluded.

          -  Patients with COPD or other chronic pulmonary disease with PFTs indicating an FEV&lt; 50%
