      This is an open label, single center, controlled study with each subject's two treatment
      plaque areas assigned by the investigator 1:1 to (a) PH-10 with ambient light exposure and
      (b) PH-10 with 544 nm LED light illumination at 10 J/cm2. A third plaque area will receive no
      treatment and serve as a control.

      Subjects with at least three distinct, stable study plaque areas will receive the
      experimental therapy to two treatment plaque areas twice a week (2-5 days apart) for the
      lesser of 12 weeks or until remission is observed in the treatment plaque areas. If remission
      is observed in a treatment plaque area then treatment of that area will be discontinued and
      the area assessed weekly. A third plaque area (control plaque area) will receive no drug or
      light treatment and serve as an internal control.

      Primary efficacy will be assessed 12 weeks after initial PH-10 treatment. Subjects will be
      followed for a total of 16 weeks to allow assessment of Durability of Response of treated
      lesions and comprehensive follow-up of adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in at least three distinct plaque areas,
             each separated by at least a 2.5-cm band of normal skin. Study plaque areas, each
             covering a contiguous area up to 15 x 35 cm in size, should have a minimum plaque size
             of 2 cm2. All study plaque areas must be on the trunk or extremities (excluding palms,
             soles, scalp, and facial or intertriginous sites).

          -  Fitzpatrick skin type I-VI.

          -  Ability to understand and sign the informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are pregnant, attempting to conceive, or
             nursing an infant.

          -  Subjects who have received PUVA or UVB light therapy or systemic antipsoriatic therapy
             within 4 weeks of study treatment (two weeks for methotrexate).

          -  Subjects who have received topical antipsoriatic therapy (including corticosteroids,
             tar, anthralin, or Vitamin D analogs) to the study plaque areas within 2 weeks of
             study treatment.

          -  Subjects who have received any photosensitizing or phototoxic drug within 4 weeks of
             study treatment.

          -  Subjects who have received any approved biologic drug therapy for psoriasis within 3
             months or 5 half-lives of study treatment.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical research study within 4 weeks of study
             treatment.

          -  Subjects with a history of porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus or xeroderma
             pigmentosum.

          -  Subjects with clinical conditions that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator,
             may pose a health risk to the subject by being involved in the study or detrimentally
             affect regular follow-up of the subject.
