  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring has proven beneficial in increasing safety and
      improving patient care during pediatric cardiac surgery and during Pediatric Intensive Care
      Unit (PICU) stays. NIRS estimates the amount of oxygen in tissues by comparing the tissue's
      absorption of two wavelengths of light corresponding to hemoglobin carrying oxygen and
      hemoglobin without oxygen.

      During cardiac surgery, multi-site NIRS monitoring is used to determine the heart's output by
      comparing the amount of oxygen available to discrete regions of the body nourished by
      different parts of the circulatory system. NIRS leads placed on the forehead detect oxygen
      available to the brain (cerebral), while leads placed over the kidney reflect oxygen
      available to the internal organs (somatic).

      NIRS monitoring has been used for studying muscle oxygen usage during exercise in normal and
      disease states. Cerebral oxygenation at peak exercise at has been studied with NIRS
      monitoring. The use of multi-site NIRS monitoring during exercise stress testing for studying
      cardiac output through the patterning of somatic and cerebral oxygenation in combination with
      exercise stress test data has not been researched.

      We hypothesize that addition of multi-site NIRS monitoring to the standard data collection
      already achieved during exercise testing, will enable calculation of anaerobic threshold and
      cardiac output prediction. This will assist in determining appropriate timing for surgical
      intervention, predicting the post operative course and testing response to medication.
