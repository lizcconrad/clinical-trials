  <brief_summary>

      This study will assess whether rhDNase treatment improves ventilation inhomogeneity as
      assessed by lung clearance index (LCI) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy in CF patients has greatly increased due to improved clinical care. While
      this is certainly beneficial to CF patients, it has made it more difficult to assess the
      effect of therapeutic interventions. Currently, FEV1 remains the primary outcome parameter
      for most clinical trials, but many CF patients have normal pulmonary function and the annual
      rate of decline is now less than 2 %. Therefore, additional parameters are needed that are
      more sensitive to define abnormalities in CF patients and that can be used in therapeutic
      trials.

      Gas mixing techniques have been shown to be sensitive parameters to define abnormalities in
      patients with cystic fibrosis, but it is unclear how useful this technique is to detect
      changes after a therapeutic intervention. Abnormalities in gas clearance from the lung are
      largely due to retention of inhaled gases due to mucous obstruction in the lower airways and
      can be assessed with the lung clearance index (LCI). Interventions that improve mucous
      accumulation are expected to improve lung clearance as assessed by this technique. RhDNase
      has been demonstrated to improve lung function and reduce pulmonary exacerbations in patients
      with cystic fibrosis due to improved mucus clearance.

      Lung clearance index (LCI) has been shown to be more sensitive than spirometry in detecting
      abnormalities in CF patients. Clear cut-offs have been found which can differentiate normal
      patients from even newly diagnosed CF patients. However, little is known about how LCI may
      change with treatment.
