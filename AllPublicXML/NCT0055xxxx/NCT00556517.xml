  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common soft tissue injury in sports involving sprinting and jumping is the hamstring
      strain. In addition to the frequency of injury, hamstring injuries are also the most
      recurrent soft tissue injury occurring in sport. There is a need for further research
      concerning diagnosis and different prognostic parameters for the rehabilitating process.

      The aims for this study are:

      A longitudinal comparison of sonographic and MRI assessments of acute and healing hamstring
      injuries.

      A study investigating different biomechanical parameters in the process of determining
      whether a former hamstring injured soccer player is fully rehabilitated. We hypothesize that
      it is possible to use electromyography, muscle strength measurements and different tests on a
      force platform to help determine this issue.
