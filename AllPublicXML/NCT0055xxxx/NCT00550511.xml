  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether surgeon-performed ultrasound as a supplement
      to clinical investigation when a patient presents with abdominal pain in the emergency
      department can improve the management of the patient.

    <textblock>
      Surgeon-performed ultrasound bedside in the emergency department when a patient presents with
      abdominal pain is quite common in Continental Europe and USA. It is considered to be
      implemented at emergency departments all over Sweden. This is the first randomized study
      performed to evaluate the method. In our study we compare diagnostic accuracy and further
      management of patients admitted to the emergency department for abdominal pain, with or
      without examination with surgeon-performed ultrasound bedside.
