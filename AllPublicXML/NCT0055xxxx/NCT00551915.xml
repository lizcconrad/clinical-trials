  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 3
      formulations of the HR5I vaccine (Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, recombinant
      hepatitis B surface antigen, diphtheria, tetanus, 5-component acellular pertussis, and
      inactivated poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3). The primary hypothesis is that at least 1 of the 3
      formulations of HR5I administered as a primary series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age will be
      acceptable (similar to targeted rates) with respect to Postdose 3 antibody responses to all
      antigens.

      Participants will be randomized into 4 arms:

      AR51 (12, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 12 mcg of polyribosylribitol
      phosphate (PRP) conjugated to tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) and 10 mcg of Hepatitis B surface
      antigen (HBsAg)

      PR51 (3, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 3 mcg of polyribosylribitol
      phosphate conjugated to the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitides
      (PRP-OMPC) and 10 mcg of HBsAg

      PR51 (6, 10): arm receiving vaccine formulation containing 6 mcg of PRP-OMPC and 10 mcg of
      HBsAg

      PENTACEL™ + RECOMBIVAX HB™: open-label control group receiving PENTACEL™ (licensed vaccine
      for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, and invasive disease due to Haemophilus
      influenzae type b) and RECOMBIVAX HB™ (licensed vaccine for hepatitis)
