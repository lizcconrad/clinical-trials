  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vicriviroc (vye-kri-VYE-rock) is an investigational drug (not yet approved by Government
      Regulatory Authorities for commercial use) that belongs to a new class of drugs, called CCR5
      receptor blockers. This group of drugs blocks one of the ways HIV enters T-cells (the cells
      that fight infection). Previous smaller studies in HIV treatment-experienced patients, have
      shown that vicriviroc is safe and effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      virologic efficacy of vicriviroc combined with ritonavir-boosted Reyataz® in HIV-infected
      treatment-naïve subjects.

      This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study of
      vicriviroc maleate in treatment-naïve subjects infected with CCR5-tropic HIV. The study will
      compare the virologic benefit of vicriviroc combined with ritonavir-boosted Reyataz to a
      control group receiving Truvada plus ritonavir-boosted Reyataz. Interim analyses will be
      performed when the first cohort of 80 subjects have completed 24 weeks and 48 weeks of
      treatment. The second cohort of 120 subjects will be enrolled after the first interim
      analysis; a third interim analysis will be performed when subjects in this second cohort have
      completed 24 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when all 200
      subjects from both stages have completed 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued. The final
      analysis will be performed at Week 96, when all 200 subjects have completed 96 weeks of
      treatment or discontinued. If vicriviroc is shown to provide benefit at the studied dose,
      study participants in the vicriviroc arm who complete 96 weeks of treatment may continue in a
      protocol extension, where they will be offered vicriviroc free of charge until the drug is
      commercially available in their location or until the sponsor terminates the clinical
      development of vicriviroc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult subjects at least 18 years old or minimum age that defines an adult as
             determined by local regulatory authorities or legal requirements) of either sex or any
             race with CCR5-tropic HIV infection.

          -  Cumulative lifetime anti-retroviral therapy exposure of at most 4 weeks (with the
             exception of prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission, and in this case, if
