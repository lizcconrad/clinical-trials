    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and follow patients with various allergic, hypersensitivity and
      inflammatory disorders. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments; patients will be
      managed with standard of care therapies. Participants may be referred to other current NIAID
      protocols as appropriate or to new studies as they are developed, but will not be required to
      join another study.

      Patients with allergic, hypersensitivity or inflammatory disorders between the ages of 3
      years and 80 years may be eligible for this study. Conditions of interest include, but are
      not limited to, asthma, allergic rhinitis, mastocytosis, atopic dermatitis and food allergy.

      Participants will have a medical history and physical examination, plus standard tests for
      diagnosing and treating their specific disorder. Tests may include routine blood and urine
      studies, X-rays or other imaging studies, allergy skin tests and lung function tests. Blood
      samples may be collected for research on immune system cells and other substances involved in
      immune function. Generally, about 2 to 6 tablespoons will be drawn at a time, but no more
      than 16 ounces will be collected over a 6-week period.

      NIH does not provide emergency medical treatment or treatment for other, unrelated conditions
      the patient may have. Therefore, patients must maintain a personal physician for these
      purposes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic, hypersensitivity and inflammatory disorders, including but not limited to asthma,
      allergic rhinitis, mastocytosis, atopic dermatitis and food allergy are exceedingly common
      disorders. The pathogenesis of these various disorders are being investigated under a number
      of Laboratory of Allergic Diseases clinical research protocols. This protocol is an
      evaluation and long term follow-up protocol of such disorders, for the purposes of
      maintaining a group of patients on which LAD investigators draw for our other various
      protocols. The patients admitted under this protocol also provide training and experience for
      members of the NIAID Allergy and Immunology fellowship training programs.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Males and females ages 3 years to 80 years.

        Allergic, hypersensitivity or inflammatory diseases.

        Willingness to participate in clinical protocols when appropriate.

        Subjects must maintain a private physician for non-protocol related medical complaints and
        for emergency medical treatment required for these or other of their disorders.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Unacceptably poor compliance which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere
        with one's ability to study or provide quality medical care for the patient.
