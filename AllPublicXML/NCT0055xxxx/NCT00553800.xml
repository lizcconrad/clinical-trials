      This study will evaluate the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib in elderly patients
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no definite evidence of a superior therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      in elderly patients. With the exception of one known study, single agent erlotinib has not
      been studied exclusively in the elderly and the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab has
      never been studied exclusively in the treatment naive elderly. This is an important
      population that needs less toxic therapies.
