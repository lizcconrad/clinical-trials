  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance versus
      detoxification using buprenorphine/naloxone, in prescription opioid dependent patients
      receiving primary care management and drug counseling in an office-based setting, leads to
      decreased illicit opioid use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioid dependence is increasing and creates a significant public health burden,
      but office-based physicians lack evidence-based guidelines to decide between maintenance or
      detoxification treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone. The proposed study compares
      buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance (Mtn) vs. detoxification (Dtx) in a 18-week randomized
      clinical trail in a heterogeneous population of prescription opioid dependent patients
      (N=120) in a primary care clinic. Patients are randomized to Mtn or Dtx after a 2-week
      induction period. Mtn is designed to reflect usual care by primary care physicians and
      includes weekly drug counseling (DC) and referral to ancillary services. Dtx and Mtn will be
      identical for the first 4 weeks (stabilization) following randomization. In Mtn,
      buprenorphine/naloxone will continue unchanged for the remainder of the study. In Dtx, the
      dosage of buprenorphine/naloxone will be tapered to zero over the next 3 weeks, and patients
      will not receive additional buprenorphine/naloxone for the remainder of the study. Dtx
      patients will be offered thrice-weekly DC beginning during the taper and naltrexone will be
      offered 7 days following the last dose of Bup. The study will test the hypothesis that Mtn
      will lead to decreased illicit drug use and will demonstrate incremental cost-effectiveness
      compared to Dtx. Relevance to public health: The results of this study will help define the
      role of maintenance vs. detoxification with buprenorphine/naloxone in the care of
      prescription opioid dependent patients in primary care.

    <measure>Changes in HIV Risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As measured by the AIDS Risk Inventory. The AIDS Risk Inventory (ARI) is a 166 item structured interview that assesses the number and frequency of drug-related and sexual risk behaviors in the preceding 3 months. Calculation of the ARI total score is based on the frequency of occurrence of a given behavior and on the recency of this behavior, with recency being weighted more than a life-time occurrence of the same behavior. Higher values are associated with greater risk of HIV transmission (worse).
There are 10 subscales comprised of between 8 and 24 items. Subscales scores are based on the sum of the individual items and the overall ARI total score is the sum of the subscales.
Scores can range from 0 to 350, although among opioid dependent patients most values are below 100 with means between 50 and 60 depending on characteristics of the patients and treatment status.</description>

In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively.</description>

        <title>Changes in HIV Risk</title>
        <description>As measured by the AIDS Risk Inventory. The AIDS Risk Inventory (ARI) is a 166 item structured interview that assesses the number and frequency of drug-related and sexual risk behaviors in the preceding 3 months. Calculation of the ARI total score is based on the frequency of occurrence of a given behavior and on the recency of this behavior, with recency being weighted more than a life-time occurrence of the same behavior. Higher values are associated with greater risk of HIV transmission (worse).
There are 10 subscales comprised of between 8 and 24 items. Subscales scores are based on the sum of the individual items and the overall ARI total score is the sum of the subscales.
Scores can range from 0 to 350, although among opioid dependent patients most values are below 100 with means between 50 and 60 depending on characteristics of the patients and treatment status.</description>

          <title>Changes in HIV Risk</title>
          <description>As measured by the AIDS Risk Inventory. The AIDS Risk Inventory (ARI) is a 166 item structured interview that assesses the number and frequency of drug-related and sexual risk behaviors in the preceding 3 months. Calculation of the ARI total score is based on the frequency of occurrence of a given behavior and on the recency of this behavior, with recency being weighted more than a life-time occurrence of the same behavior. Higher values are associated with greater risk of HIV transmission (worse).
There are 10 subscales comprised of between 8 and 24 items. Subscales scores are based on the sum of the individual items and the overall ARI total score is the sum of the subscales.
Scores can range from 0 to 350, although among opioid dependent patients most values are below 100 with means between 50 and 60 depending on characteristics of the patients and treatment status.</description>
