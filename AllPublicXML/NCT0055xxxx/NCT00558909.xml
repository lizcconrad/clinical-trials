  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      BI 44847 in male and female patients with type 2 diabetes following oral administration of
      repeated doses of 100 mg b.i.d, 400 mg b.i.d. and 800 mg b.i.d. over 28 days.

      A secondary objective is the exploration of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BI
      44847 after multiple dosing, including assessment of steady state.
