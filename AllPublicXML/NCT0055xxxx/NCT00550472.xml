      The study was performed to investigate the effects of a probiotic supplementation containing
      Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37, Lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2 and Bifidobacterium animalis
      subsp. lactis DGCC 420 (B. lactis 420) on clinical, immunological and faecal parameters in
      healthy volunteers and in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).

      Recent studies suggest that oral bacteriotheraphy with probiotic bacteria might be useful to
      alleviate atopic dermatitis in infants. There are few indications about the effect of
      probiotics in the management of atopic dermatitis in adults.

      As a precondition for participating in this study, the subjects were provided information in
      writing and verbally about the details of the study. Informed consent was obtained from all
      volunteers. Before the beginning of the study, all participants were subject to a medical
      examination in the Clinic for Dermatology and Dermatologic Allergology of the Friedrich
      Schiller University Jena. The AD was diagnosed according to the atopy-score of Diepgen.
      Severity of eczema was evaluated by using the SCORAD score. A skin prick test was performed
      for the exclusion of type 1 sensitivity to cow's milk.

      The study was designed as a placebo-controlled and cross-over study. After a 3-week run-in
      period the 30 participants (15 healthy subjects and 15 patients with AD) were randomized to
      receive either 200 ml/d of a probiotic drink containing L. paracasei Lpc-37, L. acidophilus
      74-2 and B. lactis 420 or 200 ml/d of a placebo drink for 8 weeks. After a 2-week washout
      period the intervention was crossed between the groups and the respective products were
      consumed for another 8 weeks followed by a 2-week washout period. Venous blood and fresh
      stool samples were collected before the beginning and at the end of each period. In AD
      patients the Scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) was assessed by the same physician every 4
      weeks and 2 weeks after the wash-out period, respectively.

          -  No food allergies

          -  Exclusion of atopic diathesis (&lt; 7 points in Erlangen atopy score)

        Patients with AD:

          -  Clear diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (&gt; 10 points in the Erlangen atopy score) or
             flexural eczema or pruritis for at least 12 months (recidivating or permanent)

          -  SCORAD 5-30 (minor or medium AD)

          -  Willingness to apply for the duration of the study exclusively the cosmetic products
             recommended by the accompanying doctor and to use the recommended class II
             corticosteroid (Advantan) as further therapy of AD (for example during an episode)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, lactation
