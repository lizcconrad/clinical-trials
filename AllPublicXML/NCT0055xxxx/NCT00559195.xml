      RATIONALE: Epoetin beta may cause the body to make more red blood cells and may help relieve
      fatigue in patients with malignant solid tumors receiving palliative care.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well epoetin beta works in treating fatigue and
      anemia in patients receiving palliative care for malignant solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the impact of epoetin beta on fatigue and quality of life of patients receiving
           palliative care for malignant solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the impact of epoetin beta on hemoglobin level (increase &gt; 2 g/dL).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive epoetin beta subcutaneously once a week for up to 3 months.

      Fatigue, quality of life, and hemoglobin and reticulocyte levels are assessed every 4 weeks.
