      RATIONALE: Gathering information about pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood exposures may
      help doctors identify cancer risk factors, and may help the study of cancer.

      PURPOSE: This natural history study is looking at the effects of fetal, infant, and early
      childhood exposures on adult cancer risk in women.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine if fetal, infant, and early childhood exposures are associated with adult
           cancer risk in women.

      OUTLINE: Mothers of nurses complete questionnaires to collect maternal data, such as
      pregnancy weight gain, diet during pregnancy, maternal pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes,
      gestational age at birth, birth weight, and infant feeding practices. Maternal data is linked
      to other data collected from critical time periods in the nurses's life cycle, such as
      menarche, first pregnancy, or adult dietary intake.
