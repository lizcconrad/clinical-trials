      The purpose of this research study is to look at concentrations of GSK189075 in blood when
      different long and short acting forms of the drug are taken by mouth. The results will help
      to decide whether a long-acting form of GSK189075 can be made. The effects of the drug on the
      body and safety will also be studied.
