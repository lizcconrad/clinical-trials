  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections are associated with high morbidity and cost Hypothesis: Extended
      intraoperative hygiene measures decrease surgical site infections in general surgery compared
      to standard hygiene measures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperatively two types of hygiene measures were performed randomly: standard and
      extensive. Standard hygiene measures included empiric accepted measures (e.g. gloves, masks,
      disinfection). Extensive hygiene measures included among others: double gloving, astro caps,
      extensive disinfection, extensive intraoperative rinsing. In addition, intraoperative
      adherence to the rules of asepsis were registered by an independent observer.

      Patients were followed for 30 days.
