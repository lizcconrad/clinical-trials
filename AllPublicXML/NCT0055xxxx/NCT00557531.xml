      ENDPOINTS Preliminary safety endpoints Occurrence of all adverse events including but not
      limited to All MIs Cardiovascular hospitalization

      Serious ventricular arrhythmias sustained:

      VT (symptomatic or sustained VT [duration longer than 30 seconds or 100 beats, or associated
      with hemodynamic collapse]) VF symptomatic bradycardia, pauses of longer than 3.0 seconds,
      complete atrioventricular block, Mobitz II atrioventricular block Symptomatic heart failure
