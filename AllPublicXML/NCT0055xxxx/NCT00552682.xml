      The purpose of this study is to compare duloxetine with conventional treatment of pain in
      HIV-1 infected patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among HIV-1-infected patients, diagnosis of fibromialgy has increased over the last years .
      Appropriate identification of firomialgy in these patients is challenging and sometimes can
      be more complicated than in HIV-negative population. Concomitant infectious processes and
      symptoms due to HIV infection itself need to be ruled out before establishing a formal
      diagnosis.

      The treatment of this disease frequently includes muscular relaxants , pain-killers,
      anti-inflammatories and antidepressives despite no drug is formally indicated for this
      pathology.

      Duloxetine approved indications include both treatment of major depressive disorders (MDD)
      and diabetic neuropathic pain. Recent studies in HIV negative patients show efficacy to
      control pain and depressive symptoms in patients with fibromialgy The main purpose of this
      pilot study is to assess the efficacy of duloxetine in HIV-1-infected patients with
      fibromialgy.

      The main purpose of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy of duloxetine in
      HIV-1-infected patients with fibromialgy or chronic fatigue syndrome presenting with
      widespread pain.
