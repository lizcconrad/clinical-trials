      SPECIFIC AIM: To test the safety and feasibility of using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH,
      enoxaparin sodium; Lovenox, Sanofi-Aventis) in lieu of unfractionated heparin (UFH) as
      antithrombotic therapy for patients in atrial fibrillation undergoing transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE) guided chemical or electrical cardioversion to sinus rhythm.

      HYPOTHESIS: Early cardioversion from atrial fibrillation can be safely performed using a
      short-term anticoagulation strategy of low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox, Sanofi-Aventis)
      compared to unfractionated heparin, accompanied by a TEE examination prior to cardioversion.
      The use of LMWH with TEE will result in a safe, cost-effective, and possible efficacious
      approach to cardioversion of atrial fibrillation compared to UFH with TEE.

             fibrillation

          -  Males and females 18 years of age or older

             incompatible with pregnancy or by serum or urine beta HCG levels.
