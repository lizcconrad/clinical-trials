    <textblock>
      Currently, there are no published methods for easily determining the level of amifostine in
      the blood or saliva. A method has been developed within the Department of Radiation Oncology
      by Drs. Douglas Spitz and Gurminder Sidhu, within the Spitz Lab. This method has been tested
      using both animal sampling and expired blood (obtained from DeGowin blood center) mixed with
      amifostine.

      If the method proves successful, it could then be used as a tool to quantify blood and
      salivary amifostine levels and possibly correlate them to treatment efficacy or limiting
      adverse events using amifostine. A better method of treatment, either increasing the efficacy
      of amifostine or reducing its unwanted side effects, could then be developed.

      Amifostine is an FDA-approved medication that protects the lining of the mucous membranes of
      the head and neck when radiation treatments are given. Normally, amifostine is injected into
      a vein causing side effects of nausea, vomiting and low blood pressure. The amifostine can
      reduce radiation side effects but does not remove them completely.
