  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the co-administration of valproic acid
      (Epival®), with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can reduce the size of HIV
      latent reservoirs in infected CD4 cells.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants must be on HAART with a suppressed viral load (&lt; 50 copies/ml) for at least the
      previous 12 months. They will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, one group will start
      the valproic acid right away at week 1 for 16 weeks, and the other group will wait until week
      17 to add valproic acid to their treatment for 32 weeks. Subjects will be followed every four
      weeks for one year and evaluated by a variety of assays, all carried out using
      well-established methods, to assess the main outcome defined by changes in HIV reservoir size
      measured by the mean frequency of resting CD4 memory cells carrying HIV proviral DNA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Documented HIV seropositive infection by Western Blot, EIA assays or viral load.

          -  Aged 18 years old or older.

          -  Viral load &lt;50 copies/ml for at least the previous 12 months.

          -  Circulating CD4+ cell count ³ 200 cells/ml.

          -  Taking HAART.

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of
             diseases such as advanced cirrhosis and advanced liver disease (ALT or AST &gt; 5 x upper
             limit of normal value).

          -  Karnofsky performance status 80%.
