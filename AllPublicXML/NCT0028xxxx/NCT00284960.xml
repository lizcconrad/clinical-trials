      Determine if men with erectile dysfunction (ED) are more likely to have insulin resistance
      compared to healthy controls.

      Insulin is a hormone produced by the body that lets sugar into the cells, where it is used
      for energy. Insulin resistance occurs when the body's cells have a decreased ability to react
      to insulin. This leads to an increase in insulin secretion. Over time, insulin resistance can
      lead to higher levels of sugar in the blood (diabetes), and can also contribute to obesity,
      high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and heart disease. There are no simple tests to
      actually diagnose insulin resistance. Currently, the glucose tolerance test is used to
      diagnose IR, but it involves several blood draws over a 2-hour period. Another purpose of
      this study is to compare a blood test involving only one blood draw to the 2-hour glucose
      tolerance test, which involves several blood draws over a 2-hour period.

      It is well known that diabetes often leads to erectile dysfunction. Because insulin
      resistance occurs before diabetes, it is possible that erectile dysfunction may occur in some
      individuals while they have insulin resistance, but before they develop diabetes. If this is
      true, it might be possible to use erectile dysfunction as a sign of insulin resistance, which
      may lead to more timely treatment of insulin resistance and may delay or prevent the
      development of diabetes, and the other problems mentioned above.
