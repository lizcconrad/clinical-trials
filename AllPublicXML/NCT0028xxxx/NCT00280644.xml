      Study objectives:

        -  To provide more insight on the modulation of inflammation and matrix degrading factors
           in serum and urine by leflunomide in early , active patients with RA and to validate the
           sensitivity of DEMRI (Dynamic Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in detecting
           inflammatory changes in active RA in response to treatment with leflunomide

        -  Effect of leflunomide therapy on physical function improvement and Quality of life

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who has not ARA functional class IV (ACR 1991 revised criteria). Active
             disease defined as &gt; 6 swollen or tender joints, by physician and as well as by
             patient global assessment of disease activity as moderate or worse

          -  Patient who has active disease defined by a modified Disease Activity Score (DAS)&gt;3.2

          -  At least one wrist joint with active disease, defined by clinically detectable
             synovitis at that site due to technical facility of using wrist joint for DEMRI

          -  Patient who has received unchanged doses of oral corticosteroids (with a maximum dose
             of 10 mg prednisone daily or steroid equivalent orally administered ) and concomitant
             stable doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for at least 4 weeks before
             entering the study

          -  Woman of childbearing potential,who is demonstrated not to be pregnant (by serum
             pregnancy test) or breast feeding at screening visit, and who is agree to undergo

             of the treatment

          -  Woman of childbearing potential, who agrees to maintain an adequate mean of
             contraception and not to get pregnant through the study and for 24 months after the
