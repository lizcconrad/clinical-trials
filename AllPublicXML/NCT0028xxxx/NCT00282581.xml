      This is a multi-center study 90 HIV-seropositive subjects. There will be an injection of MVA
      smallpox vaccine or placebo on day 0 and day 28.

      Subjects will be enrolled and vaccinated in two cohorts according to CD4 cell count levels
      and number of subjects vaccinated. Excluding the screening period, the study duration will be
      approximately 56 days with a follow up safety visit at study day 148 and a telephone health
