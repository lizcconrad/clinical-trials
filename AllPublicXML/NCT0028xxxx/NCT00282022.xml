      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as VNP40101M, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well VNP40101M works in treating patients with
      recurrent or refractory locally advanced or metastatic small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial and complete) in patients with relapsed or
           refractory locally advanced or metastatic small cell lung cancer treated with VNP40101M.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease state
      (sensitive relapse [progressive disease &gt; 3 months after responding to first-line
      chemotherapy] vs resistant disease [progressive disease during or ≤ 3 months after first-line
      chemotherapy]).

      Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15-30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses of therapy after CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 18 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study.
