  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of evidence in the literature regarding the adverse effects of
      hyperglycemia in critically ill patients. To target and maintain better blood glucose
      regulation we implemented an insulin protocol with target blood glucose levels between 81-110
      mg/dL.
