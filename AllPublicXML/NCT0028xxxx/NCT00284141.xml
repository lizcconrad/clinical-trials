    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of aflibercept in the treatment of participants
      with advanced chemoresistant non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLA).

      Primary objective:

        -  To determine the overall objective response rate (ORR) of AVE0005 (ziv-aflibercept,
           aflibercept, VEGF trap, ZALTRAP®) 4.0 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks in
           participants with platinum- and erlotinib-resistant, locally advanced or metastatic
           NSCLA.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To assess duration of response (DR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall
           survival (OS) in this participant population

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of IV AVE0005 (ziv-aflibercept, aflibercept, VEGF trap,
           ZALTRAP®).

      This study employed an Independent Review Committee (IRC) for radiological tumor assessments.
      For all tumor assessment-related efficacy variables, two analyses were performed: the primary
      analysis was based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) reviewed data and the secondary
      analysis was based on Investigator evaluation.

      In addition, both Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) and Modified Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (mRECIST) were used to assess tumors. Where as RECIST
      criteria only consider the longest diameter of the tumors for calculations pertaining to
      changes in tumor size, mRECIST assessments also account for the differences in the cavities
      of lesions observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Responses based on RECIST and
      mRECIST are reported.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included :

        -  A screening phase up to 21 days followed by registration

        -  Treatment initiation within 5 working days of registration

        -  A treatment phase with 14-day study treatment cycles until a study withdrawal criterion
           was met or up to the clinical database cut-off date (18 July 2008)

        -  A follow-up phase - up to 60 days after end of treatment

      Withdrawal criteria that led to treatment discontinuation were:

        -  The participant or their legally authorized representative requested to withdraw

        -  In the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be detrimental to the
           participant's well being, due to reasons such as disease progression, unacceptable
           toxicity, noncompliance, or logistical considerations.

        -  A specific request by the Sponsor

        -  Participant had intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of study
           treatment

        -  Participant had more than 2 aflibercept dose reductions

        -  Participant had arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accidents,
           myocardial infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, new onset or worsening of
           pre-existing angina

        -  Participant had radiographic evidence of intestinal obstruction (e.g., dilated loops of
           bowel accompanied by air-fluid levels) or gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., presence
           of extraluminal gas) requiring surgical intervention

        -  Participant was lost to follow-up

      After discontinuing treatment, participants remained on the study until the last
      post-treatment visit or until recovery of drug related toxicities, whichever was later.

    <measure>Confirmed Objective Response (OR) Based Upon Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC).</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2.5 years from initial treatment</time_frame>
    <description>OR was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST or modified RECIST. CR was the disappearance of all target/nor-target lesions; and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with reference to the baseline sum LD (According to modified RECIST, to calculate LD for cavitated lesions, the longest cavitation diameters were subtracted from the LD of cavitated target lesions).
Assessments were made by the IRC, and confirmed by repeat tumor imaging 4-6 weeks after documentation of the initial response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2.5 years from initial treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS time was interval from the date of registration to the date of tumor progression (by RECIST or modified RECIST), or death from any cause, whichever was earlier. Median PFS time was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots.
Progression was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of tumors, compared to smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new tumors.
If a participant did not progress or die, the date was censored to the date of last valid tumor assessment or the date of data cut-off, whichever was earlier.</description>

    <measure>Heath-related Quality of Life (QOL) Measured Via the Lung Cancer Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>HRQL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) questionnaire, which was completed by the participants on Day 1 of Cycle 1 only (for baseline value), then on Day 14 of each even-numbered cycle to evaluate the participants symptoms.
The questionnaire scored 7 symptoms: shortness of breath, weight loss, clarity in thinking, coughing, appetite, chest tightness, ease of breathing, on a 0-4 scale. The total FACT-LCS score ranged from 0-28 (where 28 was related to the worst outcome). To calculate a change, the baseline score was subtracted from the score obtained after treatment. A negative value implied an improvement in HRQL.</description>

        <description>OR was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST or modified RECIST. CR was the disappearance of all target/nor-target lesions; and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with reference to the baseline sum LD (According to modified RECIST, to calculate LD for cavitated lesions, the longest cavitation diameters were subtracted from the LD of cavitated target lesions).

        <description>OS was the time interval between registration to the date of death from any cause. The median time for OS was estimated from Kaplan-Meier Plots.
A participant was to be censored for the OS analysis if the participant was alive by the study cut-off date. The censoring date was either the date that the participant was last known to be alive or the date of study cut-off, whichever came earlier.</description>

        <description>HRQL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) questionnaire, which was completed by the participants on Day 1 of Cycle 1 only (for baseline value), then on Day 14 of each even-numbered cycle to evaluate the participants symptoms.
The questionnaire scored 7 symptoms: shortness of breath, weight loss, clarity in thinking, coughing, appetite, chest tightness, ease of breathing, on a 0-4 scale. The total FACT-LCS score ranged from 0-28 (where 28 was related to the worst outcome). To calculate a change, the baseline score was subtracted from the score obtained after treatment. A negative value implied an improvement in HRQL.</description>
