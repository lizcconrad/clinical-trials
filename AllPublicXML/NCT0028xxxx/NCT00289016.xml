  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Tumor Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with an overall best response of complete response or partial response. The objective response to treatment was assessed by computed tomography (CT) scanning or other clinical measurement using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Responses must have been confirmed on two visits not less than 4 weeks apart.
Tumor burden for a visit was calculated as the sum of the longest diameters of all tumors identified and measured up to that visit. Tumor response at each visit was derived from tumor burden, as follows:
Complete response (CR): zero tumor burden
Partial response (PR): a 30% or greater decrease in tumor burden
Progressive disease (PD): a 20% or greater increase in tumor burden
Stable disease (SD): none of the above (a &lt; 30% decrease and &lt; 20% increase in tumor burden)</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of the first talimogene laherparepvec dose to the date of death. Median OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression was calculated from the date of the first talimogene laherparepvec dose to the first date of documented progressive disease (via clinical symptom or tumor burden assessment) that was not followed by a later response of CR, PR, or stable disease.
Median time to progression was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Longest Continuous Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response was calculated from the date of the first talimogene laherparepvec dose to the initial date of the participant's last response interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment until the data cut-off date of 29 November 2008; Median duration of follow-up was 253 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was calculated from the initial date of response (CR or PR) until the date of progressive disease (or until last follow up that was CR or PR). Participants could have multiple response periods; in this situation, the last response interval was used for the calculation of duration of response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of talimogene laherparepvec until 30 days after the last dose; the median (minimum, maximum) duration of treatment was 82 (1, 346) days.</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of an adverse event (AE) was graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3 (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, 5 = death).
Serious adverse events include death, life-threatening events, events requiring or prolonging hospitalization, result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or otherwise important medical events that may jeopardise the patient or require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.</description>

    <description>Participants received talimogene laherparepvec at an initial dose of 10⁶ plaque forming units (PFU)/mL injected into 1 or more tumors with maximum total volume of 4 mL (up to 2 mL per tumor). Subsequent doses of talimogene laherparepvec at 10⁸ PFU/mL began 3 weeks after the first dose and were administered every 2 weeks for up to 15 weeks. After the initial 8 doses, if indications of biological activity were observed, treatment could continue for up to 16 additional doses.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically proven stage IIIc (including two or more palpable lymph
             nodes, extracapsular or in-transit metastases) or stage IV melanoma that is not
             eligible for curative surgery and who have one or more tumors that are accessible for
             direct injection.

          2. Tumors 0.5 to 10 cm in the longest diameter that are suitable for injection (i.e. not

        <title>Objective Tumor Response Rate</title>
        <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with an overall best response of complete response or partial response. The objective response to treatment was assessed by computed tomography (CT) scanning or other clinical measurement using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Responses must have been confirmed on two visits not less than 4 weeks apart.
Tumor burden for a visit was calculated as the sum of the longest diameters of all tumors identified and measured up to that visit. Tumor response at each visit was derived from tumor burden, as follows:
Complete response (CR): zero tumor burden
Partial response (PR): a 30% or greater decrease in tumor burden
Progressive disease (PD): a 20% or greater increase in tumor burden
Stable disease (SD): none of the above (a &lt; 30% decrease and &lt; 20% increase in tumor burden)</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
