    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of fenretinide and to see
      how well it works when given together with rituximab in treating patients with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fenretinide, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some find cancer cells and kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Others
      interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving fenretinide together
      with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of fenretinide delivered in a 5 of 7 day regimen. (Phase I) II. To
      estimate the efficacy (response rates) of fenretinide + rituximab in patients with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform pharmacokinetic studies on patients receiving fenretinide. (Phase I) II. To
      determine the intratumoral concentrations of fenretinide. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the in
      vivo mechanism of action of fenretinide. (Phase I) IV. To identify the predictors of response
      to fenretinide. (Phase I) V. To estimate the response rates, positron emission tomography
      (PET) response, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression
      (TTP), and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients treated on this study. (Phase I) VI. To
      estimate the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression
      (TTP), disease-free survival (DFS), and PET responses of patients treated on this study.
      (Phase II) VII. To perform pharmacokinetic studies on patients receiving fenretinide. (Phase
      II) VIII. To determine the intratumoral concentration of fenretinide. (Phase II) IX. To
      identify the predictors of response to fenretinide and fenretinide + rituximab in B-NHL.
      (Phase II) X. To evaluate the in vivo mechanism of action of fenretinide in B-NHL. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of fenretinide followed by a phase II
      study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive fenretinide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats weekly for at least 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive fenretinide PO BID on days 1-5 in weeks 1-8 and rituximab
      intravenously (IV) once weekly in weeks 5-8. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <measure>Safety, in Terms of Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) of 2 Daily Doses of Single Agent Fenretinide (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Number of participants that experienced a dose-limiting toxicity</time_frame>
    <description>A group of 3 patients would start treatment ast the dose of 900mg/m^2 BID, and if none of the 3 experienced a DLT, another 3 would then be treated at that dose. Dose Limiting Toxicity was defined as any related toxicity of grade 4 or 5 on or before the completion of 4 weeks of therapy.
Per response evaluation criteria 1999 Cheson Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (CHESON99) for target lesions assessed by either CT or MRI:
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease; Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRU): Complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease, with the exception of all residual nodal masses &gt;1.5cm in Greatest Transverse Diameter (GTD) reduced by 75% in Sum of the Product of the greatest Diameters (SPD); Partial Response (PR): 50% decrease in the SPD.</description>

    <description>The trial was stratified into rituximab-naïve and rituximab pre-treated patients, and the target response rates for these groups were expected to be 30% and 10%, respectively.

        <description>A group of 3 patients would start treatment ast the dose of 900mg/m^2 BID, and if none of the 3 experienced a DLT, another 3 would then be treated at that dose. Dose Limiting Toxicity was defined as any related toxicity of grade 4 or 5 on or before the completion of 4 weeks of therapy.
Per response evaluation criteria 1999 Cheson Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (CHESON99) for target lesions assessed by either CT or MRI:
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease; Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRU): Complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease, with the exception of all residual nodal masses &gt;1.5cm in Greatest Transverse Diameter (GTD) reduced by 75% in Sum of the Product of the greatest Diameters (SPD); Partial Response (PR): 50% decrease in the SPD.</description>
