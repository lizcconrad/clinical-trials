      Study objective: The objective of this trial was to determine the effectiveness of a
      Leadership Development Program (LDP) aimed at 1) establishing basic management knowledge and
      2) promoting reflection of leadership skills.

      Study design: Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial. Study participants: Senior
      postgraduate medical and surgical trainees at an urban university health care centre.

      Methods: Eligible participants were randomized to either the LDP(intervention group) or to
      regular postgraduate training (control group). For ethical reasons, all participants assigned
      to the control group were offered the LDP at the end of the trial. The 1ยบ outcome measure
      used was a knowledge-based written exam. The sample size was estimated on finding a 20%
      difference in mean test scores between groups. Participants' reflective capacity and higher
      order leadership role skills were tested through a personal learning project (PLP, 2ยบ outcome
      measure).
