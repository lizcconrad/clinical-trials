    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and activity of a type of vaccine as immune
      therapy for prostate cancer. This vaccine will be made for each participant's own immune
      cells (called dendritic cells) obtained by blood donation. Dendritic cells are immune cells,
      whose role is to identify foreign antigens (bacteria, viruses, or tumor cells, for example)
      in the body and to activate other cells of the immune system to mount an attack on that
      foreign antigen. Each participant will be randomized into either Arm 1 (experimental
      treatment only) or Arm 2 (placebo first, then the experimental treatment). Participants will
      be given the vaccine and three boosters as an injection. After the placebo phase, each
      participant in Arm 2 will crossover to the treatment phase so that all participants will
      eventually receive the experimental treatment.

      This is a Phase I/II dendritic cell vaccine study for patients with prostate cancer. Our
      laboratory has demonstrated that effective tumor immunity in humans is associated with, and
      likely mediated at least in part by tumor antigen-specific killer T cells (Albert et al.,
      1998a; Darnell, 1999; Darnell and Posner, 2003). Moreover, we have demonstrated that
      apoptotic material derived from dying tumor cells are a potent means of delivering antigen to
      DCs and subsequently triggering tumor antigen-specific T cell responses ex vivo (Albert et
      al., 1998a; Albert et al., 1998c). In this study, patients with 3 consecutive rises in PSA
      measured at least 2 week apart, after definite local therapy (prostatectomy or radiation)
      will be recruited. Peripheral blood monocytes will be collected by leukapheresis and
      dendritic cells will be generated in the Cleanroom in the Laboratory of Molecular
      Neuro-Oncology. These dendritic cells will be pulsed with apoptotic prostate cancer cells
      from a cell line (LNCaP), harvested, tested for certain release criteria, and then injected
      as vaccine. When patients are found to be eligible for the study, they will be randomized
      into either the experimental group or the placebo group for the purposes of comparing adverse
      events between groups only. Vaccine plus 3 boosters (or placebo) will be given, each two
      weeks apart. After the third booster, patients will be unblinded. Those receiving the vaccine
      will when enter the follow up phase which includes a post treatment leukapheresis. Those in
      the placebo group will cross over and receive the vaccine and boosters. The primary outcomes
      to be evaluated are toxicity and activity. Patients will be evaluated for both local and
      systemic toxicity. For activity, we measure both immunological and clinical responses to the
      vaccine, comparing measures taken before and after vaccination, combining patients in both
      arms.

    <description>Occurrence of adverse events (AE) was compared between the placebo and vaccine groups during the blinded phase (the 1st 9 weeks). At the end of this phase, all were unblinded, and those who received placebo crossed over to now receive vaccine. All serious AEs and any other AEs that occurred 5 times or more are reported. The exact binomial test was used to compare the occurrence of each AE between groups.</description>

    <description>To model the evolution of PSA (in log-scale) during the three study phases (pre-vaccine, vaccine, and post-vaccine phases), a mixed linear spline model was used. Two knots (one at the start of the vaccine phase and the other at the start of the post-vaccine phase) were used to directly quantify the differences in slopes between each phase. To account for the heterogeneous treatment effect and the repeated measures structure, random effects are incorporated into the model. For the general model, random effects for the intercept, slope and the first knot were considered.</description>

        <title>Change in PSA Slope, Pre- vs Post-vaccination.</title>
        <description>To model the evolution of PSA (in log-scale) during the three study phases (pre-vaccine, vaccine, and post-vaccine phases), a mixed linear spline model was used. Two knots (one at the start of the vaccine phase and the other at the start of the post-vaccine phase) were used to directly quantify the differences in slopes between each phase. To account for the heterogeneous treatment effect and the repeated measures structure, random effects are incorporated into the model. For the general model, random effects for the intercept, slope and the first knot were considered.</description>
