      Our specific aims include:

        1. AIM 1. Characterization of glucose tolerance, nutritional and clinical status,
           socioeconomic status, family history of diabetes and genotype in Hispanic CF children
           compared to Caucasian CF children. Each child will undergo a two-hour oral glucose
           tolerance test and will be categorized by glucose tolerance according to standards set
           forth by the 1998 CF Consensus Conference on Diabetes. Nutritional status will be
           determined by three-day food journals and intake will be compared to energy needs
           measured by indirect calorimetry. Socio-economic status will be calculated from reported
           family income and medical insurance coverage. Genotyping will be done at the laboratory
           of Dr. Arthur Beaudet at Baylor College of Medicine. Clinical status will be measured
           using modified NIH scores. Family history for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be
           obtained in Spanish by Dr.Vanderwel. This specific aim tests the hypothesis that glucose
           intolerance /frank CF related diabetes occurs at a younger age in Hispanics than in
           Caucasians with CF, and is correlated to family history of diabetes and clinical status.

        2. AIM 2. Characterization of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. Previous studies
           in adults have described peripheral insulin resistance as a major cause of CF related
           diabetes, yet studies have not been conducted in children. Studies in adults and
           children without CF suggest that insulin resistance occurs more frequently in Hispanics.
           We will measure insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity using the frequently sampled
           intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and the minimal model analysis of Bergman, as
           modified for children. This specific aim tests the hypothesis that Hispanic children
           with CF have worse peripheral insulin resistance, but similar insulin secretion when
           compared to Caucasian children with CF.

        3. AIM 3. Quantification of post-absorptive gluconeogenesis and whole body protein
           turnover. Total hepatic glucose production (HGP) will be measured using
           [6,6-2H2]glucose. We will quantify gluconeogenesis by measurement of the incorporation
           of 2H into the 2nd, 5th and 6th carbons of glucose following 2H20 administration method
           of Landau). We will determine whole body protein turnover using the stable isotopes
           [1-13C]leucine and will measure serum amino acid levels. This specific aim tests the
           hypothesis that gluconeogenesis and whole body protein turnover are disproportionately
           higher in Hispanic children and adolescents with CF than in Caucasian CF children.

      We will recruit 12 Hispanic prepubertal children with CF (ages 7-12, Tanner I) and 12
      Hispanic adolescents (ages 15-17, Tanner 3 or 4) from the CF Centers at University of Texas
      Southwestern and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Information obtained from these
      subjects will be compared to 12 prepubertal and 12 adolescent Caucasian children with CF
      recruited from the same CF centers. We will categorize the subjects according to glucose
      tolerance (OGTT), as well as insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity using the IVGTT and
      the Minimal Model, as modified for children. We will also compare the historical information
      of socio-economic status and family history. Clinical status will be characterized by
      measuring pulmonary function and modified NIH scores, in addition to measuring levels of
      circulating cytokines. Gluconeogenesis (GNG) will be quantified by measuring the
      incorporation 2H into the 2nd, 5th and 6th carbons of glucose. Whole body protein turnover
      (WBPT) will be measured using [1-13C]leucine. Nutritional status will be determined by
      three-day food journals, and intake will be compared to energy needs, utilizing indirect
      calorimetry to measure resting energy expenditure. Subjects will be recruited from the CF
      centers at the University of Texas- Southwestern and the South Central CF Consortium.
