    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of formoterol alone (Oxis® TurbuhalerÒ) and the fixed combination of
      formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort® TurbuhalerÒ) on airway responsiveness as a marker of
      inflammation, induced by repeated low-dose allergen challenge in allergic patients with mild
      asthma
