  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, once daily
      (QD), combined with pioglitazone in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with
      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% are type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of
      2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of dipeptidyl peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of alogliptin in combination with
      pioglitazone in subjects who are inadequately controlled on a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone
      or rosiglitazone) alone or in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea. Individuals who
      participate in this study will be required to commit to a screening visit and up to 14
      additional visits at the study center. Study participation is anticipated to be about 34
      weeks (or 8.5 months).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus currently treated with a thiazolidinedione
             either alone or in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea but who are
             experiencing inadequate glycemic control. The subject should have received the
             thiazolidinedione therapy (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) either alone or in
             combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea for at least the 3 months prior to
             Screening and must have been on a stable dose for all their antidiabetic treatments
             for at least the month prior to Screening.

          -  No treatment with antidiabetic agents other than a thiazolidinedione alone or in
             combination with either metformin or a sulfonylurea within the 3 months prior to
             Screening. (Exception: if a subject has received other antidiabetic therapy for less
             than 7 days within the 3 months prior to Screening.)

          -  Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2

          -  Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng per mL. (If this
             screening criterion is not met, the subject still qualifies if C-peptide is greater
             than or equal to 1.5 ng per mL after a challenge test.)

          -  Glycosylated hemoglobin concentration between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive.

          -  If regular use of other, non-excluded medications, must be on a stable dose for at
             least the 4 weeks prior to Screening. However, as needed use of prescription or
             over-the-counter medications is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 180 mm Hg and diastolic pressure less
             than or equal to 110 mm Hg.

          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g per dL for males and greater than or equal
             to10 g per dL for females.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg per dL.

          -  Thyroid-stimulating hormone level less than or equal to the upper limit of the normal
