  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, life-long follow-up is needed to monitor
      the effectiveness of exclusion of the aneurysm sac from blood flow. For this reason, aneurysm
      diameter and the presence of endoleaks is evaluated with CT angiography yearly after
      Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the value of MRA examinations for the follow-up of
      these patients. The advantages of MRA with respect to CTA are no use of ionizing radiation,
      use of less nephrotoxic contrast agents.

      The FEAT trial (Follow-up of Endovascular Aneurysm Treatment) is designed as a prospective,
      single-center, follow-up study. 100 Patients will be enrolled in this study. These patients
      will undergo additional MRA-examinations the day before EVAR, the day after EVAR, 6 months
      and 1 year after EVAR. These patients also participate in the conventional CTA follow-up
      scheme which comprises a pre- and post-operative CTA and a CTA yearly thereafter. Coagulation
      parameters in the blood will be measured before and 1 year after EVAR.
