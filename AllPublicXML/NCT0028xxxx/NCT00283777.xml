  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of Chromium to improve glucose levels in diabetes is controversial. The hypothesis
      of the study was to evaluate the effect of supplementing the diet of individuals with Type 2
      diabetes with chromium picolinate and assessing the effect on blood glucose levels and
      insulin sensitivity

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary clinical strategy to improve metabolic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes
      consists of lifestyle modification combined with pharmacologic intervention. However,
      alternative strategies, e.g. nutritional supplementation with over-the-counter agents, are
      extensively practiced by a large number of patients and are frequently undertaken without
      first informing the medical provider. Unfortunately, considerable controversy exists
      regarding use of dietary supplements in subjects with diabetes because efficacy data for many
      of the supplements consists of only uncontrolled studies and anecdotal reports. As such,
      there is a paucity of data in humans in regard to the effect of most commercially available
      supplements to improve metabolic abnormalities.

      One supplement that has attracted considerable clinical interest is chromium (Cr). However,
      routine use of Cr in subjects with diabetes is not currently recommended. In part, the
      controversy surrounding Cr supplementation stems from the lack of definitive randomized
      trials, the lack of &quot;gold standard&quot; techniques to assess glucose metabolism in the studies
      reported, the use of differing doses and formulation , and the study of heterogeneous study
      populations (4). As such, conflicting data has been reported that has contributed greatly to
      the confusion among healthcare providers concerning Cr supplementation. In order to provide a
      comprehensive clinical evaluation of Cr, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial in subjects with Type 2 diabetes, and over a 10 month period of
      observation, used established techniques to assess changes in insulin sensitivity, body
      composition and glycemic control.
