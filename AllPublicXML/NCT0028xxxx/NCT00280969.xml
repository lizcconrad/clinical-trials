      A selection study in treatment naive HIV patients to compare the virologic success rate of
      once daily antiretroviral treatment regimens at the 48th week with Epzicom(lamivudine and
      abacavir) plus efavirenz and Epzicom plus ritonavir boosted atazanavir. The superior regimen
      will be hired to the comparative study to the current first line regimen (tenofovir plus
      lamivudine plus efavirenz)

      A selection study in treatment naive HIV patients to compare the virologic success rate of
      once daily antiretroviral treatment regimens at the 48th week with Epzicom(lamivudine and
      abacavir) plus efavirenz and Epzicom plus ritonavir boosted atazanavir. The superior regimen
      will be hired to the comparative study to the current first line regimen (tenofovir plus
      lamivudine plus efavirenz)

      The primary endpoint is antiretroviral effect at the 48th week.

      The secondary endpoint is;1. Evaluation of immunological effect and safety in 48 weeks.
      2.Evaluation of antiretroviral effect, immunological effect and safety in 49 to 96 weeks.
