    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of
      Somatuline Autogel 60mg to control the muscle infiltration and edema, eyelid retraction and
      extraocular muscular contraction in patients with active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy of
      moderate intensity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with autoimmune thyroid disease and whose centre's medical records confirm
             the presence of euthyroidism for at least two months before being included into the
             study

          -  Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy diagnosed a minimum of six months before his/her
             participation in the study, well documented in the centre's medical records and based
             on the moderate intensity of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy in the worst eye

          -  Patients whose ophthalmopathy activity has been demonstrated by a positive octreoscan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient presents compressive optical neuropathy signs which require immediate
             surgical treatment or suffers from serious intensity thyroid ophthalmopathy

          -  The patient has been treated with radio-iodine for his/her thyroid disturbance in the
             past 6 months

          -  The patient's thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy has been treated previously (except
             for drops and local measures) or is planned to be treated with radio-iodine or
             thyroidectomy for his/her autoimmune thyroid disease during the study or suffers from
             myopia, glaucoma or any other eye disease which could modify the ophthalmological
             progress

          -  The patient is a smoker of more than 5 cigarettes per day
