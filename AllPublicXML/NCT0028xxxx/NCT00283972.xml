      To prospectively observe the association of the LAP-BAND procedure on quality of life,
      anthropometric, metabolic and biochemical parameters in morbidly obese patients when
      performed by experienced US surgeons. The study will also include a complete economic
      analysis of the LAP-BAND procedure and follow-up costs Hypothesis: Measurements defining
      quality of life and the severity of obesity and obesity related comorbidities improve
      significantly over baseline with the LAP-BAND System treatment at 6 and 12 months post
      surgery when performed by an experienced surgeon.

      Study Type: Observational cohort. Single arm (non-comparative), non-randomized, multi-site
      surgical case series.

      Objective: To prospectively observe the association of the LAP-BAND System device on
      measurements of quality of life, anthropometric, metabolic and biochemical parameters in
      morbidly obese patients when performed by experienced U.S. surgeons. Cost effectiveness
      analysis will also be done.

      Numbers: This study will enroll 240 patients total from six U.S. bariatric surgical practices

      Duration: Individual subject participation will be approximately 15 months. Data will be
      collected at a baseline less than three months prior to surgery or before starting a Very Low
      Calorie Diet (VLCD), then at 6 and 12 months post surgery. The total duration, including
      enrollment, of the observational period for the cohort is expected to be 21 months. Subjects
      have the option to consent for future contact by investigators for a period of 10 years
      following their surgery.
