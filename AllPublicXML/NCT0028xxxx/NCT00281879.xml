      RATIONALE: A peripheral stem cell transplant or an umbilical cord blood transplant from a
      donor may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or
      radiation therapy. Giving an infusion of the donor's white blood cells (donor lymphocyte
      infusion) after the transplant may help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells can make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or
      methylprednisolone may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a donor stem cell transplant or donor white
      blood cell infusions work in treating patients with hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effectiveness of unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells for
           transplantation after conditioning for the treatment of patients with high-risk
           hematologic malignancies.

        -  Compare survival, disease-free survival (DFS), response rate, and toxicity rates in
           these patients with historical controls.

        -  Compare the rate and severity of acute and chronic GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic
           stem cell transplantation in patients with hematopoietic malignancies with historical
           controls transplanted with stem cells from related sibling donors

        -  Assess engraftment, long-term hematopoietic recovery, relapse rate, and disease-free
           survival when allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells are used as a source of stem cells for
           transplantation in patients with high-risk hematological malignancies.

        -  Assess engraftment, long-term hematopoietic recovery, and overall survival when
           allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells are used as a source of stem cells for
           transplantation in patients who have graft failure or graft rejection.

        -  Compare engraftment, long-term hematopoietic recovery, rate of GVHD, rate of relapse,
           toxicity rates, overall disease-free survival and overall survival when donor leukocyte
           infusions (DLI) are given for patients who have disease recurrence, progression, or low
           donor chimerisms after unrelated stem cell transplantation or before DLI with historical
           controls of other donor leukocyte infusions.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation or donor leukocyte infusions from unrelated HLA genotypically-identical
           donors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups.

        -  Group 1*: Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) twice a day on days -7 to -4.
           Patients then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 and -2. On day 0
           patients undergo stem cell transplantation (SCT). Beginning on day 7, patients receive
           filgrastim (G-CSF) IV once daily until blood counts recover.

        -  Group 2 (patients who have previously experienced dose-limiting radiotherapy): Patients
           receive oral busulfan 4 times daily on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour
           on days -3 and -2. On day 0 patients undergo SCT. Beginning on day 7, patients receive
           G-CSF IV once daily until blood counts recover.

        -  Group 3 (pediatric patients only): Patients receive busulfan IV 4 times daily on days -9
           to -6 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5
           to -2. On day 0 patients undergo SCT. Beginning on day 7, patients may receive G-CSF IV
           once daily until blood counts recover.

        -  Group 4 (second SCT for patients who have experienced graft rejection or failure)*:
           Patients receive low-dose fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2. Patients then
           undergo low-dose TBI once followed by SCT on day 0. Beginning on day 7, patients may
           receive G-CSF IV once daily until blood counts recover.

        -  Group 5 (patients who developed grade 3 cystitis after prior cyclophosphamide-containing
           therapy): Patients receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -6, etoposide IV over 2
           hours and cytarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV over 30
           minutes on day -1 (BEAM). On day 0, patients undergo SCT. Beginning on day 7, patients
           receive G-CSF IV once daily until blood counts recover.

        -  Group 6 (cord blood transplantation): Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV once
           daily and methylprednisolone IV twice daily on days -3 to -1. On day 0, patients undergo
           an umbilical cord blood SCT.

        -  Group 7 (patients with relapsing or progressive disease after prior transplants or low
           donor chimerisms)*: Patients must not have existing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
           Patients receive donor lymphocyte infusions with conditioning chemotherapy and/or
           radiotherapy at the discretion of the investigator.

        -  Group 8 (pediatric patients only)*: Patients undergo TBI twice a day on days -7 to -5.
           Patients also receive etoposide IV over 24 hours on day -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over
           1 hour on days -3 and -2. On day 0, patients undergo SCT. Beginning on day 7, patients
           may receive G-CSF IV once daily until blood counts recover.

      NOTE: *Patients who have received &gt; 3000 cGy to the central nervous system or &gt; 2000 cGy to
      the lung or liver may not receive any regimen containing total body irradiation (TBI)

      All patients receive GVHD prophylaxis comprising methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11;
      cyclosporine and/or tacrolimus on days -2 to 100; and/or methylprednisolone IV on days 7 to
      100.

      Patients with an unrelated donor who experience a relapse prior to transplantation, may
      proceed directly to transplantation. However, if immediate transplantation from the unrelated
      donor is not possible, the patient must be re-induced into a complete hematological
      remission. Patients who experience graft failure or graft rejection after allogeneic
      transplantation are eligible for a second stem cell infusion from the original donor.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 7 days, 3 months, and 1 year after
      transplantation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>On the day of your admission, you will start to take a drug called allopurinol which helps to protect your kidneys as your body works to discharge cells killed off by your chemotherapy and TBI. Chemotherapy will begin on Day -6 with carmustine (BCNU), followed by etoposide (VP-16), cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C), and melphalan. This conditioning regimen is known as the BEAM regimen. The dose of this therapy is high enough to kill cancer cells but will also kill all of your normal blood forming cells. Subjects undergoing the BEAM regimen will not have total body irradiation (TBI).</description>

    <description>A conditioning regimen of low-dose fludarabine and TBI is used in the event that a second donation of hematopoietic stem cells is necessary. Chemotherapy with Fludarabine will begin 4 days prior to your transplant. This drug will be given through the catheter in your chest daily for 3 days. TBI (radiation) will be given to you on the day of your transplant. After your TBI, your donor's stem cells / bone marrow will be given to you through your catheter. The drugs cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will be given orally to help you accept your donor's cells.</description>

    <description>On the day of your admission you will start to take a drug called Dilantin which is used to help prevent seizures while you receive your chemotherapy drugs. You will also start to take a drug called allopurinol which helps to protect your kidneys as your body works to discharge cells killed off by your chemotherapy and TBI. On the next day, you will then begin your conditioning therapy with a drug called busulfan. This medicine will be given to you by an infusion into your bloodstream through a small tube in the vein of your arm four times per day for four days. After the busulfan treatment, you will receive 4 doses each of two drugs, cyclophosphamide (also known as Cytoxan) and fludarabine, over 2 hours into your vein.</description>

    <description>If you are undergoing a pre-transplant conditioning regimen prior to undergoing a cord blood transplant, you will receive a drug called ATG to improve your chances of engraftment and decrease your risk of graft versus host disease. You may receive ATG 3 times during your transplant regimen on days -3 through days -1 in addition to your pre-transplant conditioning therapy. Methylprednisolone will also be given during each dose of ATG to help reduce any reactions during infusion.</description>

    <arm_group_label>DLI (Donor Leukocyte Infusion)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Donor Leukocyte Infusions: You will receive DLI from your original transplant donor. This will be given through a vein , usually in your arm. It will be similar to getting a platelet or blood transfusion. You may require more than one DLI. The decision to give you another infusion will be determined by your condition, relapse status, GVHD and how much DLI you were given before. You may need chemotherapy and/or radiation to improve your disease status prior to additional DLI's.</description>

    <description>On the day after your admission, you will start receiving radiation therapy (TBI). Radiation will be given to you 2 times a day for 3 days. On the next day, you will then begin your chemotherapy with a drug called etoposide. This medicine will be given to you by an infusion into your bloodstream through a small tube in the vein of your arm for one day. After the etoposide treatment, on the next day you will receive cyclophosphamide (also known as Cytoxan) for 2 days. When you are given cyclophosphamide, you will also be given a medication called MESNA to help protect your bladder from damage. After you have completed the cyclophosphamide you will rest one day without any anti-cancer therapy. This allows your body time to remove and inactivate the chemotherapy. After a day of rest, you will be given your donor's cells.</description>

          <title>Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and Total Body Irradiation (TBI)</title>
          <description>On admission day, you will start to take a drug called allopurinol which helps to protect your kidneys as your body works to discharge cells killed off by your chemotherapy and TBI. Allopurinol tablets will be given to you by mouth up to three times a day for 7 days. You will begin radiation therapy to your entire body at the start of your transplant treatment. This procedure is called TBI (total body irradiation). Radiation will be given to you 2 times a day for 3 or 4 days. After the radiation treatment, you will receive two doses of cyclophosphamide by vein (through a small plastic tube leading into the bloodstream). Each dose takes about 2 hours to administer. When you are given cyclophosphamide, you will also be given a medication called MESNA to help protect your bladder from damage. After you have completed the cyclophosphamide you will rest one day without any anti-cancer therapy.</description>

          <description>On admission day, you will start to take a drug called Dilantin, which is used to help prevent seizures while you receive your chemotherapy drugs. You will also start to take a drug called allopurinol,which helps to protect your kidneys as your body works to discharge cells killed off by your chemotherapy and TBI. Allopurinol tablets will be given to you by mouth up to three times a day for 7 days. You will begin the therapy with a drug called busulfan. This medicine is take by mouth four times per day for four days. After the oral busulfan treatment, you will receive two doses of cyclophosphamide over 2 hours by vein (through a small tube leading into the bloodstream). When you are given cyclophosphamide, you will also be given a medication called MESNA to help protect your bladder from damage. Subjects undergoing the Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide regimen will not have total body irradiation (TBI).</description>

          <description>On the day of your admission, you will start to take a drug called allopurinol which helps to protect your kidneys as your body works to discharge cells killed off by your chemotherapy and TBI. Chemotherapy will begin on Day -6 with carmustine (BCNU), followed by etoposide (VP-16), cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C), and melphalan. This conditioning regimen is known as the BEAM regimen. The dose of this therapy is high enough to kill cancer cells but will also kill all of your normal blood forming cells. Subjects undergoing the BEAM regimen will not have total body irradiation (TBI).</description>

          <description>A conditioning regimen of low-dose fludarabine and TBI is used in the event that a second donation of hematopoietic stem cells is necessary. Chemotherapy with Fludarabine will begin 4 days prior to your transplant. This drug will be given through the catheter in your chest daily for 3 days. TBI (radiation) will be given to you on the day of your transplant. After your TBI, your donor's stem cells / bone marrow will be given to you through your catheter. The drugs cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will be given orally to help you accept your donor's cells.</description>

You will also start to take a drug called allopurinol which helps to protect your kidneys as your body works to discharge cells killed off by your chemotherapy and TBI. On the next day, you will then begin your conditioning therapy with a drug called busulfan. This medicine will be given to you by an infusion into your bloodstream through a small tube in the vein of your arm four times per day for four days. After the busulfan treatment, you will receive 4 doses each of two drugs, cyclophosphamide (also known as Cytoxan) and fludarabine, over 2 hours into your vein.</description>

It will be similar to getting a platelet or blood transfusion. You may require more than one DLI. The decision to give you another infusion will be determined by your condition, relapse status, GVHD and how much DLI you were given before. You may need chemotherapy and/or radiation to improve your disease status prior to additional DLI’s.</description>

          <description>On the day after your admission, you will start receiving radiation therapy (TBI). Radiation will be given to you 2 times a day for 3 days. On the next day, you will then begin your chemotherapy with a drug called etoposide. This medicine will be given to you by an infusion into your bloodstream through a small tube in the vein of your arm for one day. After the etoposide treatment, on the next day you will receive cyclophosphamide (also known as Cytoxan) for 2 days. When you are given cyclophosphamide, you will also be given a medication called MESNA to help protect your bladder from damage. After you have completed the cyclophosphamide you will rest one day without any anti-cancer therapy. This allows your body time to remove and inactivate the chemotherapy. After a day of rest, you will be given your donor’s cells.</description>

          <description>On admission day, you will start to take a drug called allopurinol which helps to protect your kidneys as your body works to discharge cells killed off by your chemotherapy and TBI. Allopurinol tablets will be given to you by mouth up to three times a day for 7 days. You will begin radiation therapy to your entire body at the start of your transplant treatment. This procedure is called TBI (total body irradiation). Radiation will be given to you 2 times a day for 3 or 4 days. After the radiation treatment, you will receive two doses of cyclophosphamide by vein (through a small plastic tube leading into the bloodstream). Each dose takes about 2 hours to administer. When you are given cyclophosphamide, you will also be given a medication called MESNA to help protect your bladder from damage. After you have completed the cyclophosphamide you will rest one day without any anti-cancer therapy.</description>

            <description>If you are undergoing a pre-transplant conditioning regimen prior to undergoing a cord blood transplant, you will receive a drug called ATG to improve your chances of engraftment and decrease your risk of graft versus host disease. You may receive ATG 3 times during your transplant regimen on days -3 through days -1 in addition to your pre-transplant conditioning therapy. Methylprednisolone will also be given during each dose of ATG to help reduce any reactions during infusion.</description>

On the next day, you will then begin your chemotherapy with a drug called etoposide. This medicine will be given to you by an infusion into your bloodstream through a small tube in the vein of your arm for one day. After the etoposide treatment, on the next day you will receive cyclophosphamide (also known as Cytoxan) for 2 days. When you are given cyclophosphamide, you will also be given a medication called MESNA to help protect your bladder from damage. After you have completed the cyclophosphamide you will rest one day without any anti-cancer therapy. This allows your body time to remove and inactivate the chemotherapy. After a day of rest, you will be given your donor's cells.</description>

          <description>On admission day, you will start to take a drug called allopurinol which helps to protect your kidneys as your body works to discharge cells killed off by your chemotherapy and TBI. Allopurinol tablets will be given to you by mouth up to three times a day for 7 days. You will begin radiation therapy to your entire body at the start of your transplant treatment. This procedure is called TBI (total body irradiation). Radiation will be given to you 2 times a day for 3 or 4 days. After the radiation treatment, you will receive two doses of cyclophosphamide by vein (through a small plastic tube leading into the bloodstream). Each dose takes about 2 hours to administer. When you are given cyclophosphamide, you will also be given a medication called MESNA to help protect your bladder from damage. After you have completed the cyclophosphamide you will rest one day without any anti-cancer therapy.</description>
