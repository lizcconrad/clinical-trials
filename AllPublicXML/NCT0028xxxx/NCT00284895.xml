  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is looking at the effects of weight loss, due to surgery or structured
      weight-loss program on lung function, inflammation in your body and lungs, asthma and asthma
      symptoms. This study is important because we will be better able to understand the effect of
      weight on lung functioning and asthma. Approximately 20 research subjects will be enrolling
      in this study at National Jewish.

      Adults with asthma who has elected to undergo weight-reduction surgery may qualify for the
      participation. Involvement will last about 1 year.
