    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of contrast induced nephrotoxicity
      following the administration of Isovue (iopamidol) or Visipaque in diabetic patients with
      moderate to severe chronic renal impairment undergoing clinically indicated contrast enhanced
      multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). Serum creatinine will be measured before and up to
      48-72 hours post dose.
