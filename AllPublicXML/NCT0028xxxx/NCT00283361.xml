    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if the experimental drug ZP120, when given with the
      approved drug furosemide to patients with acute or sub-acute heart failure, can reduce the
      amount of fluid in the patients' lungs and make breathing easier.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients, age 18 years or more

          2. A diagnosis of acute or subacute decompensated chronic heart failure, either ischemic
             or nonischemic, requiring hospitalization, and currently treated with furosemide,
             torsemide, or bumetadine, and other evidence based optimal treatment for heart
             failure. Patients must have the clinical diagnosis of CHF made at least 3 month prior
             to enrollment

          3. Ambulatory

          4. Objective signs of LVD corresponding to a LVEF &lt; 45%, documented by any accepted
             method within the previous 12 months. If documentation is not available within the
             required time frame, LVEF must be assessed prior to enrollment

          5. a) Worsening heart failure symptoms (current NYHA class III-IV). Patients must
             experience worsening of at least one of the symptoms described below at the time of
             entry into the study:

             Dyspnea Symptoms:

               -  Dyspnea (labored or difficult breathing) at rest

               -  Worsening dyspnea (labored or difficult breathing) on minimal exertion

               -  Worsening orthopnea (difficult breathing except in the upright position)

               -  Increased frequency of nocturnal dyspnea (awaken from sleep due to respiratory
                  distress)

                  b) Clinical evidence of volume overload such as weight gain over previous few
                  days, peripheral edema, hepatic congestion with ascites, pulmonary congestion, or
                  pleural effusion

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at enrollment. A
             female is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is post-menopausal (no
             menses for at least 12 consecutive months) or without a uterus and/or both ovaries

          7. Ability to understand and willing to sign Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Incapable of taking the 6-minute walk test due to any condition unrelated to heart
             failure, e.g., muscular or skeletal disability

          2. Valvular heart disease requiring surgical intervention (during the course of the
             study. Patients with heart failure due to or associated with uncorrected primary
             valvular disease, malfunctioning artificial heart valve, or uncorrected congenital
             heart disease)

          3. History of or clinically significant evidence of any severe disease other than heart
             failure that preclude participation and complicate the evaluation of study results
             from the local laboratory:

               -  Hepatic disease (AST, ALT, total bilirubin &gt; 3 times Upper Limit of Normal (ULN),
                  renal disease (S-Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL),

               -  Uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with a history of frequent
                  hypoglycemic episodes or frequent hospitalizations for hyperglycemia,

               -  Cancer (excluding treated non-melanoma skin cancer)

          4. Unstable angina, cardiogenic shock, or acute pulmonary edema requiring any of the
             following: Nitroprusside, intravenous nitroglycerin, nesiritide, intravenous inotrope,
             or need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

          5. Acute myocardial infarction and/or myocardial infarction within 30 days (prior to
             enrollment) as diagnosed by investigator’s evaluation of clinical symptoms, ECG,
             and/or biochemical markers of cardiac injury

          6. Cardiac arrest (patients with history of cardiac arrest within 12 months unless
             precipitated by an event such as an acute myocardial infarction, induction by catheter
             placement, severe transient electrolyte abnormality, by an electrophysiology
             procedure, or addressed by Automatic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator placement.
             Patients with increased risk of cardiac arrest, QTc &gt; 450 msec, atrial ventricular
             block II or III, etc.)

          7. Sustainable VT/VF within 30 days (&gt; 15 seconds long; patients with enrollment ECG
             showing ventricular tachycardia or premature ventricular complexes associated with
             symptoms, or ventricular tachycardia of 6 beats)

          8. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation on enrollment ECG with a ventricular rate &gt;120 bpm

          9. Cardiac surgery within the last month or acutely required PCI (patients who have

             resynchronization procedure within 30 days. Patients who have had ventricular
             reduction surgery or cardiac myoplasty and patients with mechanical ventricular assist
             device)

             infection

         13. I.v. vasoactive treatment, e.g. vasodilators, positive inotropic agents, within 24
