      To assess the procedural success, performance, 30-day and 6 month clinical outcome of
      bifurcation stenting, and the six month incidence of clinically indicated target lesion
      revascularization with the use of the Abbott Vascular MULTI-LINK FRONTIER Coronary
      Bifurcation Stent System in patients with de novo or restenotic bifurcation lesions.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of the Abbott Vascular MULTI-LINK
      FRONTIER Coronary Bifurcation Stent System (CBSS) with one and six months clinical outcomes,
      when used for bifurcation de novo or restenotic lesion treatment. The device allows for a
      stent to be implanted in the main branch and simultaneous preservation and access of the side
      branch for balloon dilatation or stenting when indicated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Other lesions in different epicardial vessels must be successfully treated prior to
             bifurcation procedure.

          -  Native parent vessel suitable to receive at least a 2.5mm x 18mm FRONTIER stent
             (&gt;2.5mm and &lt;4.0mm diameter with a side branch of &gt;2.0mm) with a lesion length &lt;15mm
             determined by visual assessment .

          -  Target main branch vessel must be a major epicardial native vessel.

          -  Appropriate lesion morphology.

          -  Target lesion is restenosis following original treatment by PTCA only (no in-stent
             restenosis).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Estimated artery reference diameter &lt;2.5mm

          -  Patients with diffuse disease defined as long segments of abnormal vessel without
             interposed areas of normal vessel

          -  Target lesion contains thrombus.

          -  Target lesion is aorto-ostial or left main stem location.

          -  Untreated lesion &gt;50% diameter stenosis proximal or distal to target lesion after the
             planned target lesion intervention.

          -  Patients with a contraindication for anti-platelet / anti-coagulation therapy.

          -  Target lesion distal to previously placed stents.

          -  Fibrotic or calcified lesions that cannot be pre-dilated.
