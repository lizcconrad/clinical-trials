      To evaluate the effect of the combination of chromium picolinate (600 μg Cr) + biotin (2 mg)
      versus placebo on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles (Total-C, HDL-C, LDL-C,
      TGs, TG/HDL ratio, etc), and pharmacoeconomic outcomes as measured at the Baseline Visit and
      90 days later at the Final Visit. Secondarily, to measure the effect of chromium picolinate
      (600 μg Cr) + biotin (2 mg) versus placebo on patient quality of life, fasting and
      post-prandial blood sugar levels, fasting insulin, and anti-hyperglycemic medication usage.

      There will be an Initial Pre-Screening Contact, two office visits (Baseline and Final), and
      two mid-study phone contacts with the subject during the course of the study. Volunteers will
      take either chromium picolinate (600 μg Cr) + biotin (2 mg) (n=400) or placebo (n=200) once
      daily just prior to the morning meal for 90 days. Assessments for glycosylated hemoglobin,
      lipid profiles, and quality of life will be taken at the Baseline Visit. After 90 days
      another set of assessments will be taken at the Final Visit for comparison with the baseline
      values. All subjects will under go a brief physical exam, a medical history assessment, and a
      comprehensive concomitant medications assessment as well as provide blood and urine samples
      at the baseline and final visits to ensure subject safety is maintained. The subject will be
      contacted, by a central call center, between visits at Day 30 and Day 60 to ensure study
      compliance by reminding the subject to take all doses of study product, perform the daily
      blood glucose monitoring, and complete the study diary daily.
