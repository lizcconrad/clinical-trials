  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropsychological studies investigating trauma-exposed and posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) subjects have generally underlined the significantly poorer performance of tasks that
      require attention, concentration, and verbal memory, and difficulty in regulating memories
      surrounding the traumatic event. A previous study (El Hage et al. Cognitive Neuropsychiatry,
      2006) revealed that the trauma-exposed subjects scored higher on anxiety/depression scales,
      and lower on processing speed tests. Moreover, the study showed significant impairment in
      working memory partially mediated by speed processing, but not by anxiety or depression.
      These results suggest that processing speed makes a major contribution to trauma-related
      working memory decline, and needs to be investigated in further studies.The aim of the
      present study is to explore correlation between hippocampus volume, frontal dysfunction and
      cognitive slowing in trauma-exposed subjects, while examining brain activation during
      performance of working memory tasks using functional magnetic resonance.

      Working memory performance will be assessed using the &quot;3-back test&quot;, and processing speed
      evaluated with &quot;words comparison test&quot;. The study will be conducted on 2 years. The study
      should include 18 right-handed females victims of sexual abuse and suffering from PTSD, and
      18 controls right-handed females without any history of abuse ad not suffering from PTSD.
      Brain activation will be measured during performance of working memory tasks (3-back test)
      and processing speed test using functional magnetic resonance.
