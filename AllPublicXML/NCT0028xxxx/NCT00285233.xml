  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of islet allotransplantation
      for the reestablishment of stable glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, using
      anti-thymocyte globulin induction immunosuppression with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and
      low dose tacrolimus maintenance immunosuppression.

    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and efficacy of a new single-donor islet allotransplant protocol
      focusing on minimization of ischemic damage by the two-layer pancreas preservation technique,
      attenuation of posttransplant nonspecific inflammatory responses by etanercept and
      anti-thymocyte globulin, deletion/inactivation of autoreactive T cells by anti-thymocyte
      globulin and daclizumab induction immunotherapy, and potent yet non-diabetogenic maintenance
      immunosuppression with sirolimus and delayed mycophenolate mofetil instead of tacrolimus for
      the reestablishment of stable glycemic control in recipients with type 1 diabetes.
