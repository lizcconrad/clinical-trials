      The purposes of this pilot study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Botox® compared
      to the safety and efficacy of oral baclofen in reducing muscle tone-related disability
      resulting from neurological damage or a stable neurological disorder and to evaluate
      drug-therapy tolerance.

      Spasticity results from any injury to the central nervous system, including brain or spinal
      cord. Illnesses or injuries that typically cause spasticity include cerebral palsy, stroke,
      multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. Common treatments for
      spasticity include physical and occupational therapy as well as oral medications such as
      baclofen, injected medications such as botulinum neurotoxin, intrathecal medications and
      surgical procedures. The approach to the treatment of spasticity is comprehensive in nature
      and these therapies have been widely applied to a broad population of patients including
      children, adults and older adults.

      This is a single-center, randomized, prospective, parallel, double-blind study. Study
      duration is approximately 16 weeks.At Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), all eligible study subjects
      will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: intramuscular Botox plus oral placebo, or
      intramuscular placebo plus oral baclofen.

    <description>This study will explore the safety and effectiveness of Botox versus baclofen in treatment subjects with upper-limb spasticity due to neurological damage or a stable neurological disorder.

    <intervention_name>intramuscular Botox versus oral baclofen</intervention_name>
    <description>Each vial of Botox contains 100 units of Clostridium botulinum toxin type A, 0.5 mg albumin (human) and 0.9 mg sodium chloride in a sterile, vacuum-dried form without a preservative. Botox placebo is sterile normal saline (without preservatives) for injection. Baclofen is supplied as 10 mg tablets for oral administration. Inactive ingredients include colloidal anhydrous silica, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, povidone, wheat starch. Baclofen placebo tablets are composed of microcrystalline cellulose binder (99%), magnesium stearate 0.5%, and silica gel 0.5% and appear similar to commercial Baclofen tablets.</description>
