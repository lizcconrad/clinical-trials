  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bicycle riding is associated with related diverse urogenital symptoms ranging from genital
      numbness to erectile dysfunction (ED). Very little is known about the quality of sperm in
      cyclists and whether a connection exists between erectile dysfunction and azoospermia.
