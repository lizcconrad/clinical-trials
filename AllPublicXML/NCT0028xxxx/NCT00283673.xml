  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study randomized healthy sedentary people age 20-80 years to 16 weeks of supervised
      exercise versus no exercise. Several end points were evaluated after 16 weeks including
      insulin sensitivity and muscle physiology.

    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects performing &lt; 30 min exercise twice per week were studied prior to
      randomization and after of sixteen weeks exercise. They were randomized to sixteen weeks of
      supervised exercise performed on a stationary bike vs. placebo exercise (a series of
      flexibility exercises performed at home). Intensity, duration and frequency of exercise were
      gradually increased to four sessions per week lasting forty minutes each and achieving 80%
      target heart rate. Participants were weighed perioidically and counseled appropriately when
      weight changed by &gt; 2 %. Insulin sensitivity and muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis were
      studied.
