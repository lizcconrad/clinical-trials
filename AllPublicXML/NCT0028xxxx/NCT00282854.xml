  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of childhood epilepsy—affecting more than
      50,000 children in the United States—and has a complex genetic inheritance. The seizure
      prognosis is relatively benign, however, many children with RE also have problems with speech
      and language, reading, and motor coordination. Symptoms of the disorder overlap with more
      severe types of epilepsy.

      The purpose of this study is to find the genes that influence RE and its related traits.
      Identifying genetic causes for the variants would improve diagnosis and allow for early
      intervention.

      Researchers will enroll 1000 children with RE and 3000 controls for participation in the
      study. The scientists will request medical histories and (salivary) DNA samples from the
      participants. Participation can be completed by mail and telephone.

      Results from this study should provide important information regarding diagnosis and
      prognosis of RE, may be useful in clinical management, and, eventually, may lead to a cure
      for this and other forms of epilepsy.
