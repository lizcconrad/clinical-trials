      Open-label Multicenter, Phase I/II Study comprising three phases (single dose, multiple dose
      and extension phase), Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of Ranibizumab (RFB002) in Japanese
      Patients With Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) Secondary to Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (AMD).

    <textblock>
      The safety and tolerability of single intravitreal injections of ranibizumab was evaluated in
      patients enrolled in the single dose phase (Group A). Patients who successfully completed the
      single dose phase (i.e. did not experience a grade-3 targeted adverse event) could enter the
      multiple dose phase and receive ranibizumab injections for an additional 11 months.
      Simultaneously, the multiple dose phase was initiated in two parallel dose groups of
      additional patients (Group B), who received ranibizumab injections for 12 months. After
      patients in Group A and Group B had completed the multiple dose phase, all patients who
      provided written consent and were considered eligible based on the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria of the extension phase had the opportunity to continue on study treatment with the
      individualized flexible treatment regimen guided by monthly acuity scores and other
      ophthalmic examinations until approval of ranibizumab in Japan.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Best Corrected Visual Acuity Score of the Study Eye at Month 6 in Group B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy assessment was based on Group B patients. Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was assessed during all study visits using best correction determined from protocol refraction at a starting test distance of 2 meters. VA measurements were taken in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at a starting test distance of 2 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the patient, hence an increase in score indicates improvement in acuity.</description>

Those patients who successfully completed this phase entered the multiple dose phase, where they received an intravitreal injection of 0.3 mg of ranibizumab once a month for an additional 11 months. Subsequently patients enrolling in the extension phase received an intravitreal injection of 0.3 mg of ranibizumab according to an individualized flexible interval regimen guided by monthly best corrected visual acuity scores and other ophthalmic examinations.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Best Corrected Visual Acuity Score of the Study Eye at Month 6 in Group B</title>
        <description>The efficacy assessment was based on Group B patients. Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was assessed during all study visits using best correction determined from protocol refraction at a starting test distance of 2 meters. VA measurements were taken in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at a starting test distance of 2 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the patient, hence an increase in score indicates improvement in acuity.</description>

        <population>Intent-to treat (ITT) population for Group B patients consisted of all patients randomized in Group B that received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline assessment of the primary efficacy variable. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) was used to impute missing data at month 6 in the ITT analysis.</population>

        <title>Extension Phase: Mean Change From Month 12 (Start of Extension Phase) in Best Corrected Visual Acuity Score of the Study Eye at Last Visit of Extension Phase in Group B.</title>
        <description>Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was assessed during all study visits using best correction determined from protocol refraction at a starting test distance of 2 meters. VA measurements were taken in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at a starting test distance of 2 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the patient, hence an increase in score indicates improvement in acuity.</description>
        <time_frame>Month 12 (start of extension phase) and last visit of extension phase. Duration in the extension phase varied depending on the study entry. The mean duration of treatment was 1.45 years in the 0.3 mg group and 1.36 years in the 0.5 mg dose group.</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included all enrolled patients in the extension phase. For the analysis of the results of the extension phase, all data are presented as observed. Patients must have values both at Month 12 and Last Visit to be included.</population>
