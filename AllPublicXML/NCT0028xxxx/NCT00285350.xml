  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the
      efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MM) in combination with prednisone as the
      initial form of immunosuppression in patients with acquired myasthenia gravis (MG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      80 patients with seropositive MG at 18 academic centers will be randomized to 3 months of
      treatment with 2.5 gm MM/day (1,250 mg q 12 hours, +/- 2 hours) plus 20 mg prednisone/day
      versus placebo plus 20 mg/day prednisone. The primary measure of efficacy will be the change
      from baseline in Quantitative MG (QMG) score at the end of 3 months. Secondary outcome
      measures include survival analysis for treatment failure, MG-related impairment of daily
      activities, functional assessment, manual muscle testing, SF-36 Health Status, and serum
      concentration of antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor. Study completers will have the
      option of taking open-label MM for an additional 6 months, during which prednisone will be
      reduced to the lowest dose necessary to maintain the optimum clinical response.

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Acquired generalized MG diagnosed by one of the Principal Investigators based on:

               -  Examination by site PI showing myasthenic weakness that is not limited to the
                  ocular or peri-ocular muscles.

               -  Elevated acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

               -  Positive edrophonium chloride test or abnormal neuromuscular transmission
                  demonstrated by single fiber EMG or repetitive nerve stimulation.

          2. Aged at least 18.

          3. Able to give informed consent.

          4. Taking a constant dose of Mestinon for at least 2 weeks.

          5. Symptom severity that would, in the judgment of the site investigator, justify
             initiation of immunosuppressive treatment.

          6. Able and willing to comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Thymoma now or in the past.

          2. Plasma exchange or IVIG treatment within 90 days of randomization.

          3. Treatment with azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, or other
             immunosuppressive medication since onset of MG. Treatment with prednisone or other
             corticosteroids within the previous 90 days.

             â€¢ Exception: patients may have taken doses of these immunosuppressant medications that
             are judged by the Principal Investigator to have been clinically insignificant, i.e.
             unlikely to produce improvement in MG.

          4. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast-feeding or not practicing
             effective contraception.

          5. Renal failure, active thyroid or hepatocellular disease, chronic infection, poorly
             controlled cardiac disease, or any other illness, including psychiatric disease, that
             would, in the opinion of the treating physician, make it unsafe for the patient to
             participate or would interfere with the interpretation of study results.

          6. Weakness affecting only ocular or peri-ocular muscles (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of
             America Class I).

          7. Severe weakness predominantly affecting oropharyngeal, respiratory muscles or both
             (MGFA Class IVB).

          8. Crisis or impending crisis (defined as FVC &lt;10ml/Kg or bulbar weakness severe enough
             to compromise airway protection.)

          9. Hemoglobin &lt;10mg/dl; WBC &lt;3,500.

         10. History of non-compliance with treatment and office visits.

         11. Thymectomy within 12 months before randomization.

         12. Concurrent medical condition that would pose an unacceptable risk from
             immunosuppression, including a positive skin test for tuberculosis (PPD), unless the
             patient has previously received appropriate treatment.
