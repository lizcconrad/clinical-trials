  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A macular hole is a fairly common problem in the retina and is an important cause of loss of
      central vision. The aim of this study is to determine whether, in patients with a stage 2 or
      3 full thickness macular hole (FTMH), peeling a very fine, transparent tissue that covers the
      surface of the retina, called the internal limiting membrane (ILM) during surgery is superior
      to non-ILM peeling macular hole surgery. The main outcomes are improvement in vision,
      achievement of macular hole closure, need for re-operation, health related quality of life
      (HRQOL) and cost effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) is an important cause of loss of central
      vision, usually leading to severe visual impairment. Up to 20% of affected people will
      develop a FTMH in both eyes. There is uncertainty in the literature and among vitreo-retinal
      surgeons about the balance of potential benefits and adverse effects of ILM peeling in FTMH
      surgery for stage 2-3 holes.

      FILMS is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients with stage 2-3 FTMH less less than
      18 months duration investigating whether ILM peeling improves the anatomical and visual
      outcome of macular hole surgery and the quality of life of patients with this retinal
      disease. Cost-effectiveness is also being addressed.
