      This study involves a form of group therapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT for
      depressed patients with Epilepsy. The CBT groups will be tailored for an epilepsy clinic
      population. There are 12 sessions of therapy in the study held once a week for 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Depression is frequent in PWE and often missed for unclear reasons. Busy neurology clinics
      and their overworked physicians often lack psychiatric backup that may make inquiring about
      psychological issues problematic. In the psychiatric community, awareness of the need for
      depression intervention in the primary care clinic has been recognized for many years and
      several treatment models exist. This study will attempt to use one such model, i.e.
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) using a group format and tailoring its use for an epilepsy
      clinic population.
