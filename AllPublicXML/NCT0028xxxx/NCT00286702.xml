  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, many people develop contracture of the muscles in their affected wrist and
      hand which leads to a permanently clenched, painful hand. A contracture is often treated by
      therapists who use hand splinting to prevent it occurring or slow down its progression.
      Despite their wide use, there has not been research completed to investigate whether or not
      splinting prevents contracture in people following stroke. In fact, this project will be the
      first of its kind in the world and is therefore vital to stroke rehabilitation.

      The study is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial that will measure the effect of
      hand-splinting in two positions on the prevention of contracture, functional use of the hand,
      and quality of life.
