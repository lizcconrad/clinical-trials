      Helicobacter pylori is recognized as a major gastrointestinal pathogen in developing
      countries. This microorganism infects up to 60% of children less than five years in those
      countries and is strongly associated with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in
      children and adults. The progression of gastritis to atrophy often leads to decreased gastric
      acid output, which is a well-known risk factor for anemia. Gastric acid is essential for
      increasing the bioavailability and absorption of non-heme dietary iron, the most important
      source of iron in developing countries. Numerous reports suggest that iron malabsorption
      secondary to low gastric acid output is a problem in developing world countries. It has been
      further observed that iron deficiency anemia is resistant to iron therapy particularly in
      these countries. In a recently completed study we observed an association of anaemia with H.
      pylori infection. We hypothesize that the poor bioavailability of iron in these countries
      could be related to H. pylori -induced low gastric acid output and we propose to investigate
      the role of H. pylori infection as a cause of anemia and treatment failure of iron
      supplementation in Bangladesh. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      field trial is proposed among four groups ( 65 each) of H. Pylori infected children of 2-5
      years of age with iron deficiency anemia. The children will be assigned to one of the four
      therapies: antibiotics alone (for H. Pylori eradication), antibiotic plus iron therapy, iron
      therapy alone, or placebo. Hemoglobin concentration, serum ferritin concentration, and
      transferrin receptor will be measured before and at 1 and 3 month after the intervention. We
      also propose a complementary study in an additional 20 children with H. Pylori infection and
      iron deficiency anemia to assess iron absorption with application of double stable isotopes.
      The change in hematological parameters will also be compared among the groups before and
      after the therapy. The results of this study are expected to have implications in the
      prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in developing countries.

      We propose to complementary study:

        1. A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled field trial in two hundred sixty
           children of a peri-urban community near Dhaka City is proposed.

        2. The assessment of iron absorption before and after anti-infective therapy in 20 children
           with H. Pylori infection and iron deficiency anemia

        3. Field trial

           1.1 Description of the study population Children will be recruited from Nandipara, a
           peri-urban community situated 7 miles northeast of Dhaka City. This community has a
           population of 3,500 in an area of approximately 2.5 square miles. Among the residents,
           70% of males are classified as day laborers, 20% are rickshaw pullers, and 5% are
           carpenters or service holders. Fifteen percent of women are day laborers and 85% are
           housewives. The average family size is 4.5 members. The slum has a municipal water
           supply for drinking and cooking and most families live in poorly constructed houses. The
           great majority of houses are mud walled with thatched dry leaves and bamboo or tin
           roofs. The population less than five years of age is about 700. The prevelance of H.
           pylori infection in less than five children in this community is 50%.44 A weekly clinic
           has been run by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh
           (ICDDR,B) for minor case of illness in the population since 1986.

           All children in the community will initially be screened for iron deficiency anemia and
           H. pylori infection. After explanation of the study and the tests, informed consent will
           be obtained from the parents or legal guardians. Demographic information including name,
           date of birth, sex, weight, height, economic status of the parents, nature of feeding,
           and previous medication in the past 1 month will be recorded.

           Screening for iron deficiency anemia 50 Âµl capillary blood samples obtained by
           fingerstick will be assessed for hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration. Measurement of
           hemoglobin concentration is the most useful test in screening iron deficiency anemia
           since it directly reflects the quantity of most abundant essential iron compound in the
           body. Children with hemoglobin concentration below 110g/l will be considered as anemic.
           In children with low Hgb identified through the initial screening, the diagnosis of iron
           deficiency anemia will be confirmed by venepuncture Hgb, serum ferritin concentration,
           and serum transferrin receptor concentration. Haemoglobin concentration can be
           transiently depressed due to inflammation or infection, and in such a situation does not
           indicate pathological anemia. Of all the biochemical tests for assessing iron status, a
           low SF is the most specific test for iron deficiency. The major disadvantage of SF is
           that it is readily elevated in response to any infector inflammatory condition. One
           major advantage of sTfR is that unlike SF, sTfR is not significantly effected by
           infection or the inflammatory process. However, sTfR levels are increased in situations
           of increased RBC turnover such as hemolytic anemia, i.e. thalassemia, etc. A uniform
           cutoff value of &gt;8.5 mg/l indicates an elevated sTfR and therefore iron deficiency or
           hemolytic anaemia.

           Measurement of serum transferrin receptors also becomes a promising new test for the
           evaluation of iron status particularly in epidemiological assessment of anemia.
           Performed in conjunction with serum ferritin measurements, the serum transferrin
           receptor serves to distinguish true iron deficiency from the anemia from the anemia of
           chronic diseases or inflammatory diseases and, therefore, offers a major advantage in
           establishing the true prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in population studies. The
           combination of low hemoglobin, a low serum ferritin, and an elevated serum transferrin
           receptor are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia. The diagnosis of iron deficiency will
           be made when the following criteria are met: transferrin receptor &gt; 8.3 mg/l, serum
           ferritin concentration &lt;12ng/ml, and hemoglobin concentration(&lt;11 gm/dl).

           Screening of H. Pylori infected children The anemic children will be screened for H.
           Pylori infection using a urea breath test (UBT) which is considered by many of the
           reference diagnostic test for H. pylori infection. We have recently established the test
           at ICDDR,B.44 In brief the procedures are as follows.

           Urea Breath Test A breath sample will be collected for base line 13 CO2 in a vacutainer
           following a fasting period of 2 hr. A volume of 100 ml of whole milk will then be
           allowed to be consumed by the children. Ten min later 40 mg of 13 C urea (99% 13C,
           Tracer Technologies, Boston, Massachusetts) will be given after dissolving in 25 ml of
           water. After administration of the substrate, breath samples will again be collected in
           duplicates after 30 min. Samples will be collected through two-way pediatric mask with
           an attached non-return valve into a vacutainer and will be stored for shipment to the
           University of Alabama, to measure the 13C concentration of a respiratory CO2 mass
           spectrometer. The excess over the baseline will be expressed as parts per thousand(delta
           0/00). A breath test in which the excess over a baseline is 5.00/00 at 30 min will be
           regarded as positive for H. pylori infection.

           1.2 Selection of Study children Iron deficiency anemic children with weight for age &gt;60%
           of National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), with no evidence of deficiency diseases
           or systemic infection and whose parents give informed consent will be enrolled in this
           study.

           Exclusion criteria The children with following problems will be excluded.

             -  Acute infection or apparent inflammatory process

             -  Signs of vitamins deficiency

             -  Severe anemia (Hemoglobin &lt;70 G/l)

             -  Severe malnutrition (marasmus, marasmic kwasiorkar or kwasiorkar)

             -  Presence of hook worms and /or Giardia lamblia (cyst or vegetative form) in a stool
                microscopic examination

             -  Presence of fat in a stool microscopic examination

             -  Presence of occult blood in a stool as demonstrated by Guaiac test

             -  History of taking antibiotics or any drugs for any cause in the preceding month

           1.3 Procedure A detailed medical history will be recorded. Body weight and height will
           be measured upon enrolment into the study. Naked weights will be obtained to the nearest
           10 g using a balance scale (GebrÃ¼der Soehnle, Murrhardt, Germany) and the mean of three
           consecutive measurements recorded. Recumbent length will be measured in children less
           than two years of age using a slideboard infantometer (Harpenden, St. Albans, England).
           In older children, standing height is to be determined using a locally constructed
           instrument in which a metal tape measure is extended between a footplate and head bar
           that has an attached fluid level to ensure a horizontal position. The mean of two
           consecutive height measurements to the nearest 0.1 cm is recorded as the observed value.
           Measurements are compared to the standards according to the National Center for Health
           Statistic data and the nutritional status assessed by Z-score. , Percent of median
           equivalents of standard deviation units will be determined and categorized according to
           the scheme of Waterlow.

           All children will be subjected to physical examination by one of the investigators. The
           children will be assigned to one of the four groups according to randomization:

             -  Anti Hp group

             -  Fe group

             -  Anti -Hp group + Fe group

             -  Placebo group

           In order to compare the overall prevalence of resistance to iron therapy among iron
           deficient children, there will be a fifth group comprising children with iron deficiency
           anemia but without H. pylori infection. This group will be treated with iron therapy.

           Anti Hp therapy: Clarithromycin 15 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days plus
           omeprazole 20 mg single dose for 14 days. ,

           Iron therapy: An iron dose of 3 mg/kg/day (or about 30 mg/day) as ferrous sulphate as
           advocated by Dallman41 will be fed in a single dose in the morning in one half hour
           before food. The iron therapy will be given for 90 days.

           Placebo Glucose syrup

           1.3.1 Supplementation The intervention syrup(s) will be fed daily in a single dose in
           morning in an empty stomach (Half an hour before food). The children in the placebo
           group will receive same amounts of glucose syrup. All therapies will be kept in
           identical dark brown containers and will be fed by a health worker who will be kept
           unaware about the nature of the study and of the contents inside the bottle. Twenty
           four-hour food intakes will be recorded on a precoded form by dietary recall.

           The children will be followed for three months after the end of supplementation. Urea
           breath test will be repeated at the end and at 1 and 3 months after the supplementation.
           Venous blood (500 Âµl) will be taken for determination of serum ferritin, transferrin
           receptor and hemoglobin concentration at the end and after 1 and 3 months of
           supplementation. Children in the placebo group will be given a three month course of
           supervised iron supplementation at the end of study period.

           1.4 Sample size calculation The sample size is calculated on the basis of (i) prevalence
           of H. Pylori infection, (ii) prevalence of non response to iron therapy.

           Sample size calculation based on the prevalence on H. Pylori infection

           Considering the prevalence of H. Pylori infection 50% and iron deficiency anemia 70%,44
           we anticipate H. Pylori related anemia in 50% of infants and children in this community.
           We expect a reduction in prevalence of H. Pylori related iron deficiency anemia after
           therapy with antibiotic plus iron therapies 25%. To detect a difference of this
           magnitude at 5% level and at 80% power the sample size is calculated as follows:

           N =[P1(100-P1) +P2(100-P2)]*8/(P1-P2)2

           Where P1= prevalence of H. Pylori related anemia P2= prevalence of H. Pylori related
           anemia after therapy

           =[50(50) +25(75)] * 8 / (25)2

           =56 in each group

           Based on a previous study in this community we anticipate a drop out rate of
           approximately 15%. With a (Akramuzzaman SM, personal communication), the necessary
           sample size will be 65 children in each group and the total sample of children will be
           260.

           Calculation based on prevalence of non-responder to iron therapy

           Observation from an ongoing study with an oral iron supplementation programme in anaemic
           patients being conducted in Dinajpur (a northern district of Bangladesh) suggests that
           70% of the iron supplemented group do not respond ( S. Rahman, personal communication).
           The prevalence of H. Pylori infection in the proposed study population is approximately
           50%,35 and we expect that after oral iron supplementation the non responders will be 40%
           less among the H. pylori negative group, compared to the H. pylori positive group. To
           detect a difference of this magnitude at 5% level and at 80% power the sample size is
           calculated as follows:

           N = [P1(100-P1) +P2(100-P2)]*8/(P1-P2)2

           Where P1= prevalence of anemia after iron supplementation in H. pylori infected children
           P2= prevalence of anemia after iron supplementation in H. pylori non-infected children

             -  [(70)(30) +(42)(58)] * 8 / (35)2 =46 in each group

           With 15% drop out rate, the number of children will be 53 in each group i.e. total
           sample of 212 children.

           We will take the larger sample size, i.e. 260 children for this study.

           1.5 Randomization A master randomization chart will be prepared by an appropriately
           trained person who is not connected with the study using random permuted block numbers
           taking a size of three. Bottles containing anti-Hp therapy, iron therapy or placebo will
           be identical in appearance and will be arranged in sequence that corresponds to the
           randomization chart and will be serially numbered. The serial number of the bottles will
           correspond to the serial number of the patients enrolled in the study. As one group of
           children would receive anti-Hp therapy and iron therapy simultaneously, there will be
           two bottles (bottles A or B) for each group of children to make the study double blind.
           For children belonging to anti-Hp plus Iron therapy, there will be one bottle containing
           anti-Hp therapy or and the other containing iron therapy. Children belonging to iron
           therapy or anti-Hp therapy alone, will be getting one bottle containing the medication,
           while the other will contain glucose syrup. As the duration of anti-Hp therapy is 14
           days, the children belonging to this group will be provided glucose syrup for the rest
           of the month in order to make the duration of therapy equal among the four groups.

           1.6 Laboratory test Hb concentration will be determined by the cyanmethemoglobin method,
           serum ferritin will be determined by a radio immunometric assay. Serum transferrin
           receptor will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Stool will be
           tested for the presence of occult blood by the guaiac reaction (Occultotest, Ames
           Co.,Elkhart, Inc.,. USA). Serum pepsinogen and gastrin will be measured by
           radioimmunoassay.

           1.7 Withdrawal from the study - The noncompliance of subject, either because the leaves
           the study area for other place before the end of the study or

           - because the child requires unscheduled treatment for serious interim infection.

           Treatment of withdrawal during analysis Results of all randomized children will be
           included in the analysis of the study. Data from the patients withdrawn will be included
           up to the time of withdrawal. A supplemental analysis in which such patients are
           excluded will also be made

           1.8 Outcome variables

           Major

           - The incidence of H. Pylori infection following the therapy.

           - Rise of serum hemoglobin, serum ferritin concentration or reduction of level of serum
           transferrin receptors.

           - The number of children in each group with IDA as primarily defined before and after
           the intervention

           Minor

           - Change of anthropometric indices

      2. Iron absorption study Twenty additional children with a positive Urea breath test and iron
      deficiency anemia will be selected for the Iron absorption study. The purpose of the study
      and all procedures related to iron absorption study will be explained to the parents and
      consents will be obtained. Before commencing the iron absorption study, all children will be
      given a commercial whey adjusted cowsâ milk formula with 8 mg Fe/l (Nidina 1; Nestle, Paris,
      France) for a period of at least three weeks. After 21 days of formula feedings they will be
      admitted to the Metabolic Ward of Clinical Research and Service Center.

      Erythrocyte incorporation of labeled iron (radio stable) has been used successfully to
      examine absorption from the gut. , The erythrocyte incorporation method involves oral
      administration of an isotope of iron followed by measurement of the isotope ratio of iron in
      erythrocytes at a selected time after administration. We will follow the technique for
      measuring iron absorption in children by a double stable isotope technique, developed
      recently by Kastenmayer et al.

      2.1 Method for Iron absorption study

      Preparation of labeled iron sulfate solutions Enriched 57Fe and 58Fe-ferric oxide (Fe2O3)
      will be purchased from Oak ridge National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN, USA). The isotope
      compositions of iron in the 58Fe preparation (as provided by Oak ridge National Laboratories)
      are (mg): (weight%) 54 Fe (0.65), 56 Fe (35.6)57 Fe (3.47), and 58 Fe(60.28). The isotope
      compositions of iron in the 57Fe (weight%) are; 54 Fe(0.65), 56Fe(35.60), 57Fe (3.47), and
      58Fe (60.28).

      Ferric oxide will be dissolved in concentrated H2SO4 by bubbling carbon monoxide through the
      solution over heat for approximately four hours. The solution will then be derated by passing
      purified nitrogen through it for several minutes. The volume will then be adjusted using
      derated water. Two ml aliquot of the resultants 57 FeSO4 and 58 FeSO4 solutions will be
      transferred into opaque ampules. Each ampule will be purged with nitrogen and sealed. Ampules
      will contain either 200 Âµg/ml of total iron (as ferrous sulphate) and 150 Âµg/ml of 57Fe or
      700 Âµg/ml of total iron (as ferrous sulphate) and 420 Âµg/ml of 58Fe. Aliquot from an
      individual ampule will be used to prepare 57Fe and 58Fe-spiked working solutions.

      Stability and safety of parenteral 57 Fe solutions Prior to i.v. administration to the
      infants the 57FeSO4 solution will be tested for pyrogenicity, sterility, and stability.
      Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) testing and repeated culture for bacterial and fungal growth
      to confirm that the 57FeSO4 solutions are pyrogen-free and sterile at the concentrations to
      be used in the study. The nutrient content of the parenteral solutions has been previously
      described. The total iron content of the 57FeSO4 -nutrient solution will be determined by
      atomic absorption spectrometry before and after filtration (0.22 Âµ filters), and over time at
      room temperature.

      2.2 Study design of iron absorption study Infants enrolled in the study will receive a
      combination of parenteral and enteral feeds. The 57FeSO4 solution will be provided
      parenterally while the 58FeSO4 will be given via the enteral route. Erythrocyte incorporation
      of 57Fe and 58Fe will then be measured from blood samples taken two weeks after initial
      infusions. The percentage of the I.V administered dose presents in the circulating
      erythrocytes will be used as a reference for the percentage of absorbed iron (from the orally
      administered dose) present in the circulating erythrocytes. The âcorrectedâ percent
      erythrocyte 58Fe and 57Fe incorporation (58 Fe inc-cor/ 57Fe inc-cor) will be calculated
      mathematically as described below.

      Prior to iv administration to the children, 0.7-0.8 ml of the 57FeSO4 solution(0.2mg/ml) will
      be added to a burytrol containing 30 ml of the nutrient solution used for parenteral feeding,
      using sterile techniques. The iron-nutrient mixture, which has been used safely previously,
      will be infused slowly into a peripheral vein of the children over a 12-24 hour period with
      the aid of an infusion pump.

      Soon after the start of the parenteral infusion of the 57FeSO4 solution, the enteral 58FeSO4
      will be given to the children. During this time, parenteral infusion of 57FeSO4 will be
      continued. After checking to ensure that the nasogastric feeding tube is properly located in
      the stomach, the tube will be aspirated to check stomach contents. If the stomach is empty,
      1.5 ml of the 58 FeSO4 will be delivered directly via a syringe into the feeding tube. The
      tube will then be flushed with 0.5 ml of sterile water. The dosage of parenteral 57FeSO4 will
      be 0.15mg/kg (57Fe-enriched ferrous sulfate solution), which would provide 0.12 mg/kg of
      57Fe. The dosage of enteral will be 1.5mg/kg (58Fe-enriched ferrous sulfate solution), which
      will provide 0.8mg/kg of 58Fe. The children will be discharged with therapy for Helicobacter
      pylori infection (Klarithromycin plus omeprazole) for 10 days.

      After one month of therapy the mothers will be requested to bring their children at the CRSC.
      A repeat UBT and iron absorption study will be performed.

      2.3 Blood sampling Blood samples will be taken before administration of the stable isotopes
      (baseline) and 14 days later in both occasions. Blood sample size will be 200-300 Âµl up per
      sample.

      2.4 Calculation of Erythrocyte Iron Incorporation The quantity administered 58Fe and 57Fe
      (mg) incorporated into erythrocytes at specified time âtâ after administration of the dose of
      labeled iron will be calculated in a manner similar to that used by Zlotkin et al 1995.

      58 Fe inc. =Rt58/54 -Ro58/54 xFe circ x 0.00322 Ro58/54

      57Feinc =R157/54-Ro57/54 x Fe circ x 0.0218 Ro57/54

      In this equation, 58 Feinc and 57Feinc will be expressed in mg. R158/54, R157/54 and R057/ 54
      are the isotope ratios expressed on weight basis for 58Fe/54Fe and 57Fe/54Fe, which will be
      determined on digested blood samples at time &quot;t&quot; after dosing and at a baseline (pre 58Fe and
      pre 57Fe doses) respectively; Fe circ is the quantity of the circulating iron. Fe circ at the
      time âtâ; 0.0032 and 0.0218 are the natural abundances (weight fractions) of 58 Fe and 57 Fe.
      The quantity of total circulating iron, Fe circ, expressed in mg, will be estimated as

      Fe circ. =BV x Hb X 3.47

      Where BV is the blood volume in liters, assumed to be 0.085l/kg of the body weight; Hb is the
      hemoglobin concentration in g/l; 3.47 is the concentration of iron in Hb (mg/g).

      The quantity of administered 58Fe or 57Fe incorporated into erythrocytes, % Fe inc, will be
      expressed as a percentage of the administered doses of 58Fe or 57Fe. Feinc.

        -  58 Fe inc = 58Fe inc x 100 or Fe inc

        -  57 Fe inc = 57 Fe inc x 100 57 Fe inc

      The corrected percent erythrocyte for analysis of the stable isotope ratios in erythrocytes
      will be calculated using the percentage of erythrocyte incorporation of i.v infused 57 Fe.

        -  58Fe inc-cor = % 58Fe inc X 100.

        -  57 Feinc

      Mass spectrometric analysis Preparation of blood samples for mass spectrometric analysis and
      preparation of enriched standards will be followed as per the procedures described by
      Kastenmayer et al. Samples of heparinized whole blood will wet ashed with concentrated HNO3
      at a ratio of 1:3 (blood: acid)(vol/vol) on a hot plate over low heat for 20-30 min. Digested
      solutions will be adjusted with deionized water to yield an iron concentration of 10 Âµg/ml.
      Isotope-spiked standards for an instrument calibration will be prepared in the same manner as
      with the unknown samples. Isotope ratios for 58Fe/54Fe and 57Fe/54Fe in blood before and
      after concurrent enteral (58Fe) and parenteral (57Fe) administration of isotopes will be
      determined by a computer-controlled thermal ionization mass spectrometer using an Elan Model
      250 ICP/MS system, (SCIEX, Inc., Thornhill, Ontario, Canada), operated in the isotope ratio
      mode, as followed by Zlotkin et al. in the Department of Pediatric and Nutritional Science,
      University of Tronoto, Canada.

      Intubation test A standard intubation test as described earlier14 will be performed in this
      subset of children after completion of iron absorption study. In brief, as soft gastric tube
      (18G) will be placed in most dependent part of stomach. Gastric acid samples will be
      collected from children lying in the left recumbent position using manual suction. The
      position of the tube will be confirmed by auscultation, aspiration of gastric juice, and
      nearly complete recovery of water injected in the tube. Samples of gastric juice will be
      discarded during the first 10 min after intubation. Thereafter, samples will be collected and
      saved in 15- min aliquot for 90 min. After 90 min of collection (basal sample), pentagastrin
      (peptavlon, ICI) will be injected subcutaneously at a dose of 0.6 ug/kg. The sample following
      pentagastrin stimulation for 60 min will be termed as &quot;stimulated sample&quot;. The volime of
      gastric secretion in each of the 15 min collections will be rcorded and expressed as
      mililitre per hour. The concentrations of acid in each will be measured by titration of 1 mL
      gastric juice with 0.01N sodium hydroxide to pH 7.4, using an automated titrator (Metrohm,
      Herisau, Switzerland). Total acid output was calculated for each time pint by multiplying
      volume of gastric juice and acid concentration. Basal (BAO) and stimulated acid output (SAO)
      were calculated based on 2 samples collected for baseline measurement and the 4 samples
      collected after administration of pentagastrin respectively, and were expressed as mMol/h.
