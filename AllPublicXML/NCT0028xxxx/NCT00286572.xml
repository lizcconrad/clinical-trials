  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with CAD and diabetes mellitus have a better prognosis than patients with CAD and no
      diabetes mellitus. In acute coronary syndrome patients with an insulin therapy had a better
      survival than patients with oral antidiabetics. But there is not known wether perioperative
      therapy with insulin or oral antidiabetics is associated with higher risk for higher
      perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality and worse long-term survival.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for arteriosclerosis in general and for
      coronary artery disease. Patients with CAD have a worse prognosis if they have diabetes
      mellitus. But it is not known whether the treatment of Dm has an influence on mortality or
      morbidity.

      In face of the high number of patients with Dm and the therapeutic consequences this
      prospective study wants to compare short-time and long-time morbidity in Patients with Dm
      undergoing major non-vascular surgery. Inclusion criteria are medically treated Dm (insulin
      or oral antidiabetics) and major non cardiac surgery.

      The &quot;normal&quot; perioperative treatment of the study is not changed by the study itself.
