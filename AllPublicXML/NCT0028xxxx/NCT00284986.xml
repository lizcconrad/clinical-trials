      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Prochymal(TM) (Ex-vivo Cultured
      Adult Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells) in subjects experiencing treatment-refractory acute GVHD,
      Grades III-IV, that is refractory to standard first line therapies and at least one
      second-line therapy.

      Allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is used in the treatment of a variety
      of hematological, myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders, and malignancies
      involving solid tumors. Patients receiving HCT can develop a life threatening condition
      called graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when donor T cells from the donor bone
      marrow recognize host cells as &quot;foreign&quot; and initiate an inflammatory immunological response.
      The standard of care for treatment of acute GVHD consists of intravenous delivery of
      methylprednisolone starting on day 1 and continuation of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus.
      This regimen of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs may relieve symptoms of GVHD, but some
      patients are refractory to current standard of care treatment. For treatment-refractory
      patients with grades III-IV GVHD mortality is approximately 80%. A therapy that could
      effectively suppress the immunological response from GVHD and help repair the damaged tissue
      could significantly decrease the mortality rate from this disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be 6 months to 70 years of age inclusive.

          -  If female and of childbearing age, subjects must be non-pregnant, not breast-feeding,
             and use adequate contraception. Male subjects must use adequate contraception.

          -  Subjects must have Grade III-IV acute GVHD that has failed to respond to standard
             first and at least one second-line therapy. Biopsy for confirmation of both skin and
             gastrointestinal GVHD is not mandatory, but is recommended when feasible. Enrollment
             should not be delayed awaiting biopsy results.

          -  Subjects must have minimal renal function as defined by:Calculated CrCl of &gt; 30 mL/min
             using the Cockroft Gault equation.

          -  Subject must provide written informed consent and authorization for use and disclosure
             of PHI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has uncontrolled alcohol or substance abuse within 6 months of treatment.

          -  Subject has any underlying or current medical or psychiatric condition that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of the subject (e.g.,
             uncontrolled infection, right heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, etc.).

          -  Subject has a clinically significant, unstable arrhythmia.

          -  Subject has a known allergy to bovine or porcine products.

          -  Subject is unwilling to sign consent form for the long-term follow-up study, protocol
             No. 271
