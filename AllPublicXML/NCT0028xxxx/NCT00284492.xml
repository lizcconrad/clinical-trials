      decreases the frequency of hot flushes and increases health related quality of life among

      control group will engage in self care only. The study period lasts for 12 weeks.

      The study objective is to determine whether Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
      acupuncture-care together with self-care is more effective than self-care alone, to relieve
      climacteric complaints among women who seek alternatives to hormonal replacement therapy
      (HRT). Study design is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. Study
      participants are postmenopausal women who document a mean value of 7 flushes/24 hours and who
      are not using HRT or other prescribed medication that may influence climacteric complaints.
      The treatment group will receive 10 sessions of TCM acupuncture-care and self-care; the
      control group will engage in self-care only.

      The duration of intervention period is 12 weeks with evaluations at baseline, 4, 8, 12 weeks,
      and follow up at 6 and 12 months after baseline. Primary endpoint is change in daily hot
      flush frequency in the two groups from baseline to 12 weeks; secondary endpoint is health
      related quality of life. N in each treatment group: 143 (286 altogether).
