  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a low-dose epidural drug mixture without narcotic
      will result in lower parenteral narcotic usage, and improved side-effect profile for
      post-operative pain in the pediatric population undergoing lower extremity or pelvic
      osteotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pain in patients undergoing osteotomy can be severe. Current methods of
      treatment involve parenteral narcotics and regional anesthesia. Several studies have looked
      at the efficacy of regional anesthesia with various combinations of local anesthetic and
      additives in different populations. However, to our knowledge there have been none that
      directly compare bupivacaine/clonidine epidural with supplemental narcotics to parenteral
      narcotics alone. Many studies substantiate the efficacy of bupivacaine and clonidine as
      effective drugs for epidural analgesia (1,2,3). Parenteral narcotic alone is associated with
      the possibility of significant side effects, overdose, and inadequate analgesia. Epidural
      analgesia has been shown to reduce postoperative pain scores more than parenteral narcotics
      (4). We believe that this study is important since the protocol allows additional parenteral
      narcotic in the epidural group if needed, and also allows for narcotic dosing prior to
      discontinuation of the epidural to compensate for rebound pain. Further, the prolongation of
      pain control shown with epidural clonidine may be beneficial during the transition (5,6).
