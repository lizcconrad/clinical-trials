  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired contractile function after a heart attack and due to coronary heart disease is a
      major cause of &quot;heart failure&quot; limiting quality of life and prognosis, which cannot be
      prevented even with optimal standard therapy.

      The aim of the current trial is to investigate whether infusion of progenitor cells into the
      coronary artery supplying the most dyskinetic left ventricular area may improve left
      ventricular contractile function, compared to no cell infusion in the control group, in
      patients with old (&gt;= 3 months) myocardial infarction.

      -  The study is an open-label, controlled, randomized single-center trial.

        -  Patients post myocardial infarction (&gt;= 3 months) with a patent infarct-related artery
           are included.

        -  Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells are aspirated under local anaesthesia, and after
           cell processing, are infused into the patent infarct-related artery during stop flow
           within the same day. Blood-derived progenitor cells are isolated out of 250ml peripheral
           venous blood, and after cell processing and 3 days culture, are infused into the patent
           infarct-related artery during stop flow. In addition, left ventricular angiography is
           performed. In the control group coronary angiography and left ventricular angiography
           without any intracoronary infusion are performed.

        -  After 3 months, left ventricular angiography is repeated, and patients of the control
           group cross-over to active treatment with progenitor cells, whereas patients initially
           treated with progenitor cells cross-over to the alternate cell type.

        -  The primary endpoint is the change in quantitative global left ventricular ejection
           fraction in LV angiography between the groups.
