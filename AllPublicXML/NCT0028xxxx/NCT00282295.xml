  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New immunization recommendations in the US include vaccination of adolescents against
      pertussis and meningococcal disease. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Tdap (Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced
      Diphtheria Toxoid And Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed) and MCV4 (Meningococcal conjugate
      vaccine against serotypes A, C, Y and W-135) vaccines be administered to adolescents at the
      same office visit if vaccination with both vaccines is indicated. Therefore, this study is
      designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with Boostrix
      co-administered with Menactra as compared to the administration of either vaccine alone in
      healthy adolescents 11 - 18 years of age.

      A phase IV, randomized, partially blinded multicenter study to evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with GlaxoSmithKline's tetanus toxoid, reduced
      diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed [Tdap Boostrix®] co-administered
      intramuscularly with Aventis-Pasteur's meningococcal (serogroups A, C, Y and W-135)
      polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (Menactra™) as compared to the
      administration of either vaccine alone in healthy adolescents 11-18 years of age.
      &quot;Experimental design: Prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study with three
      groups:

      Group 1: Boostrix + Menactra on Day 0, blood samples at Month 0 and Month 1 Group 2: Boostrix
      on Day 0, Menactra at Month 1, blood samples at Month 0, Month 1, and Month 2 Group 3:
      Menactra on Day 0, Boostrix at Month 1, blood samples at Month 0, Month 1 and Month 2
      Treatment allocation: randomized 1:1:1 Type of study: self-contained Duration of the study:
      Approximately one month for each subject in Group 1 and approximately two months for each
      subject in the Group 2 and Group 3.&quot;

        <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE =An AE which prevented normal, everyday activities. Such an AE, for example, prevented attendance at work/school and necessitated the administration of corrective therapy. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
          <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE =An AE which prevented normal, everyday activities. Such an AE, for example, prevented attendance at work/school and necessitated the administration of corrective therapy. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>
