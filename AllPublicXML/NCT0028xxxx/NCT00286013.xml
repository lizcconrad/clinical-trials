      The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility defined as overall tolerance and toxicity
      as well as relative dose-intensity and cumulative dose delivered, of an association
      ofgemcitabine, oxaliplatin and radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced and
      unresectable, but non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma
