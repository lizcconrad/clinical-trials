  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an 8 week study for patients who are currently taking antidepressant medication but
      not fully responding. Ropinirole CR would be taken in conjunction with current antidepressant
      medication. Patients come into the clinic once a week when starting on the medication and
      then once every other week for the remainder of the 8 weeks.

      We hope to learn whether ropinirole CR (controlled release formulation) is safe and effective
      when taken with an antidepressant to reduce the symptoms of depression. Adults who have a
      diagnosis of major depression and are currently taking an adequate dose of antidepressant
      medication will be sought for participation. They will continue to take the antidepressant
      medication and will receive ropinirole CR, an investigational medication, for eight weeks
      during which information will be collected about mood and cognitive functioning.
