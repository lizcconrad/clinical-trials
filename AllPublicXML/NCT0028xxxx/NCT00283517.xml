      The purpose of the study is to assess demographic, treatment, and outcome data in
      schizophrenia patients receiving treatment with long-acting injectable, tablet, or liquid
      formulations of first generation (conventional) or second generation (atypical) antipsychotic
      medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested the superior effectiveness of second generation (atypical)
      antipsychotic medications over first generation (conventional) antipsychotics in preventing
      relapse during the treatment of schizophrenia. It is estimated that a majority of patients
      with schizophrenia have difficulty adhering to the daily regimen of oral medications, and the
      use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics has been shown to increase compliance. This
      study includes both retrospective and prospective observations of the treatments and outcomes
      associated with antipsychotic drug therapy as well as characteristics of the patient
      population. The study is not product specific and includes patients using therapy with
      long-acting injectable, tablet, or liquid formulations of conventional or atypical
      antipsychotic medications. All patients who enroll in the study start treatment with a new
      antipsychotic medication, which is to be used according to the product labeling in the local
      country. Retrospective data, collected over a minimum of 12 months, include patient
      diagnosis, age, sex, history of treatment with antipsychotic medications, hospitalization,
      Clinical Global Impression of severity of disease (CGI-severity), Global Assessment of
      Functioning (GAF), and the reason for starting a new antipsychotic treatment. Prospective
      data, collected every 3 months over 2 years, are evaluated to assess the effectiveness of
      treatment and include the patient's adherence to antipsychotic medication, CGI-severity, GAF,
      and clinical deterioration of the patient's condition. The study investigator enters the data
      into a registry either electronically or on paper record forms. Safety assessments include
      the incidence, type and severity of adverse events throughout the prospective phase of the
      study. Atypical or conventional antipsychotics, as tablet, liquid or injectable formulations
      as prescribed
