  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, once daily
      (QD), in adults with type 2 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with
      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% are type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of
      2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of dipeptidyl peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of alogliptin in subjects with type
      2 diabetes mellitus who are inadequately controlled and who have failed treatment with diet
      and exercise. Individuals who participate in this study will be required to commit to a
      screening visit and up to 14 additional visits at the study center. Study participation is
      anticipated to be about 34 weeks (or 8.5 months).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus, experiencing inadequate glycemic control, and are receiving
             no current antidiabetic therapy. Subjects will qualify if both of the following
             conditions apply:

               -  Subject has failed treatment with diet and exercise for at least one month prior
                  to Screening

               -  Subject has received less than 7 days of any antidiabetic therapy within the 3
                  months prior to Screening Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes must be based on current
                  American Diabetes Association criteria.

          -  Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2

          -  Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng per mL (greater than
