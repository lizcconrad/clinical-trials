        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a tumorous lesion in the liver observed in diagnostic imaging such as
             ultrasonography, etc., conducted between 1 and 35 days before administration of the
             investigational agent, who are scheduled to undergo a dynamic CT examination.

          2. Patients between 20 and 80 years old at the time informed consent is obtained.

          3. Patients weighing &gt;= 55.6 and &lt; 105.0 kg at the time consent is obtained and when the
             investigational agent is administered.

        Exclusion Criteria:Issues affecting the safety evaluation of the investigational agent:

          1. Patients who will have undergone or are scheduled to undergo an examination using
             another contrast agent from 7 days before administration of the investigational agent
             up to the time follow-up examinations are performed on day 8 after administration.

          2. Patients for whom there is a strong possibility that a follow-up period, which extends
             up until examinations are performed on day 8 after administration, would not be
             possible, (i.e., when it will not be possible to evaluate delayed adverse drug
             reactions).

          3. Patients who have undergone or are scheduled to undergo surgical treatment or a
             therapy such as percutaneous ethanol injection therapy, percutaneous microwave
             coagulation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, or transcatheter arterial embolization,
             etc., from the time diagnostic imaging such as abdominal ultrasonography is performed
             up until follow-up examinations are conducted on day 8 after administration.

          4. Patients who are unable to discontinue taking analgesics during the period from the
             morning when the investigational agent is administered until CT examinations are
             completed.

          5. Patients who cannot stop taking biguanide antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin
             hydrochloride and buformin hydrochloride, for three days after study agent
             administration (including administration day).

          6. Patients who are currently participating in another clinical study.

          7. Patients who participated in another clinical study within the 6 months prior to
             providing informed consent to participate in this study.

        General concerns relating to the safety of the subject:

          1. Patients in the acute stage of illness with unstable symptoms, or patients in a
             life-threatening condition (when it is expected that emergency treatment may be
             required between the time of registration and the conclusion of the follow-up period,
             or when the patient is not expected to survive for 3 months following administration
             of the investigational agent, etc.)

          2. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to iodine or iodinated contrast agents.

          3. Patients with serious thyroid disease (goiter, hyperthyroidism, etc.)

          4. Patients with serious cardiopathy (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class
             IV heart failure, shock, cyanosis, peripheral circulatory insufficiency, ventricular
             tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or complete atrioventricular block)

          5. Patients with serious hepatopathy [symptoms of liver failure (fulminant hepatitis)
             such as a disturbance of consciousness corresponding to grade 3 in the Criteria for
             Grading Adverse Drug Reactions of Medicinal Products.]

          6. Patients with moderate serious nephropathy (acute kidney failure, chronic kidney
             failure, hydronephrosis, nephrotic syndrome, or uremia with serum creatinine levels of
             2.0 mg/dL or more, corresponding to grade 2 or above in the Criteria for Grading
             Adverse Drug Reactions of Medicinal Products.)

          7. Patients with bronchial asthma

          8. Patients with acute pancreatitis

          9. Patients with macroglobulinemia

         10. Patients with multiple myeloma

         11. Patients with tetany

         12. Patients with pheochromocytoma or who are suspected of having pheochromocytoma

         13. Pregnant and potentially pregnant women, and nursing mothers

         14. Patients with a history of medicine hypersensitivity

         15. Patients with serious myasthenia gravis

         16. Patients judged by an investigator for any other reason to be ineligible for
             participation as a subject in this study.
