  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week clinical trial in participants with mixed hyperlipidemia to study the
      effects of MK-0524B on lipids.The primary hypothesis is that MK-0524B (dosed as MK-0524A
      coadministered with simvastatin) will be superior to atorvastatin on decreasing the low
      denisity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio
      for the following dose comparisons: 2g/20 mg MK-0524B versus 10 mg atorvastatin, 2g/40 mg
      MK-0524B versus 20 mg atorvastatin, 2g/40 mg MK-0524B versus 40 mg atorvastatin, and 2g/40 mg
      MK-0524B versus 80 mg atorvastatin.
