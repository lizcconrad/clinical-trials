      The purpose of this trial is to determine if an experimental remote video camera system is an
      effective way for a stroke specialist to evaluate stroke patients from a distant site.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Stroke Team Remote Evaluation Using a Digital Observation Camera (STRokE DOC) system is a
      digital video camera system that can transfer video and audio images from the clinic or
      emergency room to a distant (remote) place where a stroke specialist can review the images in
      real time (as they happen). This system uses site independent software to access the camera
      system from multiple locations. The study will determine if video consultation is superior to
      telephone consultation for remote evaluation or treatment of stroke patients, and the
      usefulness of this system in evaluating patients with suspected stroke symptoms. However,
      this method is being used in other fields of medicine for assistance in medical evaluations.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive evaluation by either the video camera
      system or by telephone alone. For those assigned to the video camera system, the system will
      be activated and will record and transmit video and audio images to a stroke specialist
      located at a remote location. He/she may ask the participants questions relating to medical
      illnesses and current symptoms, and may also review laboratory tests and x-ray images using a
      computer, if available. The stroke specialist will also perform general physical and
      neurological examinations, which will take place by video camera with the assistance of a
      bedside physician who will perform the actual examinations.

      For those participants assigned to the telephone-only consultation, the video system will not
      be activated, but the same procedure as above will be followed except the stroke specialist
      will not be able to see the participants or examine them using the video camera system.
      Participation in the study will last for the entire time the participants are in the
      hospital. Participants will be contacted by telephone by a study nurse 3 months post-stroke
      for a 10-minute interview regarding their current health. The total duration for individual
      participation is 3 months.

      The study is part of the Specialized Program of Translational Research in Acute Stroke
      (SPOTRIAS), which allows researchers to enhance and initiate translational research that
      ultimately will benefit stroke patients.

    <measure>Appropriateness of Decision to Treat or Not Treat With Thrombolytics</measure>
    <time_frame>potentially within 3 hours of symptom onset</time_frame>
    <description>This primary measure assesses the appropriateness of decision to treat or not treat with thrombolytics for patients presenting potentially within 3 hours of symptom onset.
Appropriateness was assessed using a centralized adjudicating committee, 3 levels of data availability, and an independent medical monitor assessment. The case was presented to the adjudicating committee (blinded to randomization arm) and the committee reviewed patient records (also blinded to randomization arm) to assess whether decision was &quot;appropriate&quot; to give or not give rt-PA.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) rate at 36 hours. This was assessed by determining whether there was an intracerebral hemmorhage via telephone contact to the hospital where the patient was located. Any follow up imaging (head CT or MRI) was reported to the investigator team for presence of hemorrhage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Total Thrombolytic Administrations</measure>
    <time_frame>potentially within 3 hours of symptom onset</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses the number of total thrombolytic administrations that were given. This was to measure whether there were more participants treated with thrombolytics in one arm of the trial or the other.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Decision for Administration of Thrombolytics</measure>
    <time_frame>potentially within 3 hours of symptom onset</time_frame>
    <description>time to decision (consult onset to decision). This measure was meant to assess how long it took to do the evaluation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Evaluations With Technical Observations</measure>

    <description>Technical Observations: This measure was designed to assess the percentage of evaluations where there were technical observations (difficulties with using the technology) noted by the consultant who performed the evaluation (either telemedicine evaluation or telephone evaluation) in each arm of the trial.</description>

        <title>Appropriateness of Decision to Treat or Not Treat With Thrombolytics</title>
        <description>This primary measure assesses the appropriateness of decision to treat or not treat with thrombolytics for patients presenting potentially within 3 hours of symptom onset.
Appropriateness was assessed using a centralized adjudicating committee, 3 levels of data availability, and an independent medical monitor assessment. The case was presented to the adjudicating committee (blinded to randomization arm) and the committee reviewed patient records (also blinded to randomization arm) to assess whether decision was &quot;appropriate&quot; to give or not give rt-PA.</description>
        <time_frame>potentially within 3 hours of symptom onset</time_frame>
        <population>Of the original 234 patients, 11 were run in patients and were not randomized and 1 was removed from any analysis due to a protocol violation resulting in the total 222 patients analyzed. There were 7 lost to follow up in telemedicine and 8 lost to follow up in telephone resulting in 104 analyzed in telemedicine and 103 analyzed in telephone.</population>
