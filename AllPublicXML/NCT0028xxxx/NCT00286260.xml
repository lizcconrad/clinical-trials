  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyneuropathy of different etiologies is often associated with pain. The standard treatment
      of this pain is anticonvulsants or antidepressants, but none of these treatment are effective
      or tolerable for all patients. Levetiracetam is a newer anticonvulsant and it is the
      hypothesis is that it could relieve neuropathic pain in polyneuropathy. This is a randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial on the effect of levetiracetam 3.000
      mg/day on pain in polyneuropathy
