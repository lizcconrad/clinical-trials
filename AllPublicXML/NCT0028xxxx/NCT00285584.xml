  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to test the whether high-risk, HIV-seronegative persons
      with mild-to-moderate depression would be more likely to adopt protective behavior change
      when provided with pharmacotherapy for their depression than when treated with placebo.
      High-risk behaviors include using illegal drugs and participating in unprotected sexual
      intercourse. The specific pharmacotherapy used in this study was the anti-depressant,
      bupropion. The subject population consisted of HIV negative men who have sex with men (MSM)
      with mild-to-moderate depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression in men is often masked by high-risk behaviors such as alcohol and drug abuse.
      Common symptoms among depressed men include feelings of hopelessness and helplessness,
      irritability, and anger. MSM are among those at highest for HIV acquisition due to high-risk
      behaviors, including unprotected sexual intercourse and drug abuse. Bupropion is an
      antidepressant medication commonly used to treat depression. The purpose of this study thus
      was whether bupropion could help MSM with mild-to-moderate depression reduce their high-risk
      behaviors.

      Participants in this trial were randomly assigned to receive either bupropion or placebo for
      6 months. Study visits lasting approximately 2 hours each occurred at Day 0, and at Months 4,
      6, and 9; included in these visits were physical examination, testing for HIV and sexually
      transmitted disease (STD), depression screening, and an interview-administered questionnaire
      inquiring into sexual activity and drug use. Shorter study visits, lasting 15 - 30 minutes
      each occurred at Day 15, and Months 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7, and included depression screening and
      physical exam.

    <description>The BDI-II is a self-administered, multiple-choice questionnaire inquiring into the presence and severity of symptoms associated with depression. BDI-II scores range from 0 to 63, with 10-19 interpreted as mild-to-moderate; 20-29 as moderate-to-severe, and ≥ 30 as severe depression. The study outcome measure was the BDI-II score at Month 6 minus the BDI score at enrollment</description>

    <description>Participants initially received bupropion, 150 mg, once daily, to be taken in the morning. Dosage was increased to 150 mg twice daily within one month. Return visits were conducted monthly from study Months 1 through 6 to review medication dosage, ascertain side effects and evaluate depression severity. At the end of Moth 6, subjects were tapered to 150 mg/day over a period of 4 - 7 days. The final 150 mg/day dosage of bupropion allowed referral for pharmacotherapy without unblinding subjects or staff regarding bupropion/placebo assignment. Subjects were followed through Month 9 to permit evaluation of the durability of intervention effects.</description>

        <title>Change in Beck Depression Inventory - II (BDI-II) Scores Between Enrollment and Month 6.</title>
        <description>The BDI-II is a self-administered, multiple-choice questionnaire inquiring into the presence and severity of symptoms associated with depression. BDI-II scores range from 0 to 63, with 10-19 interpreted as mild-to-moderate; 20-29 as moderate-to-severe, and ≥ 30 as severe depression. The study outcome measure was the BDI-II score at Month 6 minus the BDI score at enrollment</description>
