  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare a newly developed system for transanal colonic irrigation
      (Peristeen Anal Irrigation) with a bowel management regime that does not include irrigation
      in a prospective, randomized trial in spinal cord lesion patients (SCL- patients) with faecal
      incontinence and/or constipation.

      Population; 80 SCL- patients with faecal incontinence and/or constipation from five
      countries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The magnitude of bowel dysfunction in spinal cord injury patients has been documented in
      several studies. Spinal cord injury affects colorectal motility, transit times, and bowel
      emptying often leading to constipation, fecal incontinence or a combination of both. Although
      these symptoms are not life-threatening, they may have a severe impact on quality of life as
      well as increase levels of anxiety and depression.

      Various bowel management programs have been empirical, and individual solutions have been
      sought on a trial-and-error basis. Transanal irrigation has been used in selected patients
      with constipation or fecal incontinence. The majority of spinal cord injured patients in a
      recent study benefited from the treatment. However, there is limited evidence in the
      literature supporting any bowel management program in spinal cord injury in favor of another
      and well-designed controlled trials are still lacking. Therefore, the present study aims to
      compare transanal irrigation with conservative bowel management, defined as best supportive
      bowel care without irrigation, in a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentre study
      among spinal cord injured patients with neurogenic bowel dysfunction.
