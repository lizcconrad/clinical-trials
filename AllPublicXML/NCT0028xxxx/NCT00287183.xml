      Current research indicates that TTP488 may be a viable agent for the treatment of diabetic
      nephropathy. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a six-month
      regimen of daily orally-administered TTP488 to patients with diabetic nephropathy.

          -  Diagnosis of probable Type 2 diabetes after the age of 30 and for at least 6 months
             prior to the screening visit and: not requiring insulin within first year of
             diagnosis; no history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); body mass index (BMI) of 40 or
             less at the screening visit

          -  Presence of persistent albuminuria with a UACR of 6.7 - 203 mg/mmol Must be taking the
             highest tolerated dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an
             angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and have been maintained on that dose for at
             least 3 months prior to the Baseline visit

          -  Blood pressure(BP) must be stable and well controlled by the judgement of the

             by diuretics

          -  Myocardial infarction or signs or symptoms of unstable coronary artery disease with
             the last year

          -  Pulmonary disease or evidence of clinically significant pulmonary symptoms.

          -  Active neoplastic disease. (Excised cutaneous basal cell carcinomas are not excluded).
             Patients with stable prostate cancer may be included at the discretion of the Medical
             Monitor.

          -  Any clinically significant hematologic or coagulation disorder

          -  Any clinically significant hepatic disease

          -  Use of excluded medications: drugs known to significantly increase QTc and/or have
             increased risk of torsades de point, immunosuppressive agents, cancer chemotherapeutic
             agents, oral corticosteroids other than maintenance doses equivalent to 7.5 mg
             prednisone per day, and radiotherapy

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days or within 5 half-lives of the
             investigational agent, whichever is longer, or use of an investigational medical
             device within 2 weeks before or after the study

          -  Any other disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the
