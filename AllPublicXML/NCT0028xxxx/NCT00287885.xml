      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Docetaxel may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving
      daily doses of docetaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel in
      treating patients with refractory or recurrent advanced gynecologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of metronomic docetaxel in patients with
           progressive or recurrent gynecologic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics associated with this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes daily for up to 6 months in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed advanced, refractory gynecologic cancer.

          -  Patients must have received prior chemotherapy, and must have residual or recurrent
             disease after initial therapy or after subsequent therapy.

          -  Patients must have at least one site of bi-dimensional measurable disease as defined
             in section 9 or must have evaluable but radiographically non-measurable disease
             associated with CA-125 &gt; 50 units/ml on two measurements at least one week apart.
             Baseline measurements and CA-125 must be obtained for all patients within four weeks
             before registration.

          -  Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.

          -  Patients must not have received any hormonal or immunologic therapy for 2 weeks or
             cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for 4 weeks (nitrosoureas and mitomycin C
             require 6 weeks) prior to registration.

          -  Patients may not have a history of prior malignancy in the past 5 years other than
