  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor the safety of continued DN-101 and docetaxel
      treatment for subjects previously enrolled in DN101-002 (ASCENT) or DN101-004 (NSCLC)
      Studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label trial of DN-101 and docetaxel combination therapy to
      monitor the safety of ongoing DN-101 and docetaxel treatment for subjects previously enrolled
      in DN101-002 or DN101-004 studies. For subjects enrolled in DN101-002 study, only subjects
      randomized to the DN-101 treatment arm and are currently receiving study drug (including
      subjects on study suspension / holiday) will be included in the current study. For subjects
      enrolled in DN101-004 study, only subjects who are receiving study treatment will be
      included.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study. Safety evaluations will consist of a modified
      physical exam (vital signs and weight) and laboratory assessments. Modified physical exam
      should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle. Docetaxel-related laboratory
      assessments will be performed per standard of care as noted in the labeling. DN-101-related
      laboratory assessments for serum calcium and serum creatinine will be performed at the
      beginning of each treatment cycle. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values will be
      reported as adverse events.
