      The purpose of this Study is to test the Safety and Effectiveness of MK0686 in relieving
      neuropathic (chronic) pain as experienced by patients with Postherpetic Neuralgia (Also Know
      as PHN or Post Shingles Pain).

      This is an early phase trial and some specific protocol information is proprietary and not
      publicly available at this time. (Full information is available to trial participants).
