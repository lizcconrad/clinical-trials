  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is rapidly emerging as an epidemic of global proportions and its
      definition is still evolving. Patients with this syndrome are at increased risk for
      cardiovascular disease, and at increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease.

      Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with obesity, and more specifically with abdominal
      obesity. Abdominal obesity, comprises two main components: visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous
      (SAT) adipose tissue depots, with VAT reported as more metabolically active than SAT, and
      thought to play a major role in the metabolic disturbances associated with obesity and
      metabolic syndrome.

      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is fast becoming the most common liver disease and
      is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

      Bariatric surgery has yielded dramatic results including longitudinal loss of excess body
      weight and either complete reversal or significant improvement of several features of
      metabolic syndrome, NAFLD, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in obese patients.
