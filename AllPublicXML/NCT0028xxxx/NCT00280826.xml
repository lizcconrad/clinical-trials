  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the safety and potential efficacy of the monoclonal antibody efalizumab
      (Raptiva) for treating sight-threatening uveitis (eye inflammation). Efalizumab controls the
      activity of white blood cells called lymphocytes that cause inflammation. The drug is
      currently approved in the United States to treat patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

      Participants 18 and older with sight-threatening intermediate or posterior uveitis of at
      least 3 months duration, causing persistent macular edema in one or both eyes, were eligible
      for this study. The uveitis required treatment with at least 20 milligrams per day of
      prednisone, or the equivalent, or a combination of two or more anti-inflammatory treatments
      such as prednisone, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, etc.

      Participants underwent the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination.

        -  Weekly efalizumab treatment.

        -  Weekly eye examination, including measurement of vision and pressure in the eyes,
           dilation of the eyes and examination of the front and back parts of the eye.

        -  Weekly blood tests to measure the number and types of cells in the blood and to check
           for signs of inflammation and treatment side effects. At some visits, blood samples were
           collected to measure how much efalizumab remains in the blood and whether the body has
           developed an immune response to the medicine.

        -  Blood draw at enrollment and at 2 and 4 months for research tests to examine how
           participants' immune response was operating.

        -  Fluorescein angiography at enrollment and 1 and 3 months after enrollment, unless
           additional tests are needed, for medical management. This test checked for abnormalities
           of eye blood vessels. A yellow dye was injected into an arm vein and travels to the
           blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina (the back portion of the eye) were
           taken with a special camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show
           whether any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible
           abnormalities.

        -  Monthly pregnancy test for women who could become pregnant.

      Participants returned for treatment and clinic visits weekly for 16 weeks. After 16 weeks,
      participants whose macular edema had decreased and whose vision may have improved were
      offered to continue the injections.

      Background: Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause
      of visual loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause
      significant adverse effects. Consequently, an effective treatment with a safer side effect
      profile is highly desirable.

      Aims: This protocol evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of subcutaneous (SC)
      efalizumab (anti-CD11a) treatments for uveitis while reducing or eliminating standard
      medications commensurate with the standard of care. If the therapeutic benefit was sustained
      using the SC formulation, then maintenance therapy was continued as clinically indicated.

      Methods: This was an open-label, non-randomized, clinical pilot study.
