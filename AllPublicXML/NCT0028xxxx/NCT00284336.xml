  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase II study in elderly patients (65y or older) with early breast
      cancer who are candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy. A scheme with liposomal doxorubicin
      (Caelyx) and cyclophosphamide (endoxan) will be used. The aim is to study the cardiac effects
      of liposomal doxorubicin with new non-invasive techniques, ie strain rate imaging, classical
      echocardiography, and special blood tests measuring troponin I and BNP.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven early breast cancer requiring adjuvant chemotherapy according to
             the treating physician (lymph node positive or other features of high risk according
             to St-Gallen criteria).

          -  Age &gt; 65 years

          -  Normal cardiac function (assessment of LVEF by MUGA scan or echocardiography above the
             lower limit of normal for the institution).

          -  Performance status 0 to 2 (WHO scale)

          -  The determination of ER and PgR is mandatory (immunohistochemical methods required; ER
             and/or PgR positivity is defined as &gt; 1% of positive cells). Also determination of
             Her2neu is mandatory, either by immunohistochemistry or by FISH

          -  Adequate organ function (as defined by neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x109/L, Platelets &gt; 100 x
             109/L, Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl, total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 UNL, ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) &gt;
             1.5 UNL, alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 UNL, creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl (150 Âµmol/L)

          -  Complete staging work-up within 2 months prior to registration. All patients will have
             bilateral mammography, chest X-ray (PA and lateral) and/or CT-scan, abdominal
             ultrasound and/or CT scan, bone scan. In case of positive bone scan suspicious for
             metastases, bone X-ray (or bone CT-scan on spinal hot spots) is mandatory to rule out
             the possibility of metastatic disease. Other tests may be performed as clinically
             indicated.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up.

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial

          -  Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be given
             according to ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic disease (M1)

          -  Prior systemic anticancer therapy for breast cancer (chemotherapy, hormone therapy of
             immunotherapy)

          -  Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer.

          -  Pre-existing motor or sensory neurotoxicity of a severity &gt; grade 2 by NCI criteria.

          -  Serious illness or medical condition:

               -  Congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris, previous history of
                  myocardial infarction within 1 year from study entry, uncontrolled hypertension
                  or high-risk uncontrolled arrythmias

               -  History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders that would prohibit
                  the understanding and giving of informed consent.

               -  Active uncontrolled infection

               -  Active peptic ulcer, unstable diabetes.

          -  Past (less than 5 years) or current history of other neoplasm except for curatively
             treated basal cell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix.

          -  Concurrent treatment with hormonal replacement therapy: this treatment should be
             stopped at least 15 days before study entry

          -  Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs. No participation in another
             clinical trial with any investigational not marketed drug within 30 days prior to
             study entry.

          -  Concurrent treatment with any other anti-cancer therapy.
