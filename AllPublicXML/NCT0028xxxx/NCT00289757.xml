      The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term persistence of hepatitis A antibodies at
      11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 years after subjects received their first dose of a
      2 dose vaccination schedule of hepatitis A vaccine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up study at Years 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 after
      primary vaccination with GSK Biologicals' hepatitis A vaccine (two-dose schedule). To
      evaluate the long-term antibody persistence, volunteers will donate a blood sample at Years
      11, 12, 13, 14,15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 after the first vaccine dose of the primary
      vaccination course to determine their anti-hepatitis A (anti-HAV) antibody concentrations If
      a subject has become seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies during any of the long-term blood
      sampling time point (i.e. Years 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 years), he/ she
      will be offered an additional vaccine dose. A blood sample will be taken on the day of the
      additional vaccination, 14 days and one month after additional vaccination to evaluate the
      immune response following this vaccination.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007
      and to include an extended follow up period up to Year 20 after primary vaccination.

      The study has 10 phases (100576, 100577, 100578, 100579, 100580, 111028, 111029, 111030,
      111031, 111032).
