  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking while on nicotine patches will help subjects to reduce their expired carbon monoxide
      levels from the levels they were before they started using the patch. Subjects will also
      decrease their daily consumption of cigarettes, change how they smoke the cigarette, and will
      show reduced reactivity to smoking-related cues and reduced craving.

      Subjects who smoke while on an individually dosed tNRT will reduce their expired carbon
      monoxide levels from pre- to post-treatment conditions. They will also decrease their daily
      consumption of cigarettes, change their smoking topography, and will show reduced reactivity
      to smoking-related cues and reduced craving.
