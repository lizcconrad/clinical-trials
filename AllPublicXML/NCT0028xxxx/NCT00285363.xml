    <textblock>
      This descriptive study aims to allow children and adolescents who have cancer to
      self-evaluate their quality of life. It is hypothesized that treatment affects quality of
      life in the areas of physical and social functioning. It is further hypothesized that these
      effects dissipate within 6 months after treatment is completed.

      Study participants will include all children and adolescents (aged 7 to 21 years old)
      currently receiving care from the Hematology/Oncology Clinic at the CMHC, which will serve as
      the study site. These individuals will be identified by the health care professionals working
      in the clinic. Specific study criteria will include only those individuals who (1) can read
      or write in the English language (due to limited availability of translators); (2) appear to
      not possibly suffer psychological harm by participating (as determined by any health care
      professional working in the Clinic); and (3) do not have a health condition and/or medical
      need that supersedes study participation. The weekly list of appointments will be reviewed by
      the researchers who already work in the Clinic for appropriateness (JH, JB and KS). To
      prevent participation coercion, solicitation for participation will be provided through the
      Child Life Specialist (CLS). The CLS is known to each participant and will function as a data
      collector for this study.
