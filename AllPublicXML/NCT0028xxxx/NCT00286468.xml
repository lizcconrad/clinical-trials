  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, once daily
      (QD), combined with a sulfonylurea in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with
      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% are type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of
      2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of dipeptidyl peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of alogliptin in combination
      with a sulfonylurea in subjects who are inadequately controlled on a sulfonylurea alone.
      Individuals who participate in this study will be required to commit to a screening visit and
      up to 14 additional visits at the study center. Study participation is anticipated to be
      about 34 weeks (or 8.5 months).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus , currently treated with a sulfonylurea alone
             but experiencing inadequate glycemic control. Should have received the sulfonylurea
             monotherapy for at least the 3 months prior to Screening; has been on a stable
             sulfonylurea dose equivalent to at least 10 mg of glyburide (Exception: documented
             maximum tolerated dose equivalent to less than 10 mg but at least 5 mg glyburide) for
             at least 8 weeks.

          -  No treatment with antidiabetic agents other than a sulfonylurea within the 3 months
             prior to Screening. (Exception: if a subject has received other antidiabetic therapy
             for less than 7 days within the 3 months prior to Screening.)

          -  Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2.

          -  Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng/mL. (If this screening
