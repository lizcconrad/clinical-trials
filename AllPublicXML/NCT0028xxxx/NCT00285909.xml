  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease
      and type 2 diabetes. The association of alcohol consumption with cardiovascular disease is
      mediated by a functional polymorphism of alcohol dehydrogenase 1c, but the effect of this
      polymorphism on alcohol metabolism is only investigated in vitro.

      The risk reduction of moderate alcohol consumption for cardiovascular disease is explained
      largely by an increase of HDL cholesterol, but an increase of adiponectin concentrations
      after moderate alcohol consumption may also be involved. It seems likely that adiponectin is
      a mediator for the association of moderate alcohol consumption with type 2 diabetes. The
      mechanism by which moderate alcohol consumption increases adiponectin concentrations is
      unknown, but ppar-gamma activation may be involved.

      effects of this polymorphism on mediators of this relation are not known. This study
      therefore investigates the effect of moderate alcohol consumption and the influence of
      alcohol dehydrogenase 1c polymorphism on ppar-gamma activated gene expression and risk
      factors of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

      Objectives :

      To investigate the effect of moderate alcohol consumption and influence of genetic variation
      of ethanol oxidation on:

        -  PPAR-γ activated gene expression

        -  Markers of coronary heart disease or type 2 diabetes

        -  Postprandial changes of HPA-axis activity among 36 postmenopausal women with ADH1C
           genotype associated with slow or fast alcohol metabolism.

      Design : Randomized, controlled, not blinded crossover trial with 1 week wash-out preceding
      each treatment period

      Participants

        -  Description : Apparently healthy postmenopausal women

        -  Number : 36

      Study substances

        -  Test substance : White wine (ca. 25 g alcohol/day)

        -  Reference substance : White grape juice

      Study treatments Treatment A: 250 ml white wine daily (ca. 25 g alcohol/day) Treatment B: 250
      ml white grape juice daily

      Study period

      - Duration : two periods of 6 weeks preceded by 1 week wash-out period

      Test parameters:

        -  Adiponectin mRNA expression

        -  Expression of PPAR-gamma activated genes: CD36, lipoprotein lipase, AP2

        -  Markers of cardiovascular disease (blood lipid profile, Lp-PLA2 activity, hs-CRP,
           fibrinogen)

        -  Markers of type 2 diabetes (adiponectin, adiponectin oligomers, insulin sensitivity)

        -  Parameters of alcohol oxidation (postprandial: blood alcohol and acetate, acetaldehyde)

        -  HPA-axis activity (postprandial &amp; fasting: cortisol, ACTH, testosterone)
