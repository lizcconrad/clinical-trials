        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with mild or moderate hypertension defined with arterial diastolic pressure
             (PAD) at sit position between 90 mmHg and 110 mmHg and arterial systolic pressure

          -  Patient diagnosed after 3 consultations within 2 months who has never been under
             treatment and responding to the required conditions for hypertension treatment with
