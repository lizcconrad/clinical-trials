  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study introduces a new optimization immunosuppressive regimen associating tacrolimus at
      a reduced dose and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium at an increased dose in order to slow
      down renal function worsening and to prevent the progression of chronic allograft
      nephropathy, while maintaining the same efficacy, in maintenance renal transplant recipients.

    <measure>Renal Function Assessed by Change in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to Month 6 calculated by using abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula is: GFR [mL/min/1.73m^2] = 186.3*(C^-1.154)*(A^-0.203)*G*R where -C is the serum concentration of creatinine [mg/dL], -A is patient age at sample collection date [years], -G=0.742 when gender is female, otherwise G=1, -R=1.21 when race is black, otherwise R=1.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Failure Parameters (Biopsy-Proven Acute Rejection (BPAR), Graft Loss, Death, or Loss to Follow-up) at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) is defined as a biopsy graded IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III based on the Banff 1997 classification.The allograft was presumed lost on the day the patient started dialysis and was not able to subsequently be removed from dialysis. If the patient went through a graft nephrectomy, then the day of nephrectomy was the day of graft loss.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Graft and Patient Survivals at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Graft survival was defined as the number of patients with no graft loss. The allograft was presumed lost on the day the patient started dialysis and was not able to subsequently be removed from dialysis. If the patient went through a graft nephrectomy, then the day of nephrectomy was the day of graft loss. Patient survival was defined as the number of patients alive with or without a functioning graft.</description>

          <description>Patients received 720 mg/day (360 mg twice a day (bid) orally) Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) and tacrolimus (twice a day orally) dose adjusted to maintain a trough blood level (C0) between 5.5 and 10 ng/mL. The randomization was stratified on 1 factor: treatment with or without steroids. Prednisone (or oral equivalent) was administrated to patients as before entering the study and as per center’s standard practice, but at a dose of at least 5 mg/day.</description>
