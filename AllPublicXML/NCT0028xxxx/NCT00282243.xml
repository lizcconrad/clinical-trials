    <description>After enrollment in the pharmacokinetic period, patients were maintained on their usual dose of tacrolimus twice daily on Day 1 through Day 14 and on Day 15 were converted to tacrolimus modified release (MR) once-daily in the morning for 14 days, converted back to tacrolimus twice daily for 14 days and then converted back to tacrolimus MR formulation once-daily in the morning for 14 days, all based on a 1:1 mg for mg total daily dose conversion. The extended treatment period began on day 57 and consisted of a single dose of tacrolimus extended-release formulation once every morning through the end of the study.
Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain the target tacrolimus trough level within the range of 5 to 20 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>

          <description>After enrollment in the pharmacokinetic period, patients were maintained on their usual dose of tacrolimus twice daily on Day 1 through Day 14 and on Day 15 were converted to tacrolimus modified release (MR) once-daily in the morning for 14 days, converted back to tacrolimus twice daily for 14 days and then converted back to tacrolimus MR formulation once-daily in the morning for 14 days, all based on a 1:1 mg for mg total daily dose conversion. The extended treatment period began on day 57 and consisted of a single dose of tacrolimus extended-release formulation once every morning through the end of the study.
Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain the target tacrolimus trough level within the range of 5 to 20 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to 24 Hours (AUC0-24) for Tacrolimus</title>
        <description>The area under the concentration-time curve was calculated from whole blood tacrolimus concentrations for both the tacrolimus and tacrolimus MR treatment periods at steady state using the linear trapezoidal rule. The AUC0-24 for tacrolimus was calculated as the sum of the AUC0-12 for the morning (0-12 hour) and afternoon (12-24 hour) doses.</description>

        <description>Biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) is defined as an episode of acute liver allograft rejection that was confirmed by biopsy results and was Banff grade ≥ I. Biopsies were graded by the pathologist at the clinical site according to the 1997 Banff criteria for grading of acute liver allograft rejection: Indeterminate: Portal inflammatory infiltrate that fails to meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute rejection; Grade I (Mild): Rejection infiltrate in a minority of the triads that is generally mild and confined within the portal spaces; Grade II (Moderate): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads; Grade III (Severe): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads, with spillover into periportal areas and moderate to severe perivenular inflammation that extends into the hepatic parenchyma and is associated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis.</description>

            <description>After enrollment in the pharmacokinetic period, patients were maintained on their usual dose of tacrolimus twice daily on Day 1 through Day 14 and on Day 15 were converted to tacrolimus modified release (MR) once-daily in the morning for 14 days, converted back to tacrolimus twice daily for 14 days and then converted back to tacrolimus MR formulation once-daily in the morning for 14 days, all based on a 1:1 mg for mg total daily dose conversion. The extended treatment period began on day 57 and consisted of a single dose of tacrolimus extended-release formulation once every morning through the end of the study.
Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain the target tacrolimus trough level within the range of 5 to 20 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>

          <title>Grade of Biopsy-confirmed Acute Rejection Episodes</title>
          <description>Biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) is defined as an episode of acute liver allograft rejection that was confirmed by biopsy results and was Banff grade ≥ I. Biopsies were graded by the clinical site pathologist according to the 1997 Banff criteria for grading of acute liver allograft rejection: Indeterminate: Portal inflammatory infiltrate that fails to meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute rejection; Grade I (Mild): Rejection infiltrate in a minority of the triads that is generally mild and confined within the portal spaces; Grade II (Moderate): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads; Grade III (Severe): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads, with spillover into periportal areas and moderate to severe perivenular inflammation that extends into the hepatic parenchyma and is associated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis. For participants with more than one biopsy-confirmed acute rejection episode, the worst case grade is reported.</description>
