  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, tolerability and safety of oral
      topiramate for the preventative management of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. It is believed that
      topiramate will decrease the frequency, duration and severity of attacks experienced by
      children and adolescents with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome.

      There is very little controlled data on the preventative treatment for Cyclic Vomiting
      Syndrome. The existing evidence consists of small, retrospective clinical series that
      evaluate symptomatic responses to five medications including cyproheptadine, propranolol,
      amitriptyline, phenobarbital and pizotifen (n &gt;10). These published data consist of
      uncontrolled or retrospective reports. In addition, varying inclusion criteria and outcomes
      (i.e. obtained by family recall) were used in these studies limiting the basis upon which to
      compare relative effectiveness.

      During the prospective baseline period, the subject will maintain cyclical vomiting records
      in which all headache occurrences will be recorded and characterized. (Cyclical vomiting
      records will be maintained throughout the study). The purpose of this study is to assess the
      effectiveness, tolerability and safety of oral topiramate for the preventative management of
      Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome using a prospective design, established diagnostic criteria (ICHD
      2004), and defined, objective primary and secondary endpoints.
