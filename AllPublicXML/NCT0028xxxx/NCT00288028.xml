      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving bortezomib after an autologous peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant may stop the growth of any cancer cells that remain after transplant.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib in
      treating patients with multiple myeloma who have undergone an autologous peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib during maintenance phase after
           high-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in
           patients with multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of bortezomib in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate, complete response rate, and response duration in
           patients treated with bortezomib at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-finding study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 or 28 days
      for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive de-escalating doses of bortezomib (at varying dosing
      schedules) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At
      least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Bortezomib is administered as a 5 second IV bolus on days 1, 4, 8,11 or 1,8 and 15 of a 21-35 days cycle (Depending on the Dosing schedule). The dosage will be calculated based on actual weight of the patient unless the actual weight is greater than 40% above the ideal body weight. In this instance the dosage will be based on the adjusted ideal body weight. The Adjusted IBW (kg) = IBW + 0.25 x (actual body weight - IBW). The dosage will be adjusted based on the safety and toxicity profile, until a MTD is determined.</description>
