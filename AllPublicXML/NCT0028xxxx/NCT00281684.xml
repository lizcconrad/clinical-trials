    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a multi centre, randomised, single-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled, single oral dose study with a positive control arm. Patients previously
      scheduled for 3rd molar tooth extraction, who are otherwise healthy, will be recruited. Upon
      completion of surgery, e.g. prior to established pain, patients will be randomised to
      treatment (SB-706598, placebo or co-codamol) and dosed with the study medication

    <measure>Weighted mean of the change from Baseline (randomization) in pain intensity (i.e. pain intensity difference) over the 10 hours post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to 10 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS). These assessments were then summarized to give a weighted mean score. The VAS was a subjective assessment of post-operative pain intensity. The participants rated the pain intensity at the time of assessment by marking a line on a 100 millimeter (mm) (0 to 100 mm) long scale. A line placed on the extreme left (0 mm) indicated no pain and extreme right (100 mm) indicated worst pain imaginable. This scale has no subscales. The Baseline (Day 1) value was the value obtained immediately prior to administration of study drug. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Pain Intensity Based on the Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) up to 10 hours post Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 hours post Baseline (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was assessed using VRS. Participants also used a 4-point categorical VRS for the subjective assessment of postoperative pain. The score and it corresponding intensity was such that 0= no pain, 1= mild, 2= moderate and 3= severe. The VRS was collected as an independent measure of the participant's pain and was not prospectively correlated to the study participant's numerical score (number of millimeters) on the VAS. Participants were provided with a worksheet with a list of adjectives to read and they were asked to select the word by checking the box that best described their level of pain. The number associated with the adjective chosen by the participant constituted the pain intensity. Baseline (Day 1) value was the value obtained immediately prior to administration of study drug. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>

    <time_frame>Prior to first rescue medication use and at 10 and 24 hours post randomisation.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants subjectively assessed their overall impression (global evaluation) of the study medication using a 4-point categorical scale, where 1= poor, 2= fair, 3= good and 4= excellent. Participants were provided with a list of adjectives and were asked to select the word by checking the box that best rated the study medication that they received for pain relief. The number associated with the adjective chosen by the participant constituted the global evaluation score. The study coordinator or designee transcribed the number corresponding to the selected adjective onto the case report form. The Global Evaluation was completed prior to receiving the first rescue medication, at 10 hours post-dose and prior to discharge from the unit.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events (AE) over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Follow up (14 days)</time_frame>
    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>ECGs were recorded with the participant lying supine, having rested in this position for at least 5 minutes before each recording. Full 12 lead ECGs were recorded using an ECG device that automatically calculated the heart rate and measured PR, QRS, RR, QT and QT, QT corrected by Bazett's formula (QTcB) and QT corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) intervals. Paper ECG traces were recorded at a standard paper speed of 25 millimeter/second and gain of 1mVolt/10 millimeter, using 2.5x4 format with lead II rhythm strip. Cardiac intervals were checked by a physician and then transcribed into the case report form. Number of participants with abnormal (not clinically significant [NCS] and clinically significant [CS]) ECG findings are presented.</description>

             method of contraception (see below).

          -  Females of non-child bearing potential are defined as:

          -  Post-menopausal females, being amenorrhoeic for at least 2 years with an appropriate
             clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms. However, if

             protocol.

          -  Subject is scheduled for outpatient surgical removal of up to four third molar teeth
             under local anesthesia. At least one third molar tooth must be a fully or partially
             impacted in the mandible requiring bone removal;

          -  Subject agrees not to take analgesics other than protocol defined rescue analgesics
             during treatment (up to 24 hrs post dose)

             surgery;

          -  Subject is unable to refrain from alcohol, psychoactive drugs, and sedatives including
             sleeping preparations (e.g . benzodiazepines) within 24 hours prior to the start of
             surgery and for the duration of their participation in the study

          -  Following screening (and 24 h Holter ECG) the subject has a significant abnormality
             that, in the opinion of the investigator makes them unsuitable for the study.

             medication.

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding, or have a positive serum pregnancy

             session.

          -  An unwillingness of the female subject to use an appropriate form of contraception.
             Appropriate forms of contraception are defined as:

          -  Abstinence - The lifestyle of the female should be such that there is complete
             abstinence from intercourse from at least the commencement of their last normal period
             prior to the first dose of study medication and to continue until the first normal
             period (defined as normal for the woman, both in terms of duration and quantity of
             menses) after treatment or 15 days after the last dose of medication, whichever is the
             longest.

          -  One of the following methods is acceptable as the sole method of contraception if
             there is indisputable data that it is &gt;99% effective otherwise it should be used with
             a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap {diaphragm or cervical/vault caps} used with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository):

          -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception from
             at least the commencement of their last normal period prior to the first dose of study
             medication. Subjects using hormonal contraception should use a barrier method in
             addition from the first dose of study medication until their next normal period
             following the end of the study.

          -  Documented tubal ligation.

          -  Documented placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).
