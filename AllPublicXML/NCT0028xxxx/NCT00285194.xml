      The collective effects of two-layer pancreas preservation, pretransplant islet culture, day
      -2 pretransplant immunosuppression, and induction immunosuppression with the FcR-nonbinding
      anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala)to facilitate diabetes reversal after
      single-donor islet transplantation.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, one-year follow-up study of type 1 diabetic islet allograft recipients
      who receive FcR non-binding OKT3 antibody hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala) plus sirolimus induction
      immunotherapy combined with sirolimus and delayed tacrolimus maintenance immunosuppression.
      Six subjects were transplanted.

      The premise behind the proposal is that hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala) corrects the imbalance between
      autoreactive and regulatory T cells and consequently prevents autoimmune destruction of
      transplanted islets. To prevent allorejection, hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala)was combined with sirolimus
      and delayed tacrolimus. Additionally, the safety and efficacy of the maintenance
      immunosuppressive regimen of sirolimus combined with tacrolimus was monitored.
