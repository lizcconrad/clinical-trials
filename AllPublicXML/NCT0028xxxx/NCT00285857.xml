      The study evaluates if a 6-month course of oral lovastatin at 80 mg/day (as 40 mg
      twice-a-day) would decrease abnormal breast duct cytology in women with a high inherited
      breast cancer risk. Breast duct cytology was assessed as hyperplasia or hyperplasia with
      atypia, as measured by random periareolar fine needle aspiration (rpFNA), of breast duct
      cells.

      A stratified analysis of this objective will be performed according to BRCA mutation status
      (absence or presence of an inherited deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation).

      Additional objectives of the study are to:

        -  Assess change in mammographic density, which is known to associate with breast cancer
           risk, before and after treatment with lovastatin

        -  Asess incidence of breast cancers and new high-risk breast lesions, including atypical
           hyperplasia, ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ, or radial scar.

        -  Assess change in other breast cancer risk-associated biomarkers in rpFNA specimens,
           including:

             -  Ki-67 (a marker of cell proliferation)

             -  Estrogen receptor (ER)

             -  Progesterone receptor (PR)

             -  HER/2-neu over-expression

             -  Susceptibility to DNA damage

    <measure>Change in the Incidence of Abnormal Breast Duct Cytology After Treatment With Lovastatin 80 mg/Day</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed on that basis of pre- and post-treatment evaluation with RPFNA (random periareolar fine needle aspiration). All subjects received a prescription for lovastatin 80 mg/day, to be taken as 40 mg twice-a-day.
Cytology was qualitatively and quantitatively, using the Masood semiquantitative scale to assign a number to each specimen, with higher numbers indicating increasing degrees of abnormality, as follows:
06-10 Non-proliferative breast disease (NPBD)
11-14 Proliferative breast disease without atypia (PBD-A)
15-18 Proliferative breast disease with atypia (PBD+A)
19-24 Carcinoma in situ and invasive cancer (CIS/IC)
If no cells could be obtained after multiple RPFNA attempts, the classification was acellular.
Change from NPBD to PBD-A was considered Unfavorable.
Change from NPBD to Acellular was considered Equivocal.
Change from PBD-A to NPBD was considered Favorable.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mammographic Density Before and After Treatment With Lovastatin 80 mg/Day</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bilateral mammography was performed at study entry (before lovastatin therapy) and at study conclusion (after lovastatin therapy) . Mammograms were assessed for a decline in mean breast density, using the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RAD) composition system for mammographic density assessment.

          <description>Assessed on that basis of pre- and post-treatment evaluation with RPFNA (random periareolar fine needle aspiration). All subjects received a prescription for lovastatin 80 mg/day, to be taken as 40 mg twice-a-day.
Cytology was qualitatively and quantitatively, using the Masood semiquantitative scale to assign a number to each specimen, with higher numbers indicating increasing degrees of abnormality, as follows:
06-10 Non-proliferative breast disease (NPBD)
11–14 Proliferative breast disease without atypia (PBD-A)
15–18 Proliferative breast disease with atypia (PBD+A)
19–24 Carcinoma in situ and invasive cancer (CIS/IC)
If no cells could be obtained after multiple RPFNA attempts, the classification was acellular.
Change from NPBD to PBD-A was considered Unfavorable.
Change from NPBD to Acellular was considered Equivocal.
Change from PBD-A to NPBD was considered Favorable.</description>
