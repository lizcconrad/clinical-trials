  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ranibizumab is derived from a murine monoclonal anti- vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) antibody and can penetrate through the many retinal cell layers following intravitreal
      injection. The present study is directed towards the assessment of ranibizumab administered
      on the same day in combination with verteporfin in patients with subfoveal CNV secondary to
      ARMD

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 50 years of age or greater who have provided written informed consent

               -  Patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization lesions secondary to AMD,
                  either predominantly classic or occult with no classic component

               -  Patients who have a BCVA score between 73 and 24 letters, inclusively, in the
                  study eye using ETDRS (approximately 20/40 to 20/320)

               -  Willing to return for all scheduled visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Patients who have a BCVA of &lt; 34 letters in both eyes (legally blind is defined as
             bilateral vision below 20/200 or less than 34 letters)

          -  Prior treatment in the study eye with verteporfin, external-beam radiation therapy,
             subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy, or transpupillary thermotherapy

          -  Previous participation in a clinical trial (for either eye) involving anti-angiogenic
             drugs (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, anecortave acetate, protein kinase C inhibitors, etc.)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
