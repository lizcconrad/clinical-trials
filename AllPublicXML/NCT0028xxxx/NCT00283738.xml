  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of PFO closure with
      the BioSTAR Septal Repair Implant System in a population of patients that have refractory
      migraine (with aura) and who have failed medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last five years, transcatheter and surgical closure of PFO in the cyrptogenic
      stroke and TIA population has grown in frequency world-wide. Observational retrospective
      reports, from both single and multi-center experiences of over 400 patients, suggest Patent
      Foramen Ovale (PFO) closure to reduce the risk of recurrent migraine events in these
      populations may be beneficial, particularly for those patients in the migraine with aura
      subgroup. Although none of these reports are from prospective, randomized, controlled trials,
      the reports are compelling enough in their totality to support further investigation of a
      well defined group in a prospective manner. The patients reported in these studies were
      brought to PFO closure with no expectation of their procedure having any impact on their
      migraine. In fact, in many cases, the discovery of a history of migraine was not made until
      well after the PFO closure procedure.

      This clinical trial will prospectively compare the safety and effectiveness of PFO closure
      with the BioSTAR device to a control arm. Patients will be followed one year post-implant.
