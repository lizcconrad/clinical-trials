      1. Vancomycin is a drug that requires precise dosing and close monitoring to avoid drug
           toxicity.

        2. There is limited data on the change of vancomycin pharmacokinetics in patients who need
           extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

        3. This control trial is to understand:

             1. whether the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin is influenced by the use ECMO

             2. design the most appropriate dose of vancomycin in adult patients using ECMO.

      1. Vancomycin is a drug that requires precise dosing and close monitoring to avoid drug
           toxicity.

        2. Oftentimes it is used in intensive care units (ICU) for patients who need a life-saving
           machine for heart and lung failure called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

        3. There is limited data on the change of vancomycin pharmacokinetics in these patients.

        4. This is a control trial using ICU patients who need vancomycin but not ECMO as a control
           to understand:

             1. whether the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin is influenced by the use ECMO

             2. design the most appropriate dose of vancomycin in adult patients using ECMO.

        5. After the 4th dose of vancomycin, blood was drawn at appropriate time spots (1 mL each)
           to determine the time concentration curve and to calculate the pharmacokinetic
           parameters for 2 groups of patients to determine if there is any difference.
