  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III study designed to evaluate the response (shrinkage or lack of growth) of
      tumors of lapatinib plus paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel plus placebo as first line
      metastatic treatment in women and men who have metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be
      evaluated for safety and efficacy. Countries include China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Brazil and
      Peru.

      Patients must with Her2+(ErbB2+) MBC Stage IV, newly diagnosed will receive
      paclitaxel+lapatinib or paclitaxel plus placebo for 6 cycles minimum. After 6 cycles continue
      to receive blinded monotherapy until progression. Safety evaluations include evaluating
      adverse events, hematology/ chemistry tests, vital signs, and cardiac muga scans. Efficacy
      assessments include evaluation of disease per RECIST. All patients followed for overall
      survival (OS).

      Study conducted in regions were access to trastuzumab is limited.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to disease progression or death (up to a maximum of Month 53)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression (radiological or clinical assessment of symptomatic progression) or death due to any cause, if sooner during the randomized phase. Disease progression is based on the assessments by the investigator.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization to disease progression or death (up to a maximum of Month 53)</time_frame>
    <description>OR, evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), is defined as the number of participants achieving either a confirmed complete response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD) of tumor, which were based on confirmed responses from the investigator assessment of best OR during the randomized phase. Participants with unknown or missing responses were treated as non-responders.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to disease progression or death (up to a maximum of Month 53)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit is defined as the number of participants achieving either a confirmed CR or PR or stable disease (neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease [at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions], taking as reference the smallest sum LD since treatment start) of &gt;=24 weeks, based on confirmed responses from the investigator assessment of best overall response during the randomized phase.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization to disease progression or death (up to a maximum of Month 53)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined for the subset of participants with a confirmed CR or PR as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression (radiological or clinical assessment of symptomatic progression) or death due to any cause during the randomized phase. Only participants with a confirmed CR or PR were included in this analysis. Disease progression is based on the assessments by the investigator.</description>

    <description>The original outcome measure to be analyzed was time to response; however, data are presented as the number of participants with a response at each nominal visit. Responses are based on the investigator's assessment, and only participants with a confirmed CR or PR were included in this analysis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>At the time of disease progression, participants had the option to be unblinded. Participants (pts) who were on placebo+paclitaxel could continue in an open-label lapatinib monotherapy extension phase until further progression or an unacceptable toxicity. All participants were followed for survival. The unblinding was performed by a third party.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Number of participants with any visceral metastatic disease and with only non-visceral disease</title>
          <description>Metastasis is defined as the spread of a tumor or cancerous cells from the primary site to one or more sites elsewhere in the body. Visceral metastasis is defined as the spread of cancer to viscera, the internal organs of the body, specifically those within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas, or intestines). Non-visceral organs are defined as any organ not considered visceral.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. GSK supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>
