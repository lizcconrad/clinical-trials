    <textblock>
      Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in
      perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly
      passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have
      identified some autoregulatory capacity of the human choroid. In the brain and the retina the
      mechanism behind autoregulation is most likely linked to changes in transmural pressure. In
      this model arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the vessel
      and outside the vessel. In the choroid, several observations argue against a direct
      involvement of arterioles. In a previous project we were able to identify that the nitric
      oxide (NO) - system as well as the endothelin system are involved in choroidal blood flow
      regulation during isometric exercise.

      In the present study autoregulation of the choroid during isometric exercise will be
      investigated and the pressure/flow relationships will be observed in the absence or presence
      of a calcium antagonist - nifedipine.
