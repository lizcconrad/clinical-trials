      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of aripiprazole in the treatment of acutely
      relapsed patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with
      risperidone as an active control.

    <textblock>
      Medical treatment of schizophrenia uses antipsychotic drugs, which ameliorate the acute
      episodes and probably prevent or decrease the risk of occurrence of new episodes. Most
      antipsychotics share the ability to block postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors of the D2
      subtype.

      The typical antipsychotics (such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine) ameliorate acute episodes
      and possibly prevent or decrease the risk of occurrence of new episodes, but they have
      minimal effectiveness against negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and cognitive impairment,
      which often lead to poor social functioning. Its full Dopamine antagonism is often associated
      with a number of well-recognized debilitating side effects. One example is EPS. A new class
      of antipsychotics, the atypical agents (such as clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine), became
      available starting in the late-1980s. Their mode of action affects both the serotonin and
      dopamine (DA) receptors. They are better tolerated than the typical antipsychotics with
      regard to EPS, except at higher doses. The improvement in the side effect profile seen with
      the atypical antipsychotics is accompanied by efficacy against positive symptoms and perhaps
      some improvement in efficacy against negative symptoms. Although they offer better efficacy
      and lower rates of EPS compared to typical agents, they are associated with other side
      effects that may be of clinical concern. For example, olanzapine and clozapine have an
      increased incidence of weight gain and diabetes mellitus, risperidone is associated with
      hyperprolactinemia, and ziprasidone is associated with ECG QT interval prolongation. In
      addition to tolerability issues, a significant proportion of patients still do not adequately
      respond to these newer agents. A need still exists for efficacious alternatives that
      demonstrate improved tolerability and side effect profiles so as to enhance treatment
      compliance and long-term functioning.

      Aripiprazole is a novel DA-serotonin stabilizer approved in U.S. for the management of
      schizophrenia. The unique mode of action of aripiprazole translates into efficacy against
      psychotic symptoms and a more favorable safety profile than current treatment. Its
      introduction will clearly provide patients and their families with a much-needed alternative
      to the antipsychotics currently available.

      This study further examined the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in patients having acute
      relapse of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in Taiwan. The duration of this study
      was 4 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis: Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, in an acute relapse.

          -  Duration of present episode/relapse: Randomization to this study occurred no more than
             four weeks following the day of initiation of any treatment for the last
             episode/relapse.

          -  Age: 18 to 65 years.

          -  Gender: Males and females (females of childbearing potential had a negative serum
             pregnancy test from screening visit, used acceptable contraception, and were not
             pregnant or lactating).

          -  Response to previous antipsychotic agents: Patients had responded to previous
             antipsychotic medication

          -  Current antipsychotic treatment: Prior to beginning the placebo-washout, patients had
             not been treated with a long-acting antipsychotic within the time required for one
             cycle of treatment with that long-acting antipsychotic, plus one week. Patients who
             had been treated with a long-acting antipsychotic within less than this time period
             might be enrolled in the study, providing they were judged by the investigator to be
             clearly clinically deteriorating.

          -  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores: Patients had a total PANSS score of at
             least 60. In addition, patients had a score of at least 4 on any two of the four PANSS
             items that constitute a psychotic items subscale.

          -  Compliance with the protocol: Patients were rated reliably on the battery of
             psychiatric and movement rating scales required by the protocol.

          -  Informed Consent: Patients eligible to enter the study signed an informed consent form
             prior to the initiation of any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, had serious suicidal ideation or
             patients who were liable to serious suicide attempt, by clinical judgment.

          -  Patients presented with a first episode of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder

             'cerebral palsy' or any condition that required intermittent or maintenance treatment,
             or which was manifested by any abnormality on neurological examination.

          -  Patients who continued to take, or who potentially needed to take, during the
             double-blind portion of this study, any of the following concomitant medications,
             which could cause unwanted drug-to-drug interactions or which could confound the
             analysis of antipsychotic effectiveness of the randomly assigned study drug:
             carbamazepine, valproic acid or sodium valproate or divalproate sodium, lithium
             carbonate or lithium citrate.

          -  Patients who failed to withdraw from fluoxetine treatment at least 28 days prior to

          -  Patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for psychoactive substance dependence or patients
             with a history of substance or alcohol dependence within one month prior to the
             beginning of the study.

          -  Patients had any somatic condition whose symptoms or physical signs could be
             misinterpreted as signs or symptoms of schizophrenia or as adverse effects from
             antipsychotic medications.

          -  Patients with any acute or unstable medical condition.

          -  Patients who had taken an investigational drug within the four weeks, which preceded

          -  Patients who were treatment-resistant.

          -  Patients who continued to take, or who potentially needed to take, during this study,
             any medication or substance that is known to be an inhibitor of the microsomal enzyme
