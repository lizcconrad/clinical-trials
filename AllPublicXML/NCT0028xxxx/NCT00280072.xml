      -  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the RAD to determine
           whether the RAD is effective in reducing mortality in patients with Acute Renal Failure
           due to Acute Tubule Necrosis and to evaluate the safety of the RAD

        -  If the RAD works normally when used for as long as 72 hours

        -  If the RAD will provide added benefits to normal CVVH therapy for patients with Acute
           Renal Failure

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Renal Failure (ARF)is a severe inflammatory disease state often accompanied by
      Multi-Organ Failure (MOF) and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). ARF is
      precipitated by many factors and is most often linked to the loss of kidney tubule cell
      function. Patients with ARF are treated in the intensive care units of hospitals and recovery
      of renal function is vitally important to their survival. Current therapy for ARF involves
      conventional kidney support with continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT). Despite
      advances in treating patients with CRRT, ARF has an extremely high mortality rate (55-70%)
      and requires extensive hospital stays, predominantly in the ICU. The RAD is designed to both
      treat ARF with MOF and/or SIRs and facilitate the natural recovery of a patient's own kidney
      function. The RAD is intended for use for short periods of time in conventional
      extracorporeal therapeutic systems that are already available in the hospital. The RAD
      therapy operates outside the body, and is designed to mimic the structure and function of the
      natural kidney. In this manner it is intended to replace the missing metabolic, endocrine,
      and immunologic functions of the kidney and allow time for the patient's own kidneys to
      resume normal functions.
