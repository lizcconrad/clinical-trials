      Device: computerized physician order entry.

      We wanted to investigate if the introduction of a computerized intensive care unit system
      reduced the incidence and severity of medication prescription errors (MPEs). A prospective
      trial was conducted during 5 weeks in a paper-based unit versus a computerized unit. The
      registration of different classes of MPEs was done by a clinical pharmacist. An independent
      panel evaluated the severity of MPEs.
