  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to identify factors which are associated with
      periods of high ventricular arrhythmia burden. This will be performed by analysis of gene
      expression from peripheral blood samples.

      This is a study of patients with ICD implants who present with multiple(&gt;2), low-level(1-2)
      or inappropriate therapies to their defibrillator. The purpose of this pilot study is to
      identify factors which are associated with periods of high ventricular arrhythmia burden by
      looking at gene expression from peripheral blood, in addition to levels of known markers of
      CHF, including catecholamine levels, B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin. This study
      hypothesizes that extrinsic or systemic factors play a role in triggering these events, and
      if true should yield candidate proteins which would spawn functional studies to prove a role
      in causation. Additionally, identification of a marker of increased recurrence of events may
      aid in guiding therapy (starting an anti-arrhythmic versus awaiting the next event).

      6 RNA samples are obtained and kept frozen on-site to be evalauted at a later date. A portion
      of this DNA will be used to analyze the structure of certain genes that are known to play a
      role in cardiac arrhythmias. We cannot at this time know exatly what genes will be tested.
