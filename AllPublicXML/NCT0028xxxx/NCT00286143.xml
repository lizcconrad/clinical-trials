      The study exams whether adding an opioid to the epidural infusion of a local anesthetic in
      neonates will significantly improve the quality of the postoperative analgesia.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the best pain medication to be infused in the
      epidural catheter. At CHOP, the medication infused in the epidural catheter following a chest
      operation in neonates is a local anesthetic (bupivacaine). However, even with this continuous
      infusion, neonates still require multiple doses of intravenous opioids (i.e. morphine)
      because of persistent or constant pain. The administration of intravenous opioids in neonates
      can have many side effects, such as respiratory depression (reduced breathing rate),
      sedation, urinary retention (inability to pass urine), itching, nausea and vomiting It has
      been well documented that by adding a small dose of any opioid to a local anesthetic given
      through an epidural catheter, the feeling of postoperative pain can be significantly improved
      in older children and in adults. It is not known whether the addition of an opioid to a local
      anesthetic is beneficial in neonates. In this study, we are comparing the standard local
      anesthetic (bupivacaine) with a combination of bupivacaine and a small dose of an opioid
      (fentanyl).

      This is a randomized study and the type of medication given into the epidural catheter will
      be chosen on the day of the operation by a random drawing (like flipping a coin). Your child
      could receive one of the following:

        1. bupivacaine 0.1%

        2. bupivacaine 0.1% with fentanyl 2mcg/ml Neither you nor your doctors will know which arm
           of the study your child is in. In case of emergency, the pharmacy can tell your doctor
           what medication your child is receiving.
