      1. The aim of this large scale study to survey the prevalence of nutritional risk and
           malnutrition in China,Europe and USA.

        2. The impact of nutritional support for the patients at nutritional risk on clinical
           outcomes and cost-effectiveness

      Already get the approval by Ethics Committee of Peking Union medical college and Johns
      Hopkins Hospital.

      Although it was often to hear that malnutrition ratio in Aisa hospitalized patient was
      40%-70% , there was no evidence to elaborate the prevalence of nutritional risk and
      malnutrition on hospitalized patients of Asia. Also in USA no data for nutritional risk. In
      2002, scientists group headed by Kondrup from : European Society for Parenteral and Enteral
      Nutrition demonstrated that randomized controlled clinical trials showed patients may get
      benefit from nutrition support when they with nutrition risk. Based on these evidences, a
      simpler method was established by European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition in
      year 2002 in Munich &amp; it was demonstrated useful to evaluate the appropriate use of nutrition
      support at present time. This method was named as Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS).

      We propose to survey the prevalence of malnutrition &amp; nutrition risk in large cities'
      large/middle size hospitalized patients in China, Europe and USA use NRS tool. As well, we
      also aim to figure out the current nutrition support status in current large/middle size
      hospitals through this survey.

      we also propose to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of parenteral nutrition, enteral nutrition
      and non-nutritional support, and to examine the clinical outcomes of nutritional support in
      certain patients at nutritional risk identified by NRS-2002.

      For international cooperation,our partners are Professor Kondrup of Europe and Professor
      Nolan from Johns Hopkins Hospital,there are students from a cooperative project with Johns
      Hopkins Hospital for Doctor of Philosophy students 2005-2011.

      In plan this protocol might be completed around 2016 also.

    <description>A infectious complication was defined as as the presence of recognized pathogens in body tissues that normally are sterile, confirmed by the results of culture and supported by clinical, radiologic or hematologic evidence of infection</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cost effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>Observation will be carried from admitting end until discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The cost effectiveness analysis was performed from the payers' perspective.The percentage of infectious complication-free patients was used to measure the effectiveness. The total cost was considered to contain 3 items in our study. The first item was the cost of nutrition support, including nutrition solutions, nursing, physician, and other staff supervision of nutrition support preparation, administration, and catheter placement and maintenance. The second item was the cost of the infectious complication.The third item was 'other costs' associated with the hospital admission, calculated from the total costs from which the cost of nutrition support and infectious complications were subtracted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the costs difference between the nutrition support cohort and no-nutrition support cohort by their difference in effectiveness.</description>
