    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan is an effective
      and safe treatment of thermal burns and non-injured skin where skin grafts are harvested.

      Hypothesis: Soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan will through its immunomodulating activities improve
      wound healing of thermal burns and non-injured skin where skin grafts are harvested.

      In severe cases, burn patients commonly exhibit a clinical picture of systemic inflammation
      with a variety of manifestations ranging from the presence of tachycardia, tachypnea, fever
      and leukocytosis, and may progress to refractory hypotension. Shock and multiple organ system
      dysfunction may subsequently occur. Sepsis, caused by infection or bacteremia, is also a
      common occurrence and a major complication in burn patients.

      After cooling the burned area, pain control is important. Local burn wound care starts with
      cleansing the wound followed by application of topical agents to prevent infection. Such
      agents may have adverse local or systemic effects and may impede on the wound healing process
      itself. The use of synthetic or biologic materials for wound covering is becoming
      increasingly popular, but most of the clinical information about efficacy of such products
      are anecdotal.

      A primary objective in burn care is to have all wounds healed within 1 month. With longer
      healing periods, there is an increasing likelihood of developing hypertropic scaring and
      alterations in pigmentation. The development of an effective wound healing agent would
      therefore be highly beneficial for the suffering patient in terms of decreased healing time
      and improved cosmetic results.
