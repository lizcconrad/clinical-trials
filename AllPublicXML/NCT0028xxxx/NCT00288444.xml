      1. To determine the safety and toxicity of intravenous docetaxel, administered on a weekly
           schedule (3 weeks out of 4), in combination with oral lonafarnib, administered on a
           daily schedule, in patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid tumor
           malignancies which are refractory to the standard of care.

        2. To determine the pharmacokinetic interaction between docetaxel and lonafarnib.

        3. To determine the molecular interaction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between
           docetaxel and lonafarnib

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:.1.1 Patient must have a pathologically-confirmed locally advanced or
        metastatic solid tumor malignancy demonstrated to be refractory to the standard of care,
        with tumors accessible by needle or surgical biopsy.

        3.1.2 Only patients determined to be at minimal risk to receiving the biopsy (with tumor
        location/accessibility as well as underlying patient comorbidities judged to allow a
        minimal risk biopsy by the radiologist/surgeon performing the procedure) will be eligible
        for this study.

        3.1.3 Patient must have an ECOG performance status of 2 or less.

        3.1.4 Patient must have a life-expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

        3.1.5 Patient must have adequate bone marrow function: WBC ≥ 3,000 cells/mm3, ANC ≥ 1,500

        steroids, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin (rifampcin), and sulfinpyrazone.

        Patient must have a pathologically-confirmed

        Exclusion Criteria:

        3.2.1 Patient has received more than three previous chemotherapy regimens.

        3.2.2 Patient is pregnant or breast feeding.

        3.2.3 Patient has signs of symptoms of acute infection requiring systemic therapy.

        3.2.4 Patient exhibits confusion, disorientation, or has a history of major psychiatric
        illness which may impair the patient's understanding of the informed consent.

        3.2.5 Patient's life expectancy is less than 12 weeks.

        3.2.6 Patient has &gt; Grade 1 neurotoxicity from previous anticancer treatment or significant
        neuropathy from any cause.

        3.2.7 Patient requires total parenteral nutrition with lipids.

        3.2.8 Inability to swallow the lonafarnib BID.

        3.2.9 Patient has a history of uncontrolled heart disease (including clinically significant
        coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and symptomatic or uncontrolled
        arrythmias).

        3.2.10 Patient has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other
        drugs formulated with polysorbate 80. Symptoms include: any reaction such as bronchospasm,
        generalized urticaria, systolic BP ≤ 80mm Hg, and angioedema.
