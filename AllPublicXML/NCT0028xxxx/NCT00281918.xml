  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab to
      see how well they work compared to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in treating patients with
      B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

A marrow sample had to be normocellular for age with less than 30% lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules had to be absent.

        <description>CR is defined by at least 8 weeks of: 1)Absence of lymphadenopathy 2)No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly 3)Absence of B-symptoms 4)Normal blood count 5)Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 8 weeks after the clinical and laboratory results demonstrated that a CR was achieved. A marrow sample had to be normocellular for age with less than 30% lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules had to be absent. If marrow was hypocellular,a repeat biopsy was taken 4 weeks later and samples were re-reviewed in conjunction with the prior pathology. DFS was calculated from time of CR to relapse or death.

        <title>Final Analysis: Time to Disease-free Survival (DFS) Event in Participants With Complete Response (CR)</title>
        <description>CR is defined by at least 8 weeks of: 1)Absence of lymphadenopathy 2)No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly 3)Absence of B-symptoms 4)Normal blood count 5)Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 8 weeks after the clinical and laboratory results demonstrated that a CR was achieved. A marrow sample had to be normocellular for age with less than 30% lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules had to be absent. If marrow was hypocellular,a repeat biopsy was taken 4 weeks later and samples were re-reviewed in conjunction with the prior pathology. DFS was calculated from time of CR to relapse or death</description>
