      Efficacy Study - We will use stratified block randomization based on race to ensure that the
      treatment groups maintain comparable race composition. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of the intervention groups or to usual care. Intervention Group 1 will receive, by
      mail, a DVD version of the interactive computer program; based on responses to its queries,
      the program will supply immediate feedback to promote mammography. Intervention Group 2 will
      receive a telephone version of the tailored intervention delivered by a counselor stationed
      at a computer. The counselor will use questions from the interactive program and deliver
      messages the program generates in response to each woman's answers. A third group will
      receive usual care. All women will be asked to participate in 6-month and 21-month follow-up
      telephone interviews querying stage of mammography adherence and beliefs.
