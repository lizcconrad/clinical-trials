  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A maximum of 60 subjects will be enrolled in the trial. It is a non-randomized, open label,
      single center study. All subjects undergo INGN 201 injection and IV chemotherapy: doxorubicin
      and docetaxel. This is done on the first 2 days of a 3-week cycle. After completion of 4 to 6
      cycles, the subject either proceeds to surgery if the tumors respond to therapy, or goes off
      study if there is no tumor response.
