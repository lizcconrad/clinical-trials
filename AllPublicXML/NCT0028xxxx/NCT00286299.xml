  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates treatment effects from aerobic endurance training, maximal strength
      training and computer game on aerobic capacity, work efficiency and psychiatric symptoms in
      patients suffering from schizophrenia. The study is a controlled trial. The aim is to
      describe the population in respect to aerobic capacity and muscular strength. Low aerobic
      capacity and muscular strength are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      The study also aim to evaluate physical and psychiatric effects from physical training.
      Effects from participation in physical training or computer game on symptoms, depression and
      quality of life will be investigated. Data will be collected between October 2005 and August
      2007.

    <arm_group_label>Aerobic interval training (AIT)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>AIT is 4x4 minutes interval training on a treadmill at 85 to 95 % HRpeak interspersed with 3 min of active resting periods at a work load corresponding to 70 % HRpeak between each interval. Patients performed the intervals walking or running with a minimum of 5 % inclination.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Maximal strength training (MST)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>MST is performed in a leg press machine. The weight is lowered in a controlled manner in the eccentric phase until the patient reached 90 degrees in the knee joint. Then the patients has a short stop (~0.5 second) before the weight is moved as rapidly as possible to complete extension. The training volume is 4 sets of 4RM (i.e. 85-90 % 1RM). The training load is increased with 2.5-5 kg each time patients managed to perform 4 sets with the determined load or each training session.</description>

    <description>The AIT group trains 4x4 minute interval training on a treadmill at 85-95 % HRpeak interspersed with 3 minutes of active resting periods at a work load corresponding to 70% HRpeak between each interval. All training sessions are monitored and start with a 6 minute warm-up and end with a 5 minute cool-down period at a work load corresponding to 70% HRpeak. Intervals are performed walking or running on a treadmill with a minimum of 5% inclination, 3 times per week for 8 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Computer game training (CG)</intervention_name>
    <description>The CG spend the same amount of time (36 minutes), training to improve their ability in the computer game, Tetris. Tetris is a game where small shapes called Tetraminoes fall from the top of the Playfield to the bottom. Players must rotate the Tetraminoes as they fall and fit them together to complete lines. When the player fills an entire line with blocks, that line is removed from the screen. If the player cannot complete lines, the blocks will eventually rise past the top of the screen, and the game ends.</description>

    <description>Training starts with a 10 minute warm-up on the treadmill. Maximal strength training is then performed in an inclined leg press machine. The subject lifts 4 maximal repetitions that are repeated 4 times after a 2 minute rest period. Subjects are instructed to lift the weight with an intention of maximal mobilization of force. Training load is increased each time the subject manage to perform 4x4 maximal repetitions. Training is carried out 3 times per week in 8 weeks.</description>
