    <textblock>
      Atomoxetine (Strattera) is a drug that is currently approved for treatment of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults. Atomoxetine works to enhance
      levels of brain chemicals that may be affected in people with executive dysfunction,
      (difficulties with organization, task completion, and priority setting). Thus, atomoxetine
      has the potential to improve executive dysfunction in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      The goal of this study is to provide preliminary data on the effectiveness and tolerability
      of atomoxetine for the treatment of executive dysfunction in patients with PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD), while defined by its motor abnormalities and associated
      dopaminergic loss, is invariably accompanied by cognitive impairment. Early in the disease
      course, the deficits are characterized by executive dysfunction with difficulties on tasks
      that involve information processing, attention, sorting, planning, set-shifting, and working
      memory and are subserved by neural connections with prefrontal brain regions. There has been
      little effort to identify treatments for these PD-related cognitive impairments, despite
      their disabling and distressing effects. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to conduct
      a small pilot study to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of atomoxetine, a
      selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of executive dysfunction in
      patients with PD.

      Atomoxetine (Strattera) is currently approved by the FDA for treatment of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults. Atomoxetine enhances dopaminergic and
      noradrenergic transmission in frontal regions that are also implicated in executive
      dysfunction and thus has the potential to improve executive dysfunction in PD as well as
      other neurological conditions. Results of the study will be used to develop a larger
      placebo-controlled trial of atomoxetine, if appropriate, as well as inform the design of
      other clinical trials on potential treatments for cognitive dysfunction in PD.

      The overall hypothesis is that atomoxetine will be an effective and safe treatment for
      executive dysfunction in PD.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change-Clinician Rated Score (CGIC-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGIC-C score is a clinician's rating of change (improvement or worsening) over the course of the trial in an individual's symptoms and their global impact on function and clinical status, i.e., the global impact of the intervention that the patient is better, unchanged, or worse). Scale ranges1 to 7 which equates to from very much worse to very much improved.
The CGIC-C score is not an appropriate baseline measure since it represents change after initiating an intervention. In addition, a baseline Clinical Global Impression of Severity-Clinician Rated Score (CGIS-C) is not appropriate to compare to CGIC-C, as a patient with severe disease might show clinically meaningful improvement (i.e., very much improved) from an intervention while still being severely affected on the CGIS-C score; by contrast, a patient with mild CGIS-C could have minimal or no change on the CGIC-C score. This study was not designed to assess the influence of disease severity on the primary outcome (CGIC-C).</description>

    <measure>Connors Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-Long Form (CAARS-L) Inattention/Memory Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAARS-L Inattention/Memory subscale, a primary self-rated outcome measure in this study, measures the frequency of behaviors associated with executive dysfunction, such as task incompletion, disorganization, distractibility, and difficulty planning, multi-tasking, and initiating tasks. CAARS-L scores are depicted as group Mean (SD) T scores, derived from comparison to CAARS norms based on gender and age in a normative sample. Similar to the FrSBE, higher T-scores are associated with greater symptom severity and T-scores above 65 represent symptoms of clinical significance.</description>

    <measure>Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale (FrSBe) Executive Function Subscore</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale (FrSBe) Executive Function subscore is on of the 3 subscales of the FrSBE, a scale designed to identify and quantify behavioral problems associated with frontal lobe dysfunction. The other subscales are Apathy and Disinhibition. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Totals are generated for each subscale and normative data is referenced (based on patient gender, age and education) and standardized T-scores are determined). For all FrSBe scales, T scores ≥ 65 are considered clinically significant and scores of 60 to 64 represent likely borderline impairment.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression of Change-Clinician Rated Score (CGIC-C)</title>
        <description>CGIC-C score is a clinician's rating of change (improvement or worsening) over the course of the trial in an individual's symptoms and their global impact on function and clinical status, i.e., the global impact of the intervention that the patient is better, unchanged, or worse). Scale ranges1 to 7 which equates to from very much worse to very much improved.
The CGIC-C score is not an appropriate baseline measure since it represents change after initiating an intervention. In addition, a baseline Clinical Global Impression of Severity-Clinician Rated Score (CGIS-C) is not appropriate to compare to CGIC-C, as a patient with severe disease might show clinically meaningful improvement (i.e., very much improved) from an intervention while still being severely affected on the CGIS-C score; by contrast, a patient with mild CGIS-C could have minimal or no change on the CGIC-C score. This study was not designed to assess the influence of disease severity on the primary outcome (CGIC-C).</description>

        <description>The CAARS-L Inattention/Memory subscale, a primary self-rated outcome measure in this study, measures the frequency of behaviors associated with executive dysfunction, such as task incompletion, disorganization, distractibility, and difficulty planning, multi-tasking, and initiating tasks. CAARS-L scores are depicted as group Mean (SD) T scores, derived from comparison to CAARS norms based on gender and age in a normative sample. Similar to the FrSBE, higher T-scores are associated with greater symptom severity and T-scores above 65 represent symptoms of clinical significance.</description>

        <description>Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale (FrSBe) Executive Function subscore is on of the 3 subscales of the FrSBE, a scale designed to identify and quantify behavioral problems associated with frontal lobe dysfunction. The other subscales are Apathy and Disinhibition. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Totals are generated for each subscale and normative data is referenced (based on patient gender, age and education) and standardized T-scores are determined). For all FrSBe scales, T scores ≥ 65 are considered clinically significant and scores of 60 to 64 represent likely borderline impairment.</description>
