    <textblock>
      This study will investigate Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)as a cause of sleep
      disturbance. Patients with GERD may experience all or some of the following symptoms: stomach
      acid or partially digested food re-entering the esophagus (which is sometimes referred to as
      heartburn or regurgitation) and belching. Even very small, unnoticeable amounts of rising
      stomach acid may cause patients to wake up during the night.

      This study will also investigate the effect of Rabeprazole, (brand name Aciphex) on patients
      with known insomnia. Rabeprazole is an FDA approved medication already marketed for the
      treatment of GERD.

      Participants with known insomnia will undergo an overnight pH and sleep study. Those found to
      be eligible after the first sleep study (those with significantly poor sleep quality and no
      significant sleep apnea) will be started on 2 weeks 20 mgs, twice-a-day, rabeprazole. Upon
      completion of the 2 week course of rabeprazole, subjects will repeat the overnight pH and
      sleep studies. Upon completion of these studies, participation is complete.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             undergoing initial sleep study,

          3. previous acid-suppressing medication for sleep disturbances,

          4. previous surgical antireflux procedure,

          5. current medical therapy that includes digoxin or ketoconazole,

          6. previous aerodigestive malignancy,

          7. a previously diagnosed psychological or medical cause of insomnia (other than
