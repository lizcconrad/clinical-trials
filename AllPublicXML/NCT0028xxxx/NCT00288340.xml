      The goal of the project is to characterize abnormalities in brain structure and function
      related to schizophrenia. The investigators will use advanced magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) techniques to measure the degree and distribution of neuronal activity during specific
      cognitive tasks, alterations in neuronal connectivity, and how these are related to disease
      symptoms and treatment.

      The goal of the project is to characterize abnormalities in brain structure and function
      related to schizophrenia. We will use advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to
      measure the degree and distribution of neuronal activity during specific cognitive tasks,
      alterations in neuronal connectivity, and how these are related to disease symptoms and
      treatment. We will focus on changes in brain structure and function associated with frequent
      auditory hallucinations, one of the most disabling manifestations of schizophrenia, and with
      neuroleptic treatment. In order to address these aims, we will study four groups of subjects:

        1. patients who have frequent auditory hallucinations,

        2. patients who are beginning a regimen of anti-psychotic medication,

        3. patients who do not have frequent hallucinations and are not changing medication
           strategies, and

        4. age-matched normal controls. Each group will contain 15 subjects for a total of 60.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Investigators will study subjects who:

          -  Are between the ages of 18 and 65.

          -  Meet diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric disorder with auditory hallucinations (at
             least one every 20 minutes) including schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder OR
             schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder without auditory hallucinations.

          -  Have been treated with an antipsychotic drug for hallucinations at least three months
             or are unmedicated

          -  Are willing to change their current antipsychotic medication if indicated

          -  Are able to provide written consent

        Normal controls must :

          -  Be between the ages of 18 and 65

          -  Not meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or
             other psychiatric disorder involving hallucinations

          -  Not currently be treated with an antipsychotic drug

          -  Be able to provide written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects and normal controls will be excluded from participation if there is:

          -  Evidence of non-psychiatric, chronic central nervous system (CNS) disease (such as
             brain injury or neurological disease)

          -  Contraindication to MRI, including prior claustrophobic reaction and severe movement
             disorder

          -  A recent change in menstrual status other than recent changes in oral or implanted
             contraceptive use (for females)

          -  A positive pregnancy result (for females)
