    <textblock>
      Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) of the oral mucosa is a common and painful condition.
      Despite advances in therapeutic means there is still necessary to find a way to alleviate the
      local pain and discomfort induced by the mucosal ulceration.

      The hypothesis was to study the effectiveness and acceptance of a herbal adhesive tablets in
      the treatment of RAS.

      Participants in the study will be examined for oral lesions, will be instructed how to apply
      the oral-tablet, and will be interviewed during the follow-up period up to one week after the
      application.
