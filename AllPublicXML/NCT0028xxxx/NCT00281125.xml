  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-arm, multicenter Phase IA/II dose-escalation study of PTK787 in
      combination with Pemetrexed alone (Cohort 1) or Pemetrexed and Cisplatin (Cohort 2).

      This study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) of PTK787 when administered in combination with Pemetrexed or Pemetrexed and
      Cisplatin, and to characterize the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, and PK profile of
      PTK787 in adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancers and mesotheliomas.

      This is an open-label, two-arm, multicenter Phase IA/II dose-escalation study of PTK787 in
      combination with Pemetrexed alone (Cohort 1) or Pemetrexed and Cisplatin (Cohort 2).

      This study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) of PTK787 when administered in combination with Pemetrexed or Pemetrexed and
      Cisplatin, and to characterize the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, and PK profile of
      PTK787 in adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancers and mesotheliomas.

      In cohort 1, PTK787 will be administered orally every 12 hours on days 2-42 of a 42-day
      cycle. In addition, Pemetrexed will be administered on days 1 and 22.

      In cohort 2, PTK787 will be administered orally every 12 hours on days 2-42 of a 42 day
      cycle. In addition, Pemetrexed will be administered on days 1 and 22. Thirty minutes after
      Pemetrexed administration, Cisplatin will be infused on days 1 and 22.

      In the current study, initially patients will be treated on Cohort 1 (Pemetrexed + PTK787).
      Once an MTD determination is made on this cohort (or PTK787 has been escalated to the maximum
      dose of 750 mg Q12h enrollment will begin on Cohort 2. At the MTD dose, both cohorts will be
      expanded to a minimum of 20 patients to determine additional safety of the combinations.
