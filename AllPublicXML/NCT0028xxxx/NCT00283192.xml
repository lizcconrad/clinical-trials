  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of FAST (a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled, trial of the
      effect of sertraline vs. placebo in reducing the incidence and severity of hot flushes in
      healthy women) is to determine if 6 weeks of treatment with sertraline (50mg daily for 2
      weeks, followed by 100mg per day for 4 weeks, if tolerated) results in a greater reduction in
      hot flush score (frequency * severity) compared to placebo among women with moderate to
      severe hot flashes. The secondary aim is to determine the effect of treatment with sertraline
      on quality of life, sleep, sexual function, and mood.

      The primary aim of FAST is to determine if 6 weeks of treatment with sertraline (50 mg daily
      for 2 weeks, followed by 100 mg per day for 4 weeks, if tolerated) results in greater
      reduction in hot flush score (frequency x severity), frequency and severity compared to
      placebo among women with moderate to severe hot flushes.

      The Secondary Aims:To determine the effect of treatment with sertraline on quality of life,
      sleep, sexual function, mood, and cognitive function. To determine if a modified, short
      version of a sexual function instrument is valid.
