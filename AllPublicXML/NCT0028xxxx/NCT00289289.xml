  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if specialized programs in the AT500 and EnRhythm
      pacemakers will reduce the number of irregular heartbeat in the upper chamber of the heart
      and reduce symptoms (such as shortness of breath, dizziness, and others).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to confirm the AT500 intervention pacing effectiveness data
      previously seen in the ASPECT clinical trial and to gather additional data to understand the
      effectiveness of the intervention pacing features. Specifically, the goal of the trial is to
      demonstrate a reduction in frequency in symptomatic atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation
      recurrence with the intervention pacing features in patients with a pacing indication and a
      history of atrial tachyarrhythmias with atrial pacing leads located in the region of
      Bachmann's Bundle.

    <measure>Rate of Symptomatic Atrial Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation Episodes Per Subject Per Month</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months (per Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of symptomatic atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation (AT/AF) episodes as measured by the Patient Assistant and retrieved from save-to-disk information. For each subject and programming period (3-9 month period and 9-15 month period), the rate of symptomatic AT/AF episodes was computed by summing the total number of Patient Assistant activations during device recorded AT/AF episodes divided by months of device follow-up in each study period. Within each subject, the ON minus OFF difference in rate of symptomatic AT/AF was computed</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate Subject Symptoms With the Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Symptom Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (per Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The AF symptom checklist (SCL) is a 16 item questionnaire measuring the frequency of 16 arrhythmia related symptoms such as tiredness/lack of energy, heart fluttering/skipping, heart racing, lightheadedness, etc. Symptom frequency is rated as never (scored as 0), rarely (scored as 1), sometimes (scored as 2), often (scored as 3), and always (scored as 4). Scores are summed across each subject and timepoint and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 64 (always symptoms). For each subject the 9 month and 15 months scores were summed respectively and ON minus OFF differences computed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Cardioversion (Changing an Abnormal Heart Rhythm Into a Normal One by Using Either Medication or Electrical Shock)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (per Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The dates of cardioversions attempted for atrial fibrillation (AF) since the previous study visit were collected at the 3, 9, and 15 month follow-up visits. For each randomized subject, the months to first attempted cardioversion during each randomized study period (3-9 months and 9-15 months) was determined. A repeated measures Cox proportional hazards model was used to compare the attempted cardioversion rate during periods of time where the pacing features were programmed ON versus OFF.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Atrial Tachycardia/Atrial Fibrillation (AT/AF) Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (per Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>AT/AF burden is defined as the sum of the duration of all atrial arrhythmias as recorded by the device divided by the device follow-up time during the programming period expressed as hours of atrial arrhythmia per day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with fast and/or slow heartbeats who are in need of dual chamber pacing
             (pacing in both the atria and ventricles) as determined by their doctor.

          -  Subjects who have a history of occasional fast heartbeats originating from the upper
             heart chambers.

          -  Subjects who have experienced at least two symptomatic episodes of fast heartbeats
             three months prior to enrollment.

          -  Subjects that are expected to stay on the same heart medications during the length
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have permanent (chronic) or persistent (not self-terminating) atrial
             fibrillation (fast heartbeats originating from the upper heart chambers).

          -  Subjects who have atrial fibrillation due to a reversible cause, i.e. electrolyte
             imbalance.

          -  Subjects who are current or immediate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
             recipients.

        <title>Evaluate Subject Symptoms With the Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Symptom Checklist</title>
        <description>The AF symptom checklist (SCL) is a 16 item questionnaire measuring the frequency of 16 arrhythmia related symptoms such as tiredness/lack of energy, heart fluttering/skipping, heart racing, lightheadedness, etc. Symptom frequency is rated as never (scored as 0), rarely (scored as 1), sometimes (scored as 2), often (scored as 3), and always (scored as 4). Scores are summed across each subject and timepoint and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 64 (always symptoms). For each subject the 9 month and 15 months scores were summed respectively and ON minus OFF differences computed.</description>
        <time_frame>6 months (per Intervention)</time_frame>
        <population>Of the 256 randomized subjects only 211 completed the AF symptom checklist at both the 9-month and 15-month visit. Since this was a crossover study, data from both visits was required for the subject to be included in the analysis</population>

          <title>Evaluate Subject Symptoms With the Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Symptom Checklist</title>
          <description>The AF symptom checklist (SCL) is a 16 item questionnaire measuring the frequency of 16 arrhythmia related symptoms such as tiredness/lack of energy, heart fluttering/skipping, heart racing, lightheadedness, etc. Symptom frequency is rated as never (scored as 0), rarely (scored as 1), sometimes (scored as 2), often (scored as 3), and always (scored as 4). Scores are summed across each subject and timepoint and range from 0 (no symptoms) to 64 (always symptoms). For each subject the 9 month and 15 months scores were summed respectively and ON minus OFF differences computed.</description>
          <population>Of the 256 randomized subjects only 211 completed the AF symptom checklist at both the 9-month and 15-month visit. Since this was a crossover study, data from both visits was required for the subject to be included in the analysis</population>
