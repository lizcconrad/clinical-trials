      This study will compare the effectiveness of either adding clonazepam or placebo to standard
      treatment or switching to venlafaxine in treating generalized social anxiety disorder in
      individuals who have not responded to treatment with sertraline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders,
      and often causes significant distress and dysfunction in affected individuals. Although
      currently available treatments for GSAD are effective, most individuals have residual
      symptoms after initial psychosocial or psychopharmacologic intervention. Further treatment is
      necessary for such individuals, but sufficient research has not been done to guide clinicians
      on what the safest and most effective next step may be. This study will compare the
      effectiveness of either combining clonazepam or placebo with sertraline or completely
      switching to venlafaxine in treating GSAD in individuals who have not responded to treatment
      with sertraline. This study will also examine predictors of treatment response, including
      factors such as age at disease onset, duration of illness, comorbidities, and genes that
      influence serotonin and catecholamine metabolism.

      Participants in this double-blind study will first partake in an initial 10-week phase in
      which they will be treated with sertraline. Participants who do not respond to sertraline
      treatment will proceed to phase two of the study, in which they will be randomly assigned to
      one of three treatment groups. One group will receive both sertraline and clonazepam, another
      group will receive both sertraline and placebo, and the third group will receive only
      venlafaxine. All treatments will continue for 12 weeks. Sertraline and venlafaxine are both
      FDA-approved for the treatment of GSAD. Clonazepam is widely used for the treatment of
      anxiety, but is not FDA-approved for the treatment of GSAD. All participants will attend
      weekly study visits at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Participants who continue into phase two
      will attend weekly study visits at Weeks 11-14, 16, 18, 20, and 22. Symptom remission rates
      and post-treatment social phobia severity will be assessed at Week 22.

    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a 24-item scale assessing fear and avoidance in social and performance situations; it is widely used in studies of pharmacological treatment of Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD). We analyzed the overall change in LSAS (last Phase II LSAS minus Week 10 LSAS). Higher numbers reflect greater drops in social anxiety disorder severity. Scores on the LSAS range from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating greater pathology.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment for this study began in 2006 at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of California San Diego, and the Anxiety Disorders Clinic, McMaster University Medical Centre. Through approved recruitment methods, 397 patients with Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD) were enrolled in Phase I of the study (open sertraline).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Among the 397 patients enrolled in Phase I of the study, 295 patients entered Phase II. A total of 181 (61%) of the patients who began Phase II were non-responders at week 10 (LSAS&gt;50), and were therefore randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment in one of three treatment arms (sertraline plus clonazepam, venlafaxine, or sertraline plus placebo).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a 24-item scale assessing fear and avoidance in social and performance situations; it is widely used in studies of pharmacological treatment of Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD).

        <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a 24-item scale assessing fear and avoidance in social and performance situations; it is widely used in studies of pharmacological treatment of Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD). We analyzed the overall change in LSAS (last Phase II LSAS minus Week 10 LSAS). Higher numbers reflect greater drops in social anxiety disorder severity. Scores on the LSAS range from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating greater pathology.</description>
