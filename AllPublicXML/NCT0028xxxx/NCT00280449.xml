  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of having a case manager help PHAs access and use health,
      social services and practical resources that are helpful to their needs as compared to the
      usual more PHA self-managed approach of deciding and using services as they see necessary.
      New and existing users of HIV/AIDS services in Wellington-Dufferin, Waterloo and Grey-Bruce
      Regions who consent to this study will be randomized to receive their usual self-directed
      supportive, educational, medical and medical care services when they seek assistance
      according to their needs or these usual services augmented by case management services. They
      will be measured before randomization and at 3, 6 and 12 months following service use for
      their satisfaction with HIV/AIDS services, compliance with HIV/AIDS medication, improvement
      in quality of life, psychological distress, risk behaviours and expenditures for the use of a
      range of publicly funded services.
