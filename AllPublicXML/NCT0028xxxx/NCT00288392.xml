      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan compared
      to placebo on the healing of chronic leg ulcers in diabetes patients.

      Hypothesis: Through its ability to activate tissue macrophages and counteract
      diabetes-associated defects in macrophages, the soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan will promote the
      healing of leg ulcers in diabetic patients.

      Diabetes predisposes to ulceration of the foot through a variety of processes, including
      neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease. Once the skin is broken, healing is frequently
      delayed and the ulcer develops the biology of a chronic wound. The factors underlaying
      delayed healing in chronic wounds are not well understood but include the effects of repeated
      trauma, tissue ischemia, infection, defective white cell function, altered immune processes,
      and altered expression of tissue cytokines and enzymes.

      Management is based on regular cleansing and debridement, off-loading and treatment of
      intercurrent infection with antibiotics. There are no interventions in routine use, which
      target aspects of chronic wound biology directly.
