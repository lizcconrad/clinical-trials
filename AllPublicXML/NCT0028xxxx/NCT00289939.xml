  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this work is to reduce the prevalence of HIV and domestic violence
      among women at risk by encouraging self-protective behaviors. To obtain this goal, Multnomah
      County Health Department and Oregon Department of Human Services have conducted a randomized
      trial of an intervention to prevent HIV and domestic violence among women who have recent
      criminal justice involvement and who are at risk for HIV infection.

      Women enrolled in the study were randomly assigned to one of three study conditions:

        -  Group 1: these women received information on local resources addressing HIV prevention,
           domestic violence, and life stability issues; they did not receive any counseling
           sessions as part of the study itself.

        -  Group 2: these women received up to ten supportive counseling sessions based on the
           techniques of motivational interviewing. These sessions aimed to reduce HIV risk and to
           improve life stability.

        -  Group 3: these women received up to ten supportive counseling sessions based on
           motivational interviewing. These sessions aimed to reduce risk for HIV and domestic
           violence and to improve life stability.

      The primary hypotheses of this study were:

        -  1. Supportive counseling (motivational interviewing) addressing HIV prevention and
           increased life stability will lead to reductions of HIV risk behavior among women
           enrolled in the study.

        -  2. Supportive counseling (motivational interviewing) addressing domestic violence
           prevention, HIV prevention, and increased life stability, will bring about reductions in
           experiences of domestic violence and a reduction of HIV risk among these women.

        -  3. The supportive counseling received in this study will enhance these women's
           self-efficacy, self-esteem, and psychological well-being.

      Women in all three experimental groups were interviewed at the beginning of the study and
      again after 4, 7, and 10 months. These assessment interviews asked questions about: HIV risk;
      experiences of domestic violence; and life stability issues such as education, employment,
      and housing; and included biological testing for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Women
      in Group 2 and Group 3 participated in up to 10 sessions of supportive counseling
      (motivational interviewing) between the time of enrollment and the 4-month interviews.
