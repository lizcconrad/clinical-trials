  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shanghai Wanxing Bio-Pharmaceuticals is currently evaluating one malaria vaccine candidate,
      PfCP2.9 adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 720. This trial is designed to test the safety and
      immunogenicity of 3 doses and 2 vaccination schedules.

      This blood stage candidate malaria vaccine is being developed for the routine immunization of
      infants and children living in malaria-endemic areas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, controlled Phase I study of PfCp2.9, an experimental
      malaria vaccine candidate, adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 720.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine
      in healthy Chinese adult volunteers.
