  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, once daily
      (QD), combined with metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with
      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% are type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of
      2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of dipeptidyl peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of alogliptin in combination
      with metformin in individually who are inadequately controlled on metformin alone.

      Individuals who participate in this study will be required to commit to a screening visit and
      up to 14 additional visits at the study center. Study participation is anticipated to be
      about 34 weeks (or 8.5 months).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus currently treated with metformin alone but,
             experiencing inadequate glycemic control. The participant should have received the
             metformin monotherapy for at least the 3 months prior to Screening; and must have a
             stable dose of greater than or equal to 1500 mg metformin for at least 8 weeks prior
             to randomization. Participants with a maximum tolerated dose that is documented to be
             less than 1500 mg of metformin may also be enrolled if this dose has been stable for 8
             weeks prior to randomization.

          -  No treatment with antidiabetic agents other than metformin within the 3 months prior
             to Screening. (Exception: if a participant has received other antidiabetic therapy for
             less than 7 days within the 3 months prior to Screening.)

          -  Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2

          -  Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng per mL. (If this
             screening criterion is not met, the participant still qualifies if C-peptide is
             greater than or equal to 1.5 ng per mL after a challenge test.

             over-the-counter medications is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.

             than or equal to 110 mm Hg

          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g per dL for males and greater than or equal to
             10 g per dL for females

          -  Alanine aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 time the upper limit of normal
