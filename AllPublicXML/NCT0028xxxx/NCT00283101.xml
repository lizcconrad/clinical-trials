  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the tolerability, safety profile,
      and antitumor activity of SGN-40 in patients with CLL. All patients will receive dose
      escalation during the first two weeks regardless of cohort designation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of three patients will be entered into each dose-level cohort for five weeks.
      Escalation to the next cohort will occur when three patients have received at least one
      infusion at the highest scheduled dose level, and at least one patient has completed the
      entire five week dosing schedule. Cohorts will be enrolled at a maximal dose level of 3, 4,
      6, or 8 mg/kg/week. Initial therapy will last for 5 weeks. Responding patients will receive
      additional infusions every two weeks x 4 at the maximal dose for each specific cohort.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of CLL as defined by the WHO criteria and
             exhibit active disease requiring treatment as per the NCI working group on CLL.

          2. Patients must have a fresh tumor specimen available (peripheral blood or bone marrow)
             for flow cytometry evaluation (e.g. CD40, CD38, CD20, CD19, and CD5).For the phase 2
             portion of the study, CD40 expression on malignant cells must be confirmed prior to
             registration.

          3. Patients must have relapsed after receiving at least one fludarabine containing
             regimen or an equivalent purine analog.

             At study start patients must be at least 8 weeks or 5 plasma half-lives (whichever is
             greater) from prior chemotherapy/radiation/investigational agents, 8 weeks from prior
             antibody therapy and 6 months from autologous stem cell transplant.

          4. Patients must have an ECOG performance status ≤ 2 and a life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          5. Patients must have the following required baseline laboratory data:

               -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 (may be maintained by transfusion)

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 7.5 g/dL (may be maintained by transfusions or growth factors)

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm3 (may be maintained by growth factors)

               -  ALT/AST ≤ 2.0 times ULN

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 times ULN (unless related to hemolysis)

               -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 times ULN

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative B-hCG pregnancy test result
             within 3 days prior to the first dose and must agree to use an effective contraceptive
             method during the course of the study and for 6 months following the last dose of
             study drug.

          7. If a deep venous thrombosis or other vascular event has required medical or surgical
             intervention in the past year, patients must either: a) be on a stable dose of
             anticoagulant therapy (i.e., Coumadin and/or Heparin) for at least three weeks or b)
             have completed anticoagulant therapy at least three months prior to registration with
             radiographic confirmation that thrombosis is resolved. Prophylactic anticoagulant
             therapy for indwelling catheters is acceptable.

          8. Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          9. Patients must be available for periodic blood sampling, study-related assessments, and
             management of toxicity at the treating institution.

         10. Patients must give written informed consent. A copy of the signed informed consent
             form will be retained by the treating institution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          7. Patients with a history of another primary malignancy that has not been in remission
             for at least 5 years (non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ on
             biopsy or a squamous intraepithelial lesion on PAP smear are exempt from the five year
             limit).

          8. Patients with any systemic viral, bacterial, or fungal infection that has required
             antibiotic therapy within four weeks prior to enrollment. Prophylactic antibiotics and
             antiviral therapy are permitted prior to registration and are required during the
             study period (e.g. Bactrim, acyclovir).

          9. Patients with known HIV, hepatitis B (by surface antigen expression), or active
             hepatitis C infection.

         10. Patients on systemic steroids who have not been on a stable daily dose during the four
             weeks immediately prior to first dose of SGN-40. Maximum steroid dose is 10 mg
             prednisone per day or equivalent.

         11. Patients with a history of migraines or severe headaches requiring medical therapy
             (other than occasional acetaminophen, aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             drugs) within 12 months of enrollment.

         12. Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
