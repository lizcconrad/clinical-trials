  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given
      together with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with advanced or refractory
      solid tumors. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving vorinostat together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may
      kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose of vorinostat (SAHA) when administered with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxic effects of this regimen in
      these patients.

      II. Assess, preliminarily, evidence of antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients.

      IV. Determine the in vivo effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of vorinostat (SAHA).

      Patients receive oral SAHA once or twice daily on days 1-14* and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours
      followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      have stable disease after the completion of 6 courses may receive single-agent SAHA at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      NOTE: *During the first treatment course only, patients receive SAHA on days -4 to 10.Cohorts
      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience DLT. An additional 6-12 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month.
