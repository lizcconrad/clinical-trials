  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem causing significant morbidity and
      mortality. Yet, smoking cessation therapies are often ineffective at helping smokers break
      their addiction.

      The mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system plays a crucial role in mediating the reinforcing
      effects of nicotine. Recently, acute high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) of frontal brain regions has been shown to efficiently modulate the
      mesolimbic dopamine systems in both animals and humans. For this reason, we investigated
      whether 10 high-frequency (10Hz) rTMS treatments over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      can help people to withdraw smoking in comparison to placebo rTMS.

      Smokers seeking to quit are recruited through newspaper advertisements. Participants were
      randomized to 10 days of either real or placebo high frequency rTMS.

    <description>3. rTMS subjects will receive 20 trains of rTMS at a rate of 10 Hz for 6 seconds (1200 pulses/session). Pulses will be administered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, defined as 5 cm anterior and in a parasagital plane to the point of maximum stimulation of the abductor pollicis muscle. Pulse intensity will be set at 100% motor threshold.</description>
