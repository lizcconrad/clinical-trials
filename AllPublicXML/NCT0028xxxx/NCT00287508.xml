      To collect clinical outcome and device performance data on the FDA 510(k)-cleared Emboshield®
      BareWire™ Rapid Exchange Embolic Protection System and FDA-approved Xact® Rapid Exchange
      Carotid Stent System when used under commercial use conditions by a broad group of physicians

      This is a multi-center, observational, single arm, post-approval study enrolling the
      following study population:

        -  Subjects with neurological symptoms and &gt;= 50% stenosis of the common or internal
           carotid artery by ultrasound or angiogram (visual estimate), or

        -  Subjects without neurological symptoms and &gt;= 80% stenosis of the common or internal
           carotid artery by ultrasound or angiogram (visual estimate)

        -  The endpoint for the 1500 subjects enrolled will be a 30-day composite of death, stroke
           and myocardial infarction (MI).

        -  For the 500 subjects with 12 month follow-up, the endpoint will be a composite of
           stroke, death and MI at 30 days and ipsilateral stroke at 12 months (31-365 days).
