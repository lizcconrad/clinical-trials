  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SAVE PACe is a large, prospective, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial with the main
      objective to study the effect of unnecessary right ventricular apical pacing on the clinical
      outcome of time to development of persistent AF.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional dual-chamber pacing maintains atrioventricular synchrony but results in high
      percentages of ventricular pacing, which causes ventricular desynchronization and has been
      linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with sinus-node disease.

      Patients with sinus-node disease and intact atrioventricular conduction are randomly assigned
      to receive conventional dual-chamber pacing or dual-chamber minimal ventricular pacing with
      the use of new Medtronic pacemaker features designed to promote atrioventricular conduction,
      preserve ventricular conduction, and prevent ventricular desynchronization. The primary end
      point was time to persistent atrial fibrillation.
