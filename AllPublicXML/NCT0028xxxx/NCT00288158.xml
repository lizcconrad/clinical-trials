    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the consequences of lowering serum uric acid in
      pre-hypertensive, obese adolescents pathways involved with how uric acid mediated
      hypertension and renal disease. The specific aims are:

        1. Test the hypothesis that lowering uric acid will improve endothelial function.

        2. Test the hypothesis that lowering uric acid will reduce plasma renin activity and serum
           angiotensin II levels.

        3. Test the hypothesis that lowering uric acid will reduce markers of inflammation

      The trial will be a double blinded, placebo control trial of two uric acid lowering agents.
      The endpoints for this trial will be, endothelial function, systemic vascular resistance,
      plasma renin activity, MCP-1 and CRP. Upon recruitment and informed consent, children will
      undergo initial screening. This will include medical history, family history, dietary
      history, review of systems (questionnaire used and validated in pediatric hypertension
      clinic) and pediatric quality of life questionnaire. They will have a physical exam, casual
      and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (see below) and screening laboratory analysis that
      will include CBC, electrolytes, BUN, Cr, Uric acid, AST, ALT and urinary micro-albumin to
      creatinine ratio. Children with serum uric acid less than 5.0mg per dl will be enrolled as
      controls and only have baseline studies at Screening and Visit 1. Children with serum uric
      acid equal to or greater than 5.0mg per dl will be randomized (in a one to one to one ratio)
      to receive placebo, allopurinol or probenecid.

      Study drug (or placebo) will be administered for 2 months. During the first week, subjects
      will take one tablet (placebo, 150mg allopurinol or 250mg probenecid) twice daily. At the end
      of one week subjects will be instructed to increase to 2 tablets (placebo, 300mg allopurinol
      or 500mg probenecid) twice daily. Data collection will occur during screening, after one and
      two months on the study drug and one month after completion of the study drug.
