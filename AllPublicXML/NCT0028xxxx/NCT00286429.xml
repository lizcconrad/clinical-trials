      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of alogliptin, once daily
      (QD), taken in combination with insulin for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with
      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% are type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected.

      Takeda is developing alogliptin (SYR-322) for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is
      thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2 peptide hormones released in
      response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of alogliptin in combination with
      insulin in subjects who are inadequately controlled on insulin alone (with or without
      metformin). Individuals who participate in this study will be required to commit to a
      screening visit and up to 14 additional visits at the study center. Study participation is
      anticipated to be about 34 weeks (or 8.5 months).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and currently treated with insulin alone (with
             or without metformin), and is inadequately controlled. Metformin dose must be stable
             for at least 8 weeks prior to Randomization.

          -  No treatment with antidiabetic agents other than insulin and metformin within the 8
             weeks prior to Randomization.

          -  Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2

          -  Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng per mL. (If this
             screening criterion is not met, the subject still qualifies if C-peptide greater than
             or equal to 1.5 ng per mL after a challenge test).

          -  Glycosylated hemoglobin concentration greater than or equal to 8.0% at Screening.

          -  Using a stable dose of insulin of at least 15 units but not more than 100 units per
             day for at least 8 weeks prior to Randomization. A dose of insulin that varies by up
             to 15% of the mean will be considered as stable.

          -  If regular use of other, non-excluded medications, must be on a stable dose for at
             least the 4 weeks prior to Screening. However, as needed use of prescription or
             over-the-counter medications is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Systolic blood pressure less than or equal to180 mm Hg and diastolic pressure less
             than or equal to 110 mm Hg

          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g per dL for males and greater than or equal
             to10 g per dL for females.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Urine albumin to creatinine ratio of greater than 1000 μg per mg at Screening. If

          -  History of coronary angioplasty, coronary stent placement, coronary bypass surgery, or
             myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  Prior treatment in an investigational study of alogliptin.

          -  Excluded Medications:

               -  Treatment with antidiabetic agents other than insulin and metformin is not
