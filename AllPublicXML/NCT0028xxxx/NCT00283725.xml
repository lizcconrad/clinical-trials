  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to examine patterns of treatment care for patients
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a real-world arena and to examine the association with
      different outcomes for patients and informal caregivers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-year, multicenter, prospective (look forward using periodic observations
      collected predominantly following patient enrollment), longitudinal (it is a co relational
      research study that involves repeated observations of the same variables over long periods of
      time), and observational study. The objective of this study is to examine the patients with
      mild and moderate AD who are currently being treated with different treatment care methods in
      real-world settings. Doctors will not be provided medication or asked to treat their patients
      with any particular treatment. The effect of the different management strategies on
      cognition, activities of daily living, and behavior of the patients will be evaluated, and
      data on the informal caregiver burden will be assessed. Data on the utilization of health and
      social care services by the patient and the primary informal caregiver, including admission
      of the patient to an assisted living facility or nursing home will be assessed. The doctor's
      assessment of clinical global impression and adverse events will also be documented. Data
      will be collected from the doctors at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months, and from the
      caregivers at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The medication dosage and administration
      is based upon the doctors' prescription, individualized for the patient and not dictated by
      the protocol.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale score at Month 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>MMSE is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used for the assessment of dementia patients' cognitive impairment. Evaluation of points are as: 24-30 = No cognitive impairment, 18-23 = Mild cognitive impairment, 0-17 = Severe cognitive impairment. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in clinical global impression (CGI) scale score at Month 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a patient. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) at Month 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is a validated clinical instrument for evaluating psychopathology in dementia to quantify and qualitate changes in psychiatric symptoms. It has 13-point scale and each is rated as follows: 1= mild (noticeable, but not a significant change), 2= moderate (significant, but not a dramatic change), and 3= Severe (very marked and prominent: a dramatic change). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Zarit caregiver burden scale score at Month 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Zarit caregiver burden scale is used to measure caregiver burden as it relates to time, developmental comparison with peers, physical health, social relationships, and emotional health. It has 22 item and each question is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = never present to 4 = nearly always present. The sum of the total scores of the 22-items is calculated in the range from 0 (low burden) to 88 (high burden). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Kaplan-Meier estimate at Month 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>By using Kaplan-Meier Estimator, the effect of an intervention is assessed by measuring the number of patients survived or saved after that intervention is given over a period of time. At any time point, the survival will be measured by the following formula: Number of patients living at the start minus Number of patients died divided by Number of patients living at the start.</description>
