      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of oxaliplatin when given
      together with leucovorin and fluorouracil in treating young patients with advanced solid
      tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      oxaliplatin when given together with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium in pediatric
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including tumors of the CNS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetic properties of oxaliplatin in this pediatric patient
      population.

      II. Correlate alterations in accumulation of fludeoxyglucose F 18 with tumor response in
      those patients who can readily undergo a positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/CT scan.

      III. Assess the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate any
      preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin. Patients
      are stratified according to solid tumor type (non-CNS vs CNS).

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1
      followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1-2. Courses repeat every 14
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
