      This is an open -label randomized phase II study of dose-dense
      Fluorouracil/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide (FEC) administered with Epirubicin of 75mg/m2
      (FEC75) and Epirubicin 90mg/m2 (FEC90) in untreated patients with early breast cancer.

      Arm A: the FEC75 regimen will be given at the following doses:

      Fluorouracil 500mg/m2 by i.v. bolus or infusion. Epirubicin 75mg/m2 by 30 minutes i.v
      infusion and Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 by i.v bolus or infusion. All three drugs will be
      administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 14-day cycles.

      Arm B: the FEC90 regimen will be given at the following doses:

      Fluorouracil 500mg/m2 by i.v. bolus or infusion.Epirubicin 90mg/m2 by 30 minutes i.v infusion
      and Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 by i.v bolus or infusion.

      All three drugs will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 14-day cycles.

      Pegfilgrastim fixed dose of 6mg as a single subcutaneous injection will be given in both arms
      on Day 2 of each cycle.

      Six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy will be administered in both arms (A + B)
