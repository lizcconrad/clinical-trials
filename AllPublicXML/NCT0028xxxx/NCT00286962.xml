  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare intraperitoneal (IP) therapy to subcutaneous
      administration of insulin regarding safety, glycemic control and number of episodes of
      hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various study data available suggest that intraperitoneal (IP) delivery of insulin in type 1
      and type 2 diabetic subjects provides an appropriate therapy that allows subjects to achieve
      acceptable glycemic control without increasing the inherent risk of severe hypoglycemia
      observed when intensive insulin treatment is pursued. Up till now little research has been
      done to investigate the efficacy of intraperitoneal (IP) therapy compared to subcutaneous
      administration. In this study we aim for safety and non-inferiority or superiority for IP
      therapy concerning glycemic control with less episodes of hypoglycemia compared to intensive
      subcutaneous (SC) therapy in intermediate or poorly controlled Type 1 patients and/or
      patients with frequent severe hypoglycemic events.

      Subjects will be randomized to insulin treatment using the Medtronic Minimed Implantable Pump
      or to subcutaneous insulin therapy during the first study arm. After the first arm of the
      study, subjects will be crossed over to the second arm and will receive the treatment
      whichever they had not received in the first treatment phase. Subjects with the MIP already
      implanted will retain the pump but will receive diluent intraperitoneally for the second
      study arm.
