      Recent data show that there are significant disparities among genders and races in the
      incidence of sepsis. While men are consistently more likely to have sepsis than women, the
      apparent racial disparities are even more striking, approaching a doubling of the risk for
      sepsis among Afro-Americans. Most prominent is the risk among black men, the group in which
      sepsis occurs at the youngest age and results in the most deaths. Potential mechanisms for
      heterogeneous susceptibility to sepsis include genetic differences, which have been explored
      according to sex but not according to race, and other social and clinical factors.

      The goal of this study is to explore whether proinflammatory and procoagulant responses in a
      well standardised inflammation model are comparable in healthy Caucasian and African
      volunteers.
