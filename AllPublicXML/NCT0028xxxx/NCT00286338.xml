      The investigators want to correlate different methods to guide fluid therapy. The
      investigators know that guidance by esophagus doppler technique has improved outcome and want
      to correlate other already used techniques to esophagus doppler.

      Fluid therapy before and under surgery can be guided by measurement of the hearts ability to
      eject blood (cardiac output). By doing this it has been shown that the occurrence of
      nausea,vomiting and complications generally can be reduced. The function of the heart has
      been measured with a probe in the esophagus in in earlier studies. We want to correlate these
      results with other techniques by which fluid therapy also is guided in daily practice. These
      are: SVO2, modelflow (finapres)and NIRS.

      These methods are noninvasive except SVO2 measurement which requires a central venous
      catheter (CVK). Therefore we have chosen a population in which CVK is standard in our
      institution. We thereby donÂ´t apply any further risks than daily practice and the project is
      considered as a quality assessment of used standards.
