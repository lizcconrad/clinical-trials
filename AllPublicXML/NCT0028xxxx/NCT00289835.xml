      HYPOTHESIS

        1. Sealing moderate SVG lesions with the TAXUS stent prevents SVG atherosclerosis
           progression as evaluated by IVUS.

        2. Sealing moderate SVG lesions with the TAXUS stent does not accelerate SVG
           atherosclerosis in the angiographically non-diseased segments of the SVG as evaluated by
           IVUS.

      OBJECTIVES

        1. To determine the effect of stenting moderate SVG lesions with the paclitaxel-eluting
           stent in comparison with medical treatment on limiting SVG disease progression as
           evaluated by IVUS.

        2. To evaluate by IVUS the effect of stenting moderate SVG lesions with the
           paclitaxel-eluting stent in comparison with medical treatment on atherosclerosis
           progression in angiographically non-diseased SVGs segments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomized study assessing the efficacy of stenting moderate SVG
      lesions with the taxus stent in the prevention of atherosclerosis progression of SVGs as
      evaluated by IVUS. Patients with previous coronary bypass surgery with SVG implantation
      undergoing coronary angiography by clinical indication will be screened. If the patient has a
      moderate lesion at any level of the SVGs it will be includable in the study. After inclusion,
      the patients will be randomized to either stenting the moderate SVG lesion with the taxus
      stent or standard medical treatment. The use of a filter wire during dilation will be
      strongly recommended. Following this procedure, all patients will have clinical controls at 1
      month and at 6 months and an angiographic and IVUS control study at 1 year follow-up.
