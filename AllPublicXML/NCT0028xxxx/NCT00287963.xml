      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan and vinorelbine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of topotecan when
      given together with vinorelbine in treating patients with recurrent lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan when combined with vinorelbine
           ditartrate in patients with recurrent lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the response and stable disease rates and the time to disease progression among
           treated patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of topotecan.

      Patents receive vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 8-10 minutes and topotecan IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which ≥ 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
