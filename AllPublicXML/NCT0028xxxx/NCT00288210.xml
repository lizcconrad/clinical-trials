  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of stent restenosis in the setting of primary angioplasty is particularly high,
      reaching a rate of 27% In the last years the introduction of drug-eluting stents has
      drastically reduced the incidence of restenosis in patients not requiring urgent
      revascularization. Whether drug-eluting stenting might constitute the new optimal therapy for
      patients with an acute myocardial infarction is unknown. To be able to answer this question,
      we designed a randomized trial in which patients with an acute myocardial infarction eligible
      for treatment with primary angioplasty and abciximab were randomized to receive either a
      rapamicine-eluting stent or a conventional bare stent.

    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute myocardial infarction has evolved dramatically in the last decade.
      Coronary angioplasty with stent implantation in conjunction with an optimal antitrombotic
      therapy as abciximab is now considered current standard therapy However, the incidence of
      stent restenosis in the setting of primary angioplasty remains particularly high, reaching a
      rate of 27%. A high restenosis rate causes a high re-hospitalization rate for target vessel
      revascularization and an ensuing increase in cost.In the last years the introduction of
      drug-eluting stents has drastically reduced the incidence of restenosis in patients not
      requiring urgent revascularization. This reduced incidence of restenosis occurs without an
      increase in adverse clinical events over conventional stents and has a very low rate of stent
      subacute thrombosis. Whether this combination of drug-eluting stents and abciximab might
      constitute the new optimal therapy for patients with an acute myocardial infarction is
      unknown. To be able to answer this question, we designed a one year coronary angiographic
      study in which patients with an acute myocardial infarction eligible for treatment with
      primary angioplasty and abciximab were randomized to receive either a rapamicine-eluting
      stent or a conventional bare stent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria were an age of more than 18 years, the presence for at least 30 minutes
        but less than 12 hours of symptoms consistent with acute myocardial infarction, and the
        presence of ST-segment elevation in at least two contiguous leads or left bundle-branch
        block.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients were excluded if they were in cardiogenic shock (defined as systolic blood
        pressure of less than 80 mm Hg for more than 30 minutes or the need for intravenous
        pressors or intraaortic-balloon counterpulsation); had a history of bleeding diathesis; had
        a history of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or severe hepatic or renal dysfunction; had a
        noncardiac illness associated with a life expectancy of less than one year; were
        participating in another study; or were unable to give informed consent owing to prolonged
        cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
