  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if an investigational drug called
      Exisulind will extend the &quot;off-treatment&quot; period of patients receiving Intermittent Androgen
      Suppression (ADT).

      There is evidence suggesting that alternating between periods of treatment and no treatment
      with androgen suppressants may delay the time to develop androgen-insensitive progression and
      improve overall quality of life. During intermittent androgen suppression (IAS) treatments,
      men receive a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist and antiandrogen for a
      fixed period of time (approximately 9 months) and then enter an off-treatment period, whose
      length will vary, depending on the rate of rise in the patient's Prostate-Specific Antigen
      (PSA). Once the PSA reaches an established threshold (1 ng/mL in men who have had a
      prostatectomy or 4 ng/ml in men with an intact prostate), androgen suppression will be
      re-initiated for another 9 months. These cycles of on-treatment/off-treatment will be
      repeated until patient no longer responds to the androgen suppression and it is clear that
      their cancer is progressing. It has been observed that off-treatment periods tend to become
      shorter with each successive cycle of androgen suppression, presumably due to the emergence
      of androgen-independent clones. This study proposes to look at exisulind, a pro-apoptotic
      drug, which may extend the off-treatment period in patients receiving IAS.

      A study doctor will meet with you and ask you about your medical history, examine you, and
      explain the study. We will draw some blood for tests (about 4-6 tablespoons), including
      Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). If not already obtained, you will have a bone scan and a
      computed tomography scan (CT scan) to establish a baseline.

      You will be receiving hormone suppression treatment with monthly injections of a luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog such as Lupron or Zoladex and an antiandrogen such as
      Eulexin or Casodex as part of your standard care for prostate cancer. About 3 months before
      your next &quot;off-treatment&quot; period, you will start 1 Exisulind pill 250 mg (2 x 125mg capsules)
      by mouth twice a day. It is necessary for you to start the Exisulind treatment 3 months prior
      to your next &quot;off-treatment&quot; period so that the medication can build up in your system enough
      to be effective.

      Per our standard follow-up procedures, we will ask you to have blood draws every 2 weeks for
      up to 12 weeks after starting Exisulind to check liver function. Thereafter you will be asked
      to have monthly blood draws, and return to the clinic every 3 months for a physical
      examination, to determine how well you are tolerating the study medication, how your cancer
      is responding to the treatment, and to give you more study medication. You will continue
      taking Exisulind during your &quot;off-treatment&quot; period until your PSA reaches a threshold level.
      PSA threshold is defined by your primary treatment. If you have had your prostate removed,
      the threshold is 1.0 ng/dL. If you have an intact prostate, your threshold is 4 ng/dL. Once
      your PSA reaches this level, you will restart your hormone suppression treatment as directed
      by your doctor.

    <description>Patients were monitored for the amount of time (number of weeks) that passed between the completion of a cycle of Intermittent Androgen Suppression with Exisulind and the need to re-initiate treatment with Intermittent Androgen Suppression. It was hoped that adding Exisulind to standard Androgen Suppression would extend the amount time before disease progression.</description>

    <description>Patients were monitored for continued hormonal sensitivity of their disease from the time of the first treatment with Intermittent Androgen Suppression and Exisulind and the time at which point they were considered hormone-refractory (castrate resistant). The development of hormone-refractory disease was one of the criteria for withdraw from study treatment. For this protocol, hormone-refractory was defined as 2 consecutive rising PSAs at least 2 weeks apart while on an LHRH agonist (with or without an anti-androgen).</description>
