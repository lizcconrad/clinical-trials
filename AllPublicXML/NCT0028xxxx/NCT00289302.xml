  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a progressive disease that decreases the pumping action of the heart. This
      may cause a backup of fluid in the heart and may result in heart beat changes. When there are
      changes in the heart beat sometimes an implantable heart device is used to control the rate
      and rhythm of the heart beat. In certain heart failure cases, when the two lower chambers of
      the heart no longer beat in a coordinated manner, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may
      be prescribed. CRT is similar to a pacemaker. It is placed (implanted) under the skin of the
      upper chest. CRT is delivered as tiny electrical pulses to the right and left ventricles
      through three or four leads (soft insulated wires) that are inserted through the veins to the
      heart.

      People who have a dangerously fast heart beat, or whose heart is at risk of stopping beating,
      may be in need of an electronic device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
      (ICD). An ICD is implanted surgically just under the skin in the upper chest area and it
      sends a strong electrical impulse, or shock, to the heart to return it to a normal rhythm. If
      the heart is beating too slowly or at an abnormal rhythm, an ICD can also pace the heart to
      return the heart to its normal rhythm. The InSync ICD device can change the timing of when
      the left and right ventricles of the heart are paced to beat.

      The purpose of this study is to monitor the long-term performance of the InSync ICD Model
      7272 and the InSync Marquis 7277 systems for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).
