    <description>Participants were enrolled into the study on their stable twice-daily (bid) dose of tacrolimus on Day 1 and continued to receive a stable bid dose of tacrolimus through Day 7. Participants then converted to Tacrolimus Modified Release (MR), administered once daily at an equivalent dose to the patient's previous stable total daily dose of tacrolimus. Participants who completed the 4-week pharmacokinetic treatment period with tacrolimus MR could continue receiving tacrolimus MR as part of the extended treatment period of the study. Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain tacrolimus trough concentrations within the target range of 5 to 15 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>

          <description>Participants were enrolled into the study on their stable twice-daily (bid) dose of tacrolimus on Day 1 and continued to receive a stable bid dose of tacrolimus through Day 7. Participants then converted to Tacrolimus Modified Release (MR), administered once daily at an equivalent dose to the patient's previous stable total daily dose of tacrolimus. Participants who completed the 4-week pharmacokinetic treatment period with tacrolimus MR could continue receiving tacrolimus MR as part of the extended treatment period of the study. Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain tacrolimus trough concentrations within the target range of 5 to 15 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>

            <description>Participants were enrolled into the study on their stable twice-daily (bid) dose of tacrolimus on Day 1 and continued to receive a stable bid dose of tacrolimus through Day 7. Participants then converted to Tacrolimus Modified Release (MR), administered once daily at an equivalent dose to the patient's previous stable total daily dose of tacrolimus. Participants who completed the 4-week pharmacokinetic treatment period with tacrolimus MR could continue receiving tacrolimus MR as part of the extended treatment period of the study. Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain tacrolimus trough concentrations within the target range of 5 to 15 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>

The natural log (ln) was used to transform Cmin prior to analysis and the results were transformed back to the original scale for the presentation of results.</groups_desc>

Biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) is defined as an episode of acute allograft rejection that was confirmed by biopsy results and was Banff grade ≥ IA. Biopsies were graded by the pathologist at the clinical site according to the 1997 Banff criteria: Borderline: No intimal arteritis present but foci of mild tubulitis; Grade I: Significant interstitial infiltration and foci of moderate to severe tubulitis; Grade II: Mild to severe intimal arteritis; Grade III: Transmural arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells with accompanying lymphocytic infiltrate in vessel.</description>

            <description>Participants were enrolled into the study on their stable twice-daily (bid) dose of tacrolimus on Day 1 and continued to receive a stable bid dose of tacrolimus through Day 7. Participants then converted to Tacrolimus Modified Release (MR), administered once daily at an equivalent dose to the patient's previous stable total daily dose of tacrolimus. Participants who completed the 4-week pharmacokinetic treatment period with tacrolimus MR could continue receiving tacrolimus MR as part of the extended treatment period of the study. Dose adjustments were allowed in order to maintain tacrolimus trough concentrations within the target range of 5 to 15 ng/mL and for clinical reasons.</description>
