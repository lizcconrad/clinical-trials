  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To perform a comprehensive evaluation of multidetector CT myocardial enhancement patterns in
      patients with an acute ST elevation MI. In particular we plan to assess the relationship
      between regions with early hypoperfusion and/or late hyperenhancement, and myocardial
      viability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 patients admitted to ICCU with ST elevation MI, and treated with primary angioplasty on
      admission, will undergo between day 2 and 7 post-MI the following exams: a) multidetector CT:
      regular scan plus late scan at 10 minutes, to evaluate coronary arteries, regional function
      and myocardial enhancement, b) echocardiography with echo-contrast to evaluate function and
      size of abnormally contracting region and remodeling, c) nuclear studies: rest early and late
      Thallium SPECT, to evaluate perfusion and viability. At 3 months a second echo will be
      performed to assess recovery of abnormal segments. The perfusion defects on MSCT will be
      compared with the other modalities and at 3 months will be used to evaluate recovery of
      myocardial function i.e. viability. Parameters that will be evaluated include opacity of
      hypoenhanced segments, ratio of normal to abnormal segments, change in opacity between early
      and late scans, size and transmurality of hypoenhanced segments, and their relation to
      regional contraction.
