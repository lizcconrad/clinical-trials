  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred for colon inspection (colonoscopy) due to suspicion of colon polyps/cancer
      will receive local administration of hexaminolevulinate (HAL) prior to colon inspection. Blue
      light illumination will induce red fluorescence of polyps and tumours, improving detection of
      the polyps and tumors. Different HAL doses will be tested to find the optimal image
      conditions. Tolerability measurements will be performed to ensure patient safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is regarded as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The
      sensitivity is uncertain but proposed to be (75-95%), however flat adenomas which are easily
      missed, are often not recognised. Fluorescence imaging may increase the sensitivity of
      standard white light colonoscopy by identifying more polyps and flat adenomas which will make
      the resection of adenomas more complete.

      In this study hexaminolevulinate (HAL) will be administered locally as a photosensitiser,
      using different doses to find the optimal imaging conditions as well as making patient safety
      assessments.

      Both standard white light and blue light (fluorescence) inspection will be performed.
