  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center evaluation of the Cypher™ Sirolimus
      eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of de novo bifurcated coronary lesions
      comparing provisional modified T stenting with systematic modified T-stenting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bifurcations involving a significant side branch (SB diameter ≥ 2.25 mm) occur in
      approximately 15-20% of all coronary lesions considered for percutaneous intervention. If a
      side branch (SB) subtends significant myocardium, failure to preserve SB vessel patency can
      lead to complications such as myocardial infarction or persistent chest pain despite full
      patency of the main branch.

      Bifurcation lesions are inherently complex and interventional treatment remains a challenging
      problem for physicians.

      The optimal technique for stenting bifurcated lesions is still unknown. Several dual vessel
      stenting techniques have been described in the literature, such as &quot;T&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Culotte&quot;
      and &quot;Crush&quot; procedures. However, most studies of bifurcation stenting have found that optimal
      long-term results are obtained by stenting the main vessel and then performing plain balloon
      angioplasty of the side branch (&quot;kissing balloon&quot;-technique). Nevertheless, occlusion or
      reduced flow of the SB are frequent after stenting of the MB. Therefore, the SB is stented in
      approximately 50% of procedures even if PTCA alone was intended.

      Hypothesis:

      Compared with plain dilatation of side branch, the placement of Cypher-Stent in side branch
      using modified T-stenting technique will reduce &quot;in-segment percent diameter stenosis&quot; of the
      side branch at 9 months post procedure as measured by quantitative coronary angiography.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. The target vessel must meet the following criteria:

               1. Bifurcated lesion Type 1, 2, 3 or 4 of a native coronary artery with a reference
                  vessel diameter of 2.5 mm to 4.0 mm in the main branch and of ≥ 2.25 mm in the
                  side branch.

               2. The target lesion (main branch and / or side branch) must be at least 50%
                  diameter stenosis.

               3. The target lesion has not been previously treated with any interventional
                  procedure.

               4. The target vessel (main branch and side branch) must be feasible for stent
                  implantation (successful passage with the guide wire; successful predilatation
                  with an appropriately sized balloon; no heavy calcification; no diffuse distal
                  disease that might impede run off).

                  2. Patient has stable or unstable angina pectoris (CCS classification I or
                  greater) or a positive stress test for ischemia.

                  3. Patient must be ≥ 18 years of age. 4. Female subjects of childbearing
                  potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days before the procedure.

                  5. Patient has no other treatment planned within 30 days of the procedure. 6.
                  Patient has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions
                  and has written informed consent as approved by the Ethics Committee.

                  7. Patient willing to comply with required post-procedure follow-up.

          -  1. Patient has had an acute myocardial infarction (&gt; 3x normal CK with presence of
             CKMB) within 72 hours preceding the index procedure and CK has not returned to normal
             limits at the time of the procedure.

             2. Patient will have a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,
             clopidogrel, stainless steel, sirolimus, or contrast sensitivity that cannot be
             adequately pre-medicated.

             3. Patient has a platelet count of &lt;100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt;700,000 cells/mm³, a WBC of
             &lt;3,000 cells/mm³, or documented or suspected liver disease.

             congestive heart failure) that may cause the patient to be non-compliant with the
             protocol, or is associated with limited life- expectancy (less than 2 years).

             8. Patient must be excluded from the study if any of these angiographic criteria are
             met:

               1. The target vessel contains intraluminal thrombus.

               2. The target lesion is located in the left main coronary artery.

               3. The target lesion or vessel shows angiographic evidence of severe calcification.
