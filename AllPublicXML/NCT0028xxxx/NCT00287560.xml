  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine wether a modified propofol preparation shows any
      effect on the incidence of injection pain in children undergoing elective surgery under
      general anesthesia.

      Study hypothesis: The use of a modified propofol preparation will reduce the incidence of
      injection pain in the study group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain on injection is the most frequently reported side effect associated with the use of
      propofol for induction of anesthesia. Various measures have been taken to reduce the pain on
      injection, e.g. administration of lidocaine or fentanyl prior to propofol administration,
      mixture of lidocaine and propofol as well as cooling of the emulsion. Although pain on
      injection had been reduced with some of the above mentioned methods, they may not be regarded
      as a satisfactory solution of the problem.
