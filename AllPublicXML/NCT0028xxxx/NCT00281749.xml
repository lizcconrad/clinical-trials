  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A telephone call from a physician taking care of a patient in the hospital to a physician in
      the long term care setting at the time of discharge can improve transitional care for elderly
      patients. We believe direct communication between physicians can reduce re-hospitalizations,
      medication errors, morbidity and mortality. No studies have been done that involve
      physician-to-physician sign-outs after hospital discharge to the nursing home. In our study,
      we would like to address the breakdown in the transfer of information to the nursing home
      setting.
