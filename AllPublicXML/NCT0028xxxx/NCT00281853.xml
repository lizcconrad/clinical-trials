      RATIONALE: Learning about the effects of chemotherapy and biological therapy on nerve
      function may help doctors plan treatment and help patients live more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying peripheral neuropathy in patients who are receiving
      chemotherapy or biological therapy for cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the change in peripheral nerve function in cancer patients during and after
           treatment with chemotherapy or biologic therapy.

        -  Determine the clinical measurement of hearing-related air and bone conduction and
           vibratory sensation in these patients.

        -  Correlate the changes in orthostatic blood pressure using both the Vasotrac automated
           blood pressure device and the standard clinical automated blood pressure equipment.

        -  Determine the patient's perception of hearing quality before and after treatment with
           chemotherapy or biologic therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo a 1-hour peripheral nerve function assessment, including hearing, vibratory
      sensation, and blood pressure testing, at baseline and then at 4, 8, and 12 weeks during
      treatment with chemotherapy or biologic therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
