      The Contracts, Prompts, and Social Reinforcement (CPR) intervention was designed to address
      the continuing care adherence needs of veterans presenting for substance use disorder (SUD)
      treatment. Final results of our recently completed HSR&amp;D clinical trial suggest CPR
      meaningfully impacts aftercare adherence and abstinence rates. However, CPR did not impact
      abstinence rates at earlier follow-up points, other important measures of treatment outcome,
      or AA/NA support group attendance. Furthermore, the generalizability of CPR to other sites
      has not been established. Thus, the intervention has been modified and pilot testing of this
      improved version of CPR, which includes contingent reinforcement of abstinence and improved
      prompting of AA/NA attendance (CPR+), shows promising results. We are conducting a multi-site
      randomized clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of CPR+. We recruited 183 veterans
      seeking residential treatment at the Salem and Jackson VAMCs. Our primary hypothesis is that
      the CPR group will have higher 1-year abstinence rates compared to the STX group. Our
      secondary hypotheses are that the CPR will be particularly effective for individuals with
      co-morbid psychiatric disorders, and that the CPR+ group will remain in AA/NA and in
      aftercare for a longer duration, have fewer days of substance use, fewer hospitalizations,
      and lower costs of care. Treatment outcome will be measured 3-, 6-, and 12-months after
      participants enter treatment and compared to baseline levels. The current study will seek to
      extend past findings to show longer-term effectiveness of the CPR+ intervention on continuing
      care adherence and greater impact on treatment outcome. Dissemination and implementation
      efforts will be ongoing for this brief, inexpensive intervention, which offers an important
      means to improve participation and outcome for individuals seeking SUD treatment within the
      VAMC. Data collection and analysis has been completed.

      The Contracts, Prompts, and Social Reinforcement (CPR) intervention was designed to address
      the continuing care adherence needs of veterans presenting for substance use disorder (SUD)
      treatment. Final results of our recently completed HSR&amp;D clinical trial suggest CPR
      meaningfully impacts aftercare adherence and abstinence rates. Among CPR participants, 55%
      met the VA's SUD continuity of care performance measure (attending at least 2 therapy
      sessions each month for 3 months), compared to 36% of those in standard treatment (STX). On
      the primary outcome variable, 57% of the participants in the CPR condition were abstinent at
      the 1-year follow-up compared to 37% of those in STX. Post hoc moderator analyses also
      indicate that the intervention was particularly effective for participants with co-morbid
      psychiatric disorders. However, CPR did not impact abstinence rates at earlier follow-up
      points, other important measures of treatment outcome, or AA/NA support group attendance.
      Furthermore, the generalizability of CPR to other sites has not been established. Thus, the
      intervention has been modified and pilot testing of this improved version of CPR, which
      includes contingent reinforcement of abstinence and improved prompting of AA/NA attendance
      (CPR+), shows promising results. We conducted a multi-site randomized clinical trial to
      examine the effectiveness of CPR+ with 2 specific goals: 1) to compare CPR+ to STX on
      adherence to continuing care (i.e., AA/NA participation and aftercare therapy) and 2) to
      assess its effect on treatment outcome. We recruited 183 veterans seeking residential
      treatment at the Salem and Jackson VAMCs. Our primary hypothesis is that the CPR group will
      have higher 1-year abstinence rates compared to the STX group. Our secondary hypotheses are
      that the CPR will be particularly effective for individuals with co-morbid psychiatric
      disorders, and that the CPR+ group will remain in AA/NA and in aftercare for a longer
      duration, have fewer days of substance use, fewer hospitalizations, and lower costs of care.
      Treatment outcome will be measured 3-, 6-, and 12-months after participants enter treatment
      and compared to baseline levels using the Form-90 Interview, the Addiction Severity Index
      (ASI), questionnaire responses, and substance use screens. Treatment adherence will be
      measured using VA databases, medical records, therapist ratings, and questionnaire responses.
      Abstinence rates will be analyzed using a logistic regression model in which the parameters
      of interest are estimated using Generalized Estimating Equations. Secondary outcomes will be
      analyzed using both marginal and linear mixed-effects models as appropriate. The current
      study sought to extend past findings to show longer-term effectiveness of the CPR+
      intervention on continuing care adherence and greater impact on treatment outcome.
      Dissemination and implementation efforts are ongoing for this brief, inexpensive
      intervention, which offers an important means to improve participation and outcome for
      individuals seeking SUD treatment within the VAMC.

    <description>Participants who were abstinent was assessed via Form-90 Interview (Form 90I) is a structured interview that assesses substance use and related behaviors over the previous 90 days employing a calendar-based follow-back method that provides continuous measures of substance use, and has good reliability. Measures include days abstinent, days using alcohol, days using drugs, total number of standard drinks, and days of self help meeting attendance. Briefer versions were constructed to collect data via telephone in instances when participants did not return for in-person interviews. As a reliability check on participants' self-report, a collateral interview was employed when contacting informants. Participants who denied use on the Form-90, but had a positive substance use screen were considered to be not abstinent for that follow-up point.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants were recruited from consecutive veterans who successful complete the 28-day
        SARRTP at the Salem VAMC and the 21-day SARRTP at the Jackson VAMC. Participants who are
        uninterested in aftercare, who have unstable housing or other factors that made aftercare
        participation difficult, will be included to maximize the generalizability of our results.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Individuals who did not live within a 60-minute drive, and those who did not have
        transportation and a work schedule allowing attendance of aftercare were ineligible.

        <title>Abstinence Rate (During the Preceding 90 Days) at 12 Months Follow-up Point as Assessed by the Form-90</title>
        <description>Participants who were abstinent was assessed via Form-90 Interview (Form 90I) is a structured interview that assesses substance use and related behaviors over the previous 90 days employing a calendar-based follow-back method that provides continuous measures of substance use, and has good reliability. Measures include days abstinent, days using alcohol, days using drugs, total number of standard drinks, and days of self help meeting attendance. Briefer versions were constructed to collect data via telephone in instances when participants did not return for in-person interviews. As a reliability check on participants' self-report, a collateral interview was employed when contacting informants. Participants who denied use on the Form-90, but had a positive substance use screen were considered to be not abstinent for that follow-up point.</description>

Contracting. Participant's completed a behavioral contract for continuing care participation that took approximately 20 minutes to complete during their final 4 days in initial treatment and after 9 weeks of participation in continuing care.
Prompting. CPR participants received prompts (mailed appointment cards, telephone reminders) to attend all of their aftercare appointments and AA/NA meetings, and following missed aftercare sessions for 1 year (or until discharged from treatment).
