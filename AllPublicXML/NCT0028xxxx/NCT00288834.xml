  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to evaluate the relative effectiveness of four therapy protocols for
      pharyngeal phase swallowing impairment in the stroke population. Data derived from this study
      should contribute significantly to our understanding of the rehabilitative process in the
      neurogenic dysphagic population and will provide the foundation for the establishment of
      efficacious, cost-efficient patient services.

      1. Research Question to be addressed

        1. The utilization of SEMG biofeedback monitoring in dysphagia rehabilitation facilitates
           more rapid and complete recovery than traditional rehabilitation using the same
           swallowing exercises without exteroceptive feedback.

        2. Swallowing rehabilitation provided in an intensive rehabilitative programme (10 hrs of
           treatment in the 1st week) facilitates more rapid and complete recovery than
           traditionally scheduled swallowing rehabilitation (twice weekly).

      This multi-site, multi-national project will evaluate the relative effectiveness of four
      therapy protocols for pharyngeal phase swallowing impairment in the stroke population. For
      this study, patients with chronic dysphagia secondary to stroke will be assigned to one of
      four treatment protocols. These four protocols differ in respect to the intensity of
      treatment and the inclusion of surface electromyography (SEMG) biofeedback as an adjunct to
      treatment. All patients will complete a total of 30 hours of therapy with data collection to
      assess progress at intervals of every 10 sessions. Treatment outcomes will be measured using
      a combination of physiologic and behavioral measures. Data derived from this study should
      contribute significantly to our understanding of the rehabilitative process in the neurogenic
      dysphagic population and will provide the foundation for the establishment of efficacious,
      cost-efficient patient services.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will represent the diagnostic categories of single event brain stem injury,
             right cortical stroke and left cortical stroke.

          -  Chronic dysphagia at least 6 months post onset secondary to single neurological event,
             brain stem, right cortical or left cortical stroke confirmed with CT or MRI

          -  Diagnosis of chronic pharyngeal phase dysphagia based on clinical and
             videofluoroscopic evaluation completed within 3 weeks of beginning treatment.

          -  Must be at least 12 months post onset with no substantial recovery of swallowing
             function. If patients have received prior swallowing treatment, they must be at least
             three months post the termination of direct treatment.

          -  Mini Mental Status Exam score &gt;21

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of pre-existing dysphagia or neurologic disease prior to the onset of the
             current disorder.
