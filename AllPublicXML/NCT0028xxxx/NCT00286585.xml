  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volatile anesthetics may provide some protection from myocardial ischemia, an effect called
      anesthetic preconditioning. In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, this
      preconditioning effect resulted in better cardiac performance, faster recovery and lower
      morbidity and mortality.

      The investigators will perform a prospective randomized multi-center study to compare
      volatile with total intravenous anesthesia in patients at a high cardiac risk who undergo
      major non-cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basic research and animal studies have detected that volatile anesthetics provide some
      protection from myocardial ischemia, an effect called anesthetic preconditioning. Recent
      clinical studies have found that this preconditioning effect is of clinical relevance in
      patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, resulting in better cardiac function and
      faster recovery after surgery, and in lower one-year morbidity. In patients undergoing non
      cardiac surgery, cardiac complications also are the major cause of perioperative morbidity
      and mortality. Myocardial ischemia frequently occurs during and immediately after non cardiac
      surgery in patients with coronary artery disease, and is a strong predictor of subsequent
      cardiac complications and death. Whether or not volatile anesthetics also provide clinically
      relevant protection from perioperative ischemia and subsequent cardiac complications in
      patients undergoing non cardiac surgery is unknown. Therefore, we will perform a prospective,
      randomized multi-center study to compare volatile with total intravenous anesthesia in
      patients at high cardiac risk who undergo major non cardiac surgery. We hypothesize that the
      use of a volatile anesthetic will reduce the incidence of perioperative ischaemia and
      myocardial injury, as indicated primarily by less ST-segment changes in the Holter ECG and,
      if there will be an effect, secondarily by lower incidences of elevated troponin T and
      NT-pro-BNP levels. And we hypothesize that the use of a volatile anesthetic will reduce the
      one-year incidence of cardiac complications and all cause mortality after surgery. The
      results of this study may apply to a huge percentage of surgical patients because coronary
      artery disease is the clinically most relevant co-morbidity, and its prevalence is expected
      to increase with the steadily increasing number of surgical patients aged 65 yr and older.
