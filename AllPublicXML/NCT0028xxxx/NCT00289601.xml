  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center study designed to compare differences
      in rates of myonecrosis (measured as an elevation of CK-MB ratio ≥ 2 times ULN) within 24
      hours following low-medium risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in aspirin or
      clopidogrel non-responsive patients who are randomized to heparin with or without
      eptifibatide therapy during PCI. The primary objective of this study is to determine if the
      use of eptifibatide is associated with a significant difference in post-PCI myonecrosis
      (measured as an elevation of CK-MB ratio ≥ 2 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) within 24
      hours of low-medium risk PCI in patients who are aspirin or non-responsive as determined by
      VerifyNow Aspirin and P2Y12 testing.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the use of eptifibatide is associated
      with a significant difference in post-PCI myonecrosis (measured as an elevation of CK-MB
      ratio ≥ 2 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) within 24 hours of low-medium risk PCI in
      patients who are aspirin or clopidogrel non-responsive as determined by VerifyNow Aspirin and
      P2Y12 testing.

      Secondary study objectives will include an assessment of safety. These safety determinations
      will be determined by monitoring the rates of MACE (defined as death, MI, ischemic
      [non-hemorrhagic] stroke and urgent revascularization by repeat PCI or CABG), bleeding
      events, rate of bailout procedures performed, elevations of CK-MB ratio (in the range of 3 to
      5 times ULN and greater than 5 times ULN) and elevations of troponin I.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center study designed to compare differences
      in rates of myonecrosis (measured as an elevation of CK-MB ratio ≥ 2 times ULN) within 24
      hours following low-medium risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in aspirin or
      clopidogrel non-responsive patients who are randomized to heparin with or without
      eptifibatide therapy during PCI. All subjects must also be pretreated with clopidogrel
      (300-600 mg) at least 2 hours before PCI. Study subjects will be randomized to either
      eptifibatide and unfractionated heparin or unfractionated heparin and placebo. Study subject
      randomization in aspirin non-responsive patients will be stratified based upon clopidogrel
      responsiveness.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with coronary artery disease will be eligible for the study. Inclusion criteria
        are:

        Patient is 21 years or older. Patient is scheduled to undergo low-medium risk percutaneous
        coronary intervention in native coronary vessels.

        Patient self-reports that he/she has received aspirin ≥ 81 mg at least 4 hours prior to
        study screening.

        Patient is defined as aspirin non-responsive based upon results of the VerifyNow™ Aspirin
        test, defined as an aspirin reaction units (ARU) &gt; 475.

        Patient is defined as clopidogrel non-responsive based upon the results of the VerifyNow
        P2Y12 test, defined as less than 20% inhibition.

        Patient will be treated with 300- 600 mg of clopidogrel at least two hours before the
        intervention.

        All patients will provide written informed consent, and the study protocol will be approved
        by the IRB of the participating centers.

        Patient is male, or is a non-pregnant female.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient has a known allergic reaction to the study medication. Patient has been diagnosed
        with a myocardial infarction within the prior 7 days.

        elevation, ST-segment depression, or T-wave inversion) at rest.

        Patient has rest pain with left bundle branch block. Note: In a patient with rest pain and
        abnormal ECG that is believed to be non-acute (i.e., STTW abnormalities secondary to LVH,
        digoxin, or prior remote infarction), a second electrocardiogram 30 min apart is required
        to establish that these changes are non-dynamic and not indicative of active ischemia.

        The target lesion(s) is located in a venous bypass graft. The patient has a chronic
        occlusion (present for longer than 3 months). The target lesion(s) has visible thrombus (by
        angiography). The patient has had a suspected aortic dissection. Patient has left
        ventricular ejection (LVEF) &lt; 30%. Patient was receiving oral anticoagulation therapy.

        Patient received any of the following drugs during 7 days prior to enrollment:

          -  any GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor

          -  ticlopidine

          -  dipyridamole

          -  cilostazol (Pletal) Patient has received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDS), or any steroidal drugs 24 hours prior to enrollment.

        Patient has been diagnosed with any stroke within the prior 3 months. Patient has active
        bleeding or bleeding diathesis. Patient has experienced trauma or major surgery in the
        preceding month. Patient has severe, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of
        more than 180 mm Hg).

        Patient’s creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl prior to PCI. Patient has a hemoglobin level of less than
        10.0 g per deciliter or a hematocrit below 30 percent.

        Patient has a platelet count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter or more than 600,000
        per cubic millimeter.

        Of note, patients on chronic clopidogrel will only be eligible for VerifyNow P2Y12 testing.
        Clopidogrel non-responsiveness in this group will be defined as &lt; 20% inhibition
