  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the patency rate of the nitinol self-expandable
      stent device in the treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusions as compared to
      angioplasty only.

      This is a multi-center prospective, randomized, two-arm study evaluating performance of the
      Cordis SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent as compared to balloon angioplasty only. Patients
      will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. It is anticipated that a total of 120 patients will be
      entered into the study.

      The study population will consist of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease patients with
      SFA occlusions. The disease will consist of symptomatic, long de novo or restenotic
      occlusions (5 - 14.5 cm) on diagnostic imaging with a history of at least 6 months. The
      occlusions must not extend beyond the proximal popliteal artery. For the purpose of this
      protocol, no lesion within 3 cm of the upper part of the patella may be treated. The distal
      popliteal artery must be patent with no hemodynamic stenosis as well as two calf vessels.
      Reference vessel diameter must be &gt;= 4.0 to &lt;= 6.0 mm.

      Trial participants will be randomized to the SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent or to
      balloon angioplasty only.

      Patients will be followed for twelve months post-procedure. Study examinations will be done
      at screening, procedure time, discharge, six, and twelve months post procedure.

      This study will be conducted at 8 investigational sites in The Netherlands.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic leg ischemia by Rutherford Classification (category 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5);
             duration of intermittent claudication (category 1-3) should be at least 6 months

          2. The patient should be suitable for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and
             also for stenting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Poor aortoiliac or common femoral &quot;inflow&quot;, which would be deemed inadequate to
             support a femoropopliteal bypass graft.

          2. Patient having total occlusions or severe stenosis of the iliac artery on the same
             side must be excluded.

          3. Gangrene in index limb (Rutherford category 6).
