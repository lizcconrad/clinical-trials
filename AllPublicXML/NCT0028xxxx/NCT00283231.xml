  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an uncontrolled pilot clinical trial to determine the feasibility of recruitment and
      effectiveness of a device called RESPeRATE that paces respiration to treat menopausal hot
      flashes in 12 peri- or postmenopausal women. Participants will practice paced respiration for
      15 minutes everyday for six weeks and attend assessment visits at weeks 3 and 6.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an uncontrolled pilot trial of the effects of learning paced respiration using
      RESPeRATE in 12 healthy peri- or postmenopausal women between 40 and 60 years old who report
      experiencing at least 4 hot flashes per day or 30 hot flashes per week. Participants will be
      screened by telephone, then attend a clinic visit for further screening, and a baseline visit
      for final eligibility assessment and to learn how to use the RESPeRATE. Participants will
      receive information about the use of the RESPeRATE and paced respiration from a trained staff
      member and practice using the RESPeRATE during the clinic visit. Participants will also be
      instructed how to record hot flashes in a diary. The intervention will consist of using the
      RESPeRATE device for 15 minutes daily. Outcomes will be assessed in the clinic after 3 weeks
      and 6 weeks use of the device. The main efficacy outcomes are change in number of hot flashes
      per week and change in hot flash score (number of flashes x mean severity) from baseline to 3
      and 6 weeks post-training, reported on the 7-day diary. Frequency of hot flashes will also be
      measured at baseline and 6 weeks using a 24-hour ambulatory hot flash monitor. Change in
      breathing rate will be calculated from baseline to 3 and 6 weeks and changes in sleep and
      quality of life from baseline to 6 weeks as measured by validated self-administered
      questionnaires. The mechanism of response to the RESPeRATE will be explored by measuring
      blood pressure at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks and, body mass index and 24-hour levels of
      urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol at baseline and 6 weeks. We will also draw a
      fasting blood sample at baseline and 6 weeks to measure serum lipids, glucose and insulin.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Self-report &gt;4 hot flashes per day or ≥ 30 hot flashes per week.

          2. Successful completion of a Hot Flash Diary.

          3. Willingness to attend all visits, fast before blood draws, complete all
             questionnaires, complete the hot flash diary, wear an ambulatory monitor, collect a
             24-hour urine and wear the RESPeRATE for 15 minutes per day.

          4. Agree not to use therapies that may affect hot flashes during the trial (estrogens,
             progestins, raloxifene, tamoxifen, clonidine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
             relaxation techniques or acupuncture). -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to sign an informed consent or fill out questionnaires.

          2. Use of therapies that may affect hot flashes within 4 weeks of entering the trial
             (estrogens, progestins, raloxifene, tamoxifen, clonidine, selective serotonin reuptake
             inhibitors, relaxation techniques or acupuncture).

          3. History of pulmonary disease including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

          4. Pregnant or breast feeding.

          5. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, would preclude the participant from
             being able to understand and use the RESPeRATE device or complete the trial, including
             severe illness, (e.g., active ischemic heart disease/unstable angina, severe
             congestive heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, stroke resulting in permanent
             impairment, chronic renal failure or sleep paralysis), plans to move, substance abuse,
             significant psychiatric problems, or dementia.

          6. Blood pressure during screening of ≤ 100/60 mmHg.

          7. Current use of any medication prescribed to lower blood pressure.
