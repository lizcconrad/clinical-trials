      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving bortezomib and fluorouracil together with radiation
      therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when
      given together with fluorouracil and external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients
      with stage II, stage III, or stage IV rectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered in combination with
           fluorouracil and external beam radiotherapy as preoperative or palliative treatment in
           patients with stage II-IV rectal adenocarcinoma.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the dose-effect relationship of bortezomib on NF-kappa B activation induced by
           chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Determine downstream events induced by NF-kappa B activation.

        -  Determine downstream events related to activation of p53 in response to treatment with
           chemoradiotherapy and bortezomib.

        -  Determine the rate of complete pathologic remission in patients who undergo surgical
           resection of their primary tumor.

        -  Determine the gene expression pattern of tumors by cDNA microarray analysis before and
           during treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 and fluorouracil IV
      continuously on days 2-38. Patients also undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for
      5½ weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients undergo tissue biopsy at baseline and on days 1 and 2. Samples are collected and
      evaluated by tissue microarray analysis for NF-kappa B pathway activation; cDNA analysis,
      RNase protection assay, and immunohistochemistry for analysis of downstream events induced by
      NF-kappa B activation; and modified TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end label for analysis of
      apoptosis by DNA fragmentation. NF-kappa B subunits are quantified by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. Serum samples are collected at baseline and stored for future studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
