      This trial is conducted in Africa and Middle East. The objective of the study is to compare
      glycemic control of Biphasic insulin Aspart 30 twice daily with Biphasic insulin Aspart 30
      twice daily plus Insulin Aspart, both insulin treatments with or without metformin, in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes, previously treated with Biphasic Human Insulin 30/70.
