  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ozone can cause acute airway inflammation in both asthmatics and normal volunteers. However,
      in asthmatics ozone can cause episodes of worsening of asthma. We want to learn if chronic
      allergic response, known as &quot;IgE-induced airway inflammation&quot; is what causes the increased
      inflammation in response to ozone. To do this we will examine the response to ozone in a
      group of asthmatics treated with omalizumab, a medicine available and approved for use in
      people with asthma, or a placebo control. The placebo for this study is inert physiologic
      saline (&quot;salt water&quot;) which contains no omalizumab. Both the omalizumab and the placebo will
      be administered as an injection under the skin. Omalizumab, also called Xolair, is a
      humanized monoclonal antibody, which means that it originally was produced in mice, then
      genetically engineered to look more like human than mouse antibody. Omalizumab inactivates
      IgE, a protein our own immune systems make as part of allergic reactions. The purpose of this
      study is to test the hypothesis that omalizumab, by blocking this aspect of allergic
      reactions, will decrease the number of inflammatory cells in the airway after ozone
      challenge. We also hypothesize that omalizumab will decrease the effects of ozone on changes
      in lung function, mucociliary clearance (a measure of how quickly mucus clears form the
      airway) and airway reactivity. Airway reactivity is a measure of how sensitive the airways
      are to a medication used to diagnose asthma, called methacholine. We will examine these as
      additional information we can learn during the course of the study. This is a blinded study,
      meaning that neither you nor the researchers know if you get the active drug or placebo, but
      that information can be obtained if needed. The placebo is an injection of inert
      physiological saline (&quot;salt water&quot;) which contains no omalizumab.

      Dosages of ozone and omalizumab

      Ozone:The 0.4 ppm ozone exposures will be conducted in an ozone exposure chamber. Each
      subject will be exposed to ozone for 2 hours. During exposures, subjects will perform four 15
      minute bouts of moderate exercise (minute ventilation or VE = 30 40 L/min) on a treadmill,
      each separated by 15 minutes of seated rest. Minute ventilation is measured for 2-3 minutes
      after about 4 minutes of exercise during the first exercise period, and again at about 12
      minutes of exercise. It is then measured at about 12 minutes into each exercise period.

      Omalizumab: Dosing for omalizumab will be consistent with doses approved for use in moderate
      or severe allergic asthma. The only exception to its indicated use is that we will be
      examining its effect in mild (rather than moderate or severe) allergic asthmatics, a group we
      have recruited for ozone challenge. IgE within the following ranges and body weights for
      subcutaneous omalizumab dosing:

        1. IgE â‰¥30-100 int. units/mL: 30-90 kg: 150 mg every 4 weeks

        2. IgE &gt;100-200 int. units/mL: 30-90 kg: 300 mg every 4 weeks

        3. IgE &gt;200-300 int. units/mL:30-60 kg: 300 mg every 4 weeks &gt;60-90 kg: 225 mg every 2
           weeks

        4. IgE &gt;300-400 int. units/mL:30-70 kg: 225 mg every 2 weeks&gt;70-90 kg: 300 mg every 2 weeks

        5. IgE &gt;400-500 int. units/mL:30-70 kg: 300 mg every 2 weeks&gt;70-90 kg: 375 mg every 2 weeks

        6. IgE &gt;500-600 int. units/mL:30-60 kg: 300 mg every 2 weeks&gt;60-70 kg: 375 mg every 2
           weeks&gt;70 kg: Do not administer dose

        7. IgE &gt;600-700 int. units/mL:30-60 kg: 375 mg every 2 weeks

      Subjects for whom the IgE level and weight indicate that no dose will be given will be
      excluded from the study.
