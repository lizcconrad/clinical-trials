  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to compare the effectiveness of two types of
      complimentary medicine treatments to see if they will reduce the fatigue experienced by
      breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. The treatments being studied are Polarity
      Therapy and Massage Therapy.

      The primary study hypothesis is that Polarity Therapy will be efficacious in relieving
      fatigue in breast cancer patients receiving radiation treatments.

      The secondary hypothesis is that Polarity Therapy will be efficacious in improving
      health-related quality of life in breast cancer patients receiving radiation treatments.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized three-arm clinical trial of an intervention examining the efficacy of
      Polarity Therapy for the relief of fatigue associated with radiation treatments in breast
      cancer patients. Patients who meets the eligibility criteria and who have signed the consent
      form will be randomized to one of three trial arms: 1) Polarity Treatment 2) Massage
      treatment 3) Standard Care. Three treatments will be administered in the 4th, 5th, and 6th
      calendar weeks of radiation treatment. There will be weekly blood draws to assess cytokine
      levels. In addition, 6 saliva samples will be gathered per day for 2 days during each of the
      4 study weeks to assess cortisol levels. Saliva samples will be completed by the participant
      at home. An actigraph will be worn for the 28 day study period to assess activity and sleep.
      Patients randomized to the Standard Care Arm will receive a Polarity or Massage treatment
      gratis following the completion of the study.
