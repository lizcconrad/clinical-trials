  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the question is addressed if zoledronic acid (Zometa, Novartis Pharma)could be
      of clinical benefit for patients with myelofibrosis and myeloid metaplasia (MMM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentre phase II study in adult patients with documented MMM and
      requiring therapy for their disease. Patients will be treated every 3 weeks with 4 mg
      zoledronic acid (Zometa), administered by a 15 min. intravenous infusion. Study duration is
      36 weeks (12 infusions). After the study it is recommended to continue treatment until
      disease progression, or the occurrence of unacceptable treatment-related toxicity.

      Objectives of the trial are:

      Primary objectives: the effect of monthly infusion of zoledronic acid 4 mg on:

      hemoglobin level, spleen size

      Secondary objectives the effect of monthly infusion of zoledronic acid 4 mg on: red blood
      cell transfusion need performance status constitutional symptoms leukocyte count thrombocyte
      count bone marrow fibrosis serum LDH

        Inclusion Criteria:

        male or female and at least 18 years-of-age histologically confirmed diagnosis of
        myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). This includes patients with agnogenic myeloid
        metaplasia (also known as idiopathic myelofibrosis) and patients with a preceding history
        of polycythemia vera or essential thrombocytemia (also known as post-polycytemic
        myelofibrosis). (see Appendix A) patients with low, intermediate and high risk disease
        categories (following the Dupriez score) may be included presence of measurable, clinically
        relevant disease manifestations (especially for low risk patients) ECOG performance status
        of 0, 1 or 2 life expectancy of at least 3 months Women of childbearing potential must use
        a medically acceptable form of contraception during the study and must have a negative
        urine or serum pregnancy test within 7 days of randomization written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        diseases associated with secondary myelofibrosis, such as metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma,
        myelodysplasia, hairy cell leukemia, mast cell disease, acute leukemia (including M7
        disease or acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis) presence of the chromosomal translocation
        t(9:22) or molecular BCR/ABL rearrangement as detected by RT-PCR in bone marrow or
        peripheral blood any anti-myelofibrosis drug therapy during the last 4 weeks. This includes
        chemotherapy, androgens, steroids, thalidomide, hematopoietic growth factors or any other
        investigational drug patients that have received bisphosphonates in the previous 3 months
        known allergy or intolerance to bisphosphonates abnormal renal function as evidenced by: a
        calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min (creatinine clearance (CrCl) is calculated
        using the Cockcroft and Gault formula) (see Appendix F) corrected serum calcium &lt; 8.0 mg/dL
        . Corrected serum calcium (mg/dl) = measured calcium (mg/dl) + 0.8*[4 - patient serum
        albumin (g/dl)] patients with nonmalignant conditions which would confound the evaluation
        of the primary endpoint, impair tolerance of therapy, or prevent compliance to the
        protocol, including: uncontrolled infections uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diseases
        with influence on bone metabolism such as Paget's disease or uncontrolled thyroid or
        parathyroid dysfunction cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, pulmonary and
        neurologic/psychiatric diseases which would prevent prolonged follow-up current active
        dental problems including infection of the teeth or jawbone (maxilla or mandibula); dental
        or fixture trauma, or a current or prior diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the jaw, of exposed
        bone in the mouth, or of slow healing after dental procedures recent (within 6 weeks) or
        planned dental or jaw surgery (e.g. extraction, implants) patients with a history of
        non-compliance to medical regimens and patients who are considered potentially unreliable
        and/or not cooperative patients treated with any systemic investigational drug within the
        past 4 weeks or topical investigational drug within the past 7 days pregnant or breast
        feeding females
