      The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      Extracorporeal Albumin Dialysis (ECAD) using the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System
      (MARS®) device in improving severe HE by 2 grades compared to Standard Medical Therapy (SMT)
      in patients with chronic End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) during a 5 day study period.

    <textblock>
      The trial was a two-group unblinded multicenter clinical trial. Patients were randomized to
      receive either SMT or SMT plus five days MARS® treatment. The trial design called for
      patients to receive a baseline hepatic encephalopathy (HE) assessment on admission, and at
      12-hour intervals, giving 10 HE measurements during treatment using a refinement / adaptation
      of the Conn West Haven HE Criteria HE scoring system

    <description>The primary outcome measure was a two-point reduction in HE score from the the randomization grade (i.e. Grade 4 improved to at least Grade 2 and Grade 3 improved to at least Grade 1). Two summary statistics were used in the analysis: 1) The proportion of HE readings within the five-day treatment period showing an improvement of at least two points over baseline 2) The time from admission to the first two-point improvement in HE score.</description>
