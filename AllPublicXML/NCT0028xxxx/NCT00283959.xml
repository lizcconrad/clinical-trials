  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information on the safety of AT1001 (migalastat
      hydrochloride) and how AT1001 works in patients with Fabry disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of AT1001 given orally to patients with
      Fabry disease. Patients will visit the clinic 4 weeks prior to dosing to determine their
      eligibility for the study, and then return for a second visit for baseline and safety
      assessments, which will include skin, cardiac, and renal biopsies. Patients will receive oral
      doses of AT1001 for 12 weeks and will visit the clinic 3 more times, once every 4 weeks, for
      evaluation and tests. Skin, cardiac, and renal biopsies, and functional assessments will be
      performed at the end of the 12 week period. Patients may be given the opportunity to enter a
      study extension phase for an additional 36 weeks, which will require three more clinic
      visits, and a final set of functional tests and biopsies. All study participants will have a
      final follow up visit 2 weeks after the end of the study.

          -  Hemizygous for Fabry disease

          -  Have a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease with a documented missense gene mutation

          -  Have enhanceable enzyme activity based on in vitro tests

          -  Have documented evidence of cardiac and/or renal dysfunction (e.g., abnormal ECG, left
             ventricular hypertrophy, renal insufficiency)

          -  Must be previously untreated by ERT or substrate depletion for Fabry disease and be
             willing to undergo two kidney, two cardiac, and three skin biopsies

          -  Agree to be sexually abstinent or use a condom with spermicide when engaging in sexual
             activity during the course of the study and for a period of 30 days following their
             completion of the study

          -  Willing and able to sign an informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of organ transplant

          -  Serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL on Day -2

             for any indication

          -  Participated in a clinical trial in the last 30 days

          -  Any other condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the
