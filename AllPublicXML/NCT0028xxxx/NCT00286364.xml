  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want to investigate if early follicular phase downregulation and androgen priming, by use
      of GnRH antagonist, aromatase inhibitor and hCG before COH in a short protocol, shows signs
      of improvement compared to standard short antagonist protocol
