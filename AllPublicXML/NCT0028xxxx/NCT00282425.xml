  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scleroderma is disease believed to be due to immune cells, cells which normally protect the
      body but are now causing damage to the body. There has not been any treatment that has been
      effective in treating this disease. The likelihood of progression of the disease to severe
      disability and death is high. This study is designed to examine whether treating patients
      with high dose Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine (drugs which reduce the function of your
      immune system) and CAMPATH-1H (a protein that kills the immune cells that are thought to be
      causing the disease), followed by return of blood stem cells that have been previously
      collected from patients brother or sister will stop or reverse the disease. The purpose of
      the Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine and CAMPATH-1H is to decrease immune system. The purpose of
      the stem cell infusion is to restore blood production, which will be severely impaired by the
      Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine and CAMPATH-1H, and to produce a normal immune system that will
      no longer attack the body.

        Patient Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 to 55 years old

          2. An established diagnosis of scleroderma (84)

          3. Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma with involvement proximal to the elbow or knee and a
             Rodnan score (see Appendix III) of &gt; 14 (85)

        And one of the following:

          1. DLCO &lt; 80% of predicted or decrease in lung function (TLC, DLCO or FEV1) of 10% or
             more over 12 months

          2. Active alveolitis on bronchoalveolar lavage

          3. Pulmonary fibrosis or alveolitis on CT scan or CXR

          4. Elevated ESR greater than or equal to 25mm/hour confirmed on a second occasion at
             least two weeks apart without evidence of active infectious process.

          5. Abnormal EKG (low QRS voltage, or ventricular hypertrophy) or left ventricle (LV)
             diastolic dysfunction (expressed by an inverted E/A ratio which represents early and
             late filling of the LV during atrial contraction) or LV wall thickness

          6. Since pulmonary disease independent of skin score (NEJM, 2006, 345:25 2655-2709)
             carries a poor prognosis, patient may be enroled for only lung involvement defined as
             active alveolitis on BAL or ground-glass opacity on CT, a DLCO &lt; 80% predicted or
             decrease in lung function (TLC), DLCO, FVC) of 10% or more in last 12 months.

        Patient Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Poor performance status (ECOG &gt; or =2) at the time of entry, unless due to disease.

          2. Significant end organ damage such as:

               1. LVEF &lt;40% or deterioration of LVEF during exercise test on MUGA or echocardiogram

               2. Untreated life-threatening arrhythmia

               3. Active ischemic heart disease or heart failure

               4. DLCO less than 45% of predicted value, unless due to disease.

               5. Pulmonary hypertension (estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure &gt;40 mmHg
                  by Doppler echocardiography or measurement by pulmonary arterial catheter)

               6. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl

               7. Liver cirrhosis, transaminases &gt;3x of normal limits or bilirubin &gt;2.0 unless due
                  to Gilberts disease

          3. HIV positive

          4. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or any other illness that in the opinion of the
             investigators would jeopardize the ability of the patient to tolerate aggressive
             treatment

          5. Prior history of malignancy except localized basal cell or squamous skin cancer. Other
             malignancies for which the patient is judged to be cured by local surgical therapy,
             such as (but not limited to) head and neck cancer, or stage I or II breast cancer will
             be considered on an individual basis.

          6. Positive pregnancy test, inability or unable to pursue effective means of birth
             control, failure to willingly accept or comprehend irreversible sterility as a side
             effect of therapy

          7. Psychiatric illness or mental deficiency making compliance with treatment or informed
             consent impossible

          8. Inability to give informed consent

          9. Age &lt;18 or &gt; 55 years old

        Donor Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Donor must be a HLA identical sibling or HLA matched cord blood donor

          2. If donor is HLA matched sibling, donor must be &gt; 18 years of age and less than 50
             years old

          3. If multiple HLA matched donors are available, preference will be given to same sex,
             same CMV status, or in the case of cord blood higher nucleated cell count

          4. If donor is HLA matched cord blood, cord blood stem cells will be obtained from the

             internationally recognized registry or, if a match is not available, from Stemcyte
             (626-821-9860) which is a commercial registry that specializes in minority donors. One
             unit of HLA matched cord blood unit will be infused on day zero
