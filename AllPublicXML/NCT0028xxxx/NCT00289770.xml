  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term persistence of hepatitis A and B
      antibodies at Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 after subjects received their first dose of a 3
      dose primary vaccination schedule of combined hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine. The Protocol
      Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at Year
      11-15.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up study at Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 after primary vaccination
      with GSK Biologicals' hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine (three-dose schedule with 3 different
      lots). To evaluate the long-term antibody persistence, volunteers will be bled at Years 11,
      12, 13, 14 and 15 after the first vaccine dose of the primary vaccination course to determine
      their anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody concentrations.

      No additional subjects will be recruited in the course of this extension study. If a subject
      has become seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies or lost anti-HBs seroprotection
      concentrations at the long-term blood sampling time point (i.e. Years 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15),
      he/ she will be offered an additional vaccine dose.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Anti-hepatitis A (Anti-HAV) Antibody Concentrations Equal to or Above Cut-off Value</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Cut-off value was defined as 15 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). This was considered as seropositivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Anti-hepatitis B Surface Antigen (Anti-HBs) Antibody Concentrations Equal to or Above Cut-off Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Cut-off values were defined 3.3 mIU/mL for the in-house anti-HBs assay and 6.2 mIU/mL for the ChemiLuminescence ImmunoAssay, which was also considered as seropositivity, and 10 mIU/mL.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anti-HAV and Anti-HBs Antibody Concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>Concentrations are expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in mIU/mL.
The laboratory assay was changed from Year 13 to Year 14 to in-house ELISA and at Year 15 to CLIA for anti-HBs GMCs.Thus for the sake of bridging, blood samples corresponding to Year 14 previously tested with ELISA were re-tested with CLIA (Year 14*).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anti-HBs Antibody Concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>at Year 11, pre-additional vaccine, after additional dose of Engerix</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects who lost seroprotective concentrations for anti-HBs (&lt; 10 mIU/mL) at any of the LT follow-up timepoints received an additional dose of Engerix after year 15.
Two subjects were eligible for this after Year 11.
3.29 in the table means a concentration of &lt; 3.3 mIU/mL.
As the concentration was calculated per subject no mean concentration was calculated and also no measure of dispersion.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects, Receiving an Additional Vaccination of Engerix, With an Anamnestic Response</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post additional dose of Engerix</time_frame>
    <description>Anamnestic response was assessed in subjects receiving an additional vaccine dose of Engerix. Two subjects were found eligible at Year 11 for this additional vaccine dose.
Anamnestic response was defined as:
post-additional vaccination anti-HBs concentration &gt;= 10 mIU/mL in subject seronegative before additional dose.
4-fold increase post-additional dose compared to pre-additional vaccine time point.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Solicited Local and General Symptoms Assessed</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 4-day follow-up period after additional vaccination with Engerix</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling. Solicited general symptoms were fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal, headache.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Unsolicited Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 30-day follow-up period after additional Engerix vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited AE covers any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 30-day follow-up period after additional Engerix vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Determined by the Investigator to Have a Causal Relationship to Primary Vaccination or Due to Lack of Vaccine Efficacy</measure>

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects who came back at a follow-up, did not necessarily come back at an earlier timepoint.
