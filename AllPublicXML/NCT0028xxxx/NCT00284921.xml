  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively evaluate in de novo kidney transplant recipients, hepatitis C positive, the
      clinical outcomes of an immunosuppressive regimen of EC-MPS free of steroids in comparison
      with a regimen of EC-MPS with standard steroids, as measured by the hepatic function tests
      (ALT/AST) after 12 months treatment.

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Patients hepatitis C positive (serology test within the last 12 months and determined
             by third-generation assay).

          2. Recipients of heart-beating cadaveric, living unrelated or living related non-HLA
             identical donor kidney transplant, treated with basiliximab and CsA-ME as primary
             immunosuppression.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Multi-organ recipients (e.g. double kidney, kidney and pancreas or kidney and liver)
             or previous transplant with any other organ.

          2. Kidneys from non-heart beating donors.

          3. ABO incompatibility against the donor.

          4. Patients with panel reactive antibodies of &gt;50% at most recent assessment prior to
             transplantation and /or prior graft lost due to immunological reasons in the first six
             months post-transplantation or patients who are considered to be at increased risk of
             acute rejection by the principal investigator Additional protocol defined
             inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
