  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, prospective and multicenter phase III study. Two-hundred-sixty-two
      (262) patients on each arm will be recruited in the study.

      The primary objective is time to disease progression. All patients must be treated with first
      line chemotherapy, consisting of one of the following regimens: a) ET (epirubicin 90 mg/sqm
      day 1 plus paclitaxel 200 mg/sqm (3 hour infusion) day 1, or b) AT (doxorubicin 50 mg/sqm day
      1 plus paclitaxel 200 mg/sqm (3 hour infusion) day 2, administered on a 3 weekly schedule.

      Patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease are eligible for MANTA1
      study.

      The expected median progression free survival of metastatic breast cancer patients who
      achieve a disease control after first line chemotherapy was estimated to be 10 months. The
      minimal improvement, justifying the adoption of maintenance paclitaxel, was estimated to be
      at least 3 months. With 262 eligible patients on each arm, the trial will have a power of 80%
      to detect a 30% improvement in median progression free survival, testing at the two-sided .05
      significance level.
