  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to compare the effect of 156 weeks of treatment with MK-0966 (Rofecoxib)
      versus placebo on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas (growths that occur on the inside
      (the lining) of the large intestine, also known as the colon) in patients with a history of
      colorectal adenomas.
