  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is common practice in elective colorectal surgery. In
      recent literature the value of MBP is subject of discussion. We conducted a multicenter,
      randomized study with the goal of comparing outcome of elective colorectal resections and
      primary anastomoses with and without mechanical bowel preparation in terms of anastomotic
      leakage and other septic complications.

      Within the setting of a multicenter randomized trial,1433 patients were randomized before
      elective colorectal surgery to receive either MBP or to have no MBP but a normal meal on the
      day before operation. The primary endpoint was anastomotic leakage. Secondary endpoints were
      septic complications (wound infection, urinary infection, pneumonia, pelvic abscesses),
      fascia dehiscence and death.

      The incidence of anastomotic leakage was similar in both groups: 5.1% in patients without MBP
      versus 4.9% in patients with MBP (p=0.93; 95% confidence interval for the difference (no MBP
      minus MBP) ranges from â€“2.3% tot +2.7%). There were no significant differences in other
      septic complications, fascia dehiscence, or mortality. Fecal contamination, number of days
      until resumption of a normal diet, and duration of hospital stay were similar in both groups.

      This study shows that elective colorectal surgery can be safely done without MBP. Therefore,
      MBP should be abandoned in elective colorectal surgery.
