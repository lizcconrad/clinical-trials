    <textblock>
      Patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma will undergo transarterial
      chemoembolisation (TACE) as clinically indicated and will be randomized to receive
      bevacizumab or placebo every 2 weeks up to 1 year. Tumor response will be assessed using MR
      of the liver and PET-scanning.

      It will be tested whether the addition of bevacizumab as angiogenic inhibitor will slow down
      tumor progression, reduce the need for re-embolisation and will improve patient survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TACE is an established therapy for patients with advanced stage HCC not amenable to liver
      transplantation or resection and has been shown to significantly improve survival in these
      patients compared to no treatment (8). TACE takes advantage of the predominantly arterial
      blood supply of malignant liver tumors contrary to the surrounding normal liver tissue, which
      receives more blood supply through the portal venous system.

      TACE leads to predictable tumor necrosis until new blood vessels grow into the tumor margins
      to support tumor growth. Quite often after cutting off the blood supply through the hepatic
      artery, the tumor induces active angiogenesis to promote collateral blood vessel growth from
      liver capsule arteries or collaterals from the gastroduodenal artery. VEGF seems to be an
      important player in inducing this angiogenetic activity and tumor control and survival of
      patients after TACE have been linked to serum VEGF-levels with higher levels showing reduced
      survival.

      Inhibition of these neoangiogenetic activity could lead to significantly improved in tumor
      control and survival in patients with advanced stage HCC.

      2. STUDY OBJECTIVE

        -  to assess the effectiveness of bevacizumab in combination with TACE as measured by
           patients without tumor progression on MRT after 3 cycles of TACE as well as the number
           of TACE cycles applied for recurrent tumor after a maximum of one year treatment with
           bevacizumab

        -  to assess collateral tumor vessel growth on MRT / CT
