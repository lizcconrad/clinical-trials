  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently there has been an increased awareness in the need for adequate sedation and pain
      control for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Fentanyl is an opioid commonly used
      in Pediatric ICU patients to decrease pain and increase sedation. Although opioids (e.g.
      morphine and fentanyl) provide excellent pain relief, they have many side effects including
      dependence, tolerance and withdrawal. These side effects lead to increased doses in order to
      maintain pain control and/or sedation. There have been a few adult studies pointing to some
      possible treatments. For example, giving low dose naloxone along with opioids. Adult studies
      show that this combination not only decreases the frequency of opioid side effects, but also
      improves pain control and prevents the development of tolerance. We propose that children who
      receive low dose naloxone infusions along with fentanyl infusions will demonstrate: 1)
      decreased total daily doses of Fentanyl, 2) decreased frequency of withdrawal and 3)
      increased pain and sedation control. In this randomized, blinded prospective trial we will
      enroll 168 Pediatric ICU patients. Patients will receive either low dose naloxone or placebo
      simultaneously with their fentanyl infusion. Pain and sedation will be assessed using the
      Modified Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MMAAS). The fentanyl infusion will be increased to
      provide adequate pain control and/or sedation. Naloxone infusion will not be adjusted.
      Approximately 48 hours prior to removal from the ventilator, patients will have their
      fentanyl infusions decreased while being monitored for withdrawal. Patients showing signs of
      withdrawal will receive methadone, an opioid taken by mouth. Once off fentanyl, naloxone will
      be stopped. Patients will continue to be monitored for withdrawal for 4 days or until ICU
      discharge. If this study works, patients who receive low dose naloxone along with opioid
      infusions will have less tolerance and dependence and demonstrate less withdrawal. This may
      cause shorter Intensive Care Unit stays.

      Objective:

      To determine if Naloxone administration to pediatric ICU patients on Fentanyl infusions
      require less Fentanyl compared to control patients.

      Background:

      During recent years there has been an increased awareness of the need for adequate sedation
      and analgesia of critically ill pediatric patients. The choices of the treatment of pain are
      numerous, but in the Pediatric ICU parenteral opioids are most commonly used. At equipotent
      doses, all mu agonist opioids (Morphine, Fentanyl, Meperidine and Codeine) produce similar
      physiologic effects and side effects. Opioids can cause hypoventilation, hypotension,
      constipation and cause urinary retention. Patients receiving continuous opioid infusions
      experience not only these physiologic side effects, but also the side effects of dependence,
      tolerance and withdrawal. These last side effects complicate medical issues and contribute to
      longer ICU admissions.

      Anand wrote a review article addressing the problems of drug dependence and withdrawal in the
      PICU. In his article he discussed the mechanisms, pharmacology and presentation of opioid
      withdrawal. He also discussed prevention of opioid withdrawal including such therapies as the
      concomitant infusion of opioid agonists and low dose Naloxone. Tobias also wrote a review
      article describing the consequences of the prolonged use of sedative and analgesic agents in
      the Pediatric ICU. Among the problems of note are tolerance, dependence and withdrawal in the
      Pediatric ICU. He discussed several possible therapies for the treatment and prevention of
      opioid withdrawal. Among these was the concomitant infusion of opioid agonist and low dose
      Naloxone, an opioid agonist. Naloxone selectively blocks those opioid receptors that are
      coupled with stimulatory G proteins, thus blocking mechanisms for super-activation of the
      cAMP pathway. This improves the efficacy of analgesia and prevents the development of acute
      tolerance.

      Recent preclinical and clinical studies (Crain, Gan, Levine, Joshi) have shown that
      co-treatments with extremely low doses of opioid receptor antagonists can markedly enhance
      the efficacy specific to Morphine and related analgesics. Crain did studies using Naloxone,
      in-vitro and in-vivo, that show direct competitive antagonism of Gs coupled excitatory opioid
      receptor functions. This markedly enhances Morphine’s antinociceptive potency and
      simultaneously attenuates opioid tolerance and dependence.

      Studies by Gan and Levine with adult post-op hysterectomy patients in one study and adult
      patients following tooth extraction in a separate study show that low dose Naloxone could
      enhance the analgesic potency of opioid agonists. The striking consistency of these studies
      provides evidence that clinical treatment of pain can be improved by administering opioid
      analgesics together with low doses of excitatory opioid receptor antagonists. The possibility
      of these same effects occurring in Pediatric ICU patients has not been explored.

      Hypothesis:

      Children admitted to the Pediatric ICU requiring continuous infusions of opioids who receive
      low dose Naloxone infusions will have a 30% decrease in the maximum total daily dose of
      Fentanyl and a decreased need for escalating doses of continuous infusions during ICU
      admission.

      Study Design:

      This will be a prospective double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled study. Patients
      admitted to the ICU and consented for the study will be started on either Naloxone continuous
      infusion of 0.25micrograms/kilogram/hour (mcg/kg/hr) or normal saline continuous infusion at
      equal rate and volume to be determined by the pharmacy. The dose or rate of Naloxone infusion
      will not be manipulated throughout the study.

      During the first four hours of ICU admission the patients will be assessed hourly via the
      Modified Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MMAAS, see appendix 1). Adjustments will be made to
      Fentanyl and Midazolam infusions according to protocol for patients not achieving a sedation
      score of –1 to +1 (see figure 1). Patients with score of greater than +1 and associated
      tachycardia/hypertension will receive a bolus of Fentanyl and repeat MMAAS in 30 minutes. The
      Fentanyl bolus will be equal to one hour total dose of Fentanyl infusion with considerations
      for weight. Dosage will be adjusted for weight accordingly: 1mcg/kg for children less than
      50kg and 0.5mcg/kg for children greater than 50kg. If repeat MMAAS score is again greater
      than +1 with hypertension/tachycardia the patient will receive another bolus of Fentanyl
      (dose as denoted above) and will have increase of Fentanyl infusion by 1mcg/kg/hr. The
      patient will have repeat MMAAS 30 minutes after change. If repeat MMAAS score still greater
      than +1 a physician will be called for assessment and intervention. If the first repeat MMAAS
      score is greater than +1 with no hypertension/tachycardia the patient will receive a bolus of
      Midazolam. The Midazolam bolus will be either equal to one hour total dose of Midazolam
      infusion or 0.1mg/kg with considerations for weight. Dosage will be adjusted according for
      weight: 0.1mg/kg for children less than 20kg or 0.05mg/kg for children greater than 20kg. The
      patient will have repeat MMAAS in 30 minutes. If second MMAAS score still greater than +1 a
      physician will be called for assessment and intervention. If MMAAS score at any time between
      +1 and –1 then repeat MMAAS will be repeated at next scheduled time per protocol (see figure
      2).

      If patients require an increase of more than 2 mcg/kg/hr within 3 hours, then the patient
      will have Midazolam either started or increased. Dosage will be 0.1 mg/kg/hr for children
      less than 20kg and 0.05 mg/kg/hr for children over 20kg for starting Midazolam. Dosage for
      increase in current infusion will be 0.1mg/kg/hr for children less than 20kg and 0.05mg/kg/hr
      for children over 20kg.

      Patients will be assessed hourly, using the MMAAS, for the first four hours of admission to
      the study and then every 2 hours for the subsequent 8 hours. After this initial time period
      patients will be assessed every 4 hours until completion of the study. Each assessment will
      consist of recording the sedation score, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate,
      ventilator set rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, infusion rate of Fentanyl and/or
      Midazolam and the need for any intervention and what that intervention included. Patients
      with signs of increased pain/discomfort will be assessed using the sedation scale as needed
      between scheduled assessments. Interventions will be made per protocol as needed between
      scheduled assessments. Once pt MMAAS score between +1 and –1 the patient will resume
      scheduled MMAAS evaluations according to protocol.

      If the patient has a sedation score of &lt;-1 on MMAAS, among any of the scheduled or
      intermittent assessments, the Midazolam infusion will be decreased by 0.05 mg/kg/hr and the
      patient will be reassessed in two hours. If there is no Midazolam infusion then, the Fentanyl
      infusion will be decreased by 0.5mcg/kg/hr and the patient will be reassessed in two hours.
      If the patient continues to have pain score of &lt;-1 on repeat MMAAS then the Fentanyl or
      Midazolam continuous infusion will again be decreased as denoted above. The patient will
      again be reassessed in two hours. If the patient continues to have MMAAS score of &lt;-1 a
      physician will be notified for assessment and intervention. If repeat MMAAS score &gt;+1 then
      Fentanyl infusion will be increased and noted above and the patient will be reassessed in 30
      min. If second repeat MMAAS not between +1 and –1 then a physician will be notified for
      assessment and intervention. If at any time MMAAS score between +1 and –1 then MMAAS will be
      repeated per protocol. If following first decrease in infusion and repeat MMAAS score &gt;+1
      then infusion previous adjusted will be increased to prior dose. The patient will be
      reassessed in 30 minutes. If repeat MMAAS score &gt;+1 with hypertension/tachycardia then
      Fentanyl infusion will be increased as noted above. If MMAAS score &gt;+1 and not
      hypertension/tachycardia then Midazolam infusion will be increases as noted above. After
      intervention MMAAS will be repeated in 30 minutes. If repeat MMAAS score remains &gt;+1 then a
      physician will be notified for assessment and intervention (see figure 3).

      As the patients approach 48-72 hours near the end of the need for continuous infusion or
      opioid, per decision by the medical staff, they will be weaned from infusions. The Naloxone
      infusion will remain unchanged. The Naloxone infusion or normal saline infusion will be
      discontinued when the Fentanyl infusion is discontinued. The Fentanyl infusions will be
      decreased by 25% of original dose every 12 hours until off. Once patients start the Fentanyl
      wean they will have withdrawal assessed every six hours and as needed using the Modified
      Narcotic Withdrawal Scale (MNAS, see appendix 2). Patients receiving two successive scores of
      8 or above will be determined to have withdrawal. These patients will be started on Methadone
      as directed by the primary team and Fentanyl infusion will continue to be decreased by 25%
      every 12 hours until off. As patients are weaned from continuous infusions they will continue
      to have assessments every 6 hours using MNAS until infusions are discontinued. Once the
      continuous infusion of Fentanyl is discontinued the patient information will continue to be
      monitored using MNAS and vital signs stated earlier for 4 days or until ICU discharge.

      Any need for reinstitution of continuous infusion of Fentanyl and the medical reason for such
      action will be noted. Increases in oral agents after receiving the first four doses will be
      noted. The need for intermittent boluses of IV analgesia or sedation during the weaning and
      associated medical reasons will be noted. These things will be monitored for the duration of
      the study.

      Patients may receive bolus of any medication as ordered by physicians for procedures without
      interfering with the study. Notation of such action will be made with next assessment. If at
      any time a physician deems it necessary to begin a medication not classified as an opioid or
      benzodiazepine the patient will be removed from the study. If at any time a physician begins
      a scheduled dose of an additional opioid or benzodiazepine to total more than one of each
      class the patient will be removed from the study.

      Adverse events (nausea, vomiting, sweating, tachycardia, increased blood pressure,
      tremulousness, seizures and cardiac arrest) will be noted in the medical record. If medical
      reasons for such events are ruled out then the patient will be unblinded from the study.

      Statistical Analysis An SPSS software random number generator was used to create a permuted
      block randomization schedule. Patient assignment was unknown to all investigators and medical
      team members, with the exception of the PICU pharmacist.

      Power analysis was based upon an assumed power of 80%, an effect size of 30% reduction in
      maximum cumulative daily dose of fentanyl, and historical data for maximum daily fentanyl
      dosing in the PICU at Children’s Medical Center Dallas (Between January and August 2002, the
      cumulative maximum daily fentanyl dose of 428 PICU patients was 79 mcg/kg with a standard
      deviation of ± 47 mcg/kg). Thus, the sample size was determined to be 62 per group (total
      N=124). The alpha criterion for significance was considered 0.05.

      All parametric and nonparametric data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows and Microsoft
      Excel software packages. Interim monitoring at the midpoint of the study was performed by an
      independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which consisted of both internal and
      external reviewers. O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries and Lan-DeMets spending functions
      were employed in the analysis.
