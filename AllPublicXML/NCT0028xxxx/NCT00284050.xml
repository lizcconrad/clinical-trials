    <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed on both eyes during every study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction. VA measurements were performed with the patient in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters as described in the Study Operations Manual.</description>

    <description>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was assessed on both eyes at every study visit. These assessments were performed by trained personnel at the sites. OCT imaging was performed using the Zeiss Humphrey System Model 2000 (or later) with version A6.1 software running under Windows 95 or Windows 98. The analysis of the OCT images were performed by the Photographic Reading Center which provided a study manual and training materials. OCT operators, systems and software were certified prior to any evaluation of study patients.</description>

    <description>Participants received monthly intravitreal injections with 0.3 mg ranibizumab (6 mg/ml) for up to 12 months. At each monthly visit from month 1 and onwards, the evaluating physician decided whether an increase in the dose to 0.6 mg was needed according to set criteria. If the dose was increased, all subsequent administrations were of the higher dose unless treatment had been withheld for more than 45 days (for any reason), in which case injections restarted with the initial dose. Laser photocoagulation was permitted as rescue treatment for the study eye after 3 consecutive monthly injections.</description>

If the dose was increased, all subsequent administrations were of the higher dose unless treatment had been withheld for more than 45 days (for any reason), in which case injections restarted with the initial dose.

        <title>Difference Between the Baseline Level of Visual Acuity (Letters) of the Study Eye and the Mean Visual Acuity Averaged Over All Monthly Post-baseline Assessments From Month 1 to Month 12</title>
        <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed on both eyes during every study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction. VA measurements were performed with the patient in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters as described in the Study Operations Manual.</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS): All patients who received at least one application of study treatment and had at least one post-baseline assessment for BCVA. A Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach was used; missing values were replaced by the mean of the last observation before and the first observation after the missing time-point.</population>

            <description>Participants received monthly intravitreal injections with 0.3 mg ranibizumab (6 mg/ml) for up to 12 months. At each monthly visit from month 1 and onwards, the evaluating physician decided whether an increase in the dose to 0.6 mg was needed according to set criteria. If the dose was increased, all subsequent administrations were of the higher dose unless treatment had been withheld for more than 45 days (for any reason), in which case injections restarted with the initial dose. Laser photocoagulation was permitted as rescue treatment for the study eye after 3 consecutive monthly injections.</description>

        <description>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was assessed on both eyes at every study visit. These assessments were performed by trained personnel at the sites. OCT imaging was performed using the Zeiss Humphrey System Model 2000 (or later) with version A6.1 software running under Windows 95 or Windows 98. The analysis of the OCT images were performed by the Photographic Reading Center which provided a study manual and training materials.
