  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with paclitaxel and
      carboplatin works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma. Bortezomib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may
      help paclitaxel and carboplatin kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to
      these drugs

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the confirmed tumor response rate and adverse event profile of bortezomib,
      carboplatin, and paclitaxel as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate time to tumor progression, overall survival, and duration of response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, and 8 and
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
