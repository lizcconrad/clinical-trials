  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to see what happens to breast density in healthy postmenopausal
      women after treatment with letrozole in one year, compared with treatment with placebo for
      one year. Other goals of the study include determining if there is a connection between
      estrogen level and breast density for women in the study and collecting information about the
      quality of life of those taking part in the study.

      -  Patients will be randomized into one of two study groups. Group 1 will receive letrozole
           and Group 2 will receive placebo. This is a double-blind trial so neither the patient or
           the doctor will know what treatment group they are assigned to.

        -  If the patient is in Group 1 they will take letrozole tablets orally once a day with
           food for one year. Patients in Group 2 will take a placebo tablet orally once a day with
           food for one year.

        -  Patients in both groups will also be given calcium tablets (500mg) and vitamin D tablets
           (400IU) once a day for one year.

        -  After the initial screening visits, the patient will return to the clinic at 3, 6, 9 and
           12 months (a total of up to 6 visits in the first year). There will also be two
           follow-up visits at 18 and 24 months. For the 3, 9 and 18 month visits, telephone
           contact instead of a clinic visit is allowed.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed during these visits:

      evaluation of side effects; routine blood tests(6, 12, and 24 month visits); urine sample (6
      and 12 month visits); complete physical exam including breast exam (12 and 24 month visits);
      mammogram (12 and 24 month visits); bone marrow density x-ray test (12 and 24 month visits);
      standard x-rays of the lower back and chest (12 month visit); and a questionnaire about how
      the patient is feeling (12 and 24 month visits).

        -  The length of participation in this study is for 1 year of study treatment followed by 1
           year of follow-up.
