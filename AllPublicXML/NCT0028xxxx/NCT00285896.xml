  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that simulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion
      in a glucose dependent way. Below normal plasma glucose levels the effects of GLP-1 stop and
      the risk of hypoglycemia is small. However no results exits on the effects pharmacologically
      relevant doses of GLP-1 during long-time fasting. There seems to be a risk of hypoglycemia in
      healthy people after a fasting period when a glucose load is administered. The risk of
      hypoglycemia when GLP-1 is administered will be evaluated during these two conditions.

      GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that simulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion
      dependent on a normal plasma glucose.It also inhibits gastric emptying and has a trophic
      effect on the pancreatic beta-cells. Below normal plasma glucose levels the effects of GLP-1
      stop and the risk of hypoglycemia is small.The counter regulatory response to hypoglycemia
      has been shown to be preserved during GLP-1 infusion. However no results exits on the effects
      pharmacologically relevant doses of GLP-1 during long-time fasting. There seems to be a risk
      of hypoglycemia in healthy people after a fasting period when a glucose load is administered.
      The risk of hypoglycemia when GLP-1 is administered will be evaluated during these two(48
      hours of fasting followed by a glucose-load)conditions in healthy men.

      Also the effect on 24 hour blood pressure will be evaluated.
