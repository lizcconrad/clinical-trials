      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as HPPH, that is absorbed by tumor cells.
      The drug becomes active when it is exposed to light, and kills tumor cells. HPPH may be
      effective in killing precancerous cells and tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well photodynamic therapy with HPPH
      works in treating patients with precancerous esophageal conditions or stage 0 or stage I
      esophageal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine response in patients with high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or early
           intramucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and Barrett's esophagus treated with
           photodynamic therapy using HPPH.

        -  Determine the safety, in terms of toxicity to surrounding normal tissue, of this regimen
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen on surrounding normal tissue in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of adenocarcinoma in these patients after this treatment.

        -  Determine the magnitude and duration of increased skin sun sensitivity in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the minimal erythemal dose of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to presence of
      intramucosal tumor (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1. Approximately 24 hours later, the
           lesion is exposed to laser light endoscopically.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive HPPH as in arm I, but at a higher dose, followed by laser light
           exposure.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
