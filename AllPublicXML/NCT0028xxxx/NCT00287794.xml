  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As one of the characteristic clinical features of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the
      unique character of the patients, somewhat difficult to be persuaded but theoretical, has
      long been pointed out. The investigators hypothesized that this unique character might be due
      to the sleep disturbance in the patients possibly due to severe pain of arthritis or unique
      biochemical disease activities. The investigators test (1) the sleep quality of the patients
      and draw some characteristic features, and (2) investigated the connection between unique
      biochemical changes such as the increase of c-fos or wee-1.

      Under the hypothesis the unique character of patients might be due to the sleep disturbance
      in the patients possibly due to severe pain of arthritis or unique biochemical disease
      activities. We do following studies; The study of sleep quality of the patients; The number
      of patients expected to be included in the study is 1,000. Inclusion criteria is the ACR
      criteria, and exclusion criteria is any defined disease conditions of sleep disorders in
      ICSD. The method includes questionnaire using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
      scoring and Epworth scoring, and actigraphy measurement for more than 3 days. In a portion of
      the patients, we measure clinical arthritis activities in conjunction with western blot for
      c-fos and wee-1 as well as routine clinical laboratory tests. Also in a portion of the
      patients, we do the polysomnography study; expected number of participants would be 100. We
      also plan to test the effect of good sloop on arthritis in a portion of the patients.
