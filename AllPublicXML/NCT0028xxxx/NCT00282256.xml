    <description>Participants continued to receive their stable twice daily dose of tacrolimus twice daily on Day 1 through Day 7 and on Day 8 were converted to tacrolimus modified release (MR) once-daily in the morning for 7 days on a 1:1 (mg:mg) basis for their total daily dose. Patients who completed the 2-week pharmacokinetic treatment period were eligible to continue receiving tacrolimus MR as part of the extension treatment period of the study. The extended treatment period began on Day 15 and consisted of a single dose of tacrolimus MR once every morning through the end of the study.</description>

        <title>Time to First Biopsy-confirmed Acute Rejection</title>
        <description>For participants with a biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR), the median number of days from the first dose of study drug to the date of biopsy confirmation. BCAR is defined as an episode of acute liver allograft rejection that was confirmed by biopsy results and was Banff grade ≥ I. Biopsies were graded by the clinical site pathologist according to the 1997 Banff criteria for grading acute liver allograft rejection: Indeterminate: Portal inflammatory infiltrate that fails to meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute rejection; Grade I: Rejection infiltrate in a minority of the triads that is generally mild and confined within the portal spaces; Grade II: Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads; Grade III: Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads, with spillover into periportal areas and moderate to severe perivenular inflammation that extends into the hepatic parenchyma and is associated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis.</description>

Biopsies were graded by the clinical site pathologist according to the 1997 Banff criteria for grading of acute liver allograft rejection: Indeterminate: Portal inflammatory infiltrate that fails to meet the criteria for diagnosis of acute rejection; Grade I (Mild): Rejection infiltrate in a minority of the triads that is generally mild and confined within the portal spaces; Grade II (Moderate): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads; Grade III (Severe): Rejection infiltrate, expanding to most or all of the triads, with spillover into periportal areas and moderate to severe perivenular inflammation that extends into the hepatic parenchyma and is associated with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis. For participants with more than one biopsy-confirmed acute rejection episode, the worst case grade is reported.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any reaction, side effect or other untoward medical occurrence, regardless of the relationship to study drug which occurred during the conduct of a clinical study. Clinically significant adverse changes in clinical status, routine laboratory studies or physical examinations were considered adverse events.
A serious adverse event was any adverse event occurring at any dose that resulted in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening adverse event
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Congenital abnormality or birth defect
