      Study objectives:

        -  to document the clinical efficacy of telithromycin(800 mg per day for 5 days) at Test Of
           the Cure (TOC)visit (D12-D19), in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.

        -  to assess the long-term clinical efficacy of telithromycin by telephone at D25-D35 (V3)

        -  to assess the safety of telithromycin
