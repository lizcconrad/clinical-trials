  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term persistence of hepatitis A and B
      antibodies at Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 years after subjects received their first dose of a
      3 dose vaccination schedule of combined hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine. The Protocol Posting
      has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at year
      11 to 15.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up study at Years 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 after primary vaccination
      with GSK Biologicals' hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccine (three-dose schedule, 3 different
      lots). To evaluate the long-term antibody persistence, volunteers will be bled at Years 11,
      12, 13, 14 and 15 after the first vaccine dose of the primary vaccination course to determine
      their anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody concentrations.

      No additional subjects will be recruited during the course of this long-term study.

      If a subject has become seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies or lost anti-HBs seroprotection
      concentrations at the long-term blood sampling time point (i.e. Years 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15),
      he/ she will be offered an additional vaccine dose.
