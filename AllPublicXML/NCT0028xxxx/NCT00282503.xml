    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of ECP treatment combined
      with high dose corticosteroids versus high dose corticosteroids alone, in the treatment of
      patients with newly diagnosed acute GvHD (Grades II to III) that developed within 100 days
      following an allo HPCT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to conducting any study procedure.

          2. Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old and weigh greater than or equal
             to 40 kg (88 lb).

          3. Patients must have received an allogeneic hematopoietic BMT or PBSCT with
             myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning and have a new onset of acute GvHD,
             Grades II to III, which includes the skin and developed within 100 days following an
             allo-HPCT.

          4. Patients must have received an allogeneic hematopoietic BMT or PBSCT from a related or
             unrelated donor that is matched at a minimum at the HLA-A, -B, and -DR loci (i.e., at
             least a 6 out of 6 match). HLA-A and -B match should be determined by serologic
             testing, and HLA-DR should be matched by molecular methods.

          5. Patients must be receiving only a calcineurin inhibitor at study entry as part of
             their acute GvHD prophylactic regimen. Patients may have received additional
             immunosuppressants for acute GvHD prophylaxis prior to study entry.

          6. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance greater than or equal to 50.

          7. Patients must be able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

          8. Patients must receive, or must have received, the first corticosteroid dose of
             approximately 2.0 mg/kg/day but no more than 2.5 mg/kg/day (methylprednisolone
             equivalent) within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis of Grade II to III acute GvHD.
             (Up to 2.5 mg/kg/day is allowed for inadvertent dosing fluctuations for reasons other
             than lack of response.)

          9. Female patients must be one of the following: postmenopausal, surgically incapable of
             bearing children, practicing an acceptable method of birth control (acceptable methods
             include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, and spermicide and barrier).
             Abstinence or partner/spouse sterility may also qualify at the Investigator's
             discretion. If a female patient is of childbearing potential, she must have a negative
             urine pregnancy test at screening. Male patients must also commit to using adequate
             contraceptive precautions (condoms). All patients (both males and females of
             childbearing potential) must commit to using adequate contraceptive precautions
             throughout their participation in the study and for at least 3 months following their
             last ECP treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have been diagnosed with chronic GvHD, including de novo chronic GvHD,
             prior to 100 days following an allo-HPCT.

          2. Patients who have received donor lymphocyte infusions.

          3. Patients with uncontrolled life-threatening infections.

          4. Patients who have a white blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L (1,500/mcL).

          5. Patients who have a platelet count &lt; 20.0 x 10^9/L (20,000/mcL), despite platelet
             transfusion.

          6. Patients whose total bilirubin is greater than or equal to 22 mg/dL.

          7. Patients who have an International Normalized Ratio (INR) greater than or equal to 2.

          8. Patients who are enrolled in any concomitant investigation for the treatment of acute
             GvHD.

          9. Patients who are unable to tolerate the extracorporeal volume shifts associated with
             ECP treatment due to the presence of any of the following conditions: uncompensated
             congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease, severe asthma, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatorenal
             syndrome.

         10. Female patients whose hemoglobin (Hgb) is &lt; 8.5 g/dL or male patients whose Hgb is &lt;
             10.0 g/dL at screening, despite packed red blood cell transfusion.

         11. Patients who have a poor tolerability of venipuncture or a lack of adequate venous
             access for required treatments and blood sampling.

         12. Patients who have a known hypersensitivity or allergy to Oxsoralen (methoxsalen).

         13. Patients who have a known hypersensitivity or allergy to both heparin and citrate
             products.

         14. Female patients who are pregnant and/or lactating.

         15. Patients who have co-existing melanoma, basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma,
             aphakia, photosensitive disease (e.g., porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, or
             albinism), white blood cell count &gt; 25,000 cells/mm3, previous splenectomy, or
             coagulation disorders.
