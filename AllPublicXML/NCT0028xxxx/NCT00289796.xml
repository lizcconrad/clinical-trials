      &quot;There will be two groups in this study:

        -  one group will receive a birth dose of Pa vaccine and 3 doses of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib
           vaccine as primary vaccination and a dose of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine as booster
           vaccination

        -  the control group will receive a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and 3 doses of
           DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine as primary vaccination and a dose of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine
           as booster vaccination&quot;.
