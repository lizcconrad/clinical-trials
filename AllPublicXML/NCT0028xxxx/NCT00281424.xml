  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project was to test the widely endorsed assumption that pedometers produce
      or encourage more physical activity participation in the form of walking. The investigators
      hypothesized that pedometers would not increase the amount of walking cardiac patients
      participated in after their cardiac rehabilitation program compared to patients without
      pedometers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As evidenced by the media attention given to pedometers and recent physical activity
      promotional efforts focused on pedometers, people seem to think that owning a pedometer will
      influence activity levels.

      However, an examination of a few social cognitive theories produces no theoretical rationale
      that would support any sustained positive influence of pedometers in the absence of some
      other conditional factor, such as a behavioural goal or a social support system. We believe
      that once people determine how many steps their usual routes and daily activity typically
      amounts to, that the pedometer will no longer be used. We based our contentions on two
      theories: self efficacy theory (Bandura, 1986;1997) and self-determination theory (Deci &amp;
      Ryan, 2000).
