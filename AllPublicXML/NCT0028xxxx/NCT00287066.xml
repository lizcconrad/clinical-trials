      The study was terminated on Oct. 28, 2007. The protocol was undergoing implementation and
      methodological issues with major revisions that qualified this trial as a new trial. Pfizer
      decided to cancel new trials because of the decision to withdraw Exubera due to lack of
      market performance and not for safety reasons.
