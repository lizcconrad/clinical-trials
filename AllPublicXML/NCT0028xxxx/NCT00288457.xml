      The Study of whether or not Ureteral Stent Length affects patient comfort after electro-shock
      wave treatment for kidney stones.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing electro shock wave for treatment of kidney stones are randomized to long
      or short stent length after signing an informed consent prior to their surgery. They keep a
      pain diary and medication diary for a two week period after the stent is placed. These are
      turned in at the two week post-op visit. Patients also complete a quality of life and urinary
      symptom score questionnaire pre and post operatively.

    <description>Ureteral stents are not investigatory but rather part of standard of care. In this study, we were interested in having patients fill out pre and post-operative questionnaires so that we could compare their symptoms with the length of their ureter and the stent placed.</description>
