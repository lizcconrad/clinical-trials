      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a lactic acid fermented oat gruel on
      iron absorption in the upper and lower part of the intestine, respectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and low iron stores are prevalent in infants, adolescents, and women of
      childbearing age in both Western and developing countries. One cause of iron deficiency is
      the low iron bioavailability from foods, which is partly due to inhibiting factors in the
      diet, such as phytate and phenolic compounds. A number of single meal studies with lactic
      acid fermented vegetables and cereals have shown a significant increase in iron absorption in
      humans. This is believed to be caused mainly by the lactic acid produced during the
      fermentation process, which conteracts the inhibiting effect of phytate.

      A recent study of ours indicate that the increased nonheme iron absorption from a low iron
      bioavailability meal was due not only to an effect of the lactic acid produced, but also a
      specific effect of the lactic acid bacteria. As lactic acid bacteria colonizes the entire
      intestine but mainly the colon it is of interest to determine whether these bacteria can
      increase iron absorption from the distal part of the intestine since iron absorption normally
      is believed to be absorbed from the duodenum and most proximal small intestine.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to determine the the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum
      299v in a lactic acid fermented oat gruel on iron absorption in the proximal and distal small
      intestine, respectively, in a cross-over design with 18 healthy women of childbearing age,
      served both fermented oat gruel and pasteurized, fermented oat gruel.
