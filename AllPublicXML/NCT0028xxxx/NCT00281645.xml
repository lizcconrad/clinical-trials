      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bicifadine 400
      mg BID for up to one year in patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain.

      The secondary objectives are to compare the long-term safety of bicifadine to standard of
      care therapy, to evaluate the safety of bicifadine following discontinuation of dosing, and
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lower doses of bicifadine in patients who do not
      tolerate bicifadine 400 mg BID.

      There are two ways by which subjects could enter this study.

      Subjects who completed 12 weeks of treatment in two other double blind clinical studies of
      bicifadine (Studies 020 and 021, both in the United States) could roll over into this study.

      Also, de novo subjects (that is, subjects who had not previously received bicifadine) could
      enroll in this study.

             extremities.

          -  Patients must not have had epidural corticosteroid injections in the lower back within
