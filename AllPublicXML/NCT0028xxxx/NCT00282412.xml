  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis disease is believed to be due to immune cells, cells that normally
      protect the body and are now causing damage to the body. Risk of death is highest in people
      with twenty or more joints actively involved with disease, positive rheumatoid factor, an
      elevated sedimentation rate (laboratory measures of active inflammation), and patients with
      limitation of daily activities (trouble doing simple things like opening a carton of milk).
      In these high risk patients, life is significantly shortened. Death is usually from heart
      disease, kidney failure, neck dislocation, broken hip bones, or blood clots to the lung. In
      this study we use moderate dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) and
      CAMPATH-1H (a protein that kills the immune cells that are thought to be causing the
      disease), followed by infusion of blood stem cells that have been collected from the
      patient's brother or sister (allogeneic stem cell transplant). The purpose of the moderate
      dose chemotherapy and CAMPATH-1H is to destroy the cells in the immune system and to allow
      the cells from the patient's brother or sister to grow. The purpose of the stem cell infusion
      is to restore blood cell production, which will be severely impaired by the moderate dose
      chemotherapy and CAMPATH-1H, and to produce a normal immune system that will no longer attack
      the body.

      Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization (PBSC)

      PBSC will be mobilized with G-CSF (dose may be adjusted down to 5-10 ug/kg/day by PI for
      toxicity, e.g. flu-like symptoms) with stem cell collection beginning on day 4 or 5.
      Leukapheresis may be repeated up to four consecutive days.

      Conditioning Regimen Immune Ablation:

      Fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d x 5 days (dosage should be based on adjusted body weight) will be
      given IV over 30 minutes in 100 cc of normal saline.

      Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/d x 4 days (dosage should be based on adjusted body weight) will be
      given IV over 1 hour in 500 cc of normal saline.

      CAMPATH-1H 30 mg/day x 3 days (no dose adjustment) will be given IV over 2 hours in 100 cc of
      normal saline. Premedication with acetaminophen 650mg &amp; benadryl 25-50mg PO/IV will be given
      30-60min before infusion. These medications can be repeated as needed.

      Hydration approximately 200 cc /hour beginning 6 hours before cyclophosphamide and continued
      until 24 hours after the last cyclophosphamide dose.

      G-CSF will be continued until absolute neutrophil count reaches 1,000 cells/ml for three
      days.

      Cyclosporine will be started at 200 mg po BID and adjusted by HPLC levels to between 150-250
      or by toxicity (e.g. tremor, renal insufficiency, TTP, etc.). CSA will be continued for 6
      months unless stopped for toxicity

      Mycophenolate Mofetil (Cellcept) will be given 1 gram po BID and may be adjusted by toxicity
      (e.g. cytopenia). Cellcept will be continued for 6 months unless stopped for toxicity.

        Participant Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 60 years at time of pre-transplant evaluation.

             Rheumatology criteria.
