  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if increasing the linear rise rate of injection of
      x-ray contrast in the heart during left ventriculograms(part of a cardiac Catheterization
      procedure) will decrease the incidence of arrythmias and improve image quality?

    <textblock>
      The LV angiogram is performed frequently as part of the cardiac catheterization procedure. It
      is done by injecting a bolus of x-ray contrast into the ventricle through a pigtail catheter
      over a short period of time and observing the heart as it is pumped out. This provides
      information on regional wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction, and mitral
      regurgitation. A common occurrence when performing a LV angio is frequent PVC’s or V-tach
      during the injection, it has been suggested that ectopic's occurs about 54% of the time and
      that interpretability was limited 30% of the time(3) This is rarely serious and subsides at
      the end of the injection but the irregularity of the contractions does affect the diagnostic
      quality of the exam.

      In an attempt to decrease the incidence of ventricular ectopic's during the LV angiogram
      Contrast injections with a greater linear rise increasing the injection duration to at least
      ½ the flow rate, greater than previous settings should decrease the tension and the contrast
      jets coming out of the catheter, decreasing the fling of the catheter at the initiation of
      the injection. Whether this affects the quality of the angiogram with a pig tail vs. a
      straight catheter will also need to be considered?

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only ventriculograms that the operator deems necessary for the booked procedure will
             be considered. Only operators agreeing to the for mentioned settings will participate
             in the study. Patients will be randomized consecutively and should conclude in 3 to 4
             weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with aortic valve disease, a-fib, and frequent benign ectopic beats and
             patients unable to follow instructions to stop breathing will be excluded.
