    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial in patients with type 1 diabetes, assessing the metabolic
      effects of accurate blood sugar results and education. A systematic approach in
      self-monitoring blood glucose will improve metabolic control in type 1 diabetes patients.
      Education in SMBG combined with a high analytical quality instrument for SMBG, introduced in
      a systematic and thorough way will improve HbA1c by 0,5% and keep it over a period of 9
      months.

    <textblock>
      -  Written informed consent 130 patients with type 1 diabetes to be included

        -  age 18-70

        -  HbA1c of 8% or higher, variation in HbA1c over the last 18 months sholuld be &lt;1,5%

        -  Treated with multiple insulin injections or insulin pumps

        -  Variation in weight less than 5kg within last year

        -  Using SMBG on a daily basis

        -  Mental capacity and stability to participate

        -  No hypoglycemia unawareness

        -  No likelihood that patient will drop out or not perform according to protocol

        -  Continious recruitment from the outpatient clinic at Stavanger University Hospital from
           October 2004-October 2005

        -  9 months follow-up

        -  Possible 12 month extension after initial

        -  Intervention group receives new SMBG instrument, education and advice on treatment
           changes at baseline, 1,2,3,6 and 9 months. Control group continues regular care
           following national guidelines of Norway. This includes visits usually every 3-6 months
           at the outpatient clinic and possibly with their GP in addition.
