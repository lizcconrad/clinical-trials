  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive chemotherapy is often associated with low platelet counts often requiring platelet
      transfusions to maintain platelet counts. In previous clinical studies administration of
      rhTPO has been demonstrated to increase platelet counts.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous rhTPO vs. placebo as primary prophylaxis in
      reducing the cumulative proportion of patients requiring platelet transfusion for severe
      chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;15,000) during the first four study
      cycles. To evaluate the severity and duration of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia associated
      with rhTPO prophylaxis, the impact of rhTPO prophylaxis on health economics/cost
      effectiveness, and patient quality of life. To assess the safety of multiple IV doses of
      rhTPO.
