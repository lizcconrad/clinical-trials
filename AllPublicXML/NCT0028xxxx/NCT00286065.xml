        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  male and female 18 to 70 years

          -  patient alert and capable of self-administering an opioid anaglesic

          -  Patient is scheduled for orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia

          -  Patient has normal laboratory values

          -  Physical examination with no clincially relevant findings

          -  Patient in general good health based on medical history and clincially acceptable

          -  Patient is able to understand the requirements of the study

          -  Patient is able to communicate effectively with study personnel _Patient voluntarily
             gives written approval.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  During Part 2 (randomized period) which involves the use of placebo, patients who are
             undergoing a major orthopedic procedure that normally requires multimodal analgesia to
             achieve adequate postoperative pain control (e.g. major spine surgery, total knee
             arthoplasty) will be excluded.

          -  Patient is taking opioid or non-opioid analgesics on a chronic basis at doses which in
             the opinion of the investigator would interfere with evaluations of post-operative
             fentanyl efficacy.

          -  History of pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, endocrine, hepatic, gastrointestinal
             (GI), or kidney disease or therapy that would jeopardize the patient’s well-being by
             participation in this study.

          -  Patient has documented or self-reported medical history of sleep apnea.

          -  Patient has a documented hypersensitivity to fentanyl or other opioid analgesics.

          -  Patient has a documented hypersensitivity/allergy to the components of the liposomes
             used in the AeroLEF formulation, including hypersensitivity to soya lecithin or
             related food products such as soya bean and peanut.

          -  Patient is currently receiving treatment, or has received treatment in the previous
             two weeks, with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

          -  Patient has a history of malignancy within the past 5 years, with the exception of
             successfully treated non?metastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin
             and/or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Patient was dosed with another investigational drug within 30 days prior to the
             Screening Visit.

          -  Patient has current therapy with CNS-depressant medications (other than stable doses
             of analgesics and drugs used with surgical anesthesia).

          -  Patient has current evidence of alcohol abuse (regularly drinks more than 4 units of
             alcohol per day; 1 unit = ½ pint of beer, 1 glass of wine, or 1 ounce of spirit).

          -  Patient has a history of abuse of licit or illicit drug substances.

          -  Patient, who in the opinion of the Investigator, is mentally or emotionally unsuitable
             to participate, or unable/unwilling to comply with the study assessments.
