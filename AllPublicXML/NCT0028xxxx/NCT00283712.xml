  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a rare skin disorder that causes blistering of the skin and mucous
      membranes. Infliximab is a man-made antibody used to treat certain types of immune system
      disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. This study will determine if
      infliximab given in combination with prednisone is a safe and effective treatment for adults
      with PV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PV involves blistering of the outer layer of skin and mucous membranes, causing a separation
      of epidermal cells. The disease occurs when the immune system produces antibodies to specific
      proteins in the skin and mucous membranes; the cause for production of these autoantibodies
      is unknown. Infliximab is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody directed against tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a chemical messenger that activates an immune response.
      Infliximab has been used to treat other autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis,
      ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of infliximab given in combination with prednisone for the treatment of adults with PV.

      This study will last 26 weeks. At study entry, all patients will be taking a stable dose of
      prednisone (or an equivalent corticosteroid) of 20 to 120 mg/day for at least 2 weeks prior
      to study entry. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: experimental or
      placebo comparator. The experimental treatment arm will receive infusions of infliximab, and
      the control arm will receive placebo. Infusions will be given at study entry and Weeks 2, 6,
      and 14. Before the start of each infusion, a physical exam, vital signs measurement, medical
      and medication history, review of a disease activity log, a skin evaluation, and blood
      collection will occur. During each infusion and for 1 hour postinfusion, patients' vital
      signs will be monitored for any adverse events. Patients will need a responsible adult to
      take them home after they are discharged from the treatment facility; this person should
      remain with the patient overnight in case any problems arise from the treatment. The patient
      will be contacted by phone that night and the next morning after infusion and will be asked
      about any adverse effects they may have experienced. Those patients that experience adverse
      effects may be asked to return to the treatment facility for examination. Prednisone doses
      may be tapered by 15 percent every 2 weeks during the study at the investigator's discretion.

      There will be a total of 9 study visits until Week 26: screening, study entry, Week 2, and
      every 4 weeks thereafter. Each study visit will include a physical exam, vital signs
      measurement, medical and medication history, a review of the disease activity log and adverse
      events experienced since the last visit, skin assessments, and blood collection; patients
      will also be asked to complete a tuberculosis (TB) questionnaire. Patients will be asked to
      complete quality of life questionnaires at study entry and Weeks 10, 18, and 26. Skin
      biopsies of unaffected skin will be done at study entry and Weeks 10, 18, and 26; if patients
      have PV-associated lesions, additional skin biopsies of affected skin will be done at study
      entry and Week 18.

    <measure>Participant Time to Cessation of New Blisters</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Time to cessation of new blisters was defined as the time from a participant's first treatment infusion date to the first date where that date and all subsequent dates had no new blisters. Participant diaries were used to assess new blister formation. To achieve cessation, participants had to be free of new blisters at least 3 weeks prior to their last assessment. In order to analyze missing or incomplete data, the data was censored at the date where a participant had no more data or on the date where 50% of the participant's data was missing past that point.</description>

    <measure>Participant Health Related Quality of Life (Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36) Score Changes From Baseline to Week 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (MOS SF-36) measures health -related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 18 minus the baseline value. A positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement and a negative value worsening.</description>

    <measure>Participant Dermatology-Related Quality of Life Changes From Baseline to Week 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a 10-question questionnaire with a weighted value to each question. The DLQI score was calculated by summing the score of each question, resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a minimum score of 0. The higher the score, the greater quality of life is impaired. Change from baseline values (defined as the visit value - baseline value) were calculated. A negative change indicates better quality of life; a positive change indicates poorer quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Participant Pemphigus Vulgaris Disease Activity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Pemphigus Vulgaris Disease Activity (PVDA) score was used to grade a participant's disease activity using the SAGE II computerized burn mapping system, which calculated the total body surface area (BSA) involved. Scores were based on the number of new lesions and blisters present, old lesion history and BSA involved. Scores range from 0 to 3 (none to severe disease activity). A new disease activity score of 3 or an old lesion score of 3 indicates active disease. New disease activity scores of 3 for a 1-month duration or an old lesion score of 3 for 2 consecutive months was cause for removal from the study treatment</description>

          <description>The Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) was developed by the International Pemphigus Committee and measures both activity of and damage due to pemphigus on the skin, scalp, and mucous membranes. Total scores can range from 0 to a possible 263 maximum score, with 250 points representing disease activity (120 points for skin activity, 10 points for scalp activity, and 120 points for mucosal activity) and 13 points representing disease damage. Higher scores reflect worse disease.</description>

          <description>The Pemphigus Vulgaris Disease Activity(PVDA)score was used to grade a participant’s baseline disease activity using the SAGE II computerized burn mapping system, which calculated the total body surface area(BSA)involved. Scores were based on the number of lesions and blisters present as well as total body surface area involved. Three types of disease activity were assessed: mucosal, cutaneous, and other organ system. A higher score indicates more severe disease activity. For each of the 3 types of disease activity, the number of participants who met the disease activity condition is shown.</description>

          <title>Pemphigus Vulgaris Disease Activity Score: Cutaneous</title>
          <description>The Pemphigus Vulgaris Disease Activity(PVDA)score was used to grade a participant’s baseline disease activity using the SAGE II computerized burn mapping system, which calculated the total body surface area(BSA)involved. Scores were based on the number of lesions and blisters present as well as total body surface area involved. Three types of disease activity were assessed: mucosal, cutaneous, and other organ system. A higher score indicates more severe disease activity. For each of the 3 types of disease activity, the number of participants who met the disease activity condition is shown.</description>

The analyses focused on estimation rather than hypothesis testing; therefore, there was not sufficient power to detect plausible treatment differences unless they were very large. The sample size reflects a balance between the desire to meet study goals and to expose as few participants as possible until the safety of infliximab for treatment of PV has been clarified.</groups_desc>

        <description>Time to cessation of new blisters was defined as the time from a participant's first treatment infusion date to the first date where that date and all subsequent dates had no new blisters. Participant diaries were used to assess new blister formation. To achieve cessation, participants had to be free of new blisters at least 3 weeks prior to their last assessment. In order to analyze missing or incomplete data, the data was censored at the date where a participant had no more data or on the date where 50% of the participant’s data was missing past that point.</description>

The date of 80% healing of existing erosions/ulcerations at time of enrollment was defined as follows: the first date at which the percent of total body surface area (BSA) involved is at least 80% less than the percent of total BSA calculated at the time of enrollment, where the baseline percent of total BSA must be greater than zero percent. If a participant had missing post-baseline assessments, their data was censored at their last non-missing assessment date.</description>

        <title>Participant Health Related Quality of Life (Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36) Score Changes From Baseline to Week 18</title>
        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (MOS SF-36) measures health -related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 18 minus the baseline value. A positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement and a negative value worsening.</description>

          <title>Participant Health Related Quality of Life (Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36) Score Changes From Baseline to Week 18</title>
          <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 (MOS SF-36) measures health -related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores: PCS=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health; MCS=vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For both, 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 18 minus the baseline value. A positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement and a negative value worsening.</description>

        <title>Participant Dermatology-Related Quality of Life Changes From Baseline to Week 18</title>
        <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a 10-question questionnaire with a weighted value to each question. The DLQI score was calculated by summing the score of each question, resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a minimum score of 0. The higher the score, the greater quality of life is impaired. Change from baseline values (defined as the visit value - baseline value) were calculated. A negative change indicates better quality of life; a positive change indicates poorer quality of life.</description>

        <description>The Pemphigus Vulgaris Disease Activity (PVDA) score was used to grade a participant’s disease activity using the SAGE II computerized burn mapping system, which calculated the total body surface area (BSA) involved. Scores were based on the number of new lesions and blisters present, old lesion history and BSA involved. Scores range from 0 to 3 (none to severe disease activity). A new disease activity score of 3 or an old lesion score of 3 indicates active disease. New disease activity scores of 3 for a 1-month duration or an old lesion score of 3 for 2 consecutive months was cause for removal from the study treatment</description>
