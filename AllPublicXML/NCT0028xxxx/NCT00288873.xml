  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese persons are known to have elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and low levels
      of vitamin D. These hormones are important in regulation of the bodyâ€™s calcium stores and
      bone health. We would like to investigate these abnormalities and the accuracy of our current
      diagnostic tests by comparing results of standard assays for vitamin D and PTH to more
      specific tests, in obese subjects at baseline and as vitamin D is replaced. We will also
      compare two standard vitamin D replacement regimens to determine if one is more effective.

      This is a pilot study with two parts: Part 1 will compare levels of PTH and vitamin D using
      two different assays in obese subjects who have normal vitamin D and those who do not. We
      plan to enroll 20 subjects who have normal vitamin D levels and 40 subjects who have vitamin
      D insufficiency. All subjects will fill out questionnaires about the amount of calcium and
      vitamin D in their diet, and their recent sunlight exposure. We will ask for blood samples so
      that we can measure levels of calcium, vitamin D, albumin, creatinine, glucose, insulin and
      the different forms of PTH.

      Subjects who have vitamin D insufficiency will then be randomized to receive Vitamin D2 or
      Vitamin D3 in standard doses for eight weeks, in an open label trial. At four and eight
      weeks, these subjects will fill out the above questionnaires and have the blood tests
      repeated. For safety purposes, urine calcium will also be monitored.
