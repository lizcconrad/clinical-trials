      Arachnoiditis, a neuropathic disease caused by inflamation of the arachnoid membrane that
      surrounds and protects the spinal nerves,can result in a debilitating state that is
      characterized by numbing and tingling, stinging and burning in the lower back or legs, and
      possible muscle cramps, twitching and spasms. Current treatments are not always effective in
      treating the pain associated with arachnoiditis. Recent research has indicated that a group
      of chemicals called cytokines that are produced by various cells in the body may be
      responsible for generating the pain response. Medications that effect the release of
      cytokines or block the action of cytokines may reduce the pain response. Various
      anti-cytokine medications are now being used to treat painful disease states such as
      rheumotoid arthritis and Crohn's Disease. In this study the anti-cytokine medication,
      Thalidomide, is being evaluated for it's effect in treating pain associated with
      arachnoiditis.
