      Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of blindness. The key features of glaucoma are damage
      to the optic nerve head and progressive visual field defect, which is not necessarily only
      related to an increase in intraocular pressure. It has been suggested that ocular blood flow
      alterations in glaucoma are related to systemic vascular dysregulations.The hand-grip test
      has been suggested as a potential tool to unravel vascular dysregulation in the ocular
      circulation. Although applied routinely in clinical practice, a proper study testing the
      effectiveness of this test is lacking. The present study is designed to compare the response
      of choroidal blood flow to the hand-grip test in glaucoma patients with and without visual
      field progression.

        Inclusion Criteria: Patients fulfilling two out of three of the following criteria in one
        or both eyes: a) typical glaucomatous disc, b) visual field damage (a cluster of three
        points (except rim points) in at least one hemifield reduced by 5 dB or greater and
        including at least one point reduced by 10 dB or greater; a cluster of two points reduced
        by 10 dB or greater; or three adjacent points on the nasal horizontal meridian that
        differed by 5 dB or greater from their mirror points on the opposite side of the meridian),
        c) intraocular pressure above 21 mm Hg at least at one occasion. Furthermore, patients need
        to have a series of at least 5 visual field examinations, after exclusion of the first
        test, for assessment of progression.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ametropia &gt; 3dpt

          -  Inadequate transparency of ocular media as defined by physical examination

          -  Iridocorneal angle extremely narrow with complete or partial closure as determined by
             gonioscopy

          -  Any abnormality which in the physician's view would prevent reliable applanation
             tonometry or LDF of at least one eye

          -  History of chronic or recurrent severe inflammatory eye disease such as scleritis or
             uveitis

          -  History of ocular trauma or intraocular surgery within the past 6 months

          -  History of infection or inflammation within the past 3 months

          -  History of clinically significant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal
             degeneration, diabetic retinopathy or retinal detachment

          -  Patients with a significant history and/or active alcohol or drug abuse (significant
             is defined as that which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient
             at risk because of participation in the study or may influence the results of the
             study or the patient's ability to participate in the study).
