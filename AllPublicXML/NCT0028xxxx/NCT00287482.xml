      This is a pilot feasibility study being performed in women completing front-line treatment
      for breast or ovarian cancer. It is being done to evaluate whether or not an herbal
      combination known as Essiac (ESIAK) can improve the overall quality of life in these women as
      they transition from active treatment to follow-up, also known as the quality of life in
      transition. This information will be used to design a larger randomized trial.

      Complementary and Alternative medical (CAM) practices are “healthcare practices outside the
      realm of conventional medicine, which are yet to be validated using scientific methods”. It
      encompasses a wide variety of behavioral (meditation, and spiritual practices) and clinical
      (herbal, acupuncture, and massage) techniques. Patients with chronic diseases including
      cancer tend to be very interested in these treatments and research involving CAM and their
      ability to improve quality of life are needed.

      Women transitioning from active treatment for breast or ovarian cancer to surveillance
      (QOL-T) can experience physical and psychological distress, related to both treatment
      (fatigue, alopecia, and menopausal symptoms), and the diagnosis itself. Intervention during
      the critical time of transition from active therapy to follow-up may help patients to adjust
      to life after cancer treatment.

      Essiac has been documented to be a popular form of herbal treatment in patients with cancer.
      Given its lack of reported side effects, we are interested in pursuing a formal evaluation of
      a Essiac in capsule formulation (ESIAK) in women surviving breast or ovarian cancers to
      evaluate its role in improving the overall quality of life following chemotherapy that often
      accompanies the end of adjuvant therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  histologically documented diagnosis of infiltrating carcinoma of the breast or
             epithelial ovarian cancer. Given the similar clinical course of patients with
             fallopian tube and primary peritoneal carcinoma these patients will also be included
             in the study.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Patients must be either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. If patients
             become pregnant during the course of the study, they will not be allowed to continue
             on the study.

          -  age ≥ 18 year-old

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70%

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign informed consent

          -  Ability to perform and comply with follow-up on study

          -  No history of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  No antecedent history of depression prior to diagnosis of malignancy

          -  Must be ≥ 4 weeks from completion of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

          -  Adequate hematopoietic function defined as: ANC ≥ 1500/mm3; Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3;
             Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL.

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function defined as: Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of
             normal (ULN); SGOT ≤ 2.5 times ULN; Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times ULN; Creatinine ≤
             2 times ULN.

          -  For patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
             (EOC/FT/PPC): patients must have completed front-line treatment within 3 months of
             study entry and in a complete remission; Patients treated with neoadjuvant
             platinum-based chemotherapy prior to definitive surgery will be eligible; If serum
             CA-125 was elevated at diagnosis, it must also have normalized by end of treatment.

          -  For patients with breast cancer: patients must have completed adjuvant treatment with
             chemotherapy and radiation therapy (if recommended) within three months of study entry
             and deemed in complete remission; Treatment must have included adjuvant chemotherapy
             and radiation if recommended; Patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy will be eligible
             following completion of all adjuvant chemotherapy if indicated. Patients receiving
             hormonal therapy following chemotherapy will be eligible to participate. However,
             patients placed on Tamoxifen or other hormonal agents in lieu of chemotherapy will not
             be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria
