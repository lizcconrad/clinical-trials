    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of inactivated
      influenza vaccine (whole virion, Vero cell derived). Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive a single injection of whole virion, Vero cell derived or egg derived influenza
      vaccine on Day 0. Subjects will return to the study site for safety evaluation at
      predetermined intervals for 180 days after vaccination. Subjects will also have blood drawn
      at predetermined intervals to measure their immunologic response to vaccination.

             consent prior to study entry;

          -  are clinically healthy (in a physical condition such that the physician would have no

             study);

          -  agree to keep a daily record of symptoms;

          -  if female and capable of bearing children - have a negative urine pregnancy test
             result at study entry and agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who

          -  have received any influenza vaccination for the 2005/2006 influenza season and/or the
             2004/2005 influenza season;

          -  have received any vaccination within 2 weeks prior to vaccination in this study;

          -  suffer from any kind of immunodeficiency;

          -  suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment
             (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence immune response;

          -  have a history of inflammatory or degenerative neurological disease (e.g. Guillain
             Barré, multiple sclerosis);

          -  have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 30 days of study entry;

          -  have donated blood or plasma within 30 days of study entry;

          -  have a history of any vaccine related contraindicating event (e.g., anaphylaxis,
             allergy to eggs, allergy to components of the test or comparator vaccine, other known
             contraindications);

          -  have a rash, dermatologic condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection site
             reaction rating;

          -  are concurrently participating in a clinical study that includes the administration of
             an investigational product;

          -  if female, are pregnant or lactating;

          -  are a member of the team conducting this study or are in a dependent relationship with
             the study investigator. Dependent relationships include close relatives (i.e.,
