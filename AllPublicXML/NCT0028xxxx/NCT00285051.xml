    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated for 2 consecutive chemo cycles with the study drug for one and
      placebo for the other. In addition, patients will receive an injection before the chemo,
      either ondansetron (if receiving placebo inhalation) or normal saline) if receiving active
      study drug. They will take study medication for 3 days, 4 times daily and fill out VAS scores
      before and after doses. Patients will be given rescue medication with each dose.

      The study is comparing the use of inhaled delata-8-THC in the prevention of nausea and
      vomitting in patients being treated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, and the patients
      will continue use for 3 days afterward. Patients will be given rescue medication and will
      fill out VAS scales for nausea, pain, appetite and dizziness. Patients will be treated for 2
      cycles, one cycle receiving active drug (one of 2 doses) and the other placebo. Patients
      receiving placebo will receive ondansetron injection before chemo and patients receiving
      active drug will receive a normal saline injection. Patients will take the drug 4 times daily
      for 3 days. The patients will return to clinic for a visit after 24-48 hours and 4 days.
      Patients will bring a urine sample to measure metabolite. Patients will be given a diary to
      monitor dosing and side effects as well as concomitant medication. The study will be
      conducted in 2 - 3 centers. There will be 108 patients enrolled with 27 in each of 4 groups:

      Group 1 cycle 1 - Placebo cycle 2 - 300 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose Group 2 cycle 1 - Placebo
      cycle 2 - 600 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose Group 3 cycle 1 - 300 mcg of delta-8-THC per
      doseGroup cycle 2 - Placebo Group 4 cycle 1 - 600 mcg of delta-8-THC per dose cycle 2 -
      placebo
