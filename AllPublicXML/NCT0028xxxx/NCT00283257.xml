  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site randomized control trial taking place at six cancer centers. UC Davis is
      the lead site. Additional performance sites include the City of Hope Medical Center, Fred
      Hutchinson Cancer Center at the Univ. of Washington, USC Norris Cancer Center, UCSD Cancer
      Center, and Johns Hopkins Cancer Center. Clinical trial patients and their caregivers who are
      randomized to the intervention arm of the study are scheduled for three educational sessions.
      The sessions focus on teaching problem solving skills based on the COPE problem solving
      model.

      The project introduces and evaluates the effects of a Simultaneous Care Education
      Intervention, using the COPE model (Creativity, Optimism, Planning and Expert Information)
      developed by D'Zurilla and Nezu, as one of its key components for cancer patients in Phase I,
      II and III clinical trials. The SCEI team will use the COPE problem solving educational model
      to instruct patients on how to problem solve and manage challenges associated not only with
      the investigational therapy, but also the psychosocial issues that arise from cancer
      diagnosis, disease progression, treatment, and disease or treatment related symptoms. The
      educational intervention also sets up a system for regularly contacting the patient and
      caregiver in order to reinforce what is taught. Patients and caregivers randomized to the
      intervention arm will receive three education sessions. Patients and designated caregiver
      will be asked to complete the set of measurement tools approximately every 30 days while
      enrolled in the study.
