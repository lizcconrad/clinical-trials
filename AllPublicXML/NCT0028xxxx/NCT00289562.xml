        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which under WHO Guidelines is
             now referred to as precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma

          -  Must have failed at least 1 treatment regimen for B-ALL, which under WHO Guidelines is
             now referred to as precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma

          -  Rapidly progressive disease with compromised organ function judged to be
             life-threatening by the Investigator

          -  Patients with clinical evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) disease

          -  Concurrent treatment with other anticancer agents

          -  Pregnant and/or lactating female

          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection HIV testing will be
             performed at the Screening visit for patients who have not been tested within 6 months
             of receiving study drug, as well as those patients who have had exposure or have been
             transfused with blood products that were not appropriately screened.

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infection Hepatitis testing
             will be performed at the Screening visit for patients who have not been tested within
             6 months of receiving study drug, as well as those patients who have had exposure or
