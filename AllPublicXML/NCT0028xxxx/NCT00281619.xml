  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how fast children, who have had a recent kidney
      transplant, absorb, breakdown and eliminate mycophenolic acid (CellCept) following their
      prescribed dose. The results may lead to better dosing based on individual needs.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, inpatient-outpatient population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
      (PK-PD) study of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in pediatric subjects (age 2-17 years) who have had
      a recent kidney transplant, as well as during the stable renal transplant period when on a
      stable oral regimen of MPA. The primary objective of this study is to develop population
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models for mycophenolic acid (MPA) and mycophenolic
      acid glucuronide (MPAG) in order to improve individualized pediatric dosing. Subjects will
      have been receiving CellCept as part of their clinical standard of care. It is anticipated
      that the clinical portion of the study for each patient will be approximately six months post
      renal transplant with four study days: a screening visit pre-transplant, two 10-hour
      inpatient days at 2-3 and 6-9 days post-transplant, and one (up to 10 hour) outpatient visit
      at 3-6 months post-transplant. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements will be
      conducted at various time points (up to 9 hours post dose) on study days 2, 3, and 4. Safety
      data to be collected will include physical examinations, measurement of vital signs, and
      laboratory assessments, as well as data on adverse events and clinical outcomes.

        Male subjects and non-pregnant female subjects aged 2-17 years who are about to receive a
        kidney transplant and will be on post transplant MMF containing immunosuppressive therapy,
        per clinical care.

          -  Male subjects and non-pregnant female subjects aged 2 to 17 years who are about to
             receive a kidney transplant and will be on post transplant MMF containing
             immunosuppressive therapy. Subjects may be enrolled up to their 18th year.

             clinically significant in the opinion of the investigators.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition (active or chronic) or prior surgery that may interfere with the
             pharmacokinetic behavior of MMF (absorption, distribution and elimination) as
             determined by the PI.

          -  Active systemic infection.

          -  History of substance abuse.
