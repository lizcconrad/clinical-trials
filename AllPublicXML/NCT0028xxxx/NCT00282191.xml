    <textblock>
      This survey aims to investigate the prevalence of spasticity among adults who live in
      community settings in Davidson County, Tennessee. The treatment of spasticity in those who
      live in community homes could significantly increase a person's quality of life by allowing
      them to participate more independently in activities of daily living, or by making assistance
      easier for caregivers.

    <textblock>
      The process of deinstitutionalization has transitioned a large majority of persons with
      developmental disabilities into the community over the past several decades, and that number
      will only increase going forward. There are 926 people in this region who are provided
      assistance through the Division of Mental Retardation Services (DMRS). People with
      developmental disabilities frequently have comorbidities such as spasticity that hinder their
      ability to participate in activities of daily living. Spasticity results from brain or spinal
      cord injury and can produce increased muscle tone, causing joint stiffness, contractures and
      pain that can interfere with recommended treatment. A previous survey conducted at Clover
      Bottom Developmental Center investigated care areas typically affected by spasticity,
      including splinting, hygiene, dressing, transfers, positioning, ambulation, and engaging in
      other functional activities. Pfister et al. reported the prevalence of spasticity in the
      developmental center to be 35% (72/205); of those people, the Survey Physician felt that 75%
      (54/72) would achieve a functional benefit from treatment.

      Primary endpoints will assess the prevalence of spasticity in adults who reside in the
      community, and whether or not spasticity impacts activities of daily living. When
      appropriate, potential care area goals will be identified, and treatment options will be
      recorded. Secondary endpoints will examine whether or not participants currently receive
      treatment for spasticity; if so, what treatment is being used; and which care areas are most
      impacted by spasticity.
