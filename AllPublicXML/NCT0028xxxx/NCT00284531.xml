  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to obtain information on the drug levels, metabolism, and safety of
      daclizumab (Zenapax(R)) in children and adolescents undergoing cardiac transplantation. In
      addition to the drug safety and metabolism information, the number and severity of rejection
      episodes in patients undergoing cardiac transplantation using the standard immunosuppressive
      drugs plus daclizumab will be compared with patients who have previously undergone cardiac
      transplantation at the Baylor College of Medicine and received the same standard
      immunosuppressive drugs without daclizumab.

    <textblock>
      Initial studies in renal and recent studies in adult cardiac transplant patients have shown
      Zenapax(R) to be both efficacious and safe when used in several different dosing schedules.
      Little data is available regarding pharmacokinetics, safety and appropriate dosing in
      pediatric heart transplant patients. Yet this ever-increasing group of patients presents a
      significant challenge for the prevention of primary rejection and the appropriate maintenance
      of immunosuppression. Induction of long term allograft acceptance through peripheral
      tolerance has been shown in animal models to be more easily induced in young animals. Once
      established however, allograft rejection and immunologic responses in the young are quite
      vigorous. This dichotomy makes young allograft recipients a particularly attractive
      population for the study of immune modulators targeted at preventing proliferative expansion
      of alloreactive T cell clones. This is precisely the mode of action of anti-IL2R monoclonal
      reagents such as Zenapax(R).

      Although some pharmacokinetic data have been generated in adult heart transplant patients on
      multidrug immunosuppressive regimens including both Zenapax(R) and mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF), detailed pharmacokinetic data on this combination in multidrug immunosuppressive
      regimens is not available for pediatric heart transplant subjects.

      Objectives:

        -  Determination of pharmacokinetics of Zenapax(R) in pediatric patients receiving a
           uniform multidrug immunosuppressive regimen for primary induction.

        -  Determine whether there are any unusual drug interactions peculiar to the pediatric
           population that would require dosing modification.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Investigate long term effects of Zenapax(R) containing induction regimen on pediatric
           patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be undergoing their first cardiac allograft transplant.

          -  Male or female must be less than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 48
             hours prior to transplantation. The sensitivity must be equal to at least 50 mIU/ml.
             (Urine test is allowed in addition to serum test in patients where serum results are
             delayed.)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must use two reliable forms of contraception
             simultaneously.

          -  Effective contraception must be used before beginning study drug therapy, and for 4
             months following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

             purpose and risks of the study and must sign a statement of informed consent.
