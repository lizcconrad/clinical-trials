  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many mammals, the duration of the nocturnal melatonin elevation regulates seasonal changes
      in reproductive hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH). Melatonin's effects on human
      reproductive endocrinology are uncertain. It is thought that the same hypothalamic pulse
      generator may both trigger the pulsatile release of GnRH and LH and also cause hot flashes.
      Thus, if melatonin suppressed this pulse generator in postmenopausal women, it might moderate
      hot flashes. This clinical trial tested the hypothesis that melatonin could suppress LH and
      relieve hot flashes.

      Twenty postmenopausal women troubled by hot flashes underwent one week of baseline
      observation followed by 4 weeks of a randomized controlled trial of melatonin or matched
      placebo. The three randomized treatments were melatonin 0.5 mg 2.5-3 hours before bedtime,
      melatonin 0.5 mg upon morning awakening, or placebo capsules. Twelve of the women were
      admitted to the GCRC at baseline and at the end of randomized treatment for 24-hour sampling
      of blood for LH. Morning urine samples were collected twice weekly to measure LH excretion.
      Subjective responses measured throughout baseline and treatment included sleep and hot flash
      logs, the CESD and QIDS depression self-ratings, and the SAFTEE physical symptom inventory.
