  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to determine if a modified bone mineral density (BMD)
      test report that contains additional fracture risk information will be a useful physician
      decision aide in selecting patients for pharmacological osteoporosis therapy. It is
      hypothesized that this supplementary information, provided in addition to the conventional
      BMD report, will increase the likelihood that patients at high risk for an osteoporotic
      fracture will receive prescribed therapy for osteoporosis.

      This observational research study is being conducted to determine if a modified bone mineral
      density (BMD) test report that contains additional fracture risk information will be a useful
      physician decision aide in selecting patients for pharmacological osteoporosis therapy. It is
      hypothesized that this supplementary information, provided in addition to the conventional
      BMD report, will increase the likelihood that patients at high risk for an osteoporotic
      fracture will receive prescribed therapy for osteoporosis. Physicians who only receive the
      conventional BMD reports without the supplemental information will be the control group.

      To compare the rates of pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis in post-menopausal
      women, family / primary care physicians are randomized to receive either:(i) a conventional
      BMD report (absolute bone density, T-score result, Z-score result, qualitative statement
      indicating the BMD results classification of risk for fracture from osteoporosis according to
      the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria) versus (ii) a conventional BMD report plus a
      supplemental information sheet (all the information contained in the conventional BMD report
      plus five-year estimated risks for future fractures calculated from the physician-supplied
      clinical risk factors and - for those who have osteoporosis according to the WHO criteria -
      the number needed to treat (in person years) to prevent one fracture.
