  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate different doses of proton pump
      inhibitors in reducing cough symptoms felt to be associated with Gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD). Proton pump inhibitors are medicines used to treat GERD, which work by
      lowering the amount of acid in the stomach.

      The proton pump inhibitor used in this study is called, Esomeprazole (brand name Nexium), and
      is already marketed for treating GERD. Patients with GERD may experience all or some of the
      following symptoms: stomach acid or partially digested food re-entering the esophagus (which
      is sometimes referred to as heartburn or regurgitation), belching and coughing. Even very
      small, unnoticeable amounts of rising stomach acid may cause patients to cough.

      Because there may be a link between chronic cough and GERD, study doctors are interested in
      learning if giving high-dose Nexium (40 milligrams, twice daily) will help in treating
      chronic cough.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, comparative parallel-group
      trial of subjects with chronic cough of unknown origin presenting to the Otolaryngology/ Head
      and Neck Surgery, Pulmonary Medicine, and Gastroenterology outpatient clinics at the
      University of North Carolina Hospital system.

      Potential subjects with chronic cough of unknown origin will be identified through the above
      outpatient clinics. Those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to join
      the study testing the efficacy of twice daily esomeprazole 40 mg taken for 3 months in the
      setting of chronic cough. Potential subjects will be consented for the study prior to leaving
      the enrolling clinic. A total of 40 subjects will be recruited into our study.

    <description>It is a validated, 28-item assessment tool designed to evaluate decrements in quality of life due to chronic cough. This questionnaire measures cough-related symptoms, as well as the social implications and psychological impact. Examples of items include, &quot;I cannot sleep at night&quot; and &quot;I cough and it makes me retch.&quot; The final score is obtained by summing the responses to 28 questions, each scored on a 1-4 scale, where 1 is &quot;strongly disagree,&quot; and 4 is &quot;strongly agree.&quot; The minimum and maximum CQLQ scores are 28 and 112 respectively, with increasing score indicating more severe impairment.</description>

        <title>Change in Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire</title>
        <description>It is a validated, 28-item assessment tool designed to evaluate decrements in quality of life due to chronic cough. This questionnaire measures cough-related symptoms, as well as the social implications and psychological impact. Examples of items include, “I cannot sleep at night” and “I cough and it makes me retch.” The final score is obtained by summing the responses to 28 questions, each scored on a 1-4 scale, where 1 is “strongly disagree,” and 4 is “strongly agree.” The minimum and maximum CQLQ scores are 28 and 112 respectively, with increasing score indicating more severe impairment.</description>

            <description>Upon successful completion of the run-in period, participants in the esomeprazole arm were given the compound at a dose of 40mg for 12 weeks. All participants were instructed to take their study medication 30 minutes before breakfast and 30 minutes before dinner. Esomeprazole was supplied by the investigational pharmacy at the University of North Carolina as blue capsules without identifying features.</description>
