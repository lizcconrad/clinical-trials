  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK Biologicals in partnership with the Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH is developing a
      candidate malaria vaccine GSK 257049 for the routine immunization of infants and children
      living in malaria endemic areas. The vaccine would offer protection against malaria disease
      due to the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The vaccine would also provide protection against
      infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV).

      In order to integrate the malaria vaccine into the EPI regimen in malaria-endemic regions, a
      new variant RTS,S/AS02D (0.5 mL dose) has been developed.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2b trial designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS02D
      when co-administered with a multivalent DTPw/Hib (Aventis Pasteur's TETRActHib vaccine).
      Infants randomized to the control group will receive a licensed hepatitis B vaccine,
      Engerix-B in place of RTS,S/AS02D.

      Data pertaining to RTS,S/AS02D or Engerix-B will be collected in a double blinded manner;
      data relating to TETRActHib will be collected in an open fashion.

      Oral polio vaccine (OPV) will be administered at birth, 8, 12, 16 weeks in co-administration
      with other vaccines and will not be administered as part of this protocol. Antibody titers to
      OPV will not be assessed as part of this protocol.

      <recruitment_details>A total of 340 subjects were enrolled for this study. The study comprised 2 phases, a double-blind phase, from Week 0 to Month 9 (2 months after the administration of the last vaccine dose), followed by a single-blind safety phase, from Month 9 to study end at Month 20.</recruitment_details>
