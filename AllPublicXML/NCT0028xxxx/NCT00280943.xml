  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporotic fractures of the hip are a major cause of admission to long-term care
      facilities. Such fractures put patients at high risk for further fractures, pain and
      disability. Current data show that many patients in long-term care facilities do not receive
      FDA medications for their osteoporosis. This trial will test whether a multi-model
      intervention (which provides feedback about provider use of osteoporosis medications,
      information about osteoporosis, and currently approved osteoporosis medications)directed at
      physicians, other health care providers, and nurses will improve the number of prescriptions
      written for FDA approved medications for osteoporosis treatment.
