  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the proposed trials is that the regular intake of a specific diet designed
      for enteral nutrition of type 2 diabetic patients results into a better nutritional status.
      Thus, the aim of the study is to scientifically evaluate the healthy effects of the
      administration of an enteral complete diet for diabetic patients (T-Diet plus Diabet).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This new complete diet has been carefully formulated, and incorporates functional ingredients
      based on:

        1. A good gastrointestinal and metabolic tolerance of the product.

        2. Beneficial outcomes in the nutritional status.

        3. A good control of the glycaemic response and the lipidic profile, allowing an
           improvement of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance indicators and hunger-satiety
           regulation.

      The experimental enteral product is a complete diet that includes, as carbohydrates,
      high-molecular maltodextrin, resistant maltodextrin, fructooligosaccharides and cellulose,
      and does not contain added fructose. Indeed, this product contains eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
