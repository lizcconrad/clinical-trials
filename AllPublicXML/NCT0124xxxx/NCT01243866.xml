  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe dental decay affects children physically, emotionally, socially and thereby impacts on
      their quality of life. Evidence from developed countries showed that children with severe
      dental decay weighed less than their peers and following dental treatment children's growth
      and quality of life improved. This suggests that treatment of severe dental decay may enhance
      growth and wellbeing. A study was carried out in Saudi to test that hypothesis.

    <description>Early treatment children were scheduled for comprehensive dental treatment over a 2-month period (from May to June 2007). All test children had their last dental treatment visit within the last 2 weeks of the second treatment month. The follow-up survey was scheduled for each child to be approximately 6-month after their dental last visit. This step was very important to make sure that all children were examined at exactly the same interval between end of treatment and when re-examined at the follow-up examination.</description>

    <description>Regular treatment did not receive any dental treatment in the period when the early children were treated unless they had toothache or dental infection. In that case they were treated for the pain but did not have comprehensive dental treatment</description>
