    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of ginkgo biloba (steady state) on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of the UGT-substrate raltegravir. Furthermore the safety
      profile of the combination is studied.

      Ginkgo biloba is an alternative medicine that is popular among HIV-infected patients because
      if its claimed positive effects on memory, concentration and depression. Alternative medicine
      can cause drug-drug interactions with regular HIV-medication. Raltegravir is a newly
      developed HIV integrase inhibitor. It is metabolized in the liver by UGT1A1 and therefore its
      pharmacokinetic profile can be influenced by inhibitors or inducers of UGT1A1. So far there
      are no data of the potential effect of ginkgo biloba on glucuronidation in vivo. The current
      study is designed to evaluate the potential inductive effect of ginkgo biloba on the
      pharmacokinetics of raltegravir and the safety profile when used in combination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 and not older than 55 years at screening.

          -  Subject does not smoke more than 10 cigarettes, 2 cigars, or 2 pipes per day for at
             least 3 months prior to the first dosing

          -  Subject has a Quetelet Index (Body Mass Index) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, extremes included.

          -  Subject is able and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form prior to screening
             evaluations.

          -  Subject is in good age-appropriate health condition as established by medical history,
             physical examination, electrocardiography, results of biochemistry, haematology and
             urinalysis testing within 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Results of biochemistry, haematology
             and urinalysis testing should be within the laboratory's reference ranges. If
             laboratory results are not within the reference ranges, the subject is included on
             condition that the Investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically
             relevant. This should be clearly recorded.

          -  Subject has a normal blood pressure and pulse rate, according to the Investigator's
             judgement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented history of sensitivity/idiosyncrasy to medicinal products or excipients.

          -  Positive HIV test.

          -  Positive hepatitis B or C test.

          -  Pregnant female (as confirmed by an HCG test performed less than 4 weeks before Day 1)
             or breast-feeding female. Female subjects of childbearing potential without adequate
             contraception, e.g. hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, (non-hormonal)

          -  Relevant history or presence of pulmonary disorders (especially COPD), cardiovascular
             disorders, neurological disorders (especially seizures and migraine), psychiatric
             disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, renal and hepatic disorders, hormonal
             disorders (especially diabetes mellitus), coagulation disorders.

          -  Relevant history or current condition that might interfere with drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion.

          -  History of or current abuse of drugs, alcohol or solvents.

          -  Inability to understand the nature and extent of the trial and the procedures
             required.

          -  Participation in a drug trial within 60 days prior to Day 1.

          -  Donation of blood within 60 days prior to Day 1.
