    <textblock>
      This study will identify a dose of ferumoxytol that can reliably detect changes in blood
      flow/volume in response to non-drug stimuli. The study will determine whether signal
      detection for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using ferumoxytol is better than
      that for blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI in response to sensory stimulation. The
      following procedures will be conducted in each of two study periods: arterial spin labeling
      (ASL) imaging study with increasing exposure to carbon dioxide (CO2); BOLD fMRI study with
      sensory stimulation; MRI studies with sensory stimulation in the presence of increasing doses
      of ferumoxytol; MRI study with increasing exposure to CO2 in the presence of ferumoxytol.
      There will be a 3-week interval between the two study periods. The study will enroll 8
      subjects, but an additional 4 subjects are permitted to enroll to preserve study power.
