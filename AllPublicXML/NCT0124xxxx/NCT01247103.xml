      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 50 years with suitable veins for
             cannulation or repeated venepuncture.

          -  Female subjects must not be pregnant, must not be lactating and must be of
             non-child-bearing potential (i.e. they must be post-menopausal or surgically sterile)

          -  Male subjects should be willing to use barrier contraception i.e. condoms and
             spermicide, from the day of dosing until at least 3 months after dosing with the
             investigational product

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive and weigh at least 50
             kg and no more than 100 kg inclusive.

          -  Subjects who are healthy as determined by pre study medical history, physical
             examination, 12-Lead ECG

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the
             resting ECG, including changes that may interfere with the interpretation of QTcF
             interval changes.

          -  Current smokers, those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous
             three months.

          -  History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important
             allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the investigator or history of hypersensitivity
             to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD4316.

          -  Judgment by the investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             they have any ongoing or recent (ie, during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
             unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.
