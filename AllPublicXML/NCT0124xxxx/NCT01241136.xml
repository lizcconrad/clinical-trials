    <textblock>
      Pilonidal disease, a chronic infection involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues along the
      sacrococcygeal area (natal cleft) is a common disease affecting mostly young adult males who
      make up the majority of our military workforce. Surgical treatment options for pilonidal
      disease vary widely from the invasive (e.g. wide open excisions) to minimally invasive
      procedures (e.g. removal of lined sinus tracts using minimal excisions) as well as other
      popular treatments involving myocutaneous or skin flaps (Limberg flap and Z-plasty). All of
      these surgical procedures are associated with varying degrees of early and late recurrence
      rates; however, the current, more popular procedure for the treatment of pilonidal disease
      involves wide open excisions.

      A recent advancement in the minimally invasive surgical technique for pilonidal disease
      involves the use of Keyes trephines (a 2-to-9 mm diameter biopsy instrument) to excise the
      individual pits and to drain the cyst cavities. Although this procedure has been proven to be
      effective against pilonidal disease with an overall low early recurrence rate, no clinical
      trial has been performed to rate this procedure of minimal excisions against the current,
      more common procedure of wide open excisions. A recent report has suggested that the
      recurrence rate of pilonidal disease for minimal excisions may be comparable to that of wide
      excisions. Furthermore, reports have also suggested that this minimally invasive procedure
      can be performed with minimal (and possibly local) anesthesia, less post-operative pain
      medication, and may involve a shorter convalescence time for patients.

      In order to compare the early recurrence rates of pilonidal disease and overall patient
      satisfaction between procedures involving minimal and wide open excisions, we propose to
      perform a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing these two surgical procedures.
      Randomly assigned patients will undergo either 1) wide excisions of all pilonidal-diseased
      tissue (e.g. pits, cavity, sinus tracts), including a surrounding rim of normal tissue and
      left open to heal, or 2) minimal excisions of lined sinus tracts using varying sized
      trephines. Overall patient satisfaction will be evaluated by the amount of analgesic used for
      the procedure, the number of dressing changes, the length of convalescence, and overall
      patient tolerance of the procedures, both intra- and post-operatively. In addition, varying
      data points will be collected with the use of a quality of life survey and visual analog pain
      scale to analyze overall patient satisfaction. Patients will be followed for a period of two
      years following surgery to evaluate for early recurrence of their pilonidal disease.
