  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of racotumomab in patients with
      advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), in concomitance with chemotherapy (docetaxel)
      when a second-line therapy is indicated. The study will also compare survival and progression
      free survival on both study arms.

    <description>Patients will receive best support treatment and vaccination with racotumomab. The vaccination schedule is as follows: 5 doses (1mg/mL each), subcutaneously, every 2 weeks (induction period) followed by monthly vaccinations until any criteria for discontinuation are met. If disease progression occurs and a second line therapy is indicated, the patient will only be able to continue in the study if the drug indicated is docetaxel. Vaccination will not be interrupted during docetaxel administration unless criteria for vaccine discontinuation are met.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient (aged over 21 years, either sex) can comply with the protocol and
             scheduled appointments and sign voluntarily the informed consent form

          2. Diagnosis of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stages IIIA (surgically unresectable),
             IIIB or IV, according to the TNM classification (Tumor-Nodes-Metastases) version 6a,
             confirmed by cytology or histology, if possible available for determination of
             ganglioside expression

          3. Patients may enter the study if they have accomplished an objective response (complete
             response or partial response) or disease stabilisation (by Response Evaluation
             Criteria In Solid Tumours [RECIST]) after completion of standard onco-specific
             treatment. In all cases, response should be documented.

             For stage IIIA and IIIB without pleural effusion (&quot;dry IIIB&quot;) standard treatment is
             considered as follows: 2 - 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy
             with curative intent in accordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
             guidelines For stage IIIB with pleural effusion (&quot;wet IIIB&quot;) and stage IV standard
             treatment is considered as follows: 4 - 6 cycles of chemotherapy based on platinum. In
             case of pleural or pericardial effusion requiring local treatment, it will be provided
             prior to study entry.

          4. Patients with an interval greater than 30 and not more than 90 days between the
             completion of oncospecific treatment and study entry. Completion of treatment is
             defined as the last day of administration of chemotherapy or the last day of
             radiotherapy. Patients should have recovered from any related episode of acute
             toxicity of degree greater than 1 (except alopecia). Patients who have received a
             monoclonal antibody (eg bevacizumab) should also have discontinued its use for at
             least 30 days before inclusion.

          5. The subject is male or female, aged greater than or equal to 21 years

          6. Performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]) less than or equal to 1

          7. Acceptable organ functionality as defined by the following parameters:

               -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) without significant abnormalities, performed within 14
                  days prior to admission

               -  Haemoglobin greater than or equal to 90 g/L

               -  Total leukocyte count greater than or equal to 3.0 x 10^9/L

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L

               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limit of normal or twice
                  the limit normal than in case liver metastases are present

               -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic
                  transaminase (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times upper limit of normal (less
                  than or equal to five times the normal maximum in case liver metastases are
                  present)

               -  Creatinine less than or equal to 2 mg/dL

          8. Life expectancy of at least four months
