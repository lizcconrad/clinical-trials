      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of
      repeated administration of subcutaneous (sc) CEP 33457 for injection every 4 weeks over 72
      weeks (18 doses) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have participated in
      a previous Cephalon sponsored clinical study of CEP 33457, and completed at least visit 8
      (week 24 of that study).

             defined by ACR Classification Revised Criteria. The diagnosis is fulfilled provided
             that at least 4 criteria are met.

          -  The patient previously participated in and completed at least visit 8 (week 24) the
             Cephalon sponsored clinical study with CEP 33457 (study C33457/2047) and, in the
             investigator's opinion, would benefit from continued participation in a clinical
             study.

          -  Women must be surgically sterile, 2 years postmenopausal, or, if of childbearing
             potential, using a medically accepted method of contraception, and must agree to

             discontinuation of study drug treatment.

          -  The patient has any clinically significant abnormalities on ECG that are not related
             to SLE, as determined by the investigator. Patients with stable ECG changes without
             evidence of active cardiovascular disease may participate at the discretion of the
             investigator and medical monitor.

             current substance abuse.

          -  The patient has a history of severe allergic reactions to or hypersensitivity to any

             study will be withdrawn from the study.)

          -  The patient has undergone or is undergoing treatment with another investigational drug
             for the treatment of lupus within 6 months prior to the 1st dose of study drug or has
             received any other investigational drug for any other condition within 30 days prior
             to the 1st dose of study drug, except for treatment with CEP-33457 or placebo in study
             C33457/2047.

          -  The patient has a known history of antibodies to CEP-33457.
