      In this study two consecutive cohorts will be treated:

        -  Cohort 1: 8 volunteers

        -  Cohort 2: 24 volunteers, divided into 3 groups of 8 subjects each

      The study will be conducted in the following three phases:

        1. Treatment of cohort 1: The aim is to establish the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for a
           local treatment with azithromycin dermal formulation.

             1. Treatment of cohort 1 with azithromycin dermal formulation and follow up

             2. Assessment of local safety within the 7 days following the first treatment

             3. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined

        2. Treatment of cohort 2: The aim is to confirm the local tolerance of the selected doses
           and to evaluate the local skin and plasma concentration of azithromycin after
           application of SHB001 dermal formulation.

             1. Treatment of cohort 2 with azithromycin dermal formulation at maximal tolerated
                dose (MTD), with a dose one or more concentrations lower than maximal tolerated
                dose (MTD) and with placebo

             2. Skin biopsies of treated skin areas will be taken for the PK assessment

        3. Study completion examination

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to assess the local safety of azithromycin dermal formulation when applied to healthy skin in healthy volunteers. This will be done by determination (in cohort 1) and confirmation (in cohort 2) of the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) after dermal application of SHB001 in 4 different dose regimens.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of SHB001</measure>
    <time_frame>April 2010 - November 2010</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin dermal formulation in the plasma in healthy volunteers after daily administration for three consecutive days in cohort 1 and cohort 2.
To assess the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin dermal formulation in the skin in healthy volunteers after daily administration for 1 - 3 consecutive days in cohort 2 only.
To demonstrate that the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of B.b. (=0.03μg/ml) in the skin is reached at least for 2 consecutive assessments (biopsies) in cohort 2.
To assess general safety in cohort 1 and 2.</description>
