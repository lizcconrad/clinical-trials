      This clinical trial studies multi-tracer positron emission tomography in patients with solid
      tumors. Diagnostic procedures, such as multi-tracer positron emission tomography, may help
      measure a patient's response to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Provide a reliable and validated cadre of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
      derived biomarkers that yield a better understanding of: 1) early clinical benefit from
      various therapeutic agents in investigational and recently approved therapies; 2) efficacy
      during novel therapeutics in investigational therapeutics and recently approved therapeutics
      at Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI); and 3) possible predict prognosis or other long-term
      outcomes.

      II. Reveal a more detailed understanding of: (1) the in vivo biologic mechanisms of various
      therapeutic drugs in investigational therapies and recently approved therapies at HCI (2)
      information on why particular functional imaging profiles are seen in treated patients.

      III. Reveal a more detailed understanding of how the combination of molecular imaging derived
      biomarkers will be potentially useful to physicians for decision making and for explanation
      of efficacy or outcomes for patients with cancer.

      IV. Implement and evaluate a new imaging technology for multi-tracer PET imaging of these
      tracers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo PET scans with fludeoxyglucose F 18, fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine, and
      water O-15 tracers at baseline and within 7 days of completion of 1 or 2 (if the course is
      less than 3 weeks) therapeutic agent courses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible adult patients currently meeting inclusion criteria and will be treated with
             an investigational or recently approved therapeutic agent at HCI; the patients must
             have measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)

             completing the investigational or recently approved therapy, however this may not
             always be possible; by signing informed consent, the patients are documenting their
             agreement to have clinical and radiographic endpoints and the results of
             histopathologic tissue analysis and other laboratory information entered into a
             research database

          -  All patients must sign a written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and
             Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization in accordance with institutional guidelines

          -  Female patients who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile will undergo a serum
             pregnancy test prior to baseline and the subsequent set of multi-tracer PET scans; the

          -  Partial thromboplastin time less than 2.5 times below or above the upper or lower
             limit range; for those patients receiving Coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper
             limit for partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the
             normal range
