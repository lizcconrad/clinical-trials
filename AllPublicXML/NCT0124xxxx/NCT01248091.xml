  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing accessibility of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, like intrauterine
      devices (IUDs), is an important strategy to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy.
      Unfortunately, fear of IUD insertion in women who have not had children is common among
      health care providers and women alike, and this limits IUD use. To increase acceptance of
      this highly effective contraceptive, there is need to investigate novel, low cost, easily
      applied and accessible techniques to improve the insertion experience. This is a pilot study
      to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of nitroprusside gel applied intracervically as an
      intervention to improve the IUD insertion experience for both patient and provider.

      Subjects who are have already scheduled an IUD insertion will be asked to join this study
      assessing whether or not nitroprusside gel helps with IUD insertion process. Only healthy,
      nulliparous women between the ages of 18 and 45 will be recruited. Nulliparous women report
      much more pain associated with IUD insertion than parous women so the possibility of being
      able to measure the effect of nitroprusside vs placebo is more likely. The primary outcome,
      pain with IUD insertion, and the secondary outcomes, such as satisfaction and provider ease
      of IUD insertion, will be compared between the study groups as well.
