  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to test study drug AZD2461 to see how it may work to treat
      solid tumors. The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      AZD2461. This is the first time the drug has been given to humans and is classed as a first
      time in man study. Its main purpose is to establish a safe dosage of the drug and provide
      additional information on any potential side effects this drug may cause. The study will also
      assess the blood levels and action of AZD2461 in the body over a period of time and will
      indicate whether the drug has a therapeutic effect on solid tumors.
