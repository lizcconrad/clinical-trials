    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in determining the utility of ultrasound of the spine for
      labor epidurals or spinal anesthesia for women in labor or having a cesarean delivery. The
      investigators hypothesized that in women with poor spinal landmarks that the use of
      ultrasound of the spine will improve the process of placing labor epidurals or spinal
      anesthetics

    <textblock>
      Ultrasound has been in use for peripheral regional anesthesia for several years and is
      becoming more common. It is currently routinely used here at the University of Missouri.
      Ultrasound for neuraxial anesthesia, however, is less common and is only being done in a few
      centers.. There have been several case reports of its use in obstetric anesthesia for
      patients with prior spinal surgery or spinal deformity. There have been even few prospective
      randomized studies. While its use may have significant advantages, it is not yet clear what
      those advantages are and in whom it may be most beneficial. The investigators seek to answer
      the following questions regarding the use of preprocedure ultrasound for neuraxial
      analgesia/anesthesia in obstetric patients:

        -  Are there benefits to the use of pre procedure ultrasound for neuraxial
           analgesia/anesthesia?

        -  If so, what are the benefits?

        -  If measurable, to what extent does the patient benefit?

        -  Do all patients benefit or only a specific subgroup?

        -  Is there a &quot;cost&quot; to the use of pre procedure ultrasound, i.e. extra time needed to
           perform the ultrasound exam vs a &quot;savings&quot; with the use of pre procedure ultrasound,
           i.e., less time to perform the epidural analgesic or spinal anesthetic as a direct
           result of the use of ultrasound?

        -  In particular the investigators hypothesize that in patients whose spinal landmarks are
           not palpable or are barely palpable, ultrasound will be found to be beneficial as
           determined by metrics described below (see item #6). In patients whose landmarks are
           prominent or easily palpable pre procedure ultrasound will not be of significant
           benefit.
