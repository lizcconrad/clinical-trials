  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      K-252a is a potent inhibitor of nerve growth factor (NGF) and therefore has the ability to
      inhibit keratinocyte proliferation. K-252a is strongly lipophilic and therefore passes freely
      into the cell membranes of keratinocytes and accumulates at a systemic level. In order to
      reduce the dermal absorption and reduce the possible long-term systemic toxicity this study
      will assess a PEGylated derivative of K-252a named CT327. This approach should improve the
      safety profile of the K-252a molecule while maintaining its activity. The primary objective
      is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and repeat doses of CT327 when applied
      topically to the skin of healthy male volunteers.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the eventual systemic absorption (pharmacokinetics;
      PK) of CT327 following single and repeat doses in healthy male subjects.
