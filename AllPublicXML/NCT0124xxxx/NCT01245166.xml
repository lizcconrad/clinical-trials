    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder which is caused by both insulin
      secretion deficiency and insulin action defect. In this type of subjects, fasting
      hyperglycemia is the result of the elevated rate of basal hepatic glucose production, and it
      is coexisting with hyperinsulinemia.After a meal, the impaired control of hepatic glucose
      production by insulin and decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake by muscle contributed
      nearly equally to postprandial hyperglycemia(Scheen, 1997). Type 2 diabetic subjects
      experience significant morbidity and mortality from microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy,
      and neuropathy) and macrovascular (cardiovascular disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular
      disease) complications. The appropriate treatment and good glycemic control of diabetes is
      therefore important and necessary (Vaag, 2006). Evidences suggest that combination therapy
      using oral antidiabetic agents with different mechanisms of action may be more effective in
      achieving and maintaining target blood glucose level (Turner et al., 2005).There are five
      classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents (sulfonylureas, biguanides, α- ucosidase inhibitors,
      thiazolidinediones and meglitinides) currently available to improve glycemic control in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes, each of which works through a different mechanism of action.
      Metformin, a biguanide which has insulin-sensitizing properties, can be used alone or in
      combination with other classes of agents. Metformin is the currently the first-choice
      treatment in subjects with diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects and obesity, characterized by
      insulin-resistance. Metformin also provides reduction of body weight and ameliorates lipid
      abnormalities and is thought to be related to a reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis (Hundal
      &amp; Inzucchi, 2003).Acarbose, the α-glucosidase inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes, and first approved for prediabetes treatment (Chiasson et al., 1994; Breuer,
      2003; Chiasson et al., 2002). The drug was launched worldwide as a type 2 diabetes
      monotherapy and combination therapy in 1990 which has proven efficacious as first-line
      therapy (Coniff et al., 1995) and in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin (Kelley et
      al., 1998). Acarbose and metformin are both associated with beneficial effects on
      hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, body weight, and, in some studies,triglyceride levels
      (Krentz et al., 1994). Because these factors are part of a cluster of risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease, combining the two drugs may be useful. In long-term clinical studies,
      acarbose has shown a favorable safety profile (Hasche et al., 1999).In combination with
      metformin, acarbose has been shown to improve long-term glycemic control (Rosenstock et al.,
      1998; Halimi et al., 2000). This study was conducted as a further vestigation into the
      efficacy and safety of concurrent use of acarbose and metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus
      subjects.Lotus Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. intends to initiate Phase III program to investigate
      assess the efficacy and safety of metformin in combination with acarbose for type 2 diabetes
      mellitus subjects considered inadequately blood glucose control. Since combination tablet of
      acarbose and metformin has not yet been approved by the Taiwan DOH, this study is conducted
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination tablet of acarbose and metformin in the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects in Taiwan. Acarbose is chosen as an
      active-comparator.
