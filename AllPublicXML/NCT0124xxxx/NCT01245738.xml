  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is proposed to investigate the pattern of dyslipidemia and of lipid
      treatment practices in patients in India experiencing their first acute cardiovascular event
      and the extent of residual dyslipidemia after 12 weeks of treatment with statins.
      Dyslipidemia definitions are per the National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment
      Panel III (NCEP-ATP III).
