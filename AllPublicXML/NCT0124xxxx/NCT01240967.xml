    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and non-pregnant, non-lactating females 18 to 80 years old inclusive with
             suitable veins for cannulation or repeated venipuncture with a weight of at least 50
             kg.

          -  Regarding renal function, subjects will be classified as either normal or as suffering
             from mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. Classification of renal impairment
             will be based using an abbreviated 4 variable Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
             equations. To ensure the assessment of consistent estimated glomerular filtration rate
             (eGFR) using the MDRD, a single equation will be used (see Section 6.2)

          -  Negative screen for Human Immunodeficiency Virus and negative results for serum
             hepatitis B surface antigen

          -  Regarding renal function, subjects will be classified as either normal or as suffering
             from mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. Classification of renal impairment
             will be based using an abbreviated 4 variable MDRD equation. To ensure the assessment
             of consistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the MDRD, a single
             equation will be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant medical, neurologic or psychiatric disease or
             disorder (other than those previously defined as acceptable for these population)
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor, may either put the subject at
             risk because of participation in the study, or influence the results of the subject's
             ability to participate in the study: This includes seizure activity and repeated
             episodes of major depression.

          -  Subjects with a history of suicide attempts in the past year and/or seen by the
             Investigator as having a significant history of risk of suicide or homicide, or
             considered at risk for suicide or homicide during the study

          -  Subjects with an active renal transplant (subjects who have previously received a
             renal transplant and are currently undergoing dialysis due to transplant failure may
             be enrolled)

          -  Any clinically significant acute illness or medical/surgical procedure within 4 weeks
             of the first administration of investigational product (IP) (other than those
             previously defined as acceptable for these population) as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Positive test in drugs of abuse screens (except for prescription medications, which
             are verified by the Investigator), or alcohol on admission to the clinic prior to the
             administration of the IP
