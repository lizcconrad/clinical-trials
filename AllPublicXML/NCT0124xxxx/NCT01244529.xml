    <description>Investigator evaluated as acceptable (centered/slightly decentered) or unacceptable (substantially decentered). Number of eyes in each category will be reported by lens. This is an aggregate reporting of the lenses, combining the different base curves into a category by lens type. This is done per protocol, due to this primary outcome not being stratified by base curve.</description>

          -  Must be at least 18 years of age and no more than 55 years of age.

          -  Must sign written informed consent.

          -  Optimal spherical equivalent distance correction must be between -1.00 and -6.00
             diopters.

          -  Have spectacle astigmatism â‰¤ -0.75 diopter cylinder in both eyes.

          -  Must have visual acuity best correctable to 20/25+3 or better for each eye.

          -  Must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical
             protocol.

          -  Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. For the purposes of this
             study a normal eye is defined as one having: No evidence of lid abnormality or
             infection; No conjunctival abnormality or infection; No clinical significant slit lamp
             findings, (i.e., oedema, staining, scarring, vascularization, infiltrates or abnormal
             opacities); No other active ocular disease.

          -  The subject is a current spherical soft contact lens wearer (defined as a minimum of 6
             hours of daily wear for a minimum of 1 month prior to the study) and willing to wear
             the study lenses on a daily wear basis (defined as a minimum of 6 hours of wear per
             day at least five days of the week) for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any systemic illness which would contraindicate lens wear or the medical treatment of
             which would affect vision or successful lens wear.

          -  Any previous eye surgery involving the anterior segment.

          -  Pre-existing ocular disease that would preclude contact lens fitting.

          -  Abnormal lacrimal secretions.

          -  Keratoconus or other corneal irregularity.

          -  Pregnancy, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrollment.

          -  Participation in any concurrent clinical trial.

          -  Subject's habitual contact lens type is toric or multifocal.

          -  Require any concurrent ocular medication.
