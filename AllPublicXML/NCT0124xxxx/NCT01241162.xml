    <textblock>
      This treatment study for relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma, Ewings sarcoma, osteogenic
      sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma or synovial sarcoma involves an autologous cancer testis (CT)
      antigen specific dendritic cell (DC) vaccine preceded by decitabine as a demethylating
      chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For vaccine production, mature DC will be pulsed with overlapping peptides mixes derived from
      full-length NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1, and MAGE-A3.
