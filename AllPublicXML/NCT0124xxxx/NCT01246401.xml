    <textblock>
      Specific Aim: To conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of extended
      release-naltrexone (XR-NTX) among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected prisoners
      meeting Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria for opioid dependence who are
      transitioning from the structure of a correctional setting to the community.

      Hypotheses:

      i. XR-NTX will result in improved HIV clinical outcomes, including lower changes in HIV-1 RNA
      levels, higher CD4 counts and higher rates of retention in care.

      ii. XR-NTX will result in improved opioid treatment outcomes, including longer time to opioid
      relapse, lower addiction severity and lower craving for opioid.

      iii. XR-NTX will result in reduced drug- and sex-related HIV risk behaviors compared to the
      control group.

      iv. XR-NTX will result in decreased rates of reincarceration after 12 months of release to
      the community.

      The specific aim for this study is to conduct a placebo-controlled trail (RCT) of XR-NTX
      among HIV+ persons in jails and prisons meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who are
      transitioning to the community. HIV treatment outcomes (HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count, Highly
      Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) adherence, retention in care), substance abuse (time to
      relapse to opioid use, % opioid negative urines, opioid craving), adverse side effects and
      HIV risk behavior (sexual and drug-related risks) outcomes will be compared in 150 recruited
      prisoners and jail detainees in Connecticut (CT) and Massachusetts (MA) who will be
      randomized 2:1 to either XR-NTX or placebo. The primary outcome of interest will be the
      proportion with a HIV-RNA &lt;400 copies/mL at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include mean CD4
      count, antiretroviral adherence, retention on HAART and in HIV care, HIV risk behaviors,
      time-to-relapse to opioid use, percent opioid negative urines, retention on d-NTX and HIV
      quality of life. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed for an additional 6 months
      after completion of the intervention. If this placebo-controlled trial of XR-NTX among
      released HIV+ criminal justice system (CJS) persons with opioid dependence demonstrates
      efficacy and safety, it is likely to become an evidence-based intervention to intervene with
      this extremely marginalized population in a way that will meet Healthy People 2010's goals to
      increase the quality and years of life, decrease health disparities particularly among
      minorities, break the cycle of addiction, reduce the numbers of people within the CJS and
      launch a number of new and innovative trials and second generation questions for future
      research. As such, the individual, our health care system and society have a high likelihood
      to benefit. This will not only be true for strategies here in the U.S., but may have even
      greater application for geographic areas where the interface between opioid disorders and HIV
      is even greater.

    <measure>Time to Opioid Relapse or End of Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring days to first relapse based on self reported opioids (heroin) use within the 6 month (180 days) intervention period. If participants had no follow-up visits, and thus no self reported opiate use, they were treated as missing. Those who did not relapse within the 6 month intervention period were treated as having 180 days until relapse.</description>

    <measure>Addiction Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) questionnaire will be used to assess addiction severity. The ASI composite scoreprovides reliable and valid measure of patient status in a particular module of interest which can then be usecompared at the beginning of treatment to the evaluation endpoint to note the improvement or lack thereof. In this assessment the drug composite score was calculated using algorithm by Treatment Research Institute. If the score increases then it shows increase in severity where as if it decreases then it shows decrease in severity for that measured module. The scale ranges from 0 to 1.
The mean composite scores for drug use from baseline to 6 months were compared using Nonparametric test.</description>

    <measure>Craving for Opioids</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Craving at baseline compared to 6 month. This is assessed through a self report scale rated 0 to 10; 0 meaning not craving and 10 meaning highest craving. Change in craving score was categorized as 1)no change between baseline and 6 month; 2)increased craving - baseline craving was reported lower than at 6 month; 3)decreased craving - baseline craving was reported higher than 6 month craving.</description>

        <title>Addiction Severity</title>
        <description>The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) questionnaire will be used to assess addiction severity. The ASI composite scoreprovides reliable and valid measure of patient status in a particular module of interest which can then be usecompared at the beginning of treatment to the evaluation endpoint to note the improvement or lack thereof. In this assessment the drug composite score was calculated using algorithm by Treatment Research Institute. If the score increases then it shows increase in severity where as if it decreases then it shows decrease in severity for that measured module. The scale ranges from 0 to 1.
The mean composite scores for drug use from baseline to 6 months were compared using Nonparametric test.</description>
