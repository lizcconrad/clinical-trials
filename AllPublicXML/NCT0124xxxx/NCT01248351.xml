  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to test the hypothesis whether or not autologous stored
      platelets are able to offset the antiplatelet effect of aspirin and clopidogrel as assessed
      by state-of-the-art platelet function assays.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is a well established strategy to
      prevent thrombotic complications in patients with high platelet reactivity following plaque
      rupture in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or percutaneous coronary interventions. Current
      practice guidelines for antiplatelet therapy advocate a one to 12 months dual antiplatelet
      therapy after bare metal stent PCI and a 12 months dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI in
      patients with ACS and drug eluting stent PCI. Although oral antiplatelet therapy is
      associated with both, short- as well as long-term clinical efficacy, irreversible platelet
      inhibition carries a substantial risk of bleeding particularly in patients presenting for
      surgery. Empiric therapy of bleeding consists of platelet transfusion. However, there are
      currently no pharmacodynamic studies assessing the effect of stored platelets on in-vitro
      platelet function tests.

      Healthy volunteers will donate platelets, take aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 days (loading
      dose aspirin 300 mg, clopidogrel 300 mg, maintenance dose aspirin 100 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg)
      and platelets will be retransfused on the 4th day. Pharmacodynamic measurements of platelet
      function will be performed at baseline, after drug intake before retransfusion, immediately
      after retransfusion and 24 hours thereafter.
