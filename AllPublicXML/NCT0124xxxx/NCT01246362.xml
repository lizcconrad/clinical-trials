      The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy of pre-emptive etoricoxib in reducing
      post-operative pain and improving function outcome after a total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic surgeries
      worldwide and has proven to be a success in the treatment of end-stage osteoarthritic knees.
      TKA is associated with significant postoperative pain which may delay the patient's
      functional recovery and necessitate an increased use of opioid analgesias, which are
      themselves associated with significant adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. The
      selective cycloxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was previously shown in a clinical trial
      in a paper by Buvanendran et al to reduce postoperative opioid requirement and improve
      clinical outcomes. Feng et al studied the use of a single dose of rofecoxib pre-operatively
      and its effect on inflammatory markers and postoperative pain. Rofecoxib has, however, been
      withdrawn from the market due to its association with cardiovascular side effects. Our
      current clinical practice in post-operative pain management constitutes post-operative
      etoricoxib but we hypothesize that pre-emptively administering etoricoxib pre-operatively
      would give an even greater benefit in terms of post-operative opioid usage, pain scores, and
      functional recovery in the first 2-3 days. To date, there has been no study investigating
      etoricoxib as a pre-emptive medication in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. We aim
      to conduct a study to test the efficacy of pre-emptive etoricoxib in reducing postoperative
      pain, opioid requirement and improving the rate of functional recovery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients between the ages of 50 and 80 who are listed for single-knee TKA at Singapore
             General Hospital by one of 4 adult reconstructive surgeons for the treatment of
             osteoarthritis will be recruited upon the patient giving written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Younger than 50, older than 80

          -  Known allergy to etoricoxib or other cycloxygenase-2 inhibitors, aspirin or any
             Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

             baseline, or a history of significant clinical or laboratory abnormality that in the
             opinion of the investigator would contraindicate the use of etoricoxib
