  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
      (MBCT) on physical symptoms attributed to chemical exposures, psychological distress, illness
      worry, quality of life, and illness perceptions in patients suffering from multiple chemical
      sensitivity (MCS). Furthermore, a secondary objective is to evaluate whether a possible
      symptom reduction is mediated by an increased level of mindfulness.

      The primary hypothesis is that the self-reported severity of MCS symptoms and the degree to
      which chemical exposures causes symptoms and the impact on daily life will be significantly
      improved in the MBCT treatment group as compared to the control group.

    <description>MBCT is partly based on the mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn and colleagues, and partly on cognitive therapy for depression, the latter influence particularly expressed through the aspect of &quot;decentering&quot;, meaning not accepting the content of thoughts as facts and not identifying with the thought. The MBCT programme in this study includes 2½ hours of training once a week for 9 weeks. In addition, participants are encouraged to practice at home for up to 45 min per day, 6 days a week during the entire course.</description>
