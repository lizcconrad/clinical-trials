    <textblock>
      MK-2206 is a newly discovered drug that may slow or stop cancer growth. This drug has been
      used in other research studies, and information from those other research studies suggests
      that MK-2206 may help to slow or stop the growth of malignant gliomas. In addition, MK-2206
      has the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a
      separation of circulating blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central nervous system
      (CNS); and although it serves as a protective barrier, it can often interfere with
      potentially beneficial treatments reaching the brain successfully. Therefore, the
      investigators hope that because MK-2206 can successfully cross the blood-brain barrier, it
      will be more effective in patients. The purpose of this study is to see how well MK-2206
      works in patients with malignant gliomas and will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 and Part
      2.

      Part 1 of the study will investigate the effects of MK-2206 on Akt signaling in tumor tissue.
      Ten patients with recurrent GBM who require reoperation will receive a short pre-operative
      course of MK-2206. After recovery from surgery, patients will resume MK-2206 until disease
      progression or the development of unacceptable toxicities. Part 2 of this trial will be
      initiated only AFTER analysis of Part 1 data shows drug penetration into tumor tissue; if
      there is no significant drug penetration into the tumor and/or there is no reduction of pAkt
      levels, progression to Part 2 of the trial will be halted. The primary goal of Part 2 is to
      determine the therapeutic efficacy of MK-2206 as measured by 6-month progression-free
      survival (PFS6). In Part 2, 40 participants with GBM and 18 with anaplastic glioma will be
      treated with MK-2206 weekly at a dose selected on the basis of an ongoing phase 1 study.
      Treatment duration will be measured in 4-week cycles. Participants will remain on treatment
      until tumor progression, as long as there are no unacceptable toxicities. Responses will be
      assessed by clinical examinations every 4 weeks and MRI scans every 8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Participants will have the following tests and procedures within 2 days before the first
           dose of MK-2206: medical history, physical examination, blood tests, urine tests and
           EKG.

        -  Participants in Part 2 of this research study may also have optional FDG-PET imaging
           done. If the participant agrees, they will have two PET scans performed; one within a
           week before beginning study drug, and another within 3 days after starting study drug.

        -  Participants in Part 1 will take MK-2206 orally prior to surgery on days 1-8 (with
           surgery after the MK-2206 dose on day 8). They will have an EKG within 4-8 hours after
           their first dose of MK-2206, and again on Day 8. During surgery, a sample of the tumor
           will be taken for research. The tumor tissue will be analyzed to measure the level of
           MK-2206 in the tumor and to study the effect of the drug on the tumor. Genetic tests
           will be done on the tumor tissue to determine if the tumor's genetic profile can predict
           response to treatment. You will also have 3 teaspoons of blood drawn to measure the
           level of MK-2206 in the blood. An assessment of the participant's tumor by MRI or CT
           scan will be done within 96 hours of surgery to determine how much of the tumor has been
           removed. One to 4 weeks after surgery (within 14 days of the last MRI/CT scan), MK-2206
           treatment will restart at the same schedule as before surgery (weekly dosing). Within 2
           days prior to restarting MK-2206 the following tests and procedures must be completed:
           medical history, physical examination, blood tests, urine test and EKG.

        -  Participants in both groups will receive MK-2206 by mouth once a week (Days 1, 8, 15,
           and 22). Participants will receive an EKG within 4-8 hours after their first dose of
           MK-2206 (for Part 1 participants, this is day 1 pre-surgery; for Part 2 participants,
           this is day 1 of the first cycle of treatment). Participants will receive an EKG weekly
           during their first cycle of treatment with MK-2206. The following tests and procedures
           are required within 2 days before the start of each subsequent 4-week cycle of MK-2206
           treatment: medical history, physical examination, blood tests, urine test, and EKG. Each
           treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which time participants will be taking the study
           drug once a week. In addition, patients will also need the following tests/procedures
           performed during treatment cycles: medical history and physical examination on Day 15
           (+/- 2 days) of Cycles 1 and 2 and blood tests weekly during Cycle 1 and on Day 15 (+/-
           2 days) of cycle 2.

        -  Assessments of the tumor by MRI will be performed within one week prior to the start of
           each odd-numbered cycle, starting with cycle 3.

        -  Participants can continue to receive study drug until their disease worsens or develop
           unacceptable side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. Participants will be eligible if
             the orginal histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of
             glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made.

          -  Unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan. A scan should be
             performed within 14 days of registration. The same type of scan must be used
             throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement. MRI scans are
             preferred whenever possible. If participants in Part 2 of the study are taking
             corticosteroids, the dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to
             the scan.

          -  Must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy. From the start of
             scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have elapsed: 4 weeks from
             any investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy, or 4 weeks from other
             anti-tumor therapies.

          -  Must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of at least 12
             weeks from the completion of radiation therapy.

          -  Prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery
             must have confirmation of progressive disease based upon nuclear imaging, MR
             spectroscopy, or histopathology.

          -  Participants having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will
             be eligible as long as the following conditions apply: a) they have recovered from the
             effects of surgery, b) residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not
             mandated for eligibility. To best assess the extent of residual disease
             post-operatively, and MRI or CT scan should be done no later than 96 hours following
             surgery or at least 4 weeks post-operatively, in either case within 14 days prior to
             registration. If participants in Part 2 of the study are taking corticosteroids, the
             dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. If steroids
             are added or the steroid dose is increased between the date of the screening MRI or CT
