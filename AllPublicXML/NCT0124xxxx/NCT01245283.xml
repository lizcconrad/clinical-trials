    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC Score); Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC is a standard, multidimensional, self-administered functional-health status instrument for patients with lower limb OA. Subjects will complete the self-assessment at the time intervals indicated to document any change in their perception of their functional health status.
Scale for Total score: the higher score means the worst the function and pain Total WOMAC scores will have a range of 0 to 96 (best and worst scores possible).
0-20 Womac pain (0= best, 20=worst) 0-8 Womac stiffness (0= best, 8=worst) 0-68 Womac functional (0= best, 68=worst) 0-96 Womac Total (0= best, 96=worst)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six Minute Walk Test; Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will walk at a self-selected pace in the lab around a pre-measured loop for a period of six minutes. Subjects will complete the walk test at the time intervals indicated to document any change. 6 minute walk test is a baseline and 4 month post intervention measurement. It is used to measure distance covered while walking during 6 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chair Rise Time and Stair Climb Time; Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional abilities related to moving body weight will be captured using two standard tests, the chair rise time and stair climb time. Subjects will complete the tests at the time intervals indicated to document any change in their functional abilities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leg Press Test; Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will do a one repetition maximum. Participants will perform a leg press. The leg press is a weight training exercise in which the individual pushes a weight or resistance away from them using their legs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leg Extensions Test; Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant perform a one repetition maximum . Participants will perform a leg extension which is a resistance weight training exercise that targets the quadriceps muscle in the legs. The exercise is done using a machine called the Leg Extension Machine. This resistence is measured in pounds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Leg Curl Test; Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will perform a one repetition maximum. Participant will perform a leg curl which is an isolation exercise that targets the hamstring muscles. The exercise involves flexing the lower leg against resistance towards the buttocks. This resistence is measured in pounds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chest Press; Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will perform a one repetition maximum. Participants will perform a chest press which is an upper body strength training exercise that consists of pressing a weight upwards from a supine position. This resistence is measured in pounds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Press Test; Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will perform a one repetition maximum. Participants will perform the shoulder press which is a weight training exercise, typically performed while standing, in which a weight is pressed straight upwards from the shoulders until the arms are locked out overhead. This resistence is measured in pounds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seated Row Test; Change From Baseline at 4 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will perform a one repetition maximum. Participants will do a seated row test which is pulling on a cable to lift weight from a seated row position. This resistence is measured in pounds.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC is a standard, multidimensional, self-administered functional-health status instrument for patients with lower limb OA. Subjects will complete the self-assessment at the time intervals indicated to document any change in their perception of their functional health status.
Scale for Total score: the higher score means the worst the function and pain Total WOMAC scores will have a range of 0 to 96 (best and worst scores possible).
