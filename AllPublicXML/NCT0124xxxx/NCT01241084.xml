      Objective The aim of the trial is to evaluate the beneficial effects of the oral
      administration of the probiotic L. Reuteri (ReuterinÂ®) on the airways allergic inflammation
      in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma.

      Study design This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controller trial. 50 children will
      be enrolled (age range 6-14 years), affected by mild to moderate persistent asthma based on
      the GINA Guidelines and allergic to acarus (Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus
      ++/+++). At the enrollment period all children have to show asthmatic symptoms and to be
      under antileukotrienes treatment (Montelukast 5mg/die) based on the GINA Guidelines. Any
      inhaling corticosteroids therapies have to be stopped 8 weeks before the trial beginning.

      Patients will be randomly divided into 2 treatment groups:

      Group A: 25 patients will take antileukotrienes + L. reuteri drops (108 CFU = 5 drops daily).

      Group B: 25 patients will take antileukotrienes + placebo. At the enrollment period (T0),
      after the 1st and the 2nd month of supplementation (T1 and T2), and also 1 month after the
      supplementation end (T3), all patients will be clinically evaluated through spirometry, FeNO
      determination and exhale condensate analysis.

      During the entire trial period the number of asthmatic exacerbations and the use of beta-2
      antagonists will be monitored by a diary properly examined at T1, T2 and T3.

      All children will be enrolled at the Asthma and Infant Respiratory Physiopathology unit
      &quot;Michele Miraglia del Giudice&quot; of the &quot;F. Fede&quot; Pediatric Department.

      The analysis of the inflammatory markers on the exhaled condensate will be performer at T1,
      T2 and T3 in the Pharmacology unit of the Experimental Medicine Department.

      During the trial it will be possible to administer only salbutamole MDI if it needed. If
      patients will be administered with any systemic corticosteroids they will exit from the
      trial.

      At the enrolment period all patients will receive the completed information on the trial and
      the informed consent will be properly signed.
