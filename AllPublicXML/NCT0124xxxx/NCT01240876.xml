    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Over the 4 days prior to the randomization visit, the patient has a mean score greater
             than or equal to 5 (of 10) for &quot;Average Pain Over the Past 24 Hours&quot; for the pain in
             the affected leg as assessed by the 11-Point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS-11) captured
             in the electronic diaries. The patient must have valid (non-missing) data for at least
             3 out of the 4 days, and the mean score must be at least 5 without rounding.

          -  The patient has a current diagnosis of lumbosacral radicular pain. Pain must radiate
             into the leg in a dermatomal/myotomal distribution consistent with the diagnosis of
             lumbosacral radicular pain in the suspected involved nerve root. Based on history and
             medical records (if available), the duration of the current episode of pain must be
             between 6 and 52 weeks duration.

          -  Diagnosis must be confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or existing computed
             tomography [CT] or MRI related to the symptoms present at screening) performed within
             6 months prior to screening and demonstrating disk herniation at a location consistent
             with the clinical symptoms of radicular pain. Other incidental pathology is permitted
             as long as it is asymptomatic and believed not causal of the primary diagnosis of
             lumbosacral radicular pain at the specific spinal level as described below.

          -  The patient must have at least 1 of the following: a positive straight leg raise
             (L5-S1), positive femoral stretch test (L3-L4), or other positive test result upon
             physical examination that is consistent with the presence of nerve root irritation at
             the nerve root suspected to be involved in the diagnosed lumbosacral radicular pain at
             screening.

          -  Herniation must affect L3-L4, L4-L5, or L5-S1 and must be consistent with clinical
             presentation of the current episode of lumbosacral radicular pain as described above.

          -  Patients with significant or progressive sensory impairment or motor impairment (such
             as foot drop) must be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the investigator, and must
             in each case receive written approval of the Sponsor prior to randomization.

          -  There must be confirmation that the patient does not have an active tuberculosis
             infection at screening. The patient should have either a negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold
             blood test or negative tuberculin skin test (TST) result at screening; however if
             QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test or TST is positive, a chest radiogram may be used to
             determine whether a patient has an active infection.

          -  The patient is willing to keep all analgesic medication and other therapy usage (such
             as physiotherapy, acupuncture, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS])
             stable or decreased during the study and use only the rescue pain medication as needed
             and as specified by the protocol.

          -  The patient is in good health (with the exception of the condition under study) as
             determined by a medical and psychiatric history, medical examination, ECG, serum
             chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (ie, not surgically sterile or 2 years
             postmenopausal), must use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree
             to continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after
             participation in the study, and have a negative pregnancy test at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The patient:

          -  has a documented history of an allergic reaction (hives, rash, etc.) or a clinically
             significant intolerance to study drug or ingredients.

          -  has a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m2.

          -  the patient has an established history of a major psychiatric disorder, not controlled
             with medication or appears to have anxiety that would interfere with clinical pain
             scores or participation in the trial.

          -  has clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology or
             urinalysis, including serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase/aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase/alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of the reference range or an
             estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2
             (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] study formula) at screening.

          -  has received an intra-epidural steroid injection for the treatment of the current
             episode of sciatica during the last 3 months prior to screening.

          -  has significant pain unrelated to the disk herniation that would significantly
             compromise assessment of the radicular back and leg pain related to the disk
             herniation.

          -  has radiologic evidence of disk herniation at more than 1 spinal level, and clinical
             evidence of lumbosacral radicular pain at more than 1 spinal nerve corresponding to
             the levels of the multiple disk herniations.

          -  has received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening, or is
             scheduled to receive an investigational drug other than blinded study drug during the
             course of this study.

          -  has had lumbar or sacral back surgery related to the specific disk that is the cause
             of the radicular pain upon presentation to the study, or currently plans to undergo
             spine surgical intervention while in the study.

          -  has received epidural corticosteroid injections in the back within 3 months of
             screening.

          -  is involved in an ongoing worker's compensation claim, disability claim, or litigation
             related to any pain problem.

          -  has any active infection that is not self-limiting and not resolved prior to study
             drug administration.

          -  has a history of malignancy or evidence of malignancy or lymphoproliferative or
             neoplastic disease with the exception of successfully treated basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia within 5 years of the
             screening visit.

          -  has a history of systemic fungal infection.

          -  has a history of opportunistic infection within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  has a history of known or suspected chronic infection, tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The
