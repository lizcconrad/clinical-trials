  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether taurolidine with heparin locking solution
      prevents recurrence of central venous catheter related blood stream infections in
      haemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections related to long-term haemodialysis catheters are associated with significant
      morbidity. A high proportion of those people initially treated with antibiotics to clear a
      catheter infection develop a second infection within six months, necessitating the removal
      and replacement of the dialysis catheter.

      This study will examine the efficacy of an antimicrobial catheter locking solution called
      taurolidine with heparin in preventing a second infection within six months of a significant
      infection. This solution will be compared with the solution used currently (heparin) which is
      left inside the catheter between dialysis sessions.

      This is a clinical study given that antimicrobial catheter locks are thought to reduce the
      risk of blood stream infections and the ultimate need for catheter change. However, there is
      concern that the absence of an anticoagulant in the lock solution increases the risk of
      catheter thrombosis, again requiring a change of catheter but for a separate reason. It is
      unclear therefore whether a solution containing both taurolidine (an antimicrobial) and
      heparin (an anticoagulant) will increase catheter survival.

      The results of this study will help guide the appropriate suse of locking solutions in the
      future.
