          9. Patients may receive concurrent radiation therapy to painful bone metastases or areas
             of impending bone fracture as long as radiation therapy is initiated prior to study
             entry. Patients who have received prior radiotherapy must have recovered from any
             toxicity induced by this treatment (toxicity grade less than or equal to 1).

         10. Patients must be disease-free of prior invasive cancers for greater than 5 years with

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient who has had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy within 3 weeks
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin C or bevacizumab), or who has not recovered from
             the adverse events due to previous agents administered more than 4 weeks prior to
             Study Day 1. If the patient has residual toxicity from prior treatment,toxicity must
             be less than or equal to Grade 1.

             wounds must be fully healed.

          3. Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study with an
             investigational compound or device within 30 days of Study Day 1.

          4. Patient has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. However,
             patients with CNS metastases who have completed a course of therapy would be eligible
             for the study provided they are clinically stable for at least 1 month prior to entry
             as defined as: (1) no evidence of new or enlarging CNS metastasis (2)off steroids that
             are used to minimize surrounding brain edema.

          5. Patient has a primary central nervous system tumor.

          6. Patient has known hypersensitivity to the components of study drug or its analogs.

          7. Patient has a history or current evidence of clinically significant heart disease
             including:

               -  Clinically significant congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,

               -  Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, history or current evidence of a
                  myocardial infarction during the last 6 months,and/or a current ECG tracing that

               -  Baseline QTc prolongation greater than 450 msec (Bazett's Formula). Medications
                  included in Arizona CERT Lists 1 and 2 (Appendix D) must be excluded. The
                  concomitant use of drugs that are associated with increased risk for QT
                  prolongation should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome
                  (Appendix D, Arizona CERT List 3). Similarly, the concomitant use of drugs that
                  are weakly associated with QT prolongation should be generally avoided (Appendix
                  D, Arizona CERT List 4). Arizona CERT List 3 and 4 drugs should be used at the
                  discretion of the Investigator and restricted where applicable. Any therapy given
                  with these drugs should be used with caution, and patients receiving these
                  medications should be carefully monitored.

          8. Patient with evidence of clinically significant bradycardia (heart rate less than 50
             ), or a history of clinically significant bradyarrhythmias such as sick sinus
             syndrome, 2nd degree AV block (Mobitz Type 2), or patients taking beta blockers,
             non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or digoxin.

          9. Patient with uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., 160/90 mHg SiBP). Patients who are
             controlled on antihypertensive medication will be allowed to enter the study.

         10. Patient at significant risk for hypokalemia (e.g., patients on high dose diuretics, or
             with recurrent diarrhea).

         11. Patient with poorly controlled diabetes defined as HbA1C greater than 8%.

         12. Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or lab
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

         13. Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Patient is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including
             &quot;recreational use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last
             year) of drug or alcohol abuse.

         15. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children
             within the projected duration of the study.

         16. Patient is known to be Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive

         17. Patient has known history of Hepatitis B or C or active Hepatitis A.

         18. Patient has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A patient who is clinically
             stable following treatment for these conditions is eligible.

         19. Patient is receiving treatment with oral corticosteroids (note: inhaled
             corticosteroids are permitted).
