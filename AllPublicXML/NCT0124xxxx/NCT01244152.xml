      The primary aim of the study is to design a group-based, culturally appropriate
      self-management skills training intervention for disadvantaged African-Americans with both
      diabetes and hypertension and to compile an intervention Manual of Operations (MOO). The
      investigators are developing an intervention to assist individuals in reducing weight and
      hemoglobin A1c.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (HgA1c&gt;7%), requiring the patient to take at
             least one tablet per day or one insulin injection per day and a diagnosis of
             hypertension (130/80) requiring them to take at least one medication per day;

          -  Participants must identify themselves as African-American;

          -  Participant resides in or proximal to the North Lawndale neighborhood;

          -  Secure written permission from their physician to engage in moderate physical
             activity. This set of participants may be at high risk for cardiac disease and this
             exclusion avoids putting them at undue risk;

          -  BMI â‰¥ 25. Participant must be overweight because the main goal of our intervention is
             weight loss of 5% or more of initial body weight.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diet-controlled diabetes;

          -  Hypertension controlled with lifestyle modification only;

          -  Endstage renal disease, stroke with paresis, congestive heart failure (NYHA class 3 or
             4), or other major endorgan complication of diabetes;

          -  Comorbid conditions limiting probable life span to &lt;4 years (e.g. cancer, AIDS) or
             indication of end-stage complications of diabetes (kidney dialysis, or transplant,
             blindness, or lower extremity amputation);

          -  Receiving treatment for a major psychiatric disorder (i.e. schizophrenia);

          -  Unable to give informed consent;

          -  Are under the age of 18-While type-2 diabetes and hypertension are increasing in those
             under the age of 18, adolescent medicine is a separate specialty area from adult
             medicine. Interventions should be targeted specifically toward this age group to take
             into consideration the specific emotional and psychological needs of adolescents;

          -  Alcoholism as measured by the CAGE.screener for alcohol abuse.
