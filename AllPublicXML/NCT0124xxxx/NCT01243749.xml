  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To document the safety and overall clinical performance of the Resolute Zotarolimus-Eluting
      Coronary Stent System in a real-world patient population requiring stent implantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Resolute stent is designed to support the approach of delivering drug to the coronary
      arterial tissue over a longer period of time than that offered by current approved DES
      products. This method of prolonged drug elution may address the need to control local
      vascular neointimal proliferation in patients with complex lesions for extended therapeutic
      effect. The purpose of this multi-center trial is to investigate the clinical safety and
      efficacy of the Endeavor Resolute drug-eluting stent in every-day patients, like stable and
      unstable patients with single or multi-vessel disease and/or complex lesions.

      Patients should be treated according to normal hospital routine practice and in line with the
      applicable guidelines on percutaneous coronary interventions and the Instructions For Use of
      the device.

      1800 patients will be enrolled from China at approximately 40 centers where Endeavor Resolute
      stent is commercially available.
