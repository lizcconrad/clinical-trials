  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of golimumab in Chinese
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Golimumab is a type of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor. TNF is a naturally occurring
      substance in the body, and this substance may cause long-term inflammation. Golimumab may
      help fight disease by blocking the activity of TNF in the body and reducing inflammation and
      pain. Each patient who is allowed to join the study will be put into a group randomly, like
      flipping a coin. Patients may get either golimumab or placebo (which looks like the drug
      being studied but has no active ingredients, for example a sugar pill). The chance that the
      patient will get golimumab is 1 to 1, a 50% chance to receive golimumab and a 50% chance to
      receive placebo. If the patient does not have an improvement in their joints at the Week 16
      visit compared to when they entered the study, and are in Group 1 (placebo group), the
      patient will receive golimumab 50 mg every 4 weeks starting at Week 16. If the patient is in
      Group 2 (golimumab 50 mg), the patient will continue to receive golimumab every 4 weeks
      starting at Week 16. If the patient is in Group 1 and is still receiving placebo injections,
      because there was improvement in their joints at Week 16, the patient will receive golimumab
      50 mg every 4 weeks starting from Week 24. If the patient is in Group 2 (golimumab 50 mg) or
      is already receiving golimumab injections at week 24, the patient will continue to receive
      golimumab every 4 weeks. Safety will be monitored throughout the study, including drawing
      blood and looking at laboratory tests, vital signs (e.g., blood pressure), and the frequency
      and type of adverse events (side effects). The patient will be in the study approximately 56
      weeks. Patients will receive placebo or active compound (golimumab 50 mg subcutaneous
      injections) every four weeks from randomization (Week 0) until Week 48.

    <description>ACR 20 response is defined as &gt;= 20% improvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms and disease activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Activity Index Score (DAS 28) Response, Using CRP (C-reactive Protein)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 using CRP is a measure of tender and swollen joints (28 joints each) and the patient's assessments of disease activity. A score of higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, and a score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A DAS28 (using CRP) responder is defined as a participant with a DAS28 response of &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Moderate&quot; at Week 14. A &quot;Good&quot; response is defined as a patient with a DAS28 score of &lt;= 3.2 at Week 14 with improvement from Baseline in DAS28 score of &gt; 1.2. A &quot;Moderate&quot; response was defined as a patient with DAS28 score of &gt;3.2-5.1 at Week 14 with improvement from baseline in DAS28 score of &gt;0.6 to &gt;1.2 The table below shows the number of participants in each treatment group who were DAS28 responders at Week 14.</description>

    <measure>HAQ (Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire) Score Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 categories (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). The full range of the HAQ scale is 0-24 with 0 being the best possible outcome. The HAQ score is calculated as the sum of the category scores divided by the number of categories scored, giving a possible range of scores from 0 to 3 with 0 being the best possible outcome (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, or 3=unable to do). The mean change from baseline at Week 24 in HAQ score is provided below for each treatment group. A negative change from baseline is indicative of a lesser degree of difficulty in accomplishing tasks assessed in the HAQ.</description>

        <title>Disease Activity Index Score (DAS 28) Response, Using CRP (C-reactive Protein)</title>
        <description>DAS28 using CRP is a measure of tender and swollen joints (28 joints each) and the patient’s assessments of disease activity. A score of higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, and a score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A DAS28 (using CRP) responder is defined as a participant with a DAS28 response of “Good” or “Moderate” at Week 14. A &quot;Good&quot; response is defined as a patient with a DAS28 score of &lt;= 3.2 at Week 14 with improvement from Baseline in DAS28 score of &gt; 1.2. A “Moderate” response was defined as a patient with DAS28 score of &gt;3.2-5.1 at Week 14 with improvement from baseline in DAS28 score of &gt;0.6 to &gt;1.2 The table below shows the number of participants in each treatment group who were DAS28 responders at Week 14.</description>

        <title>HAQ (Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire) Score Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>The HAQ assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 categories (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). The full range of the HAQ scale is 0-24 with 0 being the best possible outcome. The HAQ score is calculated as the sum of the category scores divided by the number of categories scored, giving a possible range of scores from 0 to 3 with 0 being the best possible outcome (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, or 3=unable to do). The mean change from baseline at Week 24 in HAQ score is provided below for each treatment group. A negative change from baseline is indicative of a lesser degree of difficulty in accomplishing tasks assessed in the HAQ.</description>
