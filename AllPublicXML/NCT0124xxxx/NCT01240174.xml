  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies show, guidelines state, and performance measures assert that antibiotic prescribing
      for uncomplicated acute bronchitis is inappropriate. However, clinicians prescribe
      antimicrobials in over 60% of the 22.5 million acute bronchitis visits in the United States
      each year. Previous successful interventions have only reduced the antimicrobial prescribing
      rate to 40% or 50%. It is unknown if the antimicrobial prescribing rate for acute bronchitis
      can be brought to near zero percent in actual practice while maintaining patient safety and
      satisfaction. The goal of this study is to develop an Electronic Health Record
      (EHR)-integrated algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with acute bronchitis
      with a goal of reducing the antibiotic prescribing rate to near zero percent.

      We will use a multi-modal implementation - including computerized decision support, reporting
      tools, and clinician feedback - and quality improvement techniques to ensure adherence to the
      algorithm and reduce the antimicrobial prescribing rate to near zero percent. The duration of
      the intervention will be 4 years.
