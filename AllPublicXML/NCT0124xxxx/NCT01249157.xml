  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) is a newly developed imaging examination of the breast
      that uses a radioactive glucose based tracer, which is a form of sugar attached to a low
      radiation agent, to detect cancer cells. The radioactive glucose based tracer is called
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and it is FDA approved. A PEM scanner is able to better detect
      cancer cells within the breast, more than a regular PET scanner. The PEM scanner is also FDA
      approved. This type of imaging may be able to see the breast cancer before it could be seen
      with mammograms and may be as good as or better than breast MRI.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the value of FDG Positron Emission Mammography (PEM)
      with contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breast for patients with
      breast cancer. This study will also perform special pathology test to compare the FDG PEM and
      contrast enhanced breast MRI images with the results from the standard of care breast
      surgery. This may teach us more about the biology of each breast tumor.

    <description>All consenting patients who are to have staging breast MRI, will be offered 18FDG PEM (Positron Emission Mammography) within 30 days. If the patient had a previous breast MRI that was done within 30 days at an outside institution, this MRI can be used if a radiologist determines that it is an adequate study. The surgery date will not be affected by the additional PEM evaluation. All imaging will be done and reviewed by MSKCC breast imagers. MRI and PEM findings suggestive of malignancy will be prospectively recorded in both the ipsilateral and contralateral breast.</description>

    <description>An additional 5 women will be enrolled at the beginning of the study for training purposes only and will not be included in the assessment of this study. Once the patient has had both breast MRI and PEM, the location of each site of potential breast cancer will be listed for each modality. The location of each abnormality on each imaging examination will be documented. Once the histopathologic evaluation has been performed, the pathology results will be compared to the imaging results for each modality. Furthermore, comparison of the performance of MRI and PEM will then be made with the pathological results as the truth. Comparison of the histology and biomarkers in each lesion detected by each modality will be done in order to determine if these factors affect detection by each modality.</description>
