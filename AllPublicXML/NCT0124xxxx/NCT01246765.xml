      The purpose of the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics is to determine
      the frequency of birth defects among infants exposed to atypical antipsychotics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics is dedicated to evaluating the
      safety of atypical antipsychotic medications that may be taken by women during pregnancy to
      treat a wide range of mood, anxiety, or psychiatric disorders. The primary goal of this
      Registry is to determine the frequency of major malformations, such as heart defects, cleft
      lip, or neural tube defects, in infants exposed to atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy.
      We are currently studying the following medications:

        -  Abilify (aripiprazole)

        -  Aristada (aripiprazole lauroxil)

        -  Clozaril (clozapine)

        -  Fanapt (iloperidone)

        -  Geodon (ziprasidone)

        -  Invega (paliperidone)

        -  Latuda (lurasidone)

        -  Rexulti (brexpiprazole)

        -  Risperdal (risperidone)

        -  Saphris (asenapine)

        -  Seroquel (quetiapine)

        -  Zyprexa (olanzapine)

    <description>The primary outcome for this study is rates of major malformations in infants exposed in utero to atypical antipsychotics during the first trimester of pregnancy. This data is collected through pediatric medical record review through the first six months of infants' lives.</description>

    <description>Maternal health outcomes during pregnancy will also be assessed in women taking atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy (for example: weight gain, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neonatal health outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth to six months old</time_frame>
    <description>Other neonatal health outcomes will also be assessed in infants exposed in utero to atypical antipsychotics (for example: birth weight/length, Apgar scores, NICU admission rates, and any other neonatal complications). Presence of extrapyramidal symptoms from birth to one month old will also be assessed in infants exposed to atypical antipsychotics proximate to delivery.</description>
