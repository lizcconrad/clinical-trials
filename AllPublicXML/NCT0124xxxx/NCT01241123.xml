  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Fast-track&quot; or &quot;enhanced recovery&quot; programs, which are the new standardized accelerated
      clinical pathways for post-operative care for colorectal surgeries, have three goals: to 1)
      quicken the return of bowel function (as evidenced by passage of flatus and stool), 2)
      decrease the length of hospital stays, and 3) decrease the rate of overall complications.
      Aside from several components, or interventions that can vary from institution to
      institution, these programs share three common modalities: early oral feeding, protocol pain
      management regimens less dependent on opioid use, and early mobilization (i.e. ambulation).
      Evidence-based practice has shown that the modalities individually contribute significantly
      to the program goals except for post-operative ambulation, which has not been shown to
      increase bowel function although it contributes to decreased pulmonary complications and
      early discharge of patients. Still, surgeons continue to advocate for early ambulation to aid
      in the return of bowel function despite the lack of clear evidence supporting this notion.

      The investigators propose a randomized, prospective clinical trial exploring the impact that
      post-operative ambulation has on the outcome of colorectal surgeries, particularly on the
      return of bowel function and the length of hospital stay. With the use of pedometers to
      measure physical activity, the investigators will subject patients to either the current
      traditional post-operative care or one with an aggressive ambulation regimen. Through the use
      of radiopaque markers, the investigators hope to correlate increased ambulation with
      increased gastrointestinal motility function to prove the impact of early ambulation on
      post-operative care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject patients are those who will undergo colorectal surgeries at NMCP. Colorectal
             surgery is defined as any surgery involving the gastrointestinal tract from the
             ileocecal valve to the dentate line and includes all laparoscopic approaches. This
             surgery includes, but is not limited to:

               -  Ileocecetomy

               -  Partial colectomy (including right, left, and sigmoid colectomies)

               -  Hartmann procedure

               -  Total abdominal colectomy

               -  Proctocolectomy

               -  Colostomy formation or takedown

               -  Low anterior resection

               -  Abdominoperineal resection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Reasons for subject exclusion are non-ambulatory conditions are conditions whereby a
             subject cannot walk or move from place to place. Examples of non-ambulatory conditions
             include but are not limited to: severe vasculopathy with limiting claudication (leg
             pain when ambulating due to poor blood flow) of less than 100 meters, all wheelchair
             bound conditions (anatomically missing both legs without adequate prosthesis, severely
             limiting pulmonary disease, neurologic disorders - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,
             severe multiple sclerosis, paraplegia), fractured leg bones requiring temporary and/or
             permanent use of a walking aid or any congenital disorders limiting ambulation
             (osteogenesis imperfecta, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy). Any patient who takes
             Alvimopan (Entereg Â®) will be excluded or terminated from the study. Alvimopan is an
             FDA-approved drug that accelerates bowel motility and is used to prevent and/or treat
             post-operative ileus. In addition, patients with underlying gastrointestinal motility
             issues, gastroparesis, chronic constipation, etc or who may have complications who may
             not be able to ambulate during the hospital course (i.e. prolonged intubated
             postoperatively) will be excluded as well. Pregnant women will also be excluded from
             the study.
