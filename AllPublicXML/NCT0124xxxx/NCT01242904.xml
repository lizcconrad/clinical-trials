  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the method of renal replacement therapy used by close to 200,000
      end stage renal disease patients worldwide to help replace the functions that are no longer
      performed by their kidneys. An important advantage of PD is it offers an alternative to
      hemodialysis that can be safely performed by patients in their own homes. In PD, the
      peritoneal membrane that lines the abdomen acts as a dialyzer that allows the transfer of
      solutes and water between the membrane capillaries and a dialysis solution that is infused
      into the peritoneal cavity. PD dialysis solutions typically require high concentrations of
      glucose to adequately perform these functions. Over time the continued exposure of the
      peritoneal membrane to high concentrations of glucose can permanently damage the membrane.
      Icodextrin is a polyglucose molecule that has been developed for use in PD solutions that
      does not harm the peritoneal membrane. However, its use can lead to inadequate fluid removal.
      Recent research has focused on finding a PD solution, or combination of solutions, that will
      maximize the removal of toxic substances and metabolites while maintaining regulation of
      fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. A bimodal solution that combines glucose and
      icodextrin has been shown in observational studies to be effective and safe. The
      investigators propose a randomized, controlled, blinded study that will determine the
      effectiveness and safety of this bimodal fluid in a Canadian PD population. The investigators
      hypothesize that the use of the bimodal solution during the long (day) dwell will lead to an
      improvement in 24 hour ultrafiltration efficiency as compared to usual care using icodextrin
      for the long dwell.

    <description>Ultrafiltration Efficiency (UFE): UFE is defined as the amount of 24 hour net Ultrafiltration (UF) obtained for every gram of carbohydrate absorbed from the dialysis solution.
24-hour net ultrafiltration (in mL) is recorded automatically by the Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) cycler.
Carbohydrate absorption is determined by calculating the difference (in grams) between the amount of glucose (measured by lab analysis) in the 24 hr peritoneal effluent, and the amount of glucose in the patient's dialysis prescription.
UFE will be calculated in mL/g (ie a divided by b)</description>
