      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue in the laboratory from patients who received cetuximab
      may help doctors understand and predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in predicting response to cetuximab in
      patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine, among patients with advanced CRC, whether the effect of treatment
           (cetuximab vs bevacizumab) on progression-free survival (PFS) depends on tumor BRAF
           V600E mutational status.

      Secondary

        -  To study the relationships between tumor BRAF V600E mutational status, OS, and tumor
           response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded baseline tumor samples are analyzed
      for BRAF V600E mutation. Mutation status is correlated with clinical response and outcome
      data from patients enrolled on CALGB-C80405.
