  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In several observational studies, non-ablative fractional photothermolysis (FP) has been
      reported to bridge the gap between efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of melasma.
      While some beneficial effects have been attributed to non-ablative FP in treating melasma,
      methodological constraints (e.g., a limited number of patients; no control group assignment)
      impair efficacy assessment; currently published results neither allow researchers and
      clinicians to draw valid conclusions nor warrant recommendations for therapy. In particular,
      bias resulting from poorly designed trials may mislead clinicians into making a wrong
      decision and generate not only unnecessary treatment (i.e., costs), but also a risk of side
      effects for patients. Therefore, the purpose of this trial was to clarify the efficacy and
      safety of FP in the treatment of melasma as compared to the lone application of a
      sun-blocking lotion (SPF &gt;50).
