      The purpose of this study is to show that CRT(Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) pacing in
      patients with severe functional MR (Mitral Regurgitation) who are not currently indicated for
      CRT will demonstrate chronic benefit of MR reduction( via echo measured MR/LA area and ERO
      per American Society of ECHO guidelines) and to show that CRT pacing is safe in these
      patients.

      Approximately 50 patients will be randomized, followed and analyzed in this prospective
      study. Patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be enrolled and
      implanted with a CRT system. Baseline evaluation, which includes clinical symptom evaluation
      and an echocardiogram, will be performed at the time of randomization, which should occur as
      soon after device implant as possible but no later than 2 week post -implant. The baseline
      echocardiogram should be acquired prior to the device being programmed to the randomized
      setting. Repeat echocardiograms and scheduled follow-up evaluations will be performed at the
      end of each 3 month crossover period.

    <description>The chronic effect of CRT pacing on the degree of MR in pts with severe-to-moderate or severe functional MR. The treatment being studied is CRT pacing therapy with standard of care LV lead placement. Patients will be randomized to CRT pacing ON vs. OFF and followed for a total of up to 8 months. This includes two 3-month crossover periods for each pacing modality (CRT ON and CRT OFF) and a 6-week washout period between these periods.</description>
