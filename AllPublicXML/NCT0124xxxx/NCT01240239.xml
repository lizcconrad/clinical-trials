  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate different methods of pre-anesthesia consultation,
      with the aim of improving the day of surgery experience for the patient. In this study, we
      will use a telephone consultation, an in-person consultation, and a telemedicine
      consultation, which involves television cameras and monitors that allow live two-way
      communication for the pre-anesthesia consultation. The reason for this study is to evaluate
      the use of telemedicine for the pre-anesthesia consultation. Patients and anesthesiologists
      have been highly satisfied in previous studies using pre-anesthesia telemedicine
      consultation. In this study, we will examine a larger group of patients, as previous studies
      have studied smaller groups of patients.

    <description>Primary outcomes include surgical cancellation rate, delays the day of surgery secondary to inadequate pre-op evaluation, adequacy of the airway, respiratory, and cardiovascular exams, and intra-op and post-op complications. Patient data will include age, gender, ASA Physical Status and type of surgery. The length of the PACE appointment and the number of days prior to surgery the PACE appointment was conducted will be noted. Patient satisfaction with the will be evaluated.</description>
