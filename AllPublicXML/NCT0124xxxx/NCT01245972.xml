    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out more about the use of the pulsed dye laser in the
      treatment of basal cell carcinoma and early stage squamous cell carcinoma that has not
      invaded deep into the skin. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of the
      pulsed dye laser (PDL) can completely clear or regress basal cell carcinoma or early stage
      squamous cell carcinoma.

      Pulsed dye laser is a type of laser that is commonly used to treat lesions on the skin that
      have a prominent blood vessel component. It has been used to treat broken blood vessels on
      the face, hemangiomas in children and adults, leg veins, port wine stains, and other lesions
      with a prominent vascular component.
