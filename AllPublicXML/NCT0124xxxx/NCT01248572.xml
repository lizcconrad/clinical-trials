  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the effective lens position (ELP) - or
      location an intraocular lens (IOL) &quot;sits&quot; in the eye - of the Softec HD IOL. A secondary
      study goal is to determine if measures of the eye taken prior to surgery can reliably predict
      postoperative ELP.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effective lens position (ELP) of the
      study lens, and to report the stability of ELP post-operatively. Additionally, correlations
      of ELP to predicted postoperative lens position, capsular bag metrics, preoperative biometry
      and age will be statistically analyzed for determination of ELP prediction via one, or a
      combination of preoperative variables.
