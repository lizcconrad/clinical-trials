      Safety study with multiple oral doses of LY2608204 given to patients with type 2 diabetes.
      Study subjects will receive once daily doses of LY2608204 for a total treatment duration of
      up to 28 days. In this study, each patient will receive increasing doses of LY2608204 until
      reaching the highest dose that they can tolerate.

      Continuous glucose monitoring devices will be employed for each patient to monitor for
      hypoglycemia during study treatment. Dose titration and dose reduction is determined for each
      individual patient based on their safety and glycemic data.
