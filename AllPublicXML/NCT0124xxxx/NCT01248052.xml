      This is a two part study (Parts A and B), the purpose of which is to determine the safety of
      LY2979165 in healthy people, and any side effects that might be associated with it, and to
      understand how the body handles LY2979165. In addition, Part B, will also look at levels of
      LY2979165 in spinal fluid. Doses investigated will be in the range of 20-1000 mg.
