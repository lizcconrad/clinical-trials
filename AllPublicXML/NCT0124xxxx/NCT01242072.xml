      This an an open-label study to define the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose and
      confirm the clinical effective dose of palifosfamide-tris given intravenously in combination
      with etoposide and carboplatin in a wide range of cancers which etoposide and carboplatin are
      normally given. Once the maximum dose of palifosfamide-tris is determined,a Phase II study
      using the 3 agents combined will begin.
