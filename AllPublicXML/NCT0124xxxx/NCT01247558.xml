  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an observational cohort study utilizing administrative claims data with
      100 patients randomly selected taking Metanx® meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria
      and 400 propensity score matched patients meeting the same criteria to serve as a control
      cohort for analyses. This data includes medical, and pharmacy claims from the HealthCore
      Integrated Research Database for claims submitted during the time period of 01/01/2002
      through 06/30/2007.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The control patients will be matched at a ratio of 4:1 with the Metanx® patients. Covariates
      used to select the propensity matched patients will include: age; gender; health plan type
      and region; DCI score; presence/absence of nephropathy; ischemic heart disease;
      cerebrovascular disease; neoplasm; insulin use; and all-cause health plan costs in the 6-mont
      pre-index period.

      Claims information about patients selected for the study will be followed longitudinally to
      the end of data availability. This data stream will be used to determine treatment patterns
      for Metanx®, healthcare resource utilization, and cost.

        Patients with Diabetes and Peripheral Neuropathy or Peripheral Circulatory Disorder with
        Lower Limb Ulceration Who Have Been Treated with Metanx® or Not Treated with Metanx®.

        Patients selected for the study will be identified from a review of available medical and
        pharmacy data during the period from 01/01/2003 to 06/30/2006. The date of the first
        pharmacy claim of interest within the intake period will be defined as the index date.
