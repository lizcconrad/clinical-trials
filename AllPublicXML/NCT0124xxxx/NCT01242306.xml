  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised study to compare the endothelial dysfunction of BMS vs SES,
      both implanted in the same patient with multiple de novo coronary artery lesions undergoing
      elective PCI. The primary end point will be the evaluation of endothelial dysfunction at 6
      months follow-up by measuring the change in vessel diameter in 5 points of the stent and
      peri-stent site after infusion of acetylcholine.

      This prospective, randomised study compares the endothelial dysfunction of BMS vs SES, both
      implanted in the same patient with multiple de novo coronary artery lesions undergoing
      elective PCI. From february 2009 to may 2009 we aim to enroll 20 patients with at least two
      de novo significant angiographic stenoses in different coronary segments who will have
      similar diameter and length. The primary end point will be the evaluation of endothelial
      dysfunction at 6 months follow-up by measuring the change in vessel diameter in 5 points of
      the stent and peri-stent site after infusion of acetylcholine.

    <description>Acetylcholine will be infused at a concentration of 140 microg/minute, over a period of 2 minutes, yielding estimated intracoronary concentrations of 10(-5)mol/L, with the assumption of a flow rate of 80mL/min). All infusions will be delivered at a constant rate using an infusion pump. Subsequently, in order to evaluate the endothelium-independent vasomotor response, 2mg of isosorbide dinitrate or bolus 250microg of nitroglycerine will be infused by intracoronary bolus in all subjects. The response to nitrate will be recorded 1 minute after the bolus. A 3-min period will be allowed to elapse between each drug infusion.</description>

             vessels on follow-up angiography

          -  patients with a vessel diameter &lt; 2,50 mm and length lesions &lt;10 and &gt;30 mm.

          -  patients with vessel diameter difference (SES vs BMS) &gt;0,5mm and length difference of
             the stenosis &gt;50%

          -  lesions treated with balloon injury &lt;10 mm or &gt;50 mm in length
