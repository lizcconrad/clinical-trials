  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ECG changes during caesarean section are common. Incidence of ST depression on the ECG is up
      to 81% in some studies. Although this may indicate inadequate oxygen supply to the heart
      muscle (myocardial ischaemia) many other theories have been suggested including air entering
      the circulation from the placental bed, high heart rate, hormone or nervous system influences
      and spasm of the coronary blood supply. Perioperative ST depression often reflects an
      imbalance between heart muscle oxygen supply and demand. At the time of delivery, high heart
      rate is common and there is a further increase in the amount of blood the heart has to pump
      every minute due to blood coming back to the circulation from the placental bed. This
      increases oxygen demand and most ST changes are seen at the time of delivery or within 30
      minutes. The clinical significance of these changes is much debated, and apart from a few
      case reports do not appear to be associated with poor heart muscle function or ischaemia
      (lack of oxygen supply). Management of the mother's blood pressure during caesarean section
      has changed greatly in recent years. Intermittent boluses of ephedrine, given when blood
      pressure is low, have been replaced with prevention of low blood pressure and phenylephrine
      has become the drug of choice. Ephedrine increases heart rate and contractility of the heart
      muscle and is likely to increase oxygen demand. Phenylephrine reduces heart rate while
      maintaining blood pressure which may result in a more favorable oxygen supply demand ratio.

      The investigators aim to compare the incidence of ECG changes if the mother's blood pressure
      is maintained with phenylephrine as compared to ephedrine. To see if these ECG changes are
      associated with myocardial ischaemia, the investigators will perform troponin T analysis
      after delivery. Troponin T is a molecule released by ischaemic heart muscle.

    <description>Infusion dose 50 mcg / minute. On/off regimen in response to blood pressure (BP) readings every minute. Approximative 30 minutes treatment duration. Total dose 50 mcg - 1500 mcg *
* We will start the infusion after the spinal anaesthetic (see trial design), and while we will monitor cardiac output and BP (for 20 minutes) the surgeons will prep the patient (surgery not started yet). Birth should occur more or less 10-15 minutes after beginning surgery, so this is approximatively 30 minutes after spinal anaesthetic. It is very unlikely that the infusion will run continuously and exceed 1500 mcg.</description>
