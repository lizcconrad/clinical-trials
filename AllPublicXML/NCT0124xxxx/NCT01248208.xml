  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the growing public health concerns of seasonal influenza and H1N1 in the United States,
      the primary means by which this can be addressed is with prevention, namely, vaccination
      against the influenza virus. The only individuals not able to receive this vaccination in the
      primary care provider's office are those patients with egg allergies and, in rare
      circumstances, individuals with allergies to other components of the vaccine. Current
      guidelines allow for the administration of the influenza vaccine to patients with egg allergy
      using vaccines with low egg protein (ovalbumin) content or by using skin testing followed by
      a 5-dose desensitization protocol. Since this is impractical to perform in the primary care
      office and cumbersome for allergists, many egg-allergic patients simply do not receive the
      influenza vaccine, leaving them more vulnerable to the disease and more likely to become a
      source of contagion.

      Several studies have suggested that influenza vaccination using a 1-2 dose protocol may be
      safe. This fact is due in large part to the low ovalbumin (egg protein) content in modern
      influenza vaccines. All studies of influenza vaccination in egg-allergic patients have been
      done using intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). However, the
      trivalent live-attenuated, cold-adapted influenza vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered
      intranasally, has a lower published ovalbumin content than the injectable vaccines,
      suggesting that it may also be well-tolerated by egg-allergic patients. According to several
      studies, LAIV may be more efficacious than TIV in children.

      It is the goal of the investigators to evaluate the safety of immunizing egg-allergic
      individuals with the LAIV.

      Patients with egg allergy will be recruited into the study. Since the trivalent
      live-attenuated, cold-adapted influenza vaccine (LAIV) contains the lowest amount of egg
      protein of all available influenza vaccines on the market, those who are eligible to receive
      the intranasal formulation (LAIV group) (ie age 2-49y, not asthmatic) will receive FluMist;
      others will receive the intramuscular injection in a single dose without skin testing (TIV
      group). All subjects will be monitored for 30 minutes post-vaccine for any signs/symptoms of
      an immediate allergic reaction. Subjects will also be followed-up by phone 24-48 hours after
      administration to assess for any delayed allergic reaction. Data will be collected for one
      entire Influenza season (2010-2011).

Children aged 6 months-8 years who received a seasonal vaccine for the first time during 2009-2010 but who received only 1 dose should receive 2 doses, rather than 1, during 2010-2011. In addition, for the 2010-11 influenza season, children aged 6 months-8 years who did not receive at least 1 dose of an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine should receive 2 doses of a 2010-11 seasonal influenza vaccine, regardless of previous influenza vaccination history. For all children, the second dose of a recommended 2-dose series should be administered 4 or more weeks after the initial dose.</description>
