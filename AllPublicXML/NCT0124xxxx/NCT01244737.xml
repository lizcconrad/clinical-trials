  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumors are the leading cause of death from solid tumors in children. Tumor imaging is
      important in the management of these tumors, but current imaging methods have limitations in
      providing the necessary information for optimal treatment of these patients. The goal of this
      study is to evaluate the potential utility of positron emission tomography (PET) with
      3'-deoxy-3'-[F-18] fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) in the medical management of brain tumors in
      children. Funding source - FDA Office of Orphan Product Development (OOPD)

    <textblock>
      Although pediatric central nervous system tumors are rare, they are a significant contributor
      to morbidity and mortality in children. Tumor staging, detecting recurrent tumor, and
      assessing the response to therapy are critical in the treatment of brain tumors, but current
      imaging methods have major limitations in providing such information. The objective of this
      study is to validate 3'-deoxy-3'-[F-18] fluorothymidine (18F-FLT) as a measure of tumor
      proliferation and to demonstrate the utility of 18F-FLT as a PET imaging agent in children
      with central nervous system tumors. The proposed studies will evaluate 18F-FLT PET in three
      groups:

        1. Children with a new diagnosis of central nervous system tumor.

        2. Children in whom conventional imaging has raised concern for possible recurrence of a
           central nervous system tumor.

        3. Children receiving post-operative chemotherapy for a central nervous system tumor.

      In these three groups, correlation of 18F-FLT uptake with tumor histopathology and patient
      outcome will be used to assess the utility of 18F-FLT for grading tumors at diagnosis, for
      accurate identification of tumor recurrence, and for early assessment of the response to
      chemotherapy.

    <description>[18F] FLT uptake, as determined by pre-operative FLT-PET imaging, will be compared to histological markers of cellular proliferation in the resected brain tumor. This will be performed in three groups of subjects (3 arms): (1)children with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors, (2) children in whom there is concern for recurrence of central nervous system tumor,(3) children with central nervous system tumors that are treated with post-operative chemotherapy.</description>
