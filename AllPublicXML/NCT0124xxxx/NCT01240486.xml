  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Your child is able to participate in this study, if your child's doctor is planning to start
      your child on HAART (which is a combination of at least 3 anti HIV drugs). When your child is
      treated with HAART, the way your child's body is able to fight infection may change. The
      immune system is the body's defense against infection. Your child's immune system may respond
      in a stronger way to some types of infections that your child may already have. This immune
      response may cause your child to become sick and the condition is then called &quot;immune
      reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot; or IRIS.

      IMPAACT P1073 is a prospective clinical, observational and pathogenesis study of HIV-infected
      infants and children who are ART-naïve and will be initiating a HAART regimen at an IMPAACT
      study site. Where possible, infants and children co-enrolled in IMPAACT studies will be given
      preference for enrollment in P1073.

      The plan is to enroll subjects in P1073 at a timepoint ≤ 1 week prior to starting HAART. For
      DMC purposes, this is Step 1 for P1073, and subjects are designated as a Non-case, according
      to the Study Flow Chart

        This is a prospective, clinical observational and pathogenesis study of HIV-infected
        infants and children stratified into 2 age groups: ≥ 4 weeks to ≤ 12 months of age; and &gt;

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Past or current documentation of a confirmed diagnosis of HIV-1 infection.
             Documentation of HIV-1 infection is defined as positive results from two samples
             collected at different time points. All samples tested must be whole blood, serum, or
             plasma.

               -  Sample #1 may be tested by non-study public or PEPFAR programs. However, both the
                  result and the assay date must be recorded in subject's chart. Source
                  documentation (patient's medical record/chart, Ministry of Health (MOH)
                  registers, laboratory results, etc.) must be available if requested.

               -  Sample #2 must be performed in a CAP/CLIA-approved laboratory (for US sites) or
                  in a laboratory that operates according to GCLP guidelines and participates in an
                  appropriate external quality assurance program (for international sites).

               -  For P1073, the subject may be enrolled before the result of Sample #2 is
                  available. However, the subject will be taken off study should the 2nd result be
                  negative.

                    1. Acceptable tests when subjects are ≤ 18 months of age
