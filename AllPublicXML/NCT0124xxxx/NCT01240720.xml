  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Study Protocol is to provide a basis for the clinical development of
      131I-F16SIP as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent.

      The study follows and is greatly motivated by the promising results of a Phase I/II study
      with a similar investigational drug developed by our Company, 131I-L19SIP, in several Italian
      centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The F16SIP antibody is a fully human antibody, capable of preferential localization around
      tumour blood vessels while sparing normal tissues. The formation of new blood vessels is a
      rare event in the adult (exception made for the female reproductive cycle), but is a
      pathological feature of most aggressive types of cancer. The study aims at determining the
      therapeutic potential of the F16 antibody in SIP format,labelled with the radionuclide 131I,
      for the treatment of patients with different cancer types.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Phase I:

             Patients with cancer, with progressive disease in pre-study period, refractory to
             conventional standard treatments.

             Solid Tumor: Histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer, preferably
             lung cancer, prostate cancer or colorectal cancer (CRC). At least one measurable
             (minimum 2.0 cm), non irradiated lesion defined according to modified RECIST criteria
             i.e. whenever the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its
             neoplastic nature need not be confirmed by cytology/histology.

             Lymphoproliferative Diseases: Histologically/cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             lymphoproliferative disease. At least one measurable (minimum 2.0 cm) non irradiated
             lesion defined according to modified RECIST criteria, i.e. whenever the measurable
             disease is restricted to a solitary lesion; its neoplastic nature needs to be
             confirmed by cytology/histology.

             Phase II:

             the study. Presence of brain metastases at time of screening does not represent an
             exclusion criterion. Lesions will be evaluated according to RECIST for solid tumors or
             to the Revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson BD, JCO 2007, 25,
             579-58) for lymphomas.

          2. ECOG performance status grade 0 or 1.

             alkaline phosphatase≤ 2.5 x UNL; ALT, AST ≤ UNL or ≤ 2.5 x UNL in case of liver
             metastases; albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL; creatinine ≤ UNL.

             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.3.0) Grade ≤ 1.

          6. Negative serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential within 14 days of
             starting treatment.

          7. If of childbearing potential, agreement to use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g.,
             oral contraceptives, condoms, or other adequate barrier controls, intrauterine
             contraceptive devices, or sterilization) beginning at the screening visit and
             continuing until 3 months following last treatment with study drug.

          8. Evidence of a personally signed and dated IEC-approved Informed Consent indicating
             that the patient (or legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the study.

          4. Presence of serious cardiac (congestive heart failure, heart insufficiency &gt; grade II
             NYHA, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within one year prior to study entry,
             uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia), neurological or psychiatric disorders.

          5. Presence of uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any condition which in the judgement
             of the investigator would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the
             results of the study.

          6. Recovery from major trauma including surgery within 4 weeks of administration of study
             treatment.
