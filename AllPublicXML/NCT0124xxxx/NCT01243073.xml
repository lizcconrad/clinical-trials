    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open-label study of single agent imetelstat in patients with essential
      thrombocytopenia or with polycythemia vera who have failed or are intolerant to at least one
      prior therapy, or who refuse standard therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with ET: To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of imetelstat, as measured
      by best hematologic response within the first year of therapy in patients with ET who have
      failed or are intolerant to at least one prior therapy, or who have refused standard therapy.

      For patients with PV: To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of imetelstat, as measured
      by maintenance of Hct &lt; 45% in men and &lt; 42% in women (or pre-specified Hct count that is
      tolerable) without phlebotomy or myelosuppressive therapy within the first year of therapy in
      patients with PV who have failed or are intolerant to at least one prior therapy, or who have
      refused standard therapy.

    <description>Primary objectives are as follows: ET patients - best hematologic response within the first year of therapy and PV patients - maintenance of Hct &lt; 45% in men and &lt; 42% in women (or pre-specified Hct count that is tolerable) without phlebotomy or myelosuppressive therapy within the first year of therapy. Secondary objectives, to determine the durability of hematologic response and to determine the rate of phlebotomy required within the first year of therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>From time of first dose (cycle 1 day 1) through end of study (12 mos after last paricipant is dosed)</time_frame>
    <description>The safety and tolerability of imtelstat will be assessed by the incidence, nature, relatedness and severity of adverse events, laboratory abnormalities and vital signs.</description>

        PV-Specific Criteria

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of PV by WHO criteria

          -  Patients with PV requiring cytoreduction with phlebotomy and/or myelosuppressive
             agents

               -  Patients may have failed or are intolerant to at least one prior therapy, or
                  refuse standard therapy

               -  For those patients receiving phlebotomy only, the frequency over the past year
                  must be at least one phlebotomy every 3 months.

          -  Undergone phlebotomy and attained a Hct &lt; 47% (men) or &lt; 45% (women) (or pre-specified
