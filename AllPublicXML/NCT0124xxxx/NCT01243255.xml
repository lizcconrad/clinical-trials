      The purpose of the survey is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment of hypercholesterolemia in
      Polish patients who are currently on lipid- lowering pharmacological therapy . Efficient
      treatment is defined as achievement of the LDL cholesterol level goals according to the
      European Society of Cardiology 2007 guidlines.
