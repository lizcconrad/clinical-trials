  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The utilization of external cardiohemodynamic patient assessment, applying non-invasive
      stick-on contact patches to the mother's neck on either side and chest wall on either side,
      enables the practitioner to have information about the patient's cardiac function and
      vascular status beyond simply blood pressure and pulse. This information, once collected,
      should open the practitioner's eyes to better assess the patient's disease status and her
      response to therapy. We will use this information to compare the effectiveness of the two
      standard medications used for treatment of maternal high blood pressure.

      Pregnant patients with severe acute hypertension due either to superimposed preeclampsia,
      severe preeclampsia or severe gestational hypertension will be randomized to receive either
      of two antihypertensive agents (hydralazine or labetalol). Just before drug administration
      and immediately thereafter impedance cardiography of the patient will be undertaken and the
      results analyzed relative to the cardiac profile and the drug administered to reduce the
      severe hypertension.
