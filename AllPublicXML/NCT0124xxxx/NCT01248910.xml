  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older people tend to live a sedentary lifestyle which causes a loss of cardiorespiratory
      fitness, impaired postural stability and a increased risk of falls. Social isolation of older
      people leads to depression and other mental diseases. However, numerous studies show that
      age-related degradation processes and functional limitations can be counteracted by physical
      activity. Various studies show that alpine skiing is a complex sport that places demands on
      the cardiorespiratory, neuromuscular and sensorimotor systems. With studies providing
      evidence to suggest alpine skiing is an appropriate activity for elderly as a
      health-enhancing sport, perhaps Alpine skiing could provide the physical activity needed to
      counteract age-related degradation processes and loss of function. To date, there is a lack
      of long-term intervention studies devoted to this topic. The aim of this study was to monitor
      the long-term effects of skiing on the health of older people, as to age-related muscle
      breakdown, cardiorespiratory fitness, body stability, general mobility and the overall
      psychological state of the subjects.
