  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, open label, case-controlled, observational study to evaluate the
      age-adjusted cumulative height velocity in pre-pubertal isolated growth hormone deficient
      (IGHD) and idiopathic short stature (ISS) participants receiving daily doses of somatropin
      (recombinant human growth hormone [rhGH]; Nutropin) using NuSpin device compared to
      historical controls from the national cooperative growth study (NCGS).

    <measure>Annualized Height Velocity in Response to rhGH Treatment Using the NuSpin Device After Two Years of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 24 (Year 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized height velocity (cm per year [cm/yr]) over 2 years was calculated as: [(height in cm at t24 minus (-) height in cm at t0) divided by (date at t24 - date at t0)] multiplied by 365.25, where, t0 is the baseline measurement visit and t24 is the 2-year measurement visit.</description>

    <measure>Annualized Height Velocity in Response to rhGH Treatment Using the NuSpin Device for First Year of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 12 (Year 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized height velocity (cm/yr) after 1 year was calculated as: [(height in cm at t12 - height in cm at t0) divided by (date at t12 - date at t0)] multiplied by 365.25, where, t0 is the baseline measurement visit and t12 is the 1-year measurement visit.</description>

    <measure>Annualized Height Velocity in Response to rhGH Treatment Using the NuSpin Device During the Second Year of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12 to Month 24 (Year 1 to Year 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized height velocity (cm/yr) for second year was calculated as: [(height in cm at t24 - height in cm at t12) divided by (date at t24 - date at t12)] multiplied by 365.25, where, t12 is the 1-year measurement visit and t24 is the 2-year measurement visit.</description>

        <description>The annualized height velocity (cm per year [cm/yr]) over 2 years was calculated as: [(height in cm at t24 minus (–) height in cm at t0) divided by (date at t24 – date at t0)] multiplied by 365.25, where, t0 is the baseline measurement visit and t24 is the 2-year measurement visit.</description>
