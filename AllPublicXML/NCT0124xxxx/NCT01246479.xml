        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have received two vaccinations in study IC51 322. (2) Subjects who were
             enrolled as part of the immunogenicity subgroup of study IC51‐322.

          -  Male or female healthy subjects aged ≥ 9 months to &lt; 21 years at the time of enrolment
             into this study.

          -  Written informed consent by the subject, the subject's legal representative(s),
             according to local requirements, and written informed assent of the subject, if
             applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or clinical manifestation of any Flavivirus disease during study IC51‐322.

          -  Vaccination against JE virus (JEV) (except with IC51) at any time prior or planned
             during this study.

          -  Participation in another study with an investigational product during study IC51‐322
             or IC51‐324.

          -  History of or development of any immunodeficiency including post‐organtransplantation
