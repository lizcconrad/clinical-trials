      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatments (massage therapy or
      ultrasound) directed at skeletal muscle for alleviating pain associated wtih tension
      headache.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic or episodic forms of tension-type headache affect a high percentage of the
      population. Pain from tension-type headache (TTH) not only impacts personal well-being, but
      also poses a significant socioeconomic burden in terms of workdays lost and decreased worker
      productivity. Although TTH is the most prevalent of the headache disorders, there is a
      distinct lack of research with regards to specific treatments for this ailment in comparison
      to all other headache classifications, such as migraine. A muscular involvement is associated
      with TTH and is reported in the research literature as elevation in skeletal muscle
      tenderness, increased presence of active myofascial trigger point's, and physical
      abnormalities in cervical and cranial muscles. Thus, a treatment approach that addresses the
      skeletal musculature could be an important component in the management of TTH. The purpose of
      this randomized trial is to determine the effectiveness of two muscle oriented treatments on
      reducing pain and disability associated with TTH: massage therapy and ultrasound.
