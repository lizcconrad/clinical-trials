      This will be a randomized, single-dose, open-label, two-period crossover study in 16 healthy
      subjects. The study will consist of two phases: Pre-randomization and Randomization. The
      Pre-randomization phase will have two periods: Screening and Baseline. In the Randomization
      Phase, subjects will be randomized to one of two possible treatment sequences (fed/fasted and
      fasted/fed). In each period, subjects will receive a single capsule containing 10 mg
      lenvatinib either with or without a standard breakfast. There will be a 2-week washout
      between treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy, male or female subjects age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than
             or equal to 55 years old;

          2. Body mass index (BMI) greater than 18 and less than or equal to 32 kg/m2 at Screening;

          3. All females must have a negative serum B-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) test
             result or negative urine pregnancy test results at Screening and Baseline. Females of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception (eg, abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method such as
             condom + spermicide or condom + diaphragm with spermicide, a contraceptive implant, an
             oral contraceptive or have a vasectomised partner) throughout the entire study period
             and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. The only subjects who will be exempt
             from this requirement are postmenopausal women (defined as greater than age 50 and
             with at least 12 months of amenorrhea) or subjects who have been sterilized surgically
             or who are otherwise proven sterile (eg, bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at
             least 6 months prior to dosing, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery
             at least 2 months prior to dosing). All women who are of reproductive potential and
             who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same
             hormonal contraceptive product for at least 12 weeks prior to dosing and must continue
             to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation;

          4. Male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use, or their
             partners must use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, condom + spermicide,
             condom + diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD) starting for at least
             one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study
             period and for 30 days (longer if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug).
             Those with partners using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional
             approved method of contraception (as described previously);

          5. Provide written informed consent;

             pharmacokinetics of study drug;

          2. A clinically significant illness within 8 weeks or a clinically significant infection

             Screening or Baseline;

          6. Clinically significant ECG abnormality including a marked baseline prolongation of
             QT/QTc interval (eg repeated demonstration of a QTc interval greater than 500 msec),
             or a family history of prolonged QTc syndrome or sudden death;

          7. History of drug or alcohol misuse within 6 months prior to Screening, or who have a
             positive urine drug test at Screening or Baseline;

             plasma within 1 week, of dosing;

         16. Hemoglobin level less than 12.0 g/dL;
