    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study was to demonstrate the performance of the Vasculaire
      Compression System to increase femoral venous peak velocity (PFV) in healthy subjects. This
      study was a single-arm, open label, prospective, single-center clinical study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism, e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, occurs in
      approximately one in 1,000 persons in the United States annually and results in more than
      250,000 hospital admissions annually in the United States. Intermittent pneumatic compression
      (IPC), which prevents stasis in the lower limbs, has been shown to be a safe and effective
      method of prophylaxis of DVT in studies comparing the incidence of DVT and pulmonary embolism
      with and without IPC. IPC devices decrease venous stasis by augmenting the venous blood flow
      in the lower extremities. Studies have suggested that an important indicator of the
      effectiveness of an IPC device in preventing DVT is the peak femoral venous velocity
      augmentation during the compression phase as compared with the decompression phase of the
      device.

      IPC devices produced in the early 1980s and 1990s were cumbersome, noisy and required
      external power sources, making them suitable only for non-ambulatory patients. Furthermore,
      these devices have been associated with poor compliance in trauma patients in a hospital
      setting, and the poor compliance was associated with a higher rate of DVT.

      The aim of this study is to test the hemodynamic performance of a new portable IPC device,
      the Venous Health Systems' Vasculaire Compression System. This new device is designed to
      provide patient comfort and convenience of use while providing similar improvement in venous
      blood flow when compared with existing IPC devices.

    <description>The femoral vein in the mid-thigh area was located and the femoral venous Peak Flow Velocity (PFV)was measured using duplex ultrasound during the compression phase of treatment. PFV is the maximum velocity of blood flow achieved when the foot and calf compression is applied. The PFV was then compared to the subject's own baseline PFV using a paired t-test.</description>
