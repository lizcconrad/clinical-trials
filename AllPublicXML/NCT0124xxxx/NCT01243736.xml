    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to see if taking a bowel preparation before having a
      capsule endoscopy is more helpful than the standard preparation of not eating after 7 PM the
      night before a capsule endoscopy in making it easier to see the small bowel in order to find
      the source of gastrointestinal bleeding.

      This is a single-blind, prospective randomized controlled study to determine if a combination
      of purgative agent, prokinetic agent, simethicone, and position will improve small bowel
      visualization, diagnostic yield, and completion rate of capsule endoscopy.

    <description>The other group will receive the combination bowel preparation, which consists of taking the standard bowel preparation plus:
drinking 2-liters (8 cups) of polyethylene glycol starting at 7 p.m. the night prior to the capsule endoscopy test;
drinking a teaspoon of simethicone 20 minutes prior to the capsule endoscopy test;
drinking a teaspoon of metoclopramide 20 minutes prior to the capsule endoscopy test;
lying on your right side for 30 minutes following the swallowing of the capsule endoscope.</description>
