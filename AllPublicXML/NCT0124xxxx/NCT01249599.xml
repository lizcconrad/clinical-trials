      The aim of this prospective single-center study is to evaluate endothelial function, arterial
      compliance, sympathetic nervous activity at rest and after mental and physical stress,
      carotid atherosclerosis, oxidative stress parameters, quality of life and platelet adhesion
      in patients with apical ballooning syndrome and age-matched controls.
