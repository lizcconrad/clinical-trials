    <measure>The Relative Ease of Use of NordiFlex® Compared to the Device Previously Used</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Analysed for the ITT (intent-to-treat) analysis set: The relative ease of use of the trial injection device compared to the device previously used was assessed using a quantitative scale, ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 = NordiFlex® is far less simple, 5 = equivalent simplicity and 10 = NordiFlex® is far more simple. The participants had to circle the number that represented their perception of the current state.</description>
