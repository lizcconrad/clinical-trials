  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic profile, and clinical activity of the
      oral PI3K inhibitor GSK2126458 and the oral MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts, a dose
      escalation phase and a tumor specific cohort expansion.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic profile, and clinical activity of the
      oral PI3K inhibitor GSK2126458 and the oral MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts, a Part 1 dose
      escalation phase and a Part 2 tumor specific cohort expansion.

      A continuous daily dosing schedule will be utilized initially for both investigational
      products. The frequency and schedule of dosing may be adjusted based on emerging safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics data.

      Once a recommended regimen has been characterized in Part 1, it may be further evaluated in
      Part 2 . More than one regimen (doses and schedules) may be evaluated in Part 2, based on
      findings in Part 1.

      Subjects eligible for enrollment in Part 2 will have solid tumors with genetic profiles that
      are likely to benefit from a MEK and PI3K pathway inhibition.

    <description>The first combination schedule that will be tested involves giving both GSK2126458 and GSK1120212 continuously once a day in the morning until the subjects withdraw from the study. Other dosing schedules with both drugs will also be tested and these schedules are described below GSK2126458 will be dosed twice per day (morning and evening) continuously and GSK1120212 will be dosed once a day in the morning on a continuous schedule. Subjects will be treated with both drugs and remain in the study as long as they are benefiting from therapy. Another schedule that will be tested involves giving GSK2126458 twice each day (morning and evening) on an intermittent schedule (4 days of treatment, 10 days rest, then 4 days treatment, 10 days rest). GSK1120212 will be dosed once each day in the morning on a continuous schedule. Subjects will be treated with both drugs as long as they are benefiting from therapy.</description>
