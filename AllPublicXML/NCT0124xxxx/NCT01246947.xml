  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mitral valve is the inflow valve into the main pumping chamber of the heart. It can
      become leaky or narrow, and cause blood to back up into the blood vessels of the lungs. When
      patients get symptoms from a leaky or narrow mitral valve, surgery is recommended to either
      fix or replace the valve. Many patients with mitral valve disease also develop a leaky
      tricuspid valve - the tricuspid valve is the inflow valve to the right side of the heart (the
      right heart pumps blood across the lungs). The amount of leakiness of the tricuspid valve is
      determined by an ultrasound test, and the amount of leakiness is graded as: none, mild,
      moderate, or severe. When a heart surgeon operates on a patient with a diseased mitral valve,
      he or she will fix the tricuspid valve if the tricuspid leakage is severe. This involves
      sewing a cloth-covered ring around the valve and narrowing it. If the tricuspid valve leakage
      is only mild (or absent), the surgeon will leave the tricuspid valve alone at the time of
      mitral valve surgery. If the tricuspid valve has moderate leakage surgeons are uncertain
      about what to do. In a recent review of thousands of patients across the nation having mitral
      valve surgery with moderately leaky tricuspid valves, 35 % of patients had tricuspid valve
      repair. Since the investigators don't know what the best approach is: to leave the moderately
      leaky tricuspid valve alone or to fix it with a cloth-covered ring, the investigators propose
      a study to determine which approach is best. Patients having mitral valve surgery with a
      moderately leaky tricuspid valve will be randomized to either 1. have a tricuspid valve
      repair or 2. to not have a tricuspid valve repair. The investigators will carefully follow
      these patients for two years and see if heart function is better among those who got their
      valve fixed.

      Study Design:

      This is a single-center prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Enroll/Randomize: mitral operation alone, or mitral operation with tricuspid valve repair.
      Randomization will occur before operation.

      Operation: The surgeon will perform mitral surgery and only those patients randomized to
      tricuspid valve repair will perform tricuspid valve repair using a rigid 3-dimensional
      annuloplasty ring using standard techniques.
