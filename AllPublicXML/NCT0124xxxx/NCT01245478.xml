  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a retrospective chart review of 200 charts of adult patients who have undergone
      a revision TKA at New England Baptist Hospital and who received implant component(s)
      manufactured by DePuy Orthopedics. The data will be collected retrospectively after patients
      are seen clinically for a minimum of five years after surgery to answer:

        1. What is the five-year survivorship of revision a knee prosthesis containing components
           manufactured by DePuy Orthopedics among adult revision TKA patients?

        2. What patient factors are associated with the need for re-operation after revision TKA
           among patients receiving DePuy implant components? How do clinical outcomes change from
           baseline over the five-year follow-up after revision TKA surgery?

      Data collection will include patient-reported and clinician-reported measures.
