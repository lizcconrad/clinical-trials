      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the efficacy of tirofiban (a 25mcg/kg i.v.
      bolus followed by a 0.15mcg/kg/min i.v. infusion during a percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) plus two hours after the procedure) is more effective than placebo in the setting of
      standard therapies (e.g. aspirin, a thienopyridine, and unfractionated heparin or
      bivalirudin) among patients undergoing PCI, as assessed by the incidence of adverse cardiac
      ischemic events defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), and urgent target vessel
      revascularization (uTVR) within 48 hours following study drug initiation.

      A secondary objective of this study is to assess whether tirofiban (a 25mcg/kg i.v. bolus
      followed by a 0.15mcg/kg/min i.v. infusion during a PCI plus two hours after the procedure)
      is safe compared to placebo in the setting of standard therapies (e.g. aspirin, a
      thienopyridine, and unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin) among patients undergoing PCI, as
      assessed by the incidence of non-CABG-related TIMI major bleeding within 48 hours following
      study drug initiation.

      Patient enrollment is pending.

    <description>Tirofiban (Aggrastat) will be dosed as a 25mcg/kg i.v. bolus followed by a 0.15mcg/kg/min i.v. infusion during a percutaneous coronary intervention plus two hours after the procedure.
Patients will receive tirofiban (Aggrastat) on a background of oral anti-platelet agent(s) and either unfractionated heparin (50U/kg and repeat dosing guided per guidelines) or bivalirudin as per local practice and physician discretion.</description>
