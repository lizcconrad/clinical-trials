    <textblock>
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) machines are non-contact instruments that can measure the
      depth of scars and other causes of cloudiness in the front of the cornea. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether OCT-guided settings for the lasers used for removal of corneal
      scars and other partial-thickness corneal defects result in improved vision in patients
      receiving these procedures.

    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to utilize newly available very high-speed OCT
      technology to guide surgical treatments of corneas with superficial opacities and
      irregularities. OCT is well known for its exquisite resolution, but until recently it has not
      had sufficient speed to capture the shape of the cornea because of eye motion during OCT
      scanning. The development of Fourier-domain OCT (FD-OCT) technology has made the requisite
      speed possible.

      Eyes with superficial opacities (corneal scars and stromal dystrophies) can be treated by
      phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). Currently, many surgeons rely on subjective slit-lamp
      impression of opacity depth to guide PTK and repeat slit-lamp examinations during surgery to
      determine if the opacity has been sufficiently reduced. Unpredictable hyperopic shifts can
      occur after PTK. The aim of this project is to develop methods for imaging the cornea with an
      FD-OCT system that will precisely measure corneal shape and use this information to guide
      surgery. Patients with irregularly shaped corneas could have their vision restored by
      reshaping the corneas with a procedure that combines the precision of OCT and lasers.

    <description>The primary goal of the trial is to determine the efficacy of the OCT-guided PTK treatment of corneal opacities. During the course of the trial, we will compare the predictive accuracy of the original OCT-guided PTK planning system to the OCT topography-guided system.</description>

    <time_frame>3-4, 6-8, and 12-14 months after the PTK procedure</time_frame>
    <description>A second goal is to develop a more sophisticated OCT guidance system incorporating OCT topography of anterior and posterior corneal surfaces and to develop a mathematical model that relates epithelial thickness variation to corneal mean curvature. During the course of the trial, we will compare the predictive accuracy of the original OCT-guided PTK planning system to the OCT topography-guided system.</description>

    <description>Preoperative measurements from the OCT are used to assist the calculation in deciding the laser depth settings for removal of anterior corneal opacities and defects in the phototherapeutic PTK procedure. The surgeon uses the OCT data to plan a range of treatment parameters to remove most of the opacity while preserving at least 250 microns of residual corneal stroma.</description>
