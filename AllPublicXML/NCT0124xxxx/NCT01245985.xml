  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TPF-C-HIT investigates the combination of induction chemotherapy with TPF followed by
      radioimmunotherapy with cetuximab and IMRT plus carbon ion boost with regard to efficacy and
      toxicity of the combination regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TPF-C-HIT is a prospective, monocentric phase II trial efficacy, as measured by control and
      survival rates, as well as toxicity (acute and late effects) of the combined treatment with
      TPF-induction followed by radioimmunotherapy with the EGFR-antibody cetuximab and carbon ion
      boost in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). As long-term
      local control remains a therapeutic challenge in advanced head and neck cancer, locoregional
      control was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints are survival rates
      (disease-free survival, PFS, OS), acute and late radiation effects as well as adverse events.
      For development of prognostic markers, proteomic and genomic analyses are also included in
      the secondary endpoints.
