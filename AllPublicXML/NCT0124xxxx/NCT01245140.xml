  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Palmo-plantar pustulosis (PPP) is an inflammatory skin disease affecting palms and soles. The
      disease is considered as a sub-form of psoriasis and presents with sterile pustules of the
      palms and the soles. This study investigates the efficacy of alitretinoin in patients who
      have not responded to topical drugs (e.g., steroid creams), who are suffering for at least 6
      month from the condition and whose disease severity is confirmed by a score.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Palmo-plantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) Score at the End of Treatment (EOT) (Week 24) or at the Last Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and EOT (Week 24) or the last assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator evaluated the PPPASI score on a 5-point scale. The parameters of erythema, total number of pustules, and desquamation were scored for the right/left palm and the right/left sole. After correcting the scores for area (based on a 7-point scale) and the site involved (palm or sole), the PPPASI score per palm/sole was produced. The final PPPASI score was calculated as the sum of the PPPASI score for the right sole + the PPPASI score for the left sole + the PPPASI score for the right palm + the PPPASI score for the left palm and ranges from 0 (no palmo-plantar pustulosis psoriasis [PPP]) to 72 (most severe PPP). Change from Baseline is defined as value at the EOT minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <description>Psoriatic plaques were graded based on three criteria: redness (R), thickness (T), and scaliness (S). Severity was rated for each criterion on a 5-point scale (0=no involvement, up to 4=severe involvement). Fraction of the total surface area affected on the head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities was graded on a 7-point scale (0=no involvement, up to 6=greater than 90% involvement). The four body regions were weighted to reflect their respective proportion of body surface area, and the composite mPASI score for all body regions was calculated based on the redness, thickness, and scaliness scores of plaques (0-4 each) for the head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities and the area of psoriatic involvement score (0-6). The lowest possible mPASI score was zero and highest up to 72; Higher score values represents greater severity of psoriasis. mPASI scores were continuous, with 0.1 increments within these values.</description>

    <description>The severity of nail lesions was assessed for all participants with psoriatic nail involvement by obtaining the NAPSI score. Scores were taken for fingernails only. No scores were taken for participants with traumatic or fungal changes in nails. The nail was divided into four quadrants, each of which was rated with a 0 or 1, based on the absence (0) or presence (1) of pathological signs resulting from involvement of both the nail matrix and the nail bed. Each nail was given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0-4) and nail matrix psoriasis (0-4) depending on the presence of nail psoriasis in that quadrant. Possible scores for matrix and nail bed psoriasis: 0=none, 1=present in 1/4 nail, 2=present in 2/4 nail, 3=present in 3/4 nail, 4=present in 4/4 nail. NAPSI score for nail matrix (0-4) and nail bed (0-4) were reported at Baseline, Week 12, and at the EOT visit (Week 24).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and an AE/SAE Related to Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until safety follow up (Week 29)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any adverse change from the participant's Baseline (pre-treatment) clinical condition, including intercurrent illness, which occurred during the course of a clinical study after written informed consent had been given, whether considered related to treatment or not. The relationship of AEs to the study treatment was assessed as unrelated, remotely related, possibly related, and probably related. For an AE to be considered serious, it fell into one or more of the following categories: results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, and is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.</description>

    <description>The CES-D scale is a short, self-report scale designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the general population. The CES-D consists of 20 questions. Participants were instructed to circle the number for each statement that best described how often they felt or behaved a particular way during the past week. The score was the sum of the weights of the 20 items. Responses range from 0 to 3 for each item (0=rarely or none of the time, 1=some or little of the time, 2=moderately or much of the time, 3=most or almost all the time). The CES-D score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater depression. Participants with a CES-D score of 20 or higher were re-evaluated within 2 weeks. If a CES-D score of 20 or higher was confirmed on the second occasion, and if the score represents an increase over Baseline of 4 points or more, study treatment was interrupted and the participants were referred for psychiatric evaluation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Palmo-plantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) Score at the End of Treatment (EOT) (Week 24) or at the Last Assessment</title>
        <description>The investigator evaluated the PPPASI score on a 5-point scale. The parameters of erythema, total number of pustules, and desquamation were scored for the right/left palm and the right/left sole. After correcting the scores for area (based on a 7-point scale) and the site involved (palm or sole), the PPPASI score per palm/sole was produced. The final PPPASI score was calculated as the sum of the PPPASI score for the right sole + the PPPASI score for the left sole + the PPPASI score for the right palm + the PPPASI score for the left palm and ranges from 0 (no palmo-plantar pustulosis psoriasis [PPP]) to 72 (most severe PPP). Change from Baseline is defined as value at the EOT minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Modified Psoriasis Area Severity Index (mPASI) Score at Baseline; Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20; and EOT (Week 24)</title>
        <description>Psoriatic plaques were graded based on three criteria: redness (R), thickness (T), and scaliness (S). Severity was rated for each criterion on a 5-point scale (0=no involvement, up to 4=severe involvement). Fraction of the total surface area affected on the head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities was graded on a 7-point scale (0=no involvement, up to 6=greater than 90% involvement). The four body regions were weighted to reflect their respective proportion of body surface area, and the composite mPASI score for all body regions was calculated based on the redness, thickness, and scaliness scores of plaques (0-4 each) for the head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities and the area of psoriatic involvement score (0-6). The lowest possible mPASI score was zero and highest up to 72; Higher score values represents greater severity of psoriasis. mPASI scores were continuous, with 0.1 increments within these values.</description>

        <description>Psoriatic plaques were graded based on three criteria: redness (R), thickness (T), and scaliness (S). Severity was rated for each criterion on a 5-point scale (0=no involvement, up to 4=severe involvement). The fraction of the total surface area affected on the head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities was graded on a 7-point scale (0=no involvement, up to 6=greater than 90% involvement). The four body regions were weighted to reflect their respective proportion of body surface area, and the composite mPASI score for all body regions was calculated. mPASI 50 response and mPASI 75 response is defined as a 50% and 75% decrease, respectively, in the mPASI score from Baseline.</description>

        <description>The severity of nail lesions was assessed for all participants with psoriatic nail involvement by obtaining the NAPSI score. Scores were taken for fingernails only. No scores were taken for participants with traumatic or fungal changes in nails. The nail was divided into four quadrants, each of which was rated with a 0 or 1, based on the absence (0) or presence (1) of pathological signs resulting from involvement of both the nail matrix and the nail bed. Each nail was given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0-4) and nail matrix psoriasis (0-4) depending on the presence of nail psoriasis in that quadrant. Possible scores for matrix and nail bed psoriasis: 0=none, 1=present in 1/4 nail, 2=present in 2/4 nail, 3=present in 3/4 nail, 4=present in 4/4 nail. NAPSI score for nail matrix (0-4) and nail bed (0-4) were reported at Baseline, Week 12, and at the EOT visit (Week 24).</description>

        <description>An AE was any adverse change from the participant’s Baseline (pre-treatment) clinical condition, including intercurrent illness, which occurred during the course of a clinical study after written informed consent had been given, whether considered related to treatment or not. The relationship of AEs to the study treatment was assessed as unrelated, remotely related, possibly related, and probably related. For an AE to be considered serious, it fell into one or more of the following categories: results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, and is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and an AE/SAE Related to Study Treatment</title>
          <description>An AE was any adverse change from the participant’s Baseline (pre-treatment) clinical condition, including intercurrent illness, which occurred during the course of a clinical study after written informed consent had been given, whether considered related to treatment or not. The relationship of AEs to the study treatment was assessed as unrelated, remotely related, possibly related, and probably related. For an AE to be considered serious, it fell into one or more of the following categories: results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, and is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.</description>

        <description>The CES-D scale is a short, self-report scale designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the general population. The CES-D consists of 20 questions. Participants were instructed to circle the number for each statement that best described how often they felt or behaved a particular way during the past week. The score was the sum of the weights of the 20 items. Responses range from 0 to 3 for each item (0=rarely or none of the time, 1=some or little of the time, 2=moderately or much of the time, 3=most or almost all the time). The CES-D score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater depression. Participants with a CES-D score of 20 or higher were re-evaluated within 2 weeks. If a CES-D score of 20 or higher was confirmed on the second occasion, and if the score represents an increase over Baseline of 4 points or more, study treatment was interrupted and the participants were referred for psychiatric evaluation.</description>

        <description>The assessment of suicidality was conducted using the CSSRS, a brief questionnaire designed to assess severity and change in suicidality using a semi-structured interview to probe participant responses. The suicidal ideation intensity total score was the sum of suicidal ideation severity rating scores for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation. For each item, each participant got an intensity score from 0(none) to 5(worst). Therefore, the suicidal ideation intensity total score range from 0 to 25, with a score of 0 given for no suicidal ideation. CSSRS scores were reported at Screening; Baseline; Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20; EOT (Week 24);and safety follow-up (Week 29).</description>
