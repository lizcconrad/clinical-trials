  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate that the efficacy of 3% DE-089 ophthalmic solution (one drop at a time, 6
      times daily, 4 weeks topical administration), in comparison to 0.1% sodium hyaluronate
      ophthalmic solution (0.1% HA) (one drop at a time, 6 times daily, 4 weeks topical
      administration), is at least non-inferior in the change in fluorescein staining score, and is
      superior in the change in Rose bengal score, in a multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group
      comparison study. Safety profile will likewise be compared.

    <measure>Mean Change in Fluorescein Staining Score From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4-week (discontinued (LOCF))</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein staining was scored according to the protocol by Shimmura et al. The cornea was divided into 3 equal zones: upper, middle, and lower. Each zone had a staining score ranging between 0 and 3 points, with minimum and maximum total staining scores ranging between 0 and 9 points. 0 is better.
The degree of staining with Fluorescein dyes was scored as follows: 0 = no staining, 1= staining of less than half of the area, 2= staining of more than half of the area, 3= staining in the whole area.</description>
