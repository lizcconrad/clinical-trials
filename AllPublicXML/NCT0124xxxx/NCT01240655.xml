    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with breast cancer must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis
        of disease that has metastasized or is resistant to therapy.

        Patients with ovarian cancer must have histological evidence of recurrent epithelial
        ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer.

        Patients must have recovered or stabilized from all toxicities related to their previous
        treatment except for alopecia Male or female patients 18 years or older ECOG performance
        status 0-1 Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks Measurable disease as determined by RECIST
        v1.0 Patients must give written informed consent and comply with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For patients with breast cancer:

        Concurrent Her2-directed or anti-estrogen therapy

        For patients with ovarian cancer:

        Primary refractory disease, defined as progression during initial treatment with a
        platinum- and taxane-containing regimen.

        Prior treatment with weekly paclitaxel. More than two chemotherapy regimens given in the
        relapse setting. Evidence of a documented bowel obstruction within six months of study
        entry Patients with unresolved peripheral neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea ≥ CTCAE
        Grade 2 Any concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions that could increase
        the patient's risk for toxicity while in the study or that could confound discrimination
        between disease- and study treatment-related toxicities.

        Patients with impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the
        absorption of LCL161 Patients who have undergone major surgery ≤ 3 weeks prior to starting
        study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of procedure.

        Pregnant or breast feeding (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
        female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive
        β-HCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL).

        Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic active hepatitis
        B or C (HIV and hepatitis testing are not mandatory).
