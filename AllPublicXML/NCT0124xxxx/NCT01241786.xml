      To determine the response to the combination of azacitidine + lenalidomide in patients with
      relapsed/refractory CLL and SLL

      Hypothesize - lenalidomide's activity in combination with azacitidine may further enhance its
      activity and the durability of treatment response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A promising and untested combination in CLL is the combination of lenalidomide with the DNA
      methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine. The combination of lenalidomide and azacitidine is
      novel to CLL, but has been tested in a phase I clinical trial involving patients with MDS and
      has been found to be safe with promising activity in that disease. Studying the activity of
      this combination in CLL may allow us to shift the CLL treatment paradigm from cytotoxic
      chemo-immunotherapies therapies towards an epigenetic-immunomodulatory approach and offers
      the unique opportunity to further understand the complex biology of this disease, mechanisms
      of resistance and its interaction with its microenvironment.

          6. SLL/CLL must be defined as relapsed or refractory disease as defined by the
             NCI-sponsored IWG criteria.

               -  Relapsed CLL/SLL: Relapse is defined as a patient who has previously achieved CR
                  or PR, but after a period of 6 or more months, demonstrates evidence of disease
                  progression.

               -  Refractory CLL/SLL: Refractory disease is defined as treatment failure or disease
                  progression within 6 months to the last antileukemic therapy.

          7. Patients must have received and failed at least one purine-based treatment regimen
             (ie. FCR, FR, PCR, Fludarabine) or alemtuzumab-based regimen or bendamustine-based
             regimen prior to study enrollment.

          8. Serum bilirubin levels &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range for the
             laboratory (ULN). Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to active

             be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®.

         15. Able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients
             intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin).

         16. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to

        prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form.

        2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
        subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds the
