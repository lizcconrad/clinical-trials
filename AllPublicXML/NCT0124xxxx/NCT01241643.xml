  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II multicenter, open-labeled, controlled, randomized study assessing weekly
      doses of Interleukin-7 (CYT107)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess repeated cycles of 3 weekly injections of CYT107 in
      patients immune non-responders infected with HIV.

      Eighty patients will be recruited to study the biological activity and safety of repeated
      cycles of CYT107 at 20 µg/kg/week over 2 weeks, for a maximum of 4 cycles within 21 months
      and a maximum of 3 cycles within 12 months. The entire study will cover a period of 24
      months.

      During the study visits the following may be done:

        -  medical history, physical examination, blood test every visit

        -  EKG

        -  chest X-Ray

        -  liver/spleen ultrasound

             regimen for at least 6 months prior to study entry. HAART is defined as a combination
             of two (2) classes dose regimen of approved ARV (antiretroviral)

          4. CD4+ cell counts ≥ 101 and &lt; 350 cells/µL measured on at least two (2) measurements
             (including the screening value) within the previous 12 months prior to study entry
             Note: a single isolated value of CD4+ ≥ 350 during this period (12 months prior to
             study entry) will be allowed to participate if the previous and subsequent CD4+ count
             is in the range of ≥ 101 and &lt; 350 cells/µL

          5. Plasma HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL since at least 18 months with at least two (2)

             months prior to study entry) will be allowed to participate if the prior and
             subsequent plasma HIV RNA levels are &lt; 50 copies/mL
