      IRB4729 Study Hypothesis: Is there a significant difference in the hard and soft tissue
      response comparing immediate with delayed implant after tooth removal, with immediate
      provisionalization, in maxillary anterior sites.

      The purpose of this study is to determine and compare the crestal bone levels as the primary
      endpoint variable for implants placed and temporized in extraction sites, to implants placed
      into extraction sites after the extraction site has been grafted and healed for 4 months, all
      immediately restored with an anatomic provisional restoration.

    <description>An evaluation of crestal bone level changes when implants are placed into extraction sites. Levels will be measured on standardized digital radiographs of the implants using their threads as a monitor of magnification and a preextraction reference in the measurement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients will be willing to be present for examination two times a year for at
             least three years, as well as maintenance cleaning twice a year 3 months prior to the
             data collection visit

          -  All patients will be free of uncontrolled diabetes (any type, existing malignancy, and
             will not be receiving any therapy that suppresses their immune system, such as
             radiation, chemotherapy, or chronic steroid usage

          -  Need for extraction of a single rooted maxillary central or lateral incisor, canine,
             or premolar, with no signs of acute infection (purulent exudate, erythema, pain and
             swelling).

          -  Patients will have bone present on all surfaces of the tooth within 3mm of the
             gingival margin of the planned restoration, in order to provide sufficient bone to
             circumferentially cover the implant.

          -  all patients will have adequate space for satisfactory restoration of the edentulous
             space.

          -  each patients dentition will be free of active periodontal disease or exhibit
             controllable periodontal disease such that their teeth will clinically be non-mobile
             and have probing depths less than 3mm.

          -  All prospective sites will have at least 2mm of attached or keratinized gingiva.

          -  The crestal bone width should be enough to accommodate either a 3.75mm diameter
             implant for the central incisor, canine, and premolar sites or a 3.25 mm diameter
             implant for the lateral incisor tooth sites. Bone heights should be at least 14mm for
             accommodation of the implant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with labial dehiscence defects greater than 3mm from the proposed gingival
             margin of the planned restoration will be excluded from this study.

          -  Patients who cannot come for follow up due to conflicts of schedules will not be
             accepted into the study.

          -  Patients with advanced cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, liver disease that place them
             in an ASA III or IV rating will be excluded. Post-menopausal women with known
             osteoporosis as determined by their medical internist, will be excluded. Patients with
             known alcohol abuse will be excluded.
