  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Vitiligo vulgaris is a common acquired pigment disorder, which is characterised by
      the development of depigmented macules. It develops probably due to immunedestruction of
      melanocytes. Most effective therapies are immunsuppresive:

        1. local immunesuppressives like corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors

        2. phototherapy like PUVA and NB-UVB phototherapy. NB-UVB is the first choice A synergistic
           effect of UVA and topical corticosteroids (fluticasone proprionate 0.05% cream) has been
           described by Westerhof et al. in 1999. To our knowledge to date there are no
           publications comparing NB-UVB combined with a topical corticosteroid and NB-UVB alone.

      Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effects (onset and degree
      of repigmentation) of fluticasone proprionate 0.05% cream (thrice weekly) on NB-UVB
      phototherapy twice weekly for a period of 12 months.

      Study design: Prospective single blinded randomised controlled study. Study population:
      Consecutive patients â‰¥ 18 years, diagnosed with active vitiligo vulgaris who will receive
      NB-UVB phototherapeutic treatment at the Netherlands Institute for Pigment Disorders at the
      Academic Medical Centre (AMC), University of Amsterdam.

      Methods: The patient will be randomised for either NB-UVB phototherapy and fluticasone
      proprionate 0.05% cream or NB-UVB phototherapy alone for 12 consecutive months.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The onset and degree of repigmentation is assessed by
      digital image analysis of a target lesion and blinded global physician assessment.
      Furthermore, the patients and doctors satisfaction will be assessed and changes of
      immunohistochemical parameters will be analysed in skin biopsies.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Subjects participating in the study will be asked to visit the institute 4
      times. The time investment will be 20 minutes per visit. Additionally, patients will be asked
      for consent to take punch biopsies (3 mm) at the beginning and at the end of the treatment
      period. Hence, skin biopsies are not compulsory for participation in this study. Patients may
      chose to participate in the clinical non invasive part of the study. Known side effects of
      the NB-UVB phototherapy are redness, pruritus, xerosis cutis, burning sensation and
      conjunctivitis. These side-effects however, are largely dose-dependent and avoidable.
      Corticosteroid associated systemic side-effects (suppression of the adrenocortex) will be
      minimized by treating only a limited body surface [a maximum of 30% body surface] and by
      using an intermittent application scheme of three days a week in the long term treatment. The
      regions which are known to have a higher absorption are excluded (periorbital, axillary,
      inguinal and genital area). Both topical corticosteroids and NB-UVB are part of the Dutch and
      British guidelines for the treatment of vitiligo. There is no presumptive evidence or
      indication that the combination of these therapies may result in a higher risk of side
      effects.

      All together the burden due to the study is low and the risk for systemic or local side
      effects is low.
