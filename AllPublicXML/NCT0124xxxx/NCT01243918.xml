    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the oxygen therapy delivery
      system Optiflow® compared to 2 others standard oxygen therapy delivery systems (Ospal®, non
      invasive ventilation).12 immunocompetent patients will compare the successive use of oxygen
      therapy delivery systems Optiflow®/Ospal® and 12 immunodeficient patients will compare the
      successive use of systems Optiflow®/Non invasive ventilation.

    <description>The secondary outcomes are to understand the mechanisms of action of Optiflow system and to evaluate the tolerance of this system:
number of adverse events: respiratory events, trophic troubles, subjective events (comfort, dryness of mucous membranes, gastric distension, preferred system), serious hemodynamic and cardiovascular events
impact on work of breathing: measure of respiratory frequency and blood gas
