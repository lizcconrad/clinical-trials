      The hypothesis of this study is that strut coverage occurs earlier when a DES is implanted to
      treat a BMS restenosis compared with atherosclerotic de-novo lesion. This hypothesis is
      supported by two different observations: first, when a DES is implanted to treat a BMS
      restenosis, stent struts are deployed and drugs are eluted on a soft tissue mostly
      characterized by extracellular matrix with a regular surface. In this case stent malposition
      is less likely to occur compared to atherosclerotic lesion whose surface is often more
      irregular and rich in calcium. Second, patients who develop in-stent restenosis after BMS
      implantation are likely to show a more pronounced neointima hyperplasia and, when a DES is
      implanted to treat restenosis, reendothelialization is likely to occur earlier. If this
      hypothesis was verified, duration of dual antiplatelet therapy could be shortened after DES
      implantation on BMS restenosis with a clinical advantage in terms of bleeding risk.
      Furthermore, a higher bleeding risk is often a reason for choosing a BMS instead of a DES;
      thus, patients presenting with BMS restenosis are likely to have a higher bleeding risk and
      to benefit from a shorter period of dual antiplatelet therapy.
