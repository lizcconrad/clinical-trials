  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard behavioral treatment (SBT) for obesity is often effective, but weight losses are
      highly variable, and patients sometimes fail to achieve a &quot;successful&quot; weight loss of 5-10%
      of their starting weight. It has been suggested that the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach of SBT
      may be responsible for many treatment failures because the intervention is not sufficiently
      tailored to address the unique needs of each patient. Moreover, treatment is delivered in the
      clinic, not in the settings and the times when it is needed most. The primary aim of the
      proposed research is to develop and pilot test a behavioral weight loss intervention that
      combines in-person sessions with treatment delivered via an electronic handheld device to
      provide highly individualized weight loss treatment in patients' natural environment. In a
      critical departure from previous research using cell phone technology, the portion of
      intervention that is delivered via handheld device will be of equal sophistication and
      importance to the portion of the intervention that is delivered in face-to-face treatment
      sessions. The proposed study seeks to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of
      an individually tailored behavioral weight loss program that integrates clinic-based care and
      smartphone technology.
