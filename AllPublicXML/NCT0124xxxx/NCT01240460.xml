  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure what effect the study drug XL765 (SAR245409) or the
      study drug XL147 (SAR245408) has on tumor tissue in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma (GB)
      who are candidates for surgical resection. XL765 (SAR245409) and XL147 (SAR245408), the two
      investigational agents examined in this study, XL147 (SAR245408) is a potent inhibitor of PI3
      Kinase (PI3K) and XL765 (SAR245409) is a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor. In preclinical
      studies, inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis
      (programmed cell death) in tumor cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary GB for which the subject
             has received prior treatment, including radiation and/or chemotherapy, and will be
             undergoing a second surgical resection.

          2. The subject has available archival tumor tissue from the time of initial diagnosis of
             GB that is designated for central laboratory analysis.

          3. The subject is ≥ 18 years old.

          4. The subject has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60%.

          5. The subject has adequate organ and marrow function.

          6. The subject has adequate fasting plasma glucose levels and glycosylated hemoglobin
             levels.

          7. The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements
