  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study comparing the appearance and volume of the post surgical region in the
      intact breast, as determined by 3 modalities: computed Xray tomography (CT), 3 Dimensional
      ultrasound (USS), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after breast conserving surgery and during
      whole breast irradiation.

    <textblock>
      Consenting patients who have undergone breast conserving surgery and who are planned to
      receive radiotherapy will have their first MRI and CT scan within 2 weeks of treatment
      planning. This will be followed by 3 weeks radiotherapy treatment. 3D ultrasound scans will
      be performed in the first 2 weeks before radiotherapy, during the 2nd and 3rd weeks of
      radiotherapy and in the 2 weeks following radiotherapy.Following the radiotherapy patients
      will undergo both CT and MRI scans within 2 weeks of treatment completion.The whole process
      should take approximately 10 weeks.In this study the CT scans, MRI scan + USS are above
      standard care and are the additional interventions in this study group.
