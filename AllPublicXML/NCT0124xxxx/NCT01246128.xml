      Background:

      - Previous studies have suggested that smoking cigarettes affects the number of receptors in
      the brain for nicotine, a chemical present in cigarette smoke. The receptors play a role in
      an individual's ability to think and concentrate. Many people with schizophrenia and similar
      disorders smoke, and research suggests that smoking may temporarily improve concentration and
      focus in individuals with schizophrenia. Researchers are interested in studying both current
      smokers and nonsmokers with schizophrenia to determine whether smoking affects the number of
      nicotine receptors in the brains of people with schizophrenia.

      Objectives:

      - To study the distribution and volume of nicotine receptors in the brains of individuals
      with schizophrenia who are either nonsmokers or current smokers.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia
           and are either nonsmokers or current smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day for the
           past year).

        -  Current smokers must be able to give up smoking for 48 hours.

      Design:

        -  This study involves an initial screening visit and up to five study visits.

        -  After the screening visit, participants will have two sessions in which they will
           complete questionnaires about thoughts, memory, and smoking habits. Smokers will also
           have nicotine blood and carbon monoxide breath levels taken during these sessions,
           before and after smoking a cigarette.

        -  Participants will have sessions with imaging studies (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging)
           to provide baseline measurements for later tests, and will also have tests to measure
           brain electrical activity.

        -  Participants will have a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning session to examine
           the nicotine receptors in the brain. Participants will need to stay overnight
           (nonsmokers) or for 2 nights (smokers) as an inpatient before the session. The PET scan
           session will take up to 6 hours, although participants will only be in the scanner for
           up to 3 hours.

        -  Participants will have a follow-up phone call with study researchers 1 week after the
           PET scanning session.

      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to determine the distribution and volume of distribution (Vt)
      in vivo of Beta2* acetylcholine receptors (Beta2* nAChR) in schizophrenic smokers and
      nonsmokers and compare this to published data from normal healthy subjects who are smokers
      and nonsmokers.

      Study population:

      Participants will be volunteers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia aged 18 to 50 years. The
      proposed sample size is 10 per group: nonsmokers or ex-smokers and smokers for a total of 20
      participants.

      Design:

      One PET study lasting up to 8 hours after combination of bolus and continuous infusion
      administration of 2[(18)F] FA-85380. Smokers will be abstinent for at least 48 hrs. Subjects
      will also undergo a structural MRI scan for purposes of registration of PET scan data.

      Outcome Measures:

      Data from 20 schizophrenic patients (10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers) will be compared to
      published data from healthy controls. Total volume of distribution (VT) which is a measure of
      receptor density and distribution of Beta2 nAChR* will be determined in Schizophrenic smokers
      and nonsmokers and differences in these values will be compared to published values for the
      differences in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in healthy smokers and nonsmokers
      (Mukhin et al., 2008) Also, receptor distribution and VT will be correlated with levels of
      smoking and symptom profiles in the schizophrenic patients studied.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: Subjects will be male and female volunteers aged 18 to 50 years.

        Contact: All subjects must have a stable point of contact and must agree to participate in
        one PET study and one MRI scan.

        Smoking group: must smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day for at least the last year. They
        should have experience with abstaining from smoking for at least 48 h.

        Nonsmoking group: Subjects in the non-smoking group must be nonsmokers or have smoked less
        than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and have ceased smoking at least two years before the
        start of the study.

        Diagnosis: Each volunteer will have a diagnosis of schizophrenia using DSMIV criteria. Each
        subject will have the following information available for diagnostic consideration:
        Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), a general psychiatric
        interview for past illness characteristics and family history, information from 2-3 months
        of independent clinician observation including current detailed mental status evaluations
        using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Schedule for the Assessment of Positive
        and Negative Symptoms (SAPS/SANS), and Schedule for Deficit Syndrome (SDS). An assessment
        of impulsivity will also be done (Patton, 1995).

        Comorbidity: No subject with a current axis I diagnosis other than schizophrenia will be
        allowed. No subject with known claustrophobia will be allowed.

        Medications: Study participants will continue to take their antipsychotic medications that
        they have been taking for at least 3 months prior to the study. Haldol, risperidone and
        olanzapine will be allowed because of their lack of significant effect on the density of
        beta2* nACh receptors after prolonged administration to rats (Haldol; Breese et al., 2000;
        risperidone and olanzapine; personal communication, Mukhin, also SFN abstract).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Weight: Anyone weighing more than 300 lbs is excluded from the study. The purpose of this
        exclusion is the weight limit of the PET scanner.

        History of Drug Abuse: Participants reporting current or having a significant history of
        illicit drug abuse will be excluded from the study. Subjects may use moderate amounts of
        alcohol and caffeine and smoke an occasional marijuana cigarette, but must not be dependent
        on alcohol, caffeine or marijuana. No alcohol or marijuana for at least 72 hours prior to
        scanning. No smoking for 48 hrs before the PET scan.

        Current Medication Use: Participants will continue to use their prescription medications.
        The following hypertension medications will be exclusionary: Indapamide, spironolactone,
        clonidine, guanfacine, methyldopa, propranolol. Over the counter medications are not
        exclusionary, however, subjects will not be allowed to use over the counter medications in
        the week prior to their PET scan.

        CNS disease: History of known structural brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasm, subarachnoid
        cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), history of head trauma
        (defined as documented loss of consciousness for 5 min or greater), history of seizures as
        an adult, sleep apnea.

        Cardiovascular, pulmonary, or systemic disease: Untreated hypertension known arrhythmia,
        symptomatic or known coronary artery disease; history of endocarditis, cerebral embolism,
        obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, active tuberculosis, known endocrine disease
        (derangements in adrenal, thyroid, bone or reproductive function) known chronic renal or
        hepatic dysfunction, known HIV seropositive, known current autoimmune disease involving the
        CNS, type I diabetes mellitus. Subjects with type II diabetes mellitus will be allowed if
        their Hb A1C is less than 7.

        Special considerations for female subjects. Female participants who are planning to become
        pregnant, currently pregnant or nursing will not be allowed to participate in this study
        because of potential damage to the fetus or baby from the radiation. In addition, women of
        child bearing age who are sexually active are required to use an effective form of birth
        control for the duration of the study. Effective forms of birth control include:

          1. hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills, injectable hormones, vaginal ring
             hormones),

          2. surgical sterility (tubal ligation or hysterectomy)

          3. IUD

          4. Diaphragm with spermicide

          5. Condom with spermicide

        Female subjects will be given a serum pregnancy test (quantitative beta HCG) within 24
        hours of the PET study. Menstrual cycle phase or sex has not been shown to affect receptor
        availability (Cosgrove et al., 2007).

        Radiation exposure: Any subject who has participated in any research studies in which
        he/she received a radiation exposure that would result in combination with the present
        study, in a total effective radiation exposure (from research studies) exceeding 5.0 rem in
        a year.

        Children under the age of 18 will be excluded to avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation to
        these populations.

        Presence in body of metallic implants or materials that could be moved by the magnet of the
        MRI scanner: pacemakers, surgical implants, aneurysm clips, dental braces, bullet(s) or
        other metallic materials.
