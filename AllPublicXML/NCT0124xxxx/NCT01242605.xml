  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish the recommended dose of selumetinib, a novel MEK
      inhibitor for use in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of selumetinib in combination with
      CisGem and to establish the recommended dose to take into phase II studies. Pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic endpoints will be assessed and preliminary efficacy data will also be
      collected.

      Patients with Advanced Biliary tract Cancer will receive CisGem regimen and selumetinib. A
      dose de-escalation scheme will be employed to determine the recommended phase II dose of
      selumetinib.

      Patients will be recruited in cohorts of three and assessed for dose limiting toxicity (DLT)
      during the first cycle of treatment. Depending on the number of DLTs observed, the cohort may
      be expanded, the next cohort may be enrolled at a lower dose or the dose may be declared the
      recommended dose. Patients will receive up to eight cycles of CisGem and may continue to
      receive selumetinib until progression of disease.

    <description>To investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of cisplatin, gemcitabine (CisGem) and selumetinib and to establish the recommended phase II dose of selumetinib when given in this combination.
The recommended dose of selumetinib to use in combination with CisGem in future studies will be the dose at which less than 33% of patients experience a DLT. The recommended dose will not be higher than 75mg/m*2</description>

Selumetinib will be taken every day (continuously) either once or twice a day, depending on the dose. Treatment with selumetinib may continue until disease progression.</description>
