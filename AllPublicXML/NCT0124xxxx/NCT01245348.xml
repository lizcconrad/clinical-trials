      The purpose of this study is to validate that SULT4A1-1 status stratification improves
      responses to atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenia and to extend these findings into
      bipolar disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total economic burden for schizophrenia (SZ) in the U.S. is estimated to be more than $60
      billion annually. A large contributor to the economic burden of this and other chronic mental
      disorders, including bipolar disorder (BPD), is the exacerbation of symptoms and disability
      due to lack of drug efficacy. For these disorders, clinicians typically choose a first line
      antipsychotic therapy without the support of a diagnostic tool; often, patients are switched
      to another drug after less than six months of treatment due to what is perceived by patients
      and clinicians as both insufficient efficacy and unacceptable side effects.

      Originally, the sulfotransferase family 4A, member 1 (SULT4A1) gene was selected as a
      biomarker of interest in SZ based on results showing associations between the gene and
      disease severity. Later on, SULT4A1 gene status was also associated with better efficacy of
      atypical antipsychotic (e.g. Zyprexa® (olanzapine) and Risperdal® (risperidone)), with
      respect to both time to discontinuation and quantitative measures of clinical improvement.

      In this prospectively designed, non-randomized retrospective study, we will recruit and
      genotype subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder that were/are new to therapy for any
      of the four drugs under evaluation. By looking at retrospective and prospective longitudinal
      medical and pharmacy data stored within the integrated claims database, we will validate the
      association of the SULT4A1 gene to the efficacy of selected atypical antipsychotic therapies.
