  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase II study to determine the rate of improvement in response of
      patients with previously treated multiple myeloma to imetelstat alone or in combination with
      lenalidomide maintenance therapy. This study will include multiple myeloma patients who
      either have achieved disease stabilization or who have achieved at least a partial response
      (PR) but failed to achieve a complete response (CR) after cytoreductive therapy for multiple
      myeloma; ie, have detectable but non-progressing disease and will most likely relapse.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Willing and able to sign an informed consent Male or female, 18 years or older Confirmed
        diagnosis of multiple myeloma (secretory disease) by International Myeloma Working Group
        Diagnostic Criteria

        Patients must meet one of the following criteria:

        o Previously treated patients with multiple myeloma who achieved at least stable disease
        but who have failed to achieve a complete response (CR) after a minimum of one
        cytoreductive therapy for multiple myeloma and have detectable but non-progressing disease.
        Patients must have received at least one proteasome inhibitor (eg, bortezomib) or one
        immunomodulatory agent (eg, thalidomide or lenalidomide) or both.

        Patients receiving lenalidomide as maintenance therapy may continue to receive this therapy
        provided that the patient has been on this maintenance therapy for a minimum of 3 months
        and has evidence of disease stabilization.

        Disease stabilization will be defined as an M protein that varies ≤ 25% over the three
        measurements or remains under 0.5 g/dL whichever is smaller.

        ECOG performance status 0-2 Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

        Laboratory criteria (within 14 days of first study drug administration):

          -  ANC ≥ 1000/μL

             first study drug administration)

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), unless due to
             disease.

        Must have fully recovered from any previous cancer treatments and/or major surgery.

        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and agree to use
        effective birth control (two reliable forms of contraception) during and for at least 12
        weeks after the last treatment.

        Males must agree to use effective birth control for themselves or their partner during and
        for 12 weeks after the last treatment with imetelstat. For those patients receiving
        lenolidomide, males must use latex condom during sexual contact with women of childbearing
        potential even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women who are pregnant or breast feeding Prior radioimmunotherapy. Known intracranial
        disease or epidural disease. Patients with lytic lesions of the cranium or spine secondary
        to myeloma are eligible to enroll.

             active infection. Serious co-morbid medical conditions, including cirrhosis and
             chronic obstructive or chronic restrictive pulmonary disease.

        Symptomatic hyperviscosity syndrome. Any other cancer therapy including chemotherapy,
        monoclonal antibody, signal transduction inhibitor, immunotherapy, glucocorticoid (except
        topical or as premedication), thalidomide within 3 weeks prior to first study drug
        administration.

        Investigational therapy within 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration.

        Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration (central line
        placement is allowed) Anti-platelet therapy within 2 weeks prior to first study drug
        administration, other than low dose aspirin prophylaxis therapy.

        Full dose anticoagulation. Prophylactic low dose administration for management of IV access
        devices is allowed.

        Known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV. Any other severe, acute, or
        chronic medical or psychiatric condition, laboratory abnormality, or difficulty complying
        with protocol requirements that may increase the risk associated with study participation
        or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and,
        in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for this study
