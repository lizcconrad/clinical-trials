      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given
      together with cytarabine in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system
      in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving lenalidomide together with cytarabine may
      kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide following intermediate dose
      ARA-C (cytarabine) in relapsed/refractory AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate immune reconstitution in patients in complete remission (CR) treated at the MTD.

      II. Evaluate the efficacy of the regimen in the expanded group treated at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 6-26 and cytarabine intravenously (IV) over
      3 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
