  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have surgery to cure lung cancer often have multiple problems at hospital
      discharge and later on. This includes poor exercise performance and quality of life,
      breathlessness, pain and tiredness. Currently there is little formal physical or
      psychological support for such patients. This pilot study aims to investigate whether
      outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (an exercise training and education programme), started
      within 2 weeks of hospital discharge, can lead to improvements in exercise performance and
      quality of life in patients who have undergone lung cancer surgery. The study will also
      assess whether pulmonary rehabilitation is acceptable for patients and will analyze the
      safety profile. The hypothesis is that patients; discharged from hospital after undergoing
      lung cancer surgery, have improved exercise performance and quality of life following early
      outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation compared with usual care.

      The research question is to investigate

        -  whether patients who have undergone curative surgical resection for lung cancer benefit
           from 8 weeks of early outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (started within 2 weeks of
           hospital discharge).

        -  to identify potential barriers to this approach

      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is the most effective non-pharmacological treatment for
      patients with chronic respiratory diseases, especially COPD. Many patients with lung cancer
      have co-existing smoking-related lung disorders such as COPD. To date there have been no
      randomised controlled trials of PR in post-resection lung cancer survivors. However there is
      indirect evidence that PR may be of benefit in this patient cohort. Cesario et al
      (2007)reported a 32% improvement in exercise capacity with in-patient PR, and Spruit et al
      (2009) demonstrated a 43% improvement in six minute walk distance following an 8-week
      in-patient PR programme. However, both studies had small numbers, and no randomised control
      group. Furthermore, inpatient PR is not an economically justifiable intervention in the NHS
      where emphasis is on self-management and ambulatory care.
