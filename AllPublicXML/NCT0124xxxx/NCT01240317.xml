    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are testing the expert system called eVENT. eVENT provides
      expert advice about the patient's breathing. The investigators have developed and tested a
      prototype of eVENT and now want to test how it works in practice. To do this the
      investigators plan to use computer based simulations and test it when used by
      anesthesiologists in a full size human simulator. If these tests are successful the
      investigators will then be ready to evaluate eVENT on real patients.

      The development of new sensors or the intelligent synthesis of existing signals (smart
      sensors) cannot reliably prevent adverse events unless the investigators assimilate the data
      produced from these devices and provide it to the clinician in a format that is easy to
      comprehend. The expert system that the investigators are developing will provide intelligent
      synthesis of data. The clinician focus can then be directed toward the patient rather than
      continual observation of the monitors.

      Clinicians need an expert system to augment vigilance and situation awareness, and to aid in
      decision making to prevent patient harm.

      The development of an expert system to assist the everyday anesthesiologist in the operating
      room is a significant challenge that is in urgent need of being addressed. Assistance is
      required in interpreting the overwhelming stream of physiological data, intelligently
      extracting key features from these data, and bringing them to the attention of the clinician.
