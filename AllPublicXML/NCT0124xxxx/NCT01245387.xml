    <description>Dosage recommendations for MACUGEN took place on the basis of the approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and were adjusted solely according to medical practice. MACUGEN® is available as pre-filled syringe containing 0.3 mg MACUGEN® in 90 µL injection solution for intravitreal injection. Macugen injections were documented to reflect the routine clinical practice. Follow-up visits were only carried out and documented if they took place as part of the standard medical treatment for the respective case and were necessary for medical and/or therapeutic reasons.</description>

          <title>Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</title>
          <description>IOP measured at each visit using either applanation tonometry or non-contact before intraviterial injection, reported as pre-dose pressure of treated eye in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The timeframe was as follows: Visit 1: IOP before any injection; Visit 2: IOP before first injection; Visit 3: IOP before second injection.</description>
