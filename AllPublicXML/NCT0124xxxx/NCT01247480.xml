      Major Aims of study:

        1. To create a gene expression-based prognostic device that complements or exceeds the
           prognostic utility of conventional biomarkers of breast cancer outcome.

        2. To identify one or more clinical subgroups of patients for which the prognostic device
           outperforms, or substantially adds to, the prognostic performance of conventional
           markers that currently determine therapeutic strategies.

      Sub-Aims of study:

        1. Assess the prognostic value of the multiple gene expression signatures, alone and in
           combination, using a large cohort of breast cancer patients for which pathology,
           treatment and outcome is available. A &quot;training&quot; and &quot;testing&quot; design is proposed.

        2. Evaluate the utility of a prognostic device that measures gene expression levels from
           formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens (FFPEs) of primary resected tumors. The
           investigators will utilize the Affymetrix Quantigene 2.0 Assay and/or the Illumina
           BeadXpress VeraCode DASL Gene Expression Assay (FDA-approved IVDMIA.)

        3. For specific clinical subgroups of patients/tumors, the investigators will
           mathematically identify additive or synergistic prognostic relationships between genes
           and gene signatures that, in combination, will yield maximal risk prediction (distant
           metastases-free survival) for patients.

        4. Compare the prognostic utility of the investigators device to that of the conventional
           prognostic variables that are currently used to determine therapeutic strategy.

        5. Incorporate the prognostic signatures into a practical prognosis algorithm that seeks to
           include conventional measures of outcome such as tumor size, histologic grade, nodal
           status, patient age, or Nottingham index, etc.

      The investigators hypothesize that adequate quality and quantity of tumor RNA may be
      extracted from archival paraffin-embedded tumor specimens for gene expression profiling, and
      that archival tumor-derived genomic signatures may be used as prognosticators or predictors
      in breast cancer.

      800 breast cancer patients who fulfill the eligibiltiy criteria will be selected from the NUH
      breast cancer registry (400 for training, 400 for validation). Eligible patients should have
      at least 5 years' follow-up at NUH and have an available archival paraffin-embedded tumor
      block stored at the Department of Pathology, NUH. 8-10 ten-micron sections from each tumor
      block will be cut and RNA extracted from the sections. RNA will then be profiled using
      high-throughput gene expression platforms (Illumina Veracode assay, Affymetrix Quantigene
      assay). Raw gene expression data will be applied in the following signatures previously
      generated by the Genome Institute of Singapore:

        1. 32-gene p53 Pathway Signature

        2. 5-gene Genetic Grade Signature

        3. 33-gene TuM1 Signature

        4. 10-gene ER Signature (Miller &amp; Tan, et. al., unpublished)

        5. 6-gene 3-Ratio Predictor (Miller &amp; Karuturi, et. al., unpublished)

        6. 5-gene HER2 Amplicon Predictor (Miller &amp; Karuturi, et. al., unpublished)

        7. 7-gene Basal-Luminal Discriminator (Miller, unpublished)

      The prognostic and/or predictive abilities of these signatures will be compared with
      conventional clinical prognosticators and predictors with the goal of developing archival
      tumor-derived genomic tests for breast cancer management in the future.

      The archival paraffin-embedded tumor blocks are left-over samples after clinical use. They
      are not samples that have been consented for research purpose. We are requesting for waiver
      of consent as this is a minimal risk study. We will ensure that sufficient tissue be left
      behind for future routine diagnostic purposes. Sections taken from each tumor will be coded
      with no patient identifiers to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the participants.

      The results generated from the tumor samples in this study will not impact on the clinical
      management of the patients.
