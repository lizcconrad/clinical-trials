  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) is a genetic disorder that develops in boys. It is
      caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining
      normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads
      to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type
      of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in
      approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
      investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.
      This study is an open-label trial for patients with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy who
      received ataluren in a prior PTC-sponsored study at a US clinical trial site. This trial will
      be conducted at sites in the US and will evaluate the long-term safety of ataluren, as
      determined by adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.

      The study will enroll boys with nonsense mutation DBMD who have a history of exposure to
      ataluren in a prior PTC study in nmDBMD (PTC124-GD-004-DMD, PTC124-GD-004e-DMD,
      PTC124-GD-007-DMD, PTC124-GD-007e, and PTC124-GD-008-DMD) at a trial site in the US. Patients
      will receive study drug 3 times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Study assessments
      will be performed at clinic visits during screening and every 12 weeks until the end of the
      study. Patients must also return to the clinic for a post treatment visit 6 weeks after the
      last dose of ataluren.

             the 6-week follow up period

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,
             study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:
