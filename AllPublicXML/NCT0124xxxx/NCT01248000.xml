  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) represents a step forward in the definition of response to
      therapy in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). In particular the use of PET for the early
      assessment of response has been described as the most important tool for predicting the risk
      of disease progression. As no data are available to support the use of early assessment of
      response for adapting and modifying subsequent treatment, the use of PET should be limited
      only to patients enrolled in clinical trials. Irrespective of recommendations PET scanning is
      included in the current management of patients with HL at baseline, mid treatment, end of
      treatment, and follow-up. So far no study has been performed to verify how PET is currently
      used in the clinical setting and to assess if and how results of PET scanning are used for
      supporting treatment and clinical decisions.
