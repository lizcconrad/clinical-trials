  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Removal of a central venous catheter (CVC) is often useful to prove its responsibility in a
      bloodstream infection. To avoid unnecessary removal of CVC, some catheter-spearing diagnostic
      methods have been recently developed. The aim of the study is to evaluate three
      catheter-spearing diagnostic methods in critically ill children: 1) the measurement of the
      differential time to positivity between a blood culture drawn from a peripherical vein and
      another one drawn through the CVC; 2) the exam of a blood sample drawn for the CVC and
      stained by acridine orange leucocyte cytospin test; 3) the semi-quantitative skin culture of
      the area around the insertion site of the CVC.

      Samples for the three techniques described above will be collected from the children admitted
      in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with a CVC for more than 48 hours and with clinical or
      biological signs of systemic infection. Any investigation required to determine the origin of
      the infection will be performed, according to physician's judgement. If the CVC is removed or
      changed on a guide wire, a quantitative culture of the distal segment will be performed.

      All the patients with a bloodstream infection and sampled according to the protocol will be
      included for statistical analysis. The physician and an independent medical expert will
      analyse if the bloodstream infection is CVC-related or not, according to the reference
      standard, by analysis of the clinical and bacteriological data, blinded towards the three
      studied techniques. The most optimal threshold will be determined and the sensibility, the
      specificity, the positive and negative predictable value of the three techniques will be
      calculated. Then sensibility of these three techniques will be compared.
