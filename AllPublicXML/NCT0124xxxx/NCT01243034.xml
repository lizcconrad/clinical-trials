  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of metabolic syndrome(MS) among pt's with schizophrenia has been reported to
      be high, ranging from 24 to 43% in males and 27 to 52% in females. Schizophrenic patients
      with MS have an increased incidence of DM, coronary heart disease and increased mortality
      from cardiovascular diseases. Central adiposity is highly correlated with the presence of
      hypertension, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and increased mortality risk. Waist
      circumference(WC) is a better indicator of abdominal obesity and a better predictor of CVD
      than either BMI or waist-to-hip ratio. However, currently there is no standard location for
      the measurement of WC.

      Objectives: 1. To compare the magnitude of WC measured at 3 sites ( immediately above the
      iliac crest, midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest , umbilical level) in males
      and females.

      2. To examine the correlation of WC with Triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL, LDL and glucose.
