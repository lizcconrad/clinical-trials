  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Candidemia is the fourth leading cause of hospital-acquired infection in USA. In CMUH, it
      caused 9% hospital-acquired bloodstream infection in 2008 and 2009. In addition to increased
      mortality, candidemia also increased hospital stay and cost. There is a trend of increased
      cases of candidemia in recent years in CMUH. Early empirical and target treatment can reduce
      mortality and shortened length of hospital stay.

      In the past, most prior studies in Taiwan dealt with risk factors for mortality rather than
      for candidemia and also focused at in vitro susceptibility to antifungal agents. In this
      study, the investigators hope to analyze the candidemic cases from 2003 to 2009, estimated
      1000 cases. There were some rare Candida species. Therefore, the investigators hope to do
      case study for these diseases to provide the epidemiology of candidemia in CMUH. The result
      can help clinician in predicting the disease and its outcome. Besides, it also provides the
      epidemiology of candidemia in mid-Taiwan.
