      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of UCBT to treat
      patients with lymphoid hematological diseases and to see if this treatment can decrease the
      incidence of leukemia relapse, GVHD and infections.

      These patients have a type of blood cell disorder that is very hard to cure. This treatment
      that is being used in this trial is known as a stem cell transplant. This treatment might
      help the patient live longer without the disease. It uses much stronger doses of drugs and
      radiation to kill the diseased cells that could be given without the transplant. We also
      think that the healthy cells from the donor may help fight any diseased cells left after the
      transplant.

      For the transplant to take place, we will administer stem cells from a 'donor' whose cells
      best 'match' the patient's. In this study umbilical cords will be the source of the stem
      cells. Before the transplant, two very strong drugs plus total body irradiation will be given
      to as preconditioning. This treatment will kill most of your blood-forming cells in the bone
      marrow. The patient will then get then healthy stem cells.

      If the patient has the disease in the central nervous system (CNS), they will receive
      radiation to the head and spine before starting the conditioning. This is to try to get
      disease control in the CNS. Radiation will not be given for children under 2 yrs old.

      Currently, many umbilical cord blood units are available in public banks for transplantation
      in patients lacking bone marrow donors. UCB transplants (UCBT) may offer several advantages
      over adult bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants, including:

        1. rapid availability,

        2. absence of donor risk,

        3. low risk of transmissible infectious diseases,

        4. low risk of acute GvHD (Graft vs. Host Disease)

      The three main causes of death after umbilical cord blood transplantation for these kind of
      disorders are graft failure, infection and disease relapse.

      In this study we are trying to address these three problems:

      To help improve engraftment we will add the drug Fludarabine to Cytoxan and total body
      irradiation. Fludarabine is a very strong medicine. We will try to decrease infections and
      reduce leukemia relapse by using fludarabine instead of antithymocyte globulin (ATG).

      After the eligible criterion for treatment has been met and a suitable UCB stem donor has
      been found, the patient will have a central line placed.

      Research Therapy:

      After placement of the central line, the following chemotherapy will be given to after
      admission to the hospital and before the infusion of the umbilical cord blood stem cells:

        -  9 - 6 days before the infusion: Total Body Irradiation (TBI) in two fractions (&quot;doses&quot;)
           per days.

        -  5 - 2 days before the infusion: Cytoxan given daily for 4 days, over 1 hour as an
           intravenous infusion. Mesna will be given per standards. Mesna is a drug given to
           decrease the side effects of Cytoxan. It will be given daily as an intravenous infusion
           while the patient receives the Cytoxan.

        -  4 - 2 days before the infusion: Fludarabine given daily for 3 days over 1 hour as an
           intravenous infusion.

      Stem cell transplant (intravenous infusion of the UCB stem cells) - defined as day 0 of the
      treatment. All other &quot;numbered&quot; days relate to this infusion date. For example, Day 1 is the
      first day after the stem cell transplant.

      The following medications will be given to help decrease side effects from the chemotherapy
      and UCB infusion: Cyclosporine A (CSA) will be given starting 3 days prior to the stem cell
      infusion. It will be given daily over 2 hours every 12 hours, after the infusion and then
      tapered if no GVHD is present.

      Administration of Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will start on the day the stem cell infusion is
      completed and will continue daily for 45 days, unless the patient develops GvHD.

      Intravenous immunoglobulin's (IVIG) will be given monthly until GVHD therapy is stopped and
      there is evidence that the patient's body is producing antibodies.

      Study Evaluations: Various study evaluations will be performed before and during the trial.

      Follow Up: After year 1, the patient will be asked to return to the clinic once a year for
      consultations and bone marrow tests. A follow up bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be done
      1 and 2 years after transplant. Consultations with specialists will be similar to the ones
      the patient had before the transplant.

             leukocyte antigen) matched or mismatched / related or unrelated) with a lymphoid
             hematologic malignancy (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hodgkin/non-hodgkin lymphoma)
             unlikely to be cure by standard chemotherapy. This includes patients who have relapsed
             after standard chemotherapy treatments and patients in first remission with
             unfavorable prognostics features.

          -  Related or Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood Unit with 0-1 antigen mismatch, Total
             Nucleated cell dose of greater than or equal to 4 x 10^7/kg.

          -  Lansky/Karnofsky scores greater than or equal to 60

          -  Negative pregnancy test (if applicable)

          -  Written informed consent and/or signed assent line from patient, parent or guardian.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infections. For bacterial infections, patients must be
             receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72 hours
             prior to enrollment. For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive
             systemic antifungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week
             prior to enrollment. Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability
             attributable to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic
             findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms
             will not be interpreted as progressing infection.
