  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out about the safety and effects of a
      drug called panobinostat when given to adults with sickle cell disease. Panobinostat is a pan
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to significantly
      increase hemoglobin F induction, which is well documented to improve outcomes in sickle cell
      disease. HDAC inhibitors are also known to potently inhibit cell-specific inflammation, which
      is a primary contributor to the debilitating effects of sickle cell disease. Given the
      relevance of these mechanisms of action in SCD, panobinostat may prove to contribute
      significantly to the management of SCD patients, a population in critical need of further
      effective treatment options.

      This is a one-arm, open-label, multi-center, Phase I, dose-escalation study of Panobinostat
      administered via different dosing schedules. In each schedule, this study is designed to
      determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) and DLT (dose limiting toxicities) of panobinostat
      as a single agent, and to characterize the safety and tolerability of panobinostat in adult
      patients with sickle cell disease who have failed to respond to hydroxyurea therapy
      (clinically or hematologically) or are intolerant of or refuse hydroxyurea therapy.

      The study consists of a Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Post-Treatment
      Follow-up.Screening Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 28 days of baseline
      visit (Day 1). Screening assessments will include informed consent, physical exam, vital
      signs (height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, and respirations), review
      of medical history, review of concomitant medications, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG),
      echocardiogram, and laboratory assessments. Screening laboratory assessments will include the
      following: CBC with differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel, LDH, serum
      ferritin, thyroid function testing, Hb F percentage, F-cells, HIV, urinalysis (with
      microscopic evaluation if indicated), and serum pregnancy in all females of childbearing
      potential. Approximately 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of blood will be collected at the screening
      visit.

      Treatment The treatment phase is twelve weeks in duration. Each subject will be assigned to a
      specified dose level and dosing schedule and will remain with the assigned regimen, if
      tolerated, throughout the twelve week period. Regardless of specific dosing assignment, all
      subjects will take study drug thrice weekly (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). The first three
      patients to enroll in the study will be assigned to dose level 1 (10 mg), with a dosing
      schedule of one week of treatment (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) followed by three weeks off
      treatment for the entire 12 week treatment period. The next three subjects will be assigned
      to dose level 1 (10 mg), with two weeks of treatment (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) followed
      by two weeks off treatment for the entire 12 week treatment period. The following three
      subjects will be assigned to dose level 1 (10 mg), with continuous thrice weekly dosing
      during the entire 12 week treatment period. Patient assignment will continue in this same
      manner until all three dose levels and schedules are filled or until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is found. All three subjects in a given cohort must complete one cycle of
      treatment before enrollment can begin in the next cohort. If the MTD is identified before all
      cohorts are completed, all subsequent subjects will be enrolled at that dosage and will be
      assigned one of the three dosing schedules to be followed for the entire 12 week treatment
      period. MTD is defined as one dose level lower than the dose on which 2/3 patients developed
      a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). If the MTD is reached prior to patients starting a given dose
      level, the remaining number of patients required to complete the study will be enrolled at
      the identified MTD. During the Treatment Phase, safety and efficacy assessments will be
      performed at specified times, and will include: physical examination, vital signs (weight,
      blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, and respirations), adverse events assessment,
      ECG, and laboratory assessments. Treatment phase lab assessments are to be performed at
      specified visits and include CBC with differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel,
      LDH, serum ferritin, Hb F percentage, F-cells, thyroid function testing, inflammatory
      markers, exploratory studies, urinalysis (with microscopic evaluation if indicated), and
      urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. Approximately 10 ml (2 teaspoons)
      of blood will be collected at each of the treatment visits.

      For all patients, a minimum of 3 sequential 12-lead ECGs, separated by at least 5 minutes,
      must be performed on Day 1 (baseline) and Day 5 pre-dose and 3 hours post-dose. Other ECG's
      (Day 29 and Day 57) are single pre-dose recordings

      Study personnel should place a telephone call to each patient on Days 50 and 71 to assess
      interim study drug compliance and to obtain information regarding any adverse events that may
      have occurred between study visits.

      Study drug will initially be dispensed at the baseline visit and every four weeks thereafter.
      Study drug accountability should be assessed at every visit. All baseline assessments will be
      completed prior to the first dose of study drug.

      Follow-up A follow-up visit will be performed 4 weeks after the Day 85 visit. Follow-up
      assessments will include: physical examination, vital signs, adverse events assessment, ECG,
      and laboratory assessments (CBC with differential, reticulocytes, complete chemistry panel,
      LDH, Hb F percentage, F-cells, and inflammatory markers). Approximately 10 ml (2 teaspoons)
      of blood will be collected at the follow-up visit.

      Optional genetic sub-study Exploratory genetic labs will be done on subjects who agree to
      participate. Histone acetylation and methylation assays of gamma genes will be performed as
      an assessment of the mechanism of action of panobinostat. Approximately 15ml of extra blood
      will be collected at four separate visits.
