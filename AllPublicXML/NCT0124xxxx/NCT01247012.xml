  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged use of parenteral nutrition can lead to parenteral nutrition associated liver
      disease (PNALD). The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of treatment with a
      smaller amount lipid minimization) of our standard soybean oil based intravenous lipid
      emulsion (Intralipid) versus a fish-oil based lipid emulsion (Omegaven) in infants with
      severe cholestasis.

      Infants meeting eligibility will be randomized to receive either 1g/kg/day of Intralipid速 20%
      or 1g/kg/day Omegaven速 10%. Infants randomized to Intralipid速 whose conjugated bilirubin
      level rises &gt;100umol/L will be crossed over to receive 1g/kg/day Omegaven速. Monitoring
      includes liver function tests (AST, ALT,ALP, GGT, Conjugated Bilirubin), Fatty Acid Profile
      (RBC and serum fatty acids; triene/tetraene ratio), INR (coagulation profile) and cytokine
      measure (inflammatory markers).
