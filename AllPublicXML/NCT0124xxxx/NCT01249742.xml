      Background

      The treatment of diabetes is multidisciplinary. Alignment of care of the various professional
      disciplines is, however, not always optimal. This can lead to confusion about treatment
      interventions and behavioral advices. In adolescence, good fine-tuned care is of extreme
      importance because of the difficulties in regulation of the disease in this phase of life
      (Snoek, 2004). These difficulties are due to biological changes but also to
      socio-psychological developmental changes. The adolescents' psychological development demands
      more autonomy and responsibility for the diabetes (care) by the adolescent. The social
      development can conflict with the treatment regime, because of the adolescents' social needs
      (ADA, 2001; Houdijk, 1998; Snoek, 2004). In this study the investigators assess whether an
      interactive website, on which adolescents with diabetes and their treatment team can
      communicate, leads to better alignment of care and better control over the disease.

      Intervention

      The diabetes has great impact on the adolescents' everyday life. Finding a balance between
      more autonomy, participating in social life with (healthy) peers and control of the disease
      is difficult and seems to act as a thread during this phase in life.

      This can lead to questions and uncertainty at any given moment. The interactive website
      provides the adolescent access to information and to his or her individual treatment plan and
      advices fitted to his or her condition and life. The adolescent can pose questions at any
      given moment through the online forum and their personal treatment page. Since the treatment
      team answers the question within a day, fit between diabetes care and adolescents' everyday
      life is optimized.

      Research question

      Does an online interactive treatment environment, on which adolescents with diabetes can
      communicate with their treatment team, lead to better fit of care and to better disease
      control?

    <description>Participants' appreciation of our diabetes care was assessed using the Patients' Evaluation of Quality of Diabetes care (PEQ-D; Pouwer &amp; Snoek, 2002). This questionnaire consists of 14 items, such as: 'The amount of information I receive from the doctor is…'. The adolescent is asked to answer by means of a 5-point lykert scale varying from 1) bad to 5) excellent.</description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: baseline (1 month prior to acces to intervention); T1: (6 months following T0); T2: (12 months following T0).</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life was measured by means of the PedsQl 3.0 diabetes module (Varni, 2004). The Dutch translation was used, which shows good psychometric properties for clinical application in pediatric diabetes care (de Wit, 2008). The questionnaire consists of 28 items and can be subdivided into five subscales; diabetes symptoms, treatment barriers, treatment adherence, worry, and communication. Example of item: 'I feel hungry' (subscale diabetes symptoms). Al items can be answered using a 5-point lykert scale, varying from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always).</description>

    <measure>Adolescents' disease knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: baseline (1 month prior to acces to intervention); T1: (6 months following T0); T2: (12 months following T0).</time_frame>
    <description>Diabetes knowledge was measured using the Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire (Fitzgerald, 1998). This questionnaire has shown to have good psychometric properties (Fitzgerald, 1998). The questionnaire was translated in Dutch especially for this study. The final Dutch version, DKT-NL, consisted of 21 multiple choice questions, such as 'sings of ketoacidosis include… '. Possible answers were: a) shakiness, b) sweating, c) vomiting (right answer), d) low blood glucose .</description>

    <measure>Confidence In Diabetes Selfcare</measure>
    <time_frame>T0: baseline (1 month prior to acces to intervention); T1: (6 months following T0); T2: (12 months following T0).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' self-efficacy was determined through use of the Confidence In Diabetes Selfcare questionnaire (CIDS; van de ven, 2004). The questionnaire contains 20 items, all referring to the perceived ability to perform diabetes self-care tasks. All items are preceded by &quot;I believe I can… ,&quot; and can be answered on a 5-point lykert scale, varying from 1) &quot;No, I am sure I cannot&quot; to 5) &quot;Yes, I am sure I can&quot;). An example is &quot;I believe I can… adjust my insulin when I am sick&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>T0: baseline (1 month prior to acces to intervention); T1: (6 months following T0); T2: (12 months following T0).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' Glycemic control was derived from their files. 'Old' HbA1c values were converted to new HbA1c values using the calculator of the Dutch Diabetes Federation (NDF, 2010). New HbA1c values were used in the analyses.</description>

    <measure>Degree of use of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 (6 months following start of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of use of our intervention was measured by frequency of use of adolescents of different applications. We therefore logged all action of adolescents on Sugarsquare. Examples of variables are number of page views, number of posted messages on the forum, number of attended chat sessions and number of started discussions with professional caregivers. Table 3 gives insight in all actions included in the analysis.</description>

    <description>Our intervention, Sugarsquare, is a secured treatment environment only accessible by patients of the KDCN and members of the treatment team. Sugarsquare consists of two main sections. The first section is a semi-public setting on which adolescents can exchange experiences with their diabetes (care) through a forum and a real time chat-application. All patients and treatment team members can see all messages posted here. The second section consists of patients' individual pages with treatment overview and an application for private interaction with the treatment team. Patients can only access their own individual page; treatment team members can access pages of all patients. Sugarsquare is a secured webpage, accessible only through computers equipped with the right certificate (access device) and by using the appointed username-password combination.</description>
