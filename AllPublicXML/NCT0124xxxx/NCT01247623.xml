      Primary objective: Determination of safety and tolerability of GV1001 administration combined
      with Temozolomide (based on blood samples and adverse events).

      Feasibility of combining active immunisation with Temozolomide treatment. Determination of
      immunological response after administration of GV1001 and Temozolomide as measured by
      presence of DTH skin test reaction and specific T-cell responses.

      Secondary: Evaluation of objective tumour response

      The trial is an exploratory study which main objective is to estimate safety and feasibility
      of combining active immunisation with chemotherapy. However, the trial may also indicate the
      efficacy of the combination.
