  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiopathogenesis of periodontal disease results from complex interaction between
      infectious agents, mainly including bacteria, and host cellular and humoral immune responses.
      However it is thought that bacteria-induced pathogenesis is not sufficient alone to explain
      all biological and clinical features of the destructive periodontal disease. The main
      hypothesis is that herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr Virus, may participate as well by
      altering epithelial gingival cell biology and consequently may promote the initiation and
      progression of periodontitis.
