      The purpose of this clinical study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of the
      Trufit CB (Cartilage Bone) implant for the treatment of single, isolated cartilage defects of
      the knee compared to Microfracture.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      315 subjects, ages 18 years and older with a single, isolated cartilage defect of the knee
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups:

        -  Trufit CB Implant with rehabilitation protocol;

        -  Trufit CB Implant with rehabilitation protocol;

        -  Microfracture with rehabilitation protocol

      Rehabilitation program may be standard (6 weeks touch weight to full weight bearing) or
      accelerated (2 weeks touch weight to full weight bearing)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of providing informed consent;

          -  Eighteen (18) years or older and skeletally mature on the date of study enrollment;

          -  Willing and able to attend all follow up visits and complete all study related
             procedures and evaluations including, but not limited to adhering to the

             cartilage lesion;

          -  Presents with stable health at the time of study enrollment;

          -  BMI of ≤ 32.

             motion upon physical examination;

          -  Treated with either an investigational device or drug within one (1) month of study
             enrollment, or plans to be treated with an investigational device or drug in the next
             24 months;

          -  Requires the use of any medication(s) or treatment(s) known to have an effect on bone
             metabolism (e.g. bisphosphonates, chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive agents);

          -  Requires concomitant osteotomy, partial lateral meniscectomy or complete meniscectomy;
             Note: Concomitant ACL reconstruction or revision, as well as meniscal repair and
             partial medial meniscectomies are permitted under the study protocol.

          -  Has undergone an ACL reconstruction, osteotomy, chondral resurfacing procedure or
             partial meniscectomy (≤ central third of the meniscus) in the last year and has not
             completed at least 6 months of rehabilitation since such surgery; Note: Patients who
             have undergone these procedures within the last year and have completed at least 6
             months of rehabilitation are eligible to participate in the study.

          -  Any active, implanted medical device (e.g. cochlear implant) or metallic implant
             (other then dental work) that may interfere with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);
