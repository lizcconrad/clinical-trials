      The purpose of this study is to develop a BioBank (a specialized lab) and collect blood,
      fluids and/or other tissue samples to study eye diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Biobank related to eye disease at Beaumont Hospital is to help connect
      specialties and Specialists with each other, outside traditional limits of hospital or
      laboratory departments. The specimens (blood, fluids, and/or tissue samples) that will be
      collected from men, women and children will assist the researchers in a variety of studies on
      human eye diseases.

      Research utilizing these specimens will allow for an increased understanding of the etiology,
      disease process, and response to treatments for various eye diseases, and will provide
      opportunities to subsequently improve our management decisions. Furthermore, projects that
      cross over between subspecialties are sparse and that is a limiting factor for the
      development of research that takes a more comprehensive approach.

    <measure>To build the platform for a novel application of translational research that links cutting edge molecular laboratory techniques to clinical outcome studies</measure>
    <description>Biobanks can be used for numberous discovery applications such as: identification and structural characterization of human genes, expression analysis, or discovery proteomics. Biological specimens, when coupled with standardized treatment and outcome data, will be essential resources for the identification, characterization and validation of biomarkers that are predictive of disease and treatment.</description>
