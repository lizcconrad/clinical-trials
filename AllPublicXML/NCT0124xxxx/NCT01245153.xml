  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common and worldwide problem.Although pelvic floor muscle
      training(PFMT) is the standard recommendation for conservative treatment but some patients
      had difficulty doing PFMT. They could not locate the pelvic floor muscles, and so could not
      perform the PFMT properly or increase intensity of the exercise. The authors hypothesized
      that rectal balloon training(RBT) may improve patients' pelvic floor recognition as well as
      it is another option of progressive strengthening of pelvic floor muscle. This study's aim is
      to combine RBT with PFMT using the water-filled balloons of Foley catheters

      This study's aim is to combine RBT with PFMT using the water-filled balloons of Foley
      catheters. The catheter would be inserted into the rectum and used as a tool to help the
      patient recognize the pelvic floor muscles. The advantages of Foley catheters are that they
      are cheap, safe for contacting the mucosa, easy for self-insertion, and can be reused.
      Furthermore, we can increase the load of exercise by increasing the amount of water pushing
      into the balloon, and can use that as a tool for progressive resistive exercise.

    <description>Subjects in combined RBT and PFMT group are taught Foley catheter insertion technique. The catheter is inserted into the rectum until the lower end of the balloon is 1 cm inside from the anus. Then the balloon is blown with clean water. Subjects will contract pelvic floor muscle in standing position by contracting the pelvic floor muscle, hold and count 1 to 5, then relax and count 1 to 5. Subjects are instructed to do the exercise 15 times/set, 3 sets/day, every day for 6 weeks.</description>
