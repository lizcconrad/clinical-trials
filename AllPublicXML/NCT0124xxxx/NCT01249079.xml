      This proposal responds to Request for Applications RFA-MH-08-131, which seeks applications
      that propose to enrich pre-existing resources for schizophrenia in the National Institute of
      Mental Health (NIMH) Human Genetics Initiative and to apply genomic methods to further the
      investigators understanding of the molecular etiology of the disorder. The overarching aims
      of this proposal are to quickly and cost-effectively ascertain a large sample of trio
      families affected by schizophrenia, and to discover causal variants for the disorder in the
      first family-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the disorder. In Taiwan, there is
      no such kind of policy to support this kind of GWAS study as it is a very expensive study,
      including collecting large family samples and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) scanning. The investigators, thus, collaborate with Professor Ming T, Tsuang and his
      entended subcontracted researchers to apply for this project. The investigators, the research
      team in Taiwan, will collect 3800 trio families (11400 subjects) of schizophrenia. Through
      additional ascertainment within this framework, the investigators will collect an aggregate
      sample with adequate power for detecting in a GWAS those variants that make even small
      contributions to the risk for the disorder.

      The investigators will meet the overarching goals of this project by accomplishing several
      Specific Aims, as follows: 1) Rapidly ascertain schizophrenia trio families from Taiwanese
      clinical ascertainment sites; 2) Supplement NIMH Genetics Initiative collections by sending
      all clinical data and biomaterials to the appropriate repositories; 3) Assess the association
      of schizophrenia with a genome-wide panel of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their
      constituent haplotypes; 4) Analyze quantitative schizophrenia phenotypes such as age at onset
      ; 5) Perform a genome-wide survey for copy-number variations related to schizophrenia; 6)
      Test for gene-gene interactions (epistasis); and 7) Test for gene-environment interactions,
      such as the well-established effect of season of birth.
