      This expanded access program is an open-label, multi-center study, which will consist of a
      PreTreatment Phase and a Treatment Phase. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer who fulfill the eligibility criteria will be treated. The program will continue in
      each country until eribulin is approved, reimbursed and launched in that country, or
      termination of the program by the Sponsor.

      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient's oncologist must have documented experience in a prior eribulin clinical
             trial

          -  Recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed on or
             after the last anti-cancer therapy

          -  Prior treatment with, ineligibility for, or commercial unavailability of each of the
             following therapies:

               1. Anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine

               2. Ixabepilone, in countries where this agent is marketed

               3. Trastuzumab, for Her-2 positive disease

               4. Hormonal therapy, in hormone receptor-positive disease

               5. All other commercially available therapies, e.g. gemcitabine or vinorelbine, used
                  for the treatment of advanced breast cancer (see NCCN guidelines)

          -  ECOG performance status greater than or equal to 2

          -  Adequate kidney function: serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL or
             creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40 mL/min

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5
             x 10^9/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 g/dL (can be corrected by growth
             factor or transfusion), and platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Adequate liver function: total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of
             normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate
             aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 x ULN (or less than or equal to 5 x ULN in
             case of liver metastases). If alkaline phosphatase is greater than 3 x ULN (in absence
             of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver metastases) AND
             patient also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific alkaline phosphatase
             must be used to assess liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase

          -  Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the treatment protocol

          -  Provision of written informed consent

          -  Female, aged at least 18 years

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must agree to be abstinent or to use a highly
             effective method of contraception

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

        Eligibility for any other eribulin study open in the same region

          -  Existing anti-cancer therapy-related toxicities of grade 2 or more, except that
             alopecia and grade 2 neuropathy are acceptable

          -  History of congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association Classification
             greater than grade II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months
             or serious cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Electrocardiogram with QTc interval of greater than or equal to 500 msec based upon
             Bazett's formula (QTcB)

          -  The Investigator believes the patient to be medically unfit to receive eribulin or
             unsuitable for any other reason

          -  Pregnancy (positive B-hCG test) or breastfeeding

          -  Hypersensitivity to eribulin or any of the excipients

          -  Brain or subdural metastases, unless local therapy has been completed and use of
             corticosteroids for this indication has been discontinued for at least 4 weeks before
             starting treatment in this protocol. Any signs (eg, radiologic) and/or symptoms of
             brain metastases must be stable for at least 4 weeks before starting the treatment
             protocol

          -  History of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would compromise the patient's ability to safely complete the treatment protocol

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus positivity, as neutropenia caused by eribulin
             treatment may make such patients particularly susceptible to infection.

          -  Meningeal carcinomatosis

          -  Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement resulting in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active
             treatment, including use of oxygen

          -  Receipt of any of the following treatments within the specified period before the
             start of treatment: 1) Any investigational drug within 4 weeks; 2) Chemotherapy,
             radiation, biological or targeted therapy within 2 weeks; 3) Hormonal therapy within 1
             week.
