  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VEGF Trap-Eye will be tested for safety and efficacy in patients with vision loss due to
      choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia. This will be a
      placebo-controlled trial. 3 out of 4 patients will receive an injection of VEGF Trap-Eye into
      the affected eye (and repeated injections if required), and 1 out of 4 patients will receive
      a sham injection requiring no needle stick, but making the patient unaware of whether or not
      he received active treatment.

      Outcome of the two treatment groups will be compared after 24 weeks. From week 24, sham
      patients may receive active treatment.

      Total duration of the study will be 48 weeks.

          <description>The NEI VFQ-25 total score ranges from 0-100 with a score of 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome. The NEI VFQ questionnaire is organized as a collection of subscales which are all scored from 0-100. To reach the overall composite score, each sub-scale score is averaged in order to give each sub-scale equal weight.</description>
