      The aim of this prospective study was to compare the 5-year prognostic value of transient
      elastography (TE), FibroTest (FT), APRI , FIB-4, Lok, and Child-Pugh scores for predicting
      survival and complications of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver diseases.

      A total of 1616 patients with chronic hepatitis C was included. At 5 years, 79 patients were
      dead (39 liver-related deaths) and 16 patients had liver transplantation. Overall survival
      was 91.7% and survival without liver-related death 94.4%. Survival was significantly
      decreased in patients diagnosed with severe fibrosis, whatever the non-invasive method used.
      All these methods were able to predict a shorter survival in this large population. Patients
      had their prognosis decreased as liver stiffness increased. By multivariate analysis, only
      FibroTest &gt; 0.74 (OR 4.41, 95%CI 1.62-12.01, p=0.004) was associated with overall survival,
      and liver stiffness &gt; 9.5 kPa (OR 4.71, 95%CI 1.06-21.01, p=0.04) associated with
      liver-related death.

        We included all consecutive patients with an age over eighteen and a chronic hepatitis C of
        any severity. The determination of chronic hepatitis C was made using standard diagnostic
        criteria: serological detection of hepatitis C antibodies and positive serum HCV-RNA by PCR
        for more than 6 months. Exclusion criteria were chronic hepatitis B virus infection and all
        other causes of chronic liver disease. Patients with HIV infection were included.
