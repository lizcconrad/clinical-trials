    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to determine the effects on health status and spirometric
      values of Foster® 100/6 (two puffs b.i.d.) versus Seretide® 500/50 (one inhalation b.i.d.),
      over a 12-week treatment period in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an incurable, debilitating and progressive
      disease that can be fatal. The recent Global Burden of Disease Study ranks COPD as the 6th
      leading cause of mortality and the 12th leading cause of morbidity world-wide. Furthermore,
      trends in the use of medical care resources indicate that the economic cost of COPD continues
      to rise in direct relation to the ageing population, the increase in prevalence of disease
      and the cost of new and existing medical and public health interventions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged ≥ 40 years, who have signed an Informed Consent form

             consent obtained by legal representative.

          2. Outpatients with a diagnosis of COPD and including:

               1. Smoking history of at least 10 pack years defined as [(number of cigarettes
                  smoked per day) x (number of years of smoking) / 20], both current and ex-smokers
                  are eligible.

               2. Use of bronchodilators in the previous 2 months to visit 1.

                  at visit 2).

          3. History of no more than one COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months (without
             considering the last 2 months) to visit 1.

          4. A cooperative attitude and ability to be trained to the proper use of pMDI and DPI

          1. Clinically relevant respiratory disorders.

          2. Current diagnosis of asthma or respiratory disorders other than COPD.

          3. Clinically significant laboratory and ECG abnormalities indicating a significant or
             unstable concomitant disease which may impact the feasibility of the results of the
             study according to investigator's judgement.

          4. Patients with COPD exacerbation in the 2 months prior to screening and during the
