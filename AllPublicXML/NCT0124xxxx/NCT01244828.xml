    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, open-label fixed-flexible dose long-term study of asenapine in
      participants with schizophrenia. Participants in this study consist of schizophrenia with
      residual subtype or receiving high dose/multiple antipsychotic drugs, treatment refractory,
      or elderly participants with schizophrenia. The treatment period is up to 52 weeks.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Extrapyramidal Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 56 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This measure reports the overall number of participants with any of a group of adverse events that were defined to represent extrapyramidal symptoms. The number of participants with each of the individual adverse events within this definition is also presented, for terms that occurred in at least one participant. For this measure, all adverse event terms within the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) for &quot;extrapyramidal syndrome&quot; were treated as extrapyramidal symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PANSS Total Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 3 subscales: positive subscale (7 items), negative subscale (7 items), and general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions (e.g., emotional withdrawal). For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 30 PANSS items, and ranged from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Week 52 (calculated for a participant as Week 52 value minus baseline value); improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Total Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 3 subscales: positive subscale (7 items), negative subscale (7 items), and general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions (e.g., emotional withdrawal). For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 1=absent to 7=extreme. The PANSS total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 30 PANSS items, and ranged from 30 to 210 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Week 52 (calculated for a participant as Week 52 value minus baseline value); improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>
