    <textblock>
      Earlier the investigators determined the safety and feasibility of tumor lysate-pulsed
      dendritic cells as therapeutic adjuvants in mesothelioma patients. Because pre-clinical data
      in mice had shown that better results were obtained when regulatory T cells were depleted
      using low-dosis of cyclophosphamide, ten patients who responded on chemotherapy are selected
      for DC-treatment in combination with Endoxan.

      Currently there is no satisfactory low-toxicity treatment for patients with mesothelioma
      (MM). Based on studies in other types of cancer in humans where beneficial effects were
      obtained, and based on our pre-clinical data in a mouse model for MM, led to the introduction
      of DC-immunotherapy for human MM in 2005. A beneficial effect of immunotherapy in MM patients
      without major side effects was found, however, research has shown that DC immunotherapy might
      be further improved. The objectives of the here proposed phase study are:

        -  To define the safety and toxicity of low dose CTX in combination with MesoCancerVac in
           patients with MM.

        -  To determine if vaccination with low dose CTX in combination with MesoCancerVac results
           in a detectable immune response by skin DTH reactions on MM crude antigen and KLH and by
           in vitro laboratory analysis.

        -  To observe and document anti-cancer activity by laboratory evaluation (e.g. decrease in
           Tregs, increase in CTLs using 51Cr release and IFN-gamma ELISPOT)

        -  To observe and document anti-cancer activity by clinical evaluation (e.g. CT scan)

    <description>Patients with mesothelioma who are fit enough to be treated with chemotherapy and enough tumor material was available are asked for participation in this study. After 4 cycles of Alimta chemotherapy, a leukapheresis is performed of which the monocytes are used for differentiation to DCs using different cytokines. The procedure to grow DCs in vitro and pulse them with tumor lysate is performed according to our earlier performed phase I study that was approved by our local ethics committee. Three doses of properly pulsed autologous DCs (MesoCancerVac) are then re-injected every two weeks. Patients will be treated with a low dose of CTX for seven day in a row the week before the 1st vaccination, the weeks in between the 2nd, and for one week after the 3rd vaccination.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically and histological or cytological confirmed newly diagnosed MM,
             that can be measured in two dimensions by a radiologic imaging study.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old and must be able to give written informed
             consent.

          -  Patients must be ambulatory (Karnofsky scale &gt; 70, or WHO-ECOG performance status 0,1,
             or 2) and in stable medical condition. The expected survival must be at least 4
             months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ function and adequate bone marrow reserve: absolute
             neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/l, platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/l, and Hb &gt; 6.0 mmol/l.

          -  Positive DTH skin test (induration &gt; 2mm after 48 hrs) against at least one positive
             control antigen tetanus toxoid.
