  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After comparing ultrasound study of rotator cuff injuries that have been evaluated both in
      the community and in a hospital-based ultrasound service with actual surgical findings, it is
      expected that specialist performed imaging and evaluation will be most accurate and that
      those performed in the community will be not accurate enough.
