  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critical Limb Ischemia prevents the legs and feet from receiving oxygen and nutrients needed
      for proper function. This severe lack of blood flow can lead to painful legs while walking or
      at rest and can result in foot sores, ulcers, gangrene, and even amputation. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if injections of concentrated bone marrow into damaged tissues
      will result in improved blood flow. If successful, this treatment could improve blood flow to
      the lower limb, reduce pain, and reduce the frequency of limb amputations.

    <textblock>
      Bone marrow aspirate is collected and processed by centrifugation to remove red blood cells.
      The resulting concentrate of cells is injected into ischemic tissues of the lower limb. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if injections of concentrated bone marrow nucleated
      cells into ischemic tissues will result in vasculogenesis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (PAOD) with clinical Rutherford
             Category 5 disease, as defined in the reporting standards adopted by the Society of
             Vascular Surgeons(table 1); Minor Tissue loss-focal gangrene with diffuse pedal
             ischemia

          -  Patient meets at least one of the following diagnostic criteria in the study limb:

          -  There is no reasonable open surgical or endovascular revascularization option as
             determined by the treating vascular specialist. Factors that may contribute to the
             determination of inoperability may include:

               -  Anatomical considerations

          -  No outflow targets

          -  No appropriate conduit (i.e. vein for bypass)

          -  Long segment occlusions or calcified lesions that predict poor outcome with
             endovascular approaches.

               -  High risk medical conditions i.e. Unstable cardiac disease.

               -  History of prior failed revascularization attempts

          -  The Patient's case was reviewed at the treating institution's Multidisciplinary
             Vascular Conference where the patient's status as a poor candidate for conventional
             therapies was confirmed.

          -  Age ≥18 years and ability to understand the planned treatment

          -  Subject has read and signed the IRB approved Informed Consent form

          -  Patients for whom the following medication(s) is prescribed must have a one month
             stable baseline therapy prior to enrollment: Plavix/asprin therapy, anticoagulation
             therapy, cholesterol lowering agent, and or blood pressure medication. If any of these
             medications are not prescribed notation of the reason for omission is to be provided.

          -  Hematocrit ≥ 28.0%, White Blood Cell count ≤ 14,000, Platelet count ≥ 50,000,
             Creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg / dL, INR ≤ 1.6 unless on Coumadin, or PTT &lt;1.5 x control (to
             avoid bleeding complications) Patients on Coumadin will be corrected prior to the
             procedure and must have an INR&lt;1.6 at the time of randomization/surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &lt;6 months due to concomitant illnesses

          -  History of bone marrow diseases (especially NHL, MDS) that prohibit transplantation

             PAP, Chest X-ray, PSA, Mammogram, Hemocult unless follow-up studies reveal patient to
             be cancer free.

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HgbA1C&gt;10%)

          -  Medical risk that precludes anesthesia (conscious sedation), or ASA Class 5

          -  Uncorrected occlusion of the common or external iliac artery on index side

          -  Absence of any pulsatile Doppler flow below the ankle.

          -  Extensive necrosis of the index limb or other conditions that make amputation
             inevitable (Rutherford Category 6).

             arterial aneurysm or bypass surgery, or coronary artery bypass surgery) or a
             myocardial infarction within the 3 months prior to randomization

          -  Underwent a successful or partially successful endovascular intervention for
             peripheral arterial occlusive disease. (ie. Aorta, iliac, femoral, popliteal, or

               1. The procedure is diagnostic only with no intervention performed, (for example in

               2. The treated artery recoils, thromboses, or dissects resulting in occlusion of the
                  treated arterial segment, documented by intraoperative imaging. Note that
                  endovascular procedures with suboptimal results but not meeting criteria 1 or 2
                  above may qualify for inclusion after 3 months as in #16 above.

          -  Treatment with topical growth factors or hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) within 30 days, or
