      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of metadoxine
      (MG01CI) extended release formulation for the treatment of adults diagnosed with ADHD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      study in adult subjects with ADHD.

      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups,
      1400 mg Metadoxine (MG01CI) and Placebo. The study will consist of three periods: a screening
      period of up to 2 weeks, a 6-week double-blind treatment period, and a 2-week safety
      follow-up period. The total duration of subject participation will be ~10 weeks.

      Overview of Study Visits

      Screening Period:

      Visit 1 - Screening/Baseline Visit (up to 14 days prior to dosing)

      Treatment Period:

      Visit 2 - Day 0 (Randomization Visit) Visit 3 - Day 7 ± 2 days Visit 4 - Day 14 ± 2 days
      Visit 5 - Day 28 ± 2 days Visit 6 - Day 42 ± 2 days

      Follow-up period:

      Visit 7 - Day 56 ± 3 days

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS™)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (from visit 1 baseline to visit 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the difference in change (decrease) in CAARS (Total ADHD Symptoms Score) between the study groups. The CAARS assess the presence and severity of ADHD symptoms and behaviors in adults. Respondents are asked to report their own experiences by rating items pertaining to their behavior/problems using a 4-point Likert-style format ranging from 0 ('Not at all', 'never') to 3 ('Very much', 'very frequently'). The scale measures ADHD symptoms using a 30-item questionnaire.Total score is the sum of all the items ,min=30 Max=90</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) (Change in ADHD Score From Screening to Visit 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks( visit 1 baseline to visit 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The TOVA is a computerized test that provides information about an individual's sustained attention, speed and consistency of responding, and behavioral self-regulation and executive functioning. ADHD score is a comparison of the subject's response to the CPT test to those of an ADHD group, and is reported as a Z-score. An ADHD score of -1.80 and less fits the profile of the ADHD sample. A score of more than -1.80 (more positive) does not fit the ADHD profile. When comparing ADHD scores the higher the ADHD score the better the performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adult ADHD Quality of Life (AAQoL)- Measuring Change in Total Score of AAQoL From Visit 1 to Visit 6</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks (from visit 1 baseline to visit 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The AAQoL scale provides a validated disease-specific measure of the impact of ADHD on quality of life.It is scored as an overall score (29 items) and four subscale scores: life productivity (11 items), psychological health (6 items), life outlook (7 items) and relationships (5 items). Individual items are scored on a five-point Likert-like scale from 'Not at all/Never' (1) to 'Extremely/Very Often' (5).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI-I)Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks from visit 1 baseline to visit 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients). CGI-I scores range from 1 ('very much improved') through to 7 ('very much worse').
During the conduct of the study, CGI-I evaluations were not done correctly and thus data interpretation is limited.</description>

        <title>Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS™)</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the difference in change (decrease) in CAARS (Total ADHD Symptoms Score) between the study groups. The CAARS assess the presence and severity of ADHD symptoms and behaviors in adults. Respondents are asked to report their own experiences by rating items pertaining to their behavior/problems using a 4-point Likert-style format ranging from 0 (‘Not at all’, ‘never’) to 3 (‘Very much’, ‘very frequently’). The scale measures ADHD symptoms using a 30-item questionnaire.Total score is the sum of all the items ,min=30 Max=90</description>

        <description>The TOVA is a computerized test that provides information about an individual's sustained attention, speed and consistency of responding, and behavioral self-regulation and executive functioning. ADHD score is a comparison of the subject's response to the CPT test to those of an ADHD group, and is reported as a Z-score. An ADHD score of -1.80 and less fits the profile of the ADHD sample. A score of more than -1.80 (more positive) does not fit the ADHD profile. When comparing ADHD scores the higher the ADHD score the better the performance.</description>
