  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High joint load during walking has been linked to cartilage degradation. Biomarkers, found in
      the blood and urine, are protein fragments released after cartilage degradation
      characteristic of OA. They have the potential to enable direct and immediate disease state
      monitoring and identification of early cartilage changes. Little is known about the
      association of biomarkers with joint load or if exercise aimed at reducing joint load changes
      biomarker levels, thus reducing the risk of OA progression. This study will provide novel
      information on these relationships and will guide future intervention studies. The
      investigators hypothesize that certain biomarkers will be highly correlated with joint
      loading during walking and that the levels of these biomarkers in the blood and urine will
      decrease following an exercise intervention aimed at cartilage unloading.

      Participants will be tested twice (baseline and 11 weeks later) where they will undergo gait
      and strength analyses by the same blinded assessor, complete self-report questionnaires, and
      have blood and urine samples drawn. Participants will then be randomized into either: (i)
      exercise; or (ii) usual care (no additional treatment). Those in the exercise group will
      complete 10-weeks of strengthening targeting lower limb muscles. Once weekly, they will
      consult with the study physiotherapist (MAH) at UBC to ensure proper performance and safe
      progression of exercises. Participants will be given cuff weights and resistance bands to
      complete exercises at home five times per week. Exercise compliance will be monitored using
      log books. All participants will be encouraged to maintain their usual treatment regimen
      (except for exercises completed by the exercise group), but will document any unexpected
      alterations such as medication changes or physician visits.

    <description>Participants in the exercise group will receive a lower limb strengthening program consisting of 6 exercises targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip abductor groups. They will perform these exercises at home 4 times per week (3 sets of 10 repetitions per exercise). Over the course of the intervention, each participant will consult with the physiotherapist a total of 5 times (once per week in weeks: 1,2,3,5, and 8) to ensure proper performance of exercises and safe progression of resistance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age greater than 50 years (to meet the American College of Rheumatology clinical
             definition of OA)

          -  radiographically confirmed knee OA in the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint

          -  knee pain during walking greater than 3/10 (based on an 11-point scale; 0 = &quot;no pain&quot;,
             10 = &quot;maximal pain&quot;) on most days of the previous month

          -  predominance of pain/tenderness over the medial (inside) region of the knee

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  articular cartilage degradation in the lateral tibiofemoral compartment greater than
             the medial (medial compartment OA is more common than lateral and the KAM is a
             validated measure of medial compartment loading only)

          -  currently in a structured exercise program

          -  medical condition precluding exercise

          -  inflammatory arthritic condition

          -  history of knee replacement surgery

          -  recent use of corticosteroids (oral or via injection)

          -  unable to attend exercise training sessions at UBC

          -  pain originating predominantly from the patellofemoral joint

          -  inability to ambulate without a gait aid

          -  non-English speaking (questionnaires are in English and must be completed by the study
             participant only)

          -  recent (within 6 months) arthroscopic knee surgery

          -  significant hip or back pain (limits the ability to perform the testing and exercises)
