  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individualised nutritional therapy
      comprised of appetising, energy- and protein-rich foods can have a positive effect on
      physiological function and quality of life of undernourished patients as compared to usual
      nutrition care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Undernutrition and insufficent dietary intake in hospitalised patients is a widespread
      problem. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, worsened physiological
      function and quality of life and increased expenses for the health care system. Food quality
      has been shown to be positively associated with dietary intake in patients. However, there
      has lacked knowledge on how food quality can be optimised to promote intake. A project was
      therefore initiated, which aimed at establishing a framework for developing appetising,
      energy- and protein-rich foods for patients at nutritional risk. This project included
      qualitative and quantitative investigation of nutritional risk patients' meal experiences and
      preferences (se citations below). These results have served as a basis for optimsing energy-
      and protein-rich foods as part of an indivudalised nutritional therapy aimed at improving
      dietary intake in nutritional risk patients.
