      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the comparative efficacy of the combination of
      Clotrimazole + Gentamicin + Beclomethasone in study subjects with a condition of contaminated
      dermatosis showing bilateral symmetrical lesions.

      The specific objective is to evaluate, by means of analytical propedeutics medical
      improvement in clinical signs and symptoms related to acne infected, the use of the
      association: Clotrimazole, Gentamicin and Beclomethasone versus association: Clotrimazole and
      Gentamicin, which will first be randomized.

      The study should be conducted with 20 research subjects aged over 18 years, of both sexes,
      showing the framework of bilateral lesions infected with acne, at any stage of evolution. The
      study subjects will receive treatment with both products, so they can use one in each lesion
      chosen at random, double-blind.

      Thus, the proven efficacy and safety and taking all possible adverse events reported, the
      study sponsor hopes to obtain registration with the Ministry of Health of this new
      association in the country.

      The association made a proposal was developed by the Laboratory Glenmark Pharmaceuticals
      Ltd..
