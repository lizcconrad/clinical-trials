      Based on our previous research, this study aims to determine reliable surgical stress
      response markers in patients undergoing radical resection of colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every surgical intervention represents a stress for patient's organism. During the operation,
      numerous changes in the patient's metabolism take place, that are termed surgical stress
      response. Leading cause of surgical stress response is tissue destruction that always
      accompanies operations. Surgical stress response is effected through activation of
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and through sympathetic activation.

      The consequences of surgical stress response are numerous. Surgical stress response is
      essential to uneventful postoperative recovery. On the other hand, excessive surgical stress
      response may lead to serious postoperative complications, such as heart and kidney failure,
      venous thrombosis, disruption of operative wound and wound infection.

      In prior studies the investigators have shown the kinetics of postoperative serum interleukin
      changes after radical resection of gastric cancer.

      This study aims at determining reliable markers of surgical stress response severity in
      patients undergoing radical resection of colorectal cancer.
