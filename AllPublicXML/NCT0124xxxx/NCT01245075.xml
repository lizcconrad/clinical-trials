  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of bilateral deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) of the Nucleus accumbens (NAc) as a novel treatment in severe opioid
      addiction. The included patients have been treated so far with a substitute in form of
      methadone.

      Our hypothesis is that bilateral DBS of the NAc will significantly reduce the craving for
      heroin and thus enable the patients to decrease their Levomethadone-dosage substantially.
