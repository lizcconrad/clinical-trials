      The primary objectives of this study were to characterize lactobacilli of human vaginal
      origin and to investigate if more extended antibiotic treatment against Bacterial Vaginosis,
      together with adjuvant lactobacilli treatment, could increase the cure rate and furthermore,
      to investigate factors that could influence relapse.

      Nine of the vaginal Lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy Swedish women and
      characterized in the present study were selected for the clinical trial.All women with
      symptomatic BV fulfilling the inclusion criteria were consecutively offered to participate in
      a prospective study of adjuvant lactobacilli given in addition to antibiotics. Women included
      were regularly menstruating women, 18 years or older, with normal gynaecological status, not
      pregnant or breast-feeding and without signs of other genital tract infections. Exclusion
      criteria were patients with hormonal intrauterine device without regular menstruation; women
      infected with Chlamydia trachomatis or with Trichomonas vaginalis, or with a clinical candida
      infection.
