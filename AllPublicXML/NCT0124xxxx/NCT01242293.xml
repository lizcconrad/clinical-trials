      The purpose of this study is to determine that maternal hydration during labor with fluids
      containing glucose at a rate of 125 ml per hour does not affect the duration of labor
      compared to Ringer Lactate at a rate of 250 ml per hour.

      During labor it is a common practice that the parturient is fastening and having fluid
      replacement through intravenous hydration (IVH), the rational being to avoid aspiration of
      gastric content in a situation of need for urgent intervention and general anesthesia with
      tracheal intubation. It is acceptable to infuse 125 ml per hour of a physiological solution
      that does not contain sugar, but the volume is not adjusted to the weight of mother, the
      level of effort or relaxation she is experiencing and it may well be below the required
      amount. From studies in the field of sport medicine it is clear that the amount of fluid
      reaching the muscle has an impact on the efficiency of the muscle at the level of tissue and
      the level of personal achievement in sports. Only few studies dealt with the amount and
      contents of IVH during labor that will be sufficient and meet all physiologic requirements of
      the parturient and her fetus.
