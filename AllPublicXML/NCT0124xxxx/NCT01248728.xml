  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids in autism.
      Autism, originally described by Kanner in 1943, is among the most severe of
      neurodevelopmental disorders. It is a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) affecting social
      and communicative functions and is also characterized by repetitive behaviors/restricted
      interests. It is also frequently accompanied by significant aggression, self-injury,
      irritability and hyperactivity, making care for these individuals an even greater challenge
      for families or institutional settings. Autism severely impacts the affected individual and
      family members, causing life-long functional impairment. In this protocol the investigators
      will use the terms &quot;autism&quot; and &quot;autism spectrum disorder (ASD)&quot; interchangeably to refer to
      Autistic disorder, Asperger Syndrome and PDD-Not Otherwise Specified (NOS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently risperidone is the only medication approved the by Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for this disorder, and specifically for irritability associated with autism, although
      not all patients with autism respond to risperidone. No pharmacologic treatments have been
      approved for use in preschool children, although it is clear that early intervention is
      associated with improved outcomes. Behavioral and educational therapies play a significant
      role in the management of autistic symptoms. The history of alternative treatments in autism
      is notable for the exaggerated benefit of a variety of supplements, such as high dose
      vitamins (e.g. B6, magnesium), and secretin. The current widespread use of
      alternative/nutritional supplements to patients with autism without scientifically
      demonstrated efficacy, underscores the necessity for scientifically sound studies to be
      conducted. Complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAM) are commonly employed by
      families of autistic children. Recent surveys have estimated the prevalence of such use to be
      between 30% and 95% (1,2,3). Omega-3 fatty acids were reported to be used in 28.7% of
      patients (1). However, only two small case series and a very small randomized study have been
      reported in this population to date. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acids in preschoolers with ASD.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Behavioral Inventory (PDDBI) - Autism Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDDBI measures autism symptomology. The autism composite score was used as the primary outcome measure for autism symptom severity.
PDDBI Autism Composite Scale Range:
Minimum Range = 10 (lower autism symptom severity) Maximum Range = 100 (higher autism symptom severity)
The Autism Composite is calculated from the sum of T-scores of the Sensory/Perceptual Approach Behaviours, Ritualisms/Resistance to Change, Social Pragmatic Problems, and Semantic/Pragmatic Problems domains subtracted by the sum of T-scores of the Social Approach Behaviours, and Expressive Language domain then converted into the Autism Composite as a T-score.
Mean change between baseline and week 24 is reported. A negative change indicates improvement</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Behaviour Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) - Externalizing Problems Composite</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BASC-2 externalizing problems composite measures hyperactivity and aggressive behaviours.
Primary Outcome domain: Externalizing Problems composite
Externalizing Problems Composite T-Score Range:
Minimum Range: 10 (lower externalizing problems) Maximum Range: 120 (higher externalizing problems)
The Externalizing Problems composite is computed from the sum of t-scores from the hyperactivity and aggression subscales then converted into the externalizing problems composite t-score.
Mean change between baseline and week 24 is reported. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Classified as Responders by the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a seven-point scale that provides a clinician rating of global improvement and as such is already inherently a measure of change. It requires the clinician to assess the degree to which the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state before the intervention.
Change is rated as:
0- Not assessed
Very Much Improved
Much Improved
Minimally Improved
No Change
Minimally Worse
Much Worse
Very Much Worse
Participants are classified as responders if their CGI-I score was 1 or 2 and non-responders for CGI-I scores of 3 to 7.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales (VABS) - Adaptive Functioning Composite</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VABS is a measure of adaptive behavior in daily settings. Secondary measure domain: The adaptive functioning composite describes an individuals overall functioning
Adaptive Behaviour Composite Standard Score Range:
Minimum range: 20 (low adaptive functioning) Maximum range: 160 (high adaptive functioning)
The adaptive behaviour composite standard score is computed from the sum of standard scores from the communication, daily living skills, socialization and motor skills domains and converted into the adaptive behavior composite standard score.
Change in the adaptive behaviour composite standard score from baseline to week 24 is reported. Positive change indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Preschool Language Scale (PLS-4) - Total Language</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PLS-4 is a language measure that provides a global assessment of a child's language functioning abilities, receptive and expressive language.
Secondary outcome measure domain: Total language standard score
Total Language Standard Score Range:
Minimum range: 50 (lower language abilities) Maximum range: 150 (higher language abilities)
The total language standard score is computed from a sum of the auditory comprehension and expressive communication standard scores, then converted into the total language standard score.
Change of total language standard scores from baseline to week 24 is reported. Positive change indicates improvement</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Behavioral Inventory (PDDBI) - Autism Composite Score</title>
        <description>The PDDBI measures autism symptomology. The autism composite score was used as the primary outcome measure for autism symptom severity.
PDDBI Autism Composite Scale Range:
Minimum Range = 10 (lower autism symptom severity) Maximum Range = 100 (higher autism symptom severity)
The Autism Composite is calculated from the sum of T-scores of the Sensory/Perceptual Approach Behaviours, Ritualisms/Resistance to Change, Social Pragmatic Problems, and Semantic/Pragmatic Problems domains subtracted by the sum of T-scores of the Social Approach Behaviours, and Expressive Language domain then converted into the Autism Composite as a T-score.
Mean change between baseline and week 24 is reported. A negative change indicates improvement</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Classified as Responders by the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I)</title>
        <description>The CGI-I is a seven-point scale that provides a clinician rating of global improvement and as such is already inherently a measure of change. It requires the clinician to assess the degree to which the participant's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state before the intervention.
Change is rated as:
0- Not assessed
Very Much Improved
Much Improved
Minimally Improved
No Change
Minimally Worse
Much Worse
Very Much Worse
Participants are classified as responders if their CGI-I score was 1 or 2 and non-responders for CGI-I scores of 3 to 7.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Preschool Language Scale (PLS-4) - Total Language</title>
        <description>The PLS-4 is a language measure that provides a global assessment of a child's language functioning abilities, receptive and expressive language.
Secondary outcome measure domain: Total language standard score
Total Language Standard Score Range:
Minimum range: 50 (lower language abilities) Maximum range: 150 (higher language abilities)
The total language standard score is computed from a sum of the auditory comprehension and expressive communication standard scores, then converted into the total language standard score.
Change of total language standard scores from baseline to week 24 is reported. Positive change indicates improvement</description>

            <description>Participants started at 0.75 g of EPA + DHA (1.875 ml once a day) of liquid formulation of NutraSea HP. If this was well tolerated, the dose was doubled to 1.5 g (3.5 ml) after 2 weeks, as per Health Canada guidelines for maximum dose for this age group. The NutraSea HP formulation is a naturally derived fish oil that is extracted, isolated, and processed to contain EPA/DHA in the ratio of 3:1. It has a lemon flavor.</description>

          <description>Children will be administered 3.75ml of the liquid formulation of NutraSea HP (containing 1.5 gr of EPA+DHA). The starting dose will be 1.875ml (0.75 gr of EPA+DHA) and the dose will be doubled on week 2. The parents may choose to give this as a single dose or split it to two doses if stomach upset occurs. This formulation is double distilled and has very little fishy taste, which will make it more palatable for children and will make creating a matching placebo a simpler process.
