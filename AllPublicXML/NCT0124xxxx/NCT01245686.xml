  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of
      death in the US. Every year, more than one million Americans have a heart attack, and nearly
      800,000 have a stroke. In 2010, heart disease alone is expected to cost the country more than
      $316 billion in health care and lost productivity.

      Both lifestyle changes and medication can reduce the risk of CVD, and this project combines
      these approaches in the hopes of identifying a practical intervention for use in primary care
      medical offices. The project combines two previously tested interventions and updates them to
      meet current guidelines for diet and use of aspirin and cholesterol-controlling drugs
      (statins).

      The research team is delivering the combined intervention in two formats: web-based and
      counselor-based. Each format has the same content, but the web-based advice is accessed
      through the Internet by clients at home, a community site, or a primary care office. The
      other format involves sessions delivered to clients by a counselor either in person at a
      primary care office or over the telephone. The researchers will compare how effective each
      format is in reducing participants' risk of coronary heart disease. They will also determine
      the interventions' effect on participants' diet, physical activity, smoking status,
      medication adherence, and other health indicators. In addition, the team will compare the two
      formats' cost-effectiveness and how well the patients, office staff, and clinicians accept
      the interventions.

      Recruited from five family practices, 600 patients representing the geographic and ethnic
      diversity of North Carolina are taking part in this study. Half the participants are randomly
      assigned to the web-based intervention; the other half to the counselor-based version. Both
      groups will also get information on local resources, such as gyms and farmers markets, that
      can help participants maintain a healthy lifestyle.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Predicted 10-year CHD risk</measure>
    <time_frame>4-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Framingham risk scores are well-validated and provide an absolute estimate of the likelihood of CHD events (MI, angina, and CHD death) over a 10-year time period.
We will examine absolute changes in this outcome in both intervention arms. We will also examine whether this outcome varies by subgroups of the following variables: baseline level of predicted CHD risk, age, race, SES, insurance status, overall health status, numeracy, literacy, # medications, # of perceived barriers to adherence, use of the intervention, time with the intervention, study practice site, and health counselor</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of and adherence to cardiovascular medicines</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Use of cardiovascular medicines will be by self-report. Adherence to cardiovascular medicines will be measured by the 8-Item Morisky scale and a single-item specifying overall percentage adherence to cardiovascular medicines(categorical).
Participants will additionally report use of and adherence to individual medicines, including aspirin, blood pressure medicine, and cholesterol medicine. Aspirin adherence will be validated by serum thromboxane b2 in a subsample of participants. Blood pressure and cholesterol medicine use will be confirmed by changes in blood pressure and cholesterol.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary intake will be measured through a combination of self-report and objective measures. Participants will self-report diet on two validated questionnaires: the block questionnaire (fruit and vegetable intake) and the fat quality screener. Fruit and vegetable intake will be objectively measured by serum carotenoids. Fat quality will be objectively measured using RBC membrane fatty acids.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured through a combination of self-report and objective measures. Participants will report physical activity on the validated modified RESIDE questionnaire. They will additionally wear a pedometer to monitor their daily total and aerobic steps.</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will monitor the following adverse events: ED visits (self-report), hospitalizations (self-report), deaths (family report confirmed by death registry), GI bleeds (self-report), hemorrhagic stroke (self-report), musculoskeletal injury (self-report), renal dysfunction (serum creatinine), and liver dysfunction (AST).</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of the Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>4 and 12 months</time_frame>

    <description>The Heart to Health Intervention combines and enhances two previously tested interventions to reduce CVD risk (a counselor-based intervention to improve lifestyle and a web-based intervention to improve medication adherence). The new lifestyle and medication adherence intervention (delivered alternately in a one-on-one counseling or web-format) includes a decision aid on heart disease risk and risk-reducing options, general education on lifestyle and medication adherence, tips for overcoming barriers to CHD risk reduction, and goal setting and specification of first steps.</description>
