    <textblock>
      The aim of this phase I/II trial is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of
      carfilzomib together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLD) with or without
      dexamethasone, and then to establish the efficacy and safety of this novel combination in
      patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
    </textblock>

      Phase I dose-escalation study. Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) on Days 1, 2,
      8, 9, 15, and 16 of Cycles 1-6, and on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 beginning on Cycle 7 until
      disease progression or relapse. Participants treated prior to approval of Amendment 1 will
      have carfilzomib administered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 during Cycles 1 and 2 and on
      Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 beginning on Cycle 3. PLD will be administered on Day 8 during Cycles
      1-6. Dexamethasone will be administered on the same schedule as carfilzomib (for patients
      treated in part 2 of phase 1 or phase 2). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Phase II will use the MTD from Phase I.
