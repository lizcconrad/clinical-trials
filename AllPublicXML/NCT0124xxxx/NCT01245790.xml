  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2 stage study to evaluate the amount of fostamatinib in the blood and urine in subjects
      with impaired kidney (renal) function compared with healthy volunteers with normal renal
      function. Stage 1 will include healthy subjects and subjects with end stage renal disease,
      while Stage, 2 may include subjects with mild, moderate and/or severe renal impairment
      dependent on the outcome of Stage 1. The study will also evaluate safety and tolerability in
      subjects with renal impairment.
