    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination
      with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer,
      comparing it to that of the conventional treatment with radiation and chemotherapy.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the health-related quality of life for the
      nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimen, compared to the
      standard chemoradiation regimen in the treatment of inoperable locally advanced esophageal
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a phase II, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, and two-arm study.
      The study will be conducted in Brazil and has the purpose of determining the activity and
      safety of nimotuzumab in terms of overall survival, TTP, clinical and endoscopic response
      rates, resectability rate, toxicity profile, and quality of life. All participating patients
      will sign a consent form before they undergo any study-related procedure. The eligible
      patients will have locally advanced esophageal cancer, and they will be randomized to one of
      two treatment groups. Randomization will be centrally coordinated by the sponsor and
      performed by means of the electronic CRF itself.
