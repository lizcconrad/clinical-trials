    <textblock>
      Onychomycosis is a fungal infection that affects fingernails and/or toenails.

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate if MOB015 is effective and safe for treatment of
      patients with fungal infection of the toenails.

          3. DSO of at least one of the great toe(s) affecting 25 % to 75 % of the target nail
             (verified by blinded assessor before randomization)

          4. Positive culture for dermatophytes (i.e. Trichophyton species; T. rubrum or T.
             mentagrophytes)

          3. &quot;Spike&quot; of onychomycosis extending to eponychium of the target nail

          4. Presence of dermatophytoma (defined as demarcated and localised thick masses of fungal
             hyphae and necrotic keratin between the nail plate and nail bed) on the target nail

          5. Other conditions than DSO known to cause abnormal nail appearance

          6. Topical antifungal treatment of the nails within 1 month before screening
