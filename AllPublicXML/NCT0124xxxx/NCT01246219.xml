  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research aims to provide data on gender-related psychological impact of GH (Growth
      Hormone)treatment. Implicit measurable psychological metrics of the therapy outcome on males
      are to be evaluated in a Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial. As a secondary axis of the
      study, the investigators aim to provide descriptive documentation of the unique distress
      signal manifestation implicitly shown by Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) boys and suggest
      methods of early detection and measurement of such manifestations that can be used to cement
      guidelines for the treatment in GH.

      Study Design:

      A prospective randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial design, comparing four
      research groups, with 4 repeated psychological measures (before treatment, after 3
      months,after 1 year, and at the end of treatment, after 4 years).

      The study will be divided into two segments:

      Segment 1:double blind, placebo controlled, will include the first 60 ISS (Idiopathic Short
      Stature)recruited patients. Patients in this segment will be randomized to one of the growth
      hormone treatment groups in a ratio of 2:1. 40 patients will be treated 4 years with GH and
      20 patients will be treated with placebo at the first year of the study and will have the
      option to start GH treatment after one year, for a duration of 3 years.

      Segment 2:after the enrollment to segment 1 will end, enrollment to segment 2 will
      begin.Participants in segment 2 (patients with ISS and short stature) will serve as control
      groups and therefore will not be treated with growth hormone. Patients in Segment 2 will be
      evaluated only once.

      The 4 repeated psychological evaluations (before treatment,after 3 months, after 1 year, and
      at the end of treatment, after 4 years)will include the following:

        1. Implicit Association Test

        2. Masculine Self Image

        3. Pictures Projective Test

        4. The Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale-a self report measure of explicit self- esteem

        5. Quality of Life Questionnaire

        6. Silhouette Apperception Technique (SAT)- a self report measure assessing children's and
           adolescent's perception of their own body size compared with that of their age-related
           peers

        7. Child Behavior Checklist
