  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the bone to skin depth for groups of lean, obese
      and morbidly obese patients. This information will be potentially helpful with implant design
      for obese and lean patients.

      This study will examine pelvic CT scans of injured patients to determine skin thickness in
      several distinct regions important in orthopedic surgery. All patients admitted to the
      University of Mississippi Medical Center with a pelvic ring injury or acetabular fracture
      obtain a pelvic CT scan as a standard part of patient evaluation. The CT scans attempt to
      encompass the entire soft tissue sleeve from the skin edge to the pelvic bones. Several
      landmarks described below have been described to measure important surgical sites where
      obesity is problematical. Therefore this study is an attempt to quantify the size of the soft
      tissue envelope in patients

      However, patients who are markedly obese may be too large for the entire soft tissue sleeve
      to be imaged with the CT scan. The second part of the study then is to validate the CT scan
      measurements obtained using clinical measurements. The clinical measurements will be obtained
      during operative management of displaced pelvic ring injuries and/or acetabular fractures.
      During surgical exposure, a measuring tape will be used to measure the soft tissue thickness
      in those areas corresponding to the CT scan measurements. These measures will be compared to
      validate the effectiveness of CT scan measurements to accurately document the soft tissue
      dimensions.
