  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine if methylphenidate can improve deficits in attention and
      symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, two common non-motor symptoms, in patients with
      Parkinson's Disease. This project also seeks to evaluate the effect of methylphenidate on
      postural control in these patients, a debilitating motor symptom that places patients at an
      increased risk of falling. This study will build on existing data to support a new indication
      for the use of methylphenidate in Parkinson's Disease. Using standard and objective
      evaluations, this study will quantify the effect of methylphenidate at two doses on attention
      levels, orthostatic hypotension, and measures of postural control. Phase I of the study will
      compare methylphenidate 10mg three times daily to placebo and Phase II of the study, for
      those tolerating the lower dose in Phase I, will compare methylphenidate 20mg three times
      daily to placebo. By incorporating two different doses, the study also seeks to determine if
      any improvements are dose-related. Secondary endpoints will include safety assessments
      (adverse event monitoring and vital signs) performed every 30 minutes following supervised
      drug administration. Visual analog scales will be presented to each participant before
      treatment and following the final dose of each treatment to assess changes in fatigue. A
      secondary task will be added to postural tests to assess the influence of cognitive
      processes. It is hypothesized that methylphenidate will demonstrate a significant beneficial
      effect on all outcomes. It is projected that objective improvements will be observed
      following treatment with methylphenidate at both doses (10 and 20mg three time daily) when
      compared to placebo. It is further hypothesized that the effects will be dose-related and
      therefore more profound with higher doses.

The orthostatic drop will be calculated by subtracting the blood pressures recorded at each time interval(1, 3, and 5 minutes after standing) from the blood pressure recorded in a lying position.</description>

Subjects will be required to memorize the string of digits in reverse and repeat them at the end of the trial. Errors will be quantified as either errors of insertion, deletion, or order.</description>
