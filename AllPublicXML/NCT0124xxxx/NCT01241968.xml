  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves have been proven in animal studies to induce local growth of new
      blood vessels from existing ones.

      The hypothesis of this study is that shockwave therapy could improve the symptoms of patients
      with refractory angina not amenable to revascularization with angioplasty or bypass surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves (1/10 the ones used in Lithotripsy) are delivered to myocardial
      ischemic tissue. Shockwaves are created by a special generator and are focused using a
      shockwave applicator device. The treatment is guided by standard echocardiography equipment.
      The shockwaves are delivered in synchronization with Patient R-wave to avoid arrhythmias. The
      treatment is painless.

      At first, the patient undergoes Stress-Echocardiography testing to identify the hypokinetic
      areas (ischemic areas). Following that, the ischemic areas sre treated with shockwaves.
      Several treatments are required for optimal results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is diagnosed with chronic stable angina pectoris. Diagnosis is based on
             medical history, complete physical evaluation.

          -  Patient has documented myocardial segments with reversible ischemia.

          -  Patient is classified in AP CCS of III-IV.

          -  Patient should be on a stable dosage of medication used to treat angina for at least 6
             weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patient demonstrates exercise tolerance capacity of no higher than 125 W on a modified
             Bruce treadmill exercise test until presence of clinical symptoms (i.e. angina,
             ST-depression).

          -  Patient demonstrates exercise tolerance time and stability averaging no more than 25%

             different between the two).

          -  Patient has documented epicardial coronary artery disease not amenable to angioplasty

          -  Patient has signed an IRB approved informed consent form.

          -  Patient's condition should be stable and should have a life expectancy of &gt;12 months.
             Patient's current and past medical condition and status will be assessed using
             previous medical history, physical evaluation, and the physicians (principle
             investigator's) medical opinion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is pregnant

          -  Patient has chronic lung disease including emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis.

             participated in any clinical trial involving an experimental device or drug, including
             other drugs or devices enhancing cardiac neovascularization, or any ESWT machine of a
             competitor company within 3 months of entry into the study.
