    <textblock>
      The objective of the antiretroviral treatment is to inhibit the viral replication,
      estimated(appreciated) by the measure of the viral plasmatic load(responsibility). In this
      inhibition of the viral replication usually joins an immune reconstruction [ 1 ].
      Nevertheless, a viro-immunological dissociation, i.e. an undetectable viral
      load(responsibility) and an absence of immune reconstruction, is regularly observed. It is
      now turned out that an undetectable viral load(responsibility) does not correspond to the
      total absence of viral replication and that it is possible to detect of the intracellular
      pro-viral DNA . Raltegravir ®, because of its mode of action(share) inhibiting the
      integration of the pro-viral DNA in the chromosomes of the infected cells(units) , could
      decrease the intracellular reservoir of monocyte-macrophages, improve the homeostasis, so
      optimizing the cooperation lymphocytes T - macrophages. Several experimental data suggest
      that the regression of the abnormalities of cellular interactions, and the rate of apoptose
      abnormally raised(abnormally brought up) by cells(units) T at the patients in
      viro-immunological dissociation, could be obtained .

      This study aims at measuring the impact of Raltegravir ® on the viral reservoirs lymphocyte
      and monocyte, to quantify the expression of the molecules of costimulation, the
      source(spring) of intercellular interactions lymphocytes - monocytes, and to measure the rate
      of apoptose of the cells(units) T.

    <description>To illustrate the cause and effect relationship between the abnormalities of the distribution(casting) of the molecules of co-activation and the rate of apoptose, we compare also 2 groups: a first group of patients with a rate of apoptose normal ( n=10 ), and another group of patients having a rate of apoptose aggravated ( n=10 ).
20 eligible patients will receive their treatment to J1 and will be estimated for the residual concentration of the raltegravir ®, the antiretroviral activity, the tolerance and the observance at the treatments of the study in the visits of evaluation of M1, M2, M3, M6, M12, and / or in case of premature stop(ruling) of the try(essay). Every visit will give rise to a clinical evaluation of the patient. The arisen of unwanted events</description>
