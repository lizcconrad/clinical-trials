    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend early initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy to cover typical
      and atypical bacteria that may cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Influenza antiviral
      therapy in patients with suspected or confirmed influenza. However, many clinicians do not
      suspect influenza among patients with CAP or other acute lower respiratory tract illness
      (LRTI) and often do not test for influenza. Additionally, results from currently available
      diagnostic tests for influenza may be delayed and several tests have low sensitivity and will
      give false negative results. Thus, anti-influenza treatment for patients with hospitalized
      influenza CAP and LRTI is frequently initiated late if at all. There is an association
      between delayed time to administration of empiric antibiotic therapy with increased clinical
      failure and mortality. As a result, empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with suspect CAP
      is begun within 4 - 6 hours of hospitalization. This has recently been demonstrated for
      delayed antiviral treatment as well. We hypothesize that, as happens with early empiric
      antibiotics for bacterial CAP, a standardized approach of adding early empiric anti-influenza
      therapy during the influenza season to hospitalized patients with suspect CAP and LRTI will
      improve clinical outcomes of patients with influenza associated CAP and LRTI.

      To test our hypothesis we plan a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial of
      hospitalized patients with acute LRTI, including suspect CAP, during . If early
      anti-influenza medications were not included on the patients admission orders, patients will
      be randomized to standard care, including empiric antibacterial therapy as recommended by
      ATS/IDSA guidelines plus standard influenza diagnostics and treatment (Standard of care)
      versus early initiation of empiric antiinfluenza therapy plus standard care, e.g. empiric
      antibacterial (oseltamivir group). The primary study outcome will be development of clinical
      failure and selected clinical outcomes during the 30 days after enrollment. Other clinical
      outcomes that will be compared between study groups include time to clinical stability,
      duration of hospitalization, development of cardiovascular events, re-hospitalization,
      short-term mortality (30 days), and long-term mortality (1 year). The secondary study outcome
      will be the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

    <textblock>
      This will be both a prospective, randomized, unblinded clinical study of hospitalized
      patients with acute LRTI admitted in one of four institutions in Louisville, KY (rapid
      empiric treatment with oseltamivir study[RETOS]) and a prospective observation study to
      describe influenza LRTI (Flu LRTI study). All hospitalized patients with acute LRTI will be
      invited to participate in one of the arms of study. If the admitting clinician does not order
      oseltamivir or zanamivir at the time of hospital admission, the patient is eligible for
      randomization into Group A (standard clinical care, including empiric antibiotics and
      anti-influenza drugs at the clinician discretion) or Group B (oseltamivir administered to the
      patient within 24 hours of admission, ideally within 8-12 hours of admission, plus empiric
      antibiotics).

      Patients will be enrolled from one of four hospitals, the University of Louisville Hospital,
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center of Louisville, Norton Hospital of Louisville, and Jewish
      Hospital of Louisville. Eligible patients will be identified primarily in the Emergency
      Departments of all four hospitals and evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria after
      hospital admission orders are written. Patients will be enrolled only during the influenza
      season. For this study, the influenza season is defined as December 1st until May 1st, unless
      surveillance data suggests that influenza viruses are circulating earlier or have stopped
      circulating.

      For all three study groups, diagnosis of influenza will be based on nucleic acid
      amplification through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). At the time of enrollment into the
      study, a nasopharyngeal swab will be obtained for PCR. The University of Louisville
      Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory has extensive experience using molecular techniques
      for the diagnosis of respiratory pathogens and will test batched specimens at monthly
      intervals. In addition, we will collect the results from tests done for routine care and
      bacterial or virus isolates identified during routine care for further characterization.

      The management of patients in Group A and Group B will be different only in regard to early
      empiric anti-influenza therapy. All other aspects of the management of these patients will be
      in compliance with national guideline recommendations from IDSA/ATS (2). Patients in Group A
      may have antiviral therapy started later in hospitalization or not treated at all. The study
      will not interfere with Group A patient care.

      A 1:1 randomization ratio within the two study arms is planned for EOS. A pre-defined
      randomization chart will be designed in order to have the randomization process
      Internet-based. The randomization table will be accessible by the project manager as a back
      up in the event that any problem occurs with the Internet or the computerized system.

      We will attempt to begin oseltamivir within 8 - 12 hours after hospital admission, and no
      later than 24 hours. The study nurse will facilitate receipt of early oseltamivir treatment
      for the consented patient in collaboration with the hospital pharmacies. The time of
      oseltamivir administration will be recorded for all enrolled patients.
