      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To determine if the intraoperative fluid administration with the Deltex CardioQ
           esophageal Doppler will reduce the length of stay after elective bowel resection.

        -  The probe can be used to dynamically measure stroke volume and cardiac output. This
           information will assist us in determining the ideal amount of fluids to be administered.

        -  To determine if the fluid administration established by the esophageal probe will result
           in a shorter length of stay in elective bowel resection patients.

        -  The investigators plan to enroll 100 patients in this study.

      Intraoperative goal-directed IV fluid administration utilizing an esophageal Doppler as a
      guide to measuring the amount of fluid by looking into the stroke volume to determine if
      there is too little or too much fluid. It has been shown that inadequate fluid administration
      is a cause of increased morbidity and length of stay after elective bowel resection. However,
      there are no data evaluating the Doppler's use in the postoperative period, only
      intraoperatively. Our objective is to evaluate whether postoperative goal-directed fluid
      management with the Deltex CardioQ esophageal Doppler probe leads to shorter hospital stay in
      elective bowel resection patients. All consecutive patients randomized into the 'standard
      fluid' group and the 'goal-directed fluid' group. All will follow standard surgical
      postoperative care with the exception of fluid administration. If eligible, all patients will
      receive an epidural catheter for pain control. The 'goal-directed fluid' group will have a
      Deltex CardioQ probe placed nasally in the operating room by the anesthesia team, and fluid
      management will be administered via anesthesia protocol. The 'standard fluid' group will not
      receive the Deltex CardioQ probe.Patients in the 'goal-directed fluid' group will receive
      fluids according to body weight for the first 24 hours. The probe will be evaluated every15
      minutes in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and measurements will be taken to determine whether
      fluids will be given to the patient.On the surgical floor, patients in the 'goal-directed
      fluid' group will be evaluated every 8 hours and fluids will be given if necessary according
      to measurements taken via the probe.

    <description>Patients in the 'goal-directed fluid' Lactated Ringers solution according to ideal body weight for the first 24 hours. The fluids will be changed after the first 24 hours and continued until the patient is tolerating a regular diet. The Deltex CardioQ esophageal probe will be evaluated every 15 minutes in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) by the Anesthesia service. Stroke Volume (SV), Flow Time Corrected (FTc), and Peak Velocity (PV) will be measured. A short FTc (&lt;330 ms) indicative of hypovolemia will receive a 3cc/kg fluid challenge with Lactated Ringers crystalloid solution over 5 minutes. A SV increase of &gt;10% will receive a further 3cc/kg fluid challenge. A SV increase of &lt;10% will not receive further fluid challenge.</description>

    <description>Patients in the 'standard fluid' group will receive Lactated Ringers solution for 24 hours post-operatively at 1 times maintenance rate according to ideal body weight. Then the fluids will be changed to physiologic maintenance with D5½NS at the same rate. Fluids will be decreased by ½ once the patient is tolerating a clear liquid diet, and then discontinued once the patient is tolerating a regular diet.</description>
