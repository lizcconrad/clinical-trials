  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Parkinson's Disease and the Atypical Parkinsonian Disorder (like Multiple System Atrophy,
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Corticobasal Degeneration, Lewy Body Dementia) are disease
      entities with partly common symptomatology. Especially very early in the course of disease,
      the differentiation between both disease entities can be challenging, even for specialists in
      the field of movement disorder. However, the establishment of a correct diagnosis is very
      important for adequate patientcounseling, treatment and the correct inclusion of patients in
      research trials. Ancillary diagnostic investigations are looked upon to aid in this
      diagnostic dilemma.

      Objective:

      To investigate the value of ancillary diagnostic investigations, more specific MRI, analysis
      of cerebrospinal fluids and a second opinion in a specialized movement disorder centre, to
      differentiate Parkinson's disease and the Atypical Parkisonisonian disorder.
