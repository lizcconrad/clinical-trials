  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies demonstrate that overweight in pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse
      pregnancy outcomes as fetal macrosomia, prolonged labor, low Apgar score, shoulder dystocia,
      nerve plexus injuries, increased proportion of instrumental deliveries and perineal ruptures.
      There is a 2.6 fold risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (fourfold in morbidly obese women)
      and a recent study has shown that fetuses of obese mothers develop insulin resistance in
      uterus.

      Main aims of this study are to assess if regular exercise in pregnancy among obese women can
      prevent or influence weight gain; impaired cardiac function in mother and fetus/newborn;
      impaired vascular function in mother; insulin resistance/sensitivity; body composition in
      mother and offspring; lumbopelvic pain; urinary and/or fecal incontinence; prolonged labor

      Women with a self-reported pre-pregnancy BMI of 28 or more will be eligible for our study.
      Woman are eligible if they are 18 years or older, with a singleton live fetus at an early
      (week 12-14) ultrasound scan. Exclusion criteria are pregnancy complications with high risk
      for preterm labour or diseases that could interfere with participation.

      Primary outcome measure is weight increase based on weight measured at 14 weeks and
      immediately before labour. Assessments are done at baseline at 14 (12-18) weeks of pregnancy,
      and again in week 38, as well as 3 months postpartum. Some measurements are also done at
      other points in time. The maternal secondary outcome measurements include fasting glucose,
      glucose tolerance assessed by 2-h, 75 mg per-oral glucose tolerance test, insulin resistance
      assessed by HOMA-IR, weight, height, body composition estimated by skinfold measurements in
      pregnancy and by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry postpartum, blood markers, lumbopelvic
      pain, urin- and fecal incontinence, quality of life, psychological wellbeing, depression, and
      diet.

    <description>Supervised exercise training at the hospital during pregnancy: the women will attend at least 2 weekly sessions consisting of aerobic exercise (walking on treadmills), strength training (for upper body, back, abdomen and legs) as well as pelvic floor muscle exercises. Each session is 60 minutes and lead by a physiotherapist or experienced exercise physiologist. The women will also go through motivational interviewing sessions throughout the intervention period and are encouraged to do home exercise training in addition to the exercise at the hospital</description>
