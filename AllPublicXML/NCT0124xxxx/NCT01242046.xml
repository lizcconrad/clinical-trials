  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The key research question in this study is whether or not caffeine facilitates genital sexual
      arousal in women in the presence of an external erotic stimulus. Caffeine's impact on the
      human sexual response cycle has yet to be studied in the field, so the goal is to determine
      if this substance will have any impact on genital arousal well as potentially identify the
      mechanisms underlying its ability to do so. Considering that this will be a single blind
      study, a key goal of the project is to determine how participant expectations regarding what
      they ingest will impact their subjective sexual arousal. At present, we hypothesize that, as
      caffeine's stimulant properties increase a human's heart rate and blood pressure, caffeine
      intake will facilitate genital arousal.
