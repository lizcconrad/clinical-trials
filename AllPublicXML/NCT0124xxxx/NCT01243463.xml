    <textblock>
      More often than not, obesity occurs in tandem with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), and each
      disease effectively perpetuates severity of the other. Surgical weight loss (i.e. bariatric
      surgery), and nocturnal, positive airway pressure therapy (PAP) are used to treat the two
      conditions separately, and these treatment modalities both present a unique set of challenges
      in terms of patient-adherence. Furthermore, the combined effects of these therapies on body
      weight and OSA severity are unclear, and require longitudinal investigation. The purpose of
      the research proposed herein is twofold: A) To prospectively demonstrate the specific
      physiologic/psychological improvements in OSA risk factors and disease severity that occur in
      a subset of bariatric surgery patients with OSA, who are being effectively treated with PAP
      and furthermore; B) To elucidate differences in postoperative outcomes (weight-loss,
      dyslipidemia, OSA severity, comorbidity resolution) between patients who are compliant or
      non-compliant with prescribed PAP therapy. The investigators anticipate that results will be
      used to develop and streamline approaches to improve pulmonary/sleep-related outcomes in
      bariatric surgery patients. Furthermore, this line of research has many implications for
      strategies to strengthen the coordination of care between bariatric surgery, pulmonology, and
      other clinical sub-specialties that are integral to the postoperative health of these
      patients.
