    <textblock>
      Obesity in children,as in adults,has rapidly become a public health concern. Studies in
      adults have shown that obesity, now considered to be a disease state, is a modifier of the
      effect of drugs on the body as well as how the body handles the drug.The anesthetic
      management of obese children poses a variety of significant challenges which include
      determination of the appropriate dose of anesthetic intravenous agents. Dosing of most drugs
      is calculated based on the effective dose in 50% of patients but the more practical and
      required information is the effective dose in 95%(ED95%)of patients. The aim of this study is
      to determine the effective dose in 95% of patients(children). The hypothesis is the ED95 of
      propofol in obese children will be higher than that of non-obese children.
