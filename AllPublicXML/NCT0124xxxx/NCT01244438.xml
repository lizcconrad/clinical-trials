  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, non-randomized, single arm study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of FP-1039 given by weekly intravenous (IV) administrations in advanced
      endometrial cancer patients with FGFR2-specific mutations. FP-1039 will be dosed weekly
      starting at a dose of up to 16 mg/kg.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FP-1039 will be administered intravenously over 30 minutes once a week. All enrolled subjects
      will be monitored for the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with no evidence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity after 4 doses of FP-1039 may continue to receive
      weekly treatment provided there continues to be no evidence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Dosing will be discontinued if a subject has evidence of disease
      progression. Disease will be assessed approximately every 2 months.

  <why_stopped>
    Study FP1039-002 was not feasible. The original assumption was at least 5% of patients screened
    would qualify, but after screening 70 patients, none qualified.

        Inclusion criteria for study participation:

          1. Evidence of histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally advanced
             unresectable endometrial cancer bearing either the S252W or the P243R FGFR2 mutation.

          2. Female at least 18 years of age

          3. Performance status ≤ 1 on the ECOG Performance Status Scale

          4. Adequate cardiac function e.g., NYHA Class I or II

          5. Estimated life expectancy of at least 16 weeks

          6. Measurable or evaluable disease by physical or radiologic examination

          7. Must have recovered from the adverse effects of prior therapy at the time of
             enrollment to ≤ Grade 1 (excluding alopecia)

          8. Meets laboratory criteria as specified per protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria for study participation:

          1. Prior treatment with an inhibitor of the FGF/FGFR pathway

          2. Prior treatment with any of the following:

               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic agents) or biologic
                  agents (antibodies, immune modulators, cytokines) within 4 weeks, or nitrosoureas
                  or mitomycin C within 6 weeks prior to the scheduled first dose of FP-1039

               -  A small-molecule kinase inhibitor (including investigational small-molecule
                  kinase inhibitors) within 14 days (or 5 half lives of the drug or active
                  metabolites) of the scheduled first dose of FP-1039

               -  Any other investigational therapy within 28 days of the first scheduled dose of
                  FP-1039 Note: Any eligibility questions related to prior therapies including the
                  timing from prior therapies should be discussed and a decision agreed on by the
                  Investigator and the Sponsor in writing prior to the subject entering the study

          3. Known hypersensitivity to the components of FP-1039

          5. PT/INR and/or PTT test results at screening that are above 1.3 x the laboratory ULN.

          6. No exclusionary medical history as described per the protocol.

          7. Presence of any of the following conditions:

               -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulcer disease,
                  or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to study enrollment

               -  Other potential risk factors for gastrointestinal perforation (i.e., acute
                  diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, gastrointestinal obstruction)

          8. History of organ, bone marrow, or stem cell transplantation

          9. Pregnant or breast feeding

         10. Clinically apparent CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis Note: Subjects with CNS
             metastases who have completed a course of radiotherapy and who have been on a stable
             dose of glucocorticoids for at least 4 weeks are eligible.

         11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to an active infection,
             hypertension, psychiatric, or substance abuse disorders that would preclude consent,
             limit compliance with study requirements, or confound safety interpretation.

         12. Unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with the
             Investigator or designee
