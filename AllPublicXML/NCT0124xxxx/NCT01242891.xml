      The main purpose of this protocol is to provide a mechanism for continued access for patients
      that would have been enrolled into the primary cohorts of the IDE study.

      The data collection and protocols for this study remain consistent with the main IDE study
      for the EXCOR® Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device. This protocol was closed at the same time
      as the main IDE study due to FDA approval (December 16, 2011).
