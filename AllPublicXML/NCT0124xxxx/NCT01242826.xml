    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the
      pharmacokinetic properties (the rate at which the trial drug is eliminated from the body)
      after a single subcutaneous (under the skin) injection of biphasic insulin aspart 50 (BIAsp
      50). In addition, the safety and tolerability of BIAsp 50 will be observed
