  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The experimental drug IPdR is broken down in the body to IdUrd, which has been given to
      patients to find out if it can improve radiation therapy. IdUrd has to be given through a
      vein; therefore this new drug (IPdR) has been made which can be taken by mouth. Researchers
      are interested in determining whether IPdR should also be studied to find out if it can
      improve radiation therapy. The current study is to find out if people absorb the drug given
      by mouth.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the levels of drug and its breakdown products in the blood following a single
      dose of IPdR by mouth. .

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with cancer (solid tumors or
      lymphomas) that have not responded to standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  This study involves an initial dosing visit, one day of admission to the hospital for
           blood work, and a follow-up visit 14 days later.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well
           as blood and urine samples.

        -  Participants will receive a single dose of IPdR, and will provide multiple blood and
           urine samples for 24 hours after administration of the drug.

        -  Fourteen days after receiving IPdR, participants will have another physical examination
           and additional blood and urine tests to evaluate how IPdR has been broken down by the
           body.

        -  Cancer treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.

      Background:

        -  The nucleoside analog iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd, NSC 39661) has shown promising activity
           as a radiosensitizer in preclinical models and has been evaluated in Phase I/II clinical
           trials. The extent of radiosensitization is directly related to the incorporation of
           IdUrd into tumor DNA as a replacement for thymidine.

        -  IPdR (NSC 726188) is an orally administered prodrug of IdUrd with a better therapeutic
           index in preclinical models.

        -  This first in human study of IPdR will evaluate whether IPdR is absorbed and what plasma
           levels of IPdR and its major metabolite, IdUrd, are achieved after a single oral dose.

      Objectives:

        -  Measure plasma concentrations of IPdR, IdUrd, and IdUrd metabolites after a single oral
           dose of IPdR

        -  Determine the safety of administering a single oral dose of IPdR.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have histologically confirmed
      solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies refractory to at least one line of standard treatment
      or for which no standard therapy is available. Patients should have adequate organ function
      and no disease-associated symptoms requiring immediate therapy or intervention.

      Study Design:

        -  Patients will receive a single oral dose of IPdR on day 1.

        -  The initial IPdR dose will be 150 mg; dose escalation will be in 100% increments to a
           maximum of 2400 mg. One patient will be accrued to each dose level until we reach the
           highest dose level. Six patients will be accrued at dose level 5 (2400 mg).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have histologically documented (confirmed at the Laboratory of
             Pathology, NCI) solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies that are refractory to at least
             one line of standard treatment or for which no standard therapy is available. Patients
             with lymphoid malignancies may be enrolled if they have disease for which standard
             therapy is currently not indicated. Patients should not have disease-associated
             symptoms requiring immediate therapy or intervention.

          -  Any prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy must have been completed greater than or
             equal to 2 weeks prior to enrollment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), and
             the patient must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Patients under 18 years of age are excluded
             because of their inability as a protected population to give appropriate consent to
             this non-therapeutic study.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to
             60%).

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/microL

               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL

               -  total bilirubin less than 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3.0 times ULN

               -  creatinine less than 1.5 times ULN

        OR:

        --creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min for patients with creatinine
        levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times ULN

          -  IPdR is a nucleoside analog and therefore potentially teratogenic. Women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for 30 days
             after study drug administration. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to IPdR administration to the mother,
             nursing mothers should not receive IPdR.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, GI conditions limiting absorption, serious skin conditions, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing.

        INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:

        -Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
