  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have this kind of cancer are often treated with several drugs. Carboplatin is
      one that seems to work for many treatment cycles. Even though it may work against the cancer,
      the patient can become allergic to it. If that happens, they would have to stop taking the
      drug. The standard way to give carboplatin is by vein over 30 minutes. The purpose of this
      study is to:

      Find out if giving carboplatin over three hours can prevent the allergy. See if medicine
      given before the carboplatin can help reduce the risk of allergic reactions.

      Some patients have been given carboplatin over 3 hours instead of 30 minutes. They had fewer
      allergies than we expected. We do not know if this was because of the way they got
      carboplatin or because of something else.
