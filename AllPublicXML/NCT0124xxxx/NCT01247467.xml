  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of prognostic and/or predictive genomic signatures for breast cancer have been
      developed by Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). In the past 1 year, GIS has developed
      protocols and methods to conduct expression assays from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
      (FFPE) tumor specimens. A study on 800 tumor samples is planned to analyze these gene
      signatures and compare them with conventional clinical prognosticators and predictors. As the
      investigators plan to use archival tumor samples that dates back to the 1990s, the aim of
      this pilot study is to first analyze 10 anonymized samples to determine the feasibility of
      running these assays on old archival blocks. The information generated will help us determine
      whether very old samples (diagnosed before 2000) may be selected for the actual study.

      Up to 10 archival breast tumor blocks will be obtained from the Department of Pathology, NUH
      - half of these blocks will be from patients who were diagnosed before year 2000, and the
      other half of the blocks will be from patients diagnosed between year 2000-2005 (control
      specimens). Basic tumor and patient information will be collected without patient identifiers
      - grade, stage, ER/PR/HER2 status, treatment received, outcome data. 8-10 ten-micron sections
      will be cut from each tumor block. RNA will be extracted from the tumor sections using the
      Roche High Pure FFPE RNA Micro Kit. RNA will be profiled using the Illumina Veracode assay
      and the Affymetrix Quantigene assay. RNA extraction and gene expression profiling will be
      performed by collabroators at the Genome Institute of Singapore.
