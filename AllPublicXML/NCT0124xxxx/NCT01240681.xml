    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to determine the effectiveness of Fluorothymidine
      Positron Emission Tomography (FLT PET) and Blood Oxygen Level Dependent Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (BOLD MRI) in assessing tumour response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NA CT) in women
      with locally advanced breast cancer.

    <measure>Clinical response (partial and complete)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (approximately)</time_frame>
    <description>Partial clinical response refers to at least a 50% reduction in the dimensions of the tumour mass and a complete clinical response refers to complete absence of the mass on physical exam, as well as absence of inflammation, ulceration and peau d'orange.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pathologic response</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (approximately)</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) index the pathologic response will be divided into categories. The three categories are complete response, near complete response and chemotherapy resistance. A complete pathologic response (pCR) refers to complete absence of invasive cancer.</description>

    <description>Eligible consenting patients with LABC receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NA CT) will undergo FLT PET, BOLD MRI, and clinical examination of the involved breast including ipsilateral axillary and supraclavicular nodes to assess the treatment response to chemotherapy (CT). The imaging studies will be performed at baseline and after the first cycle of NA CT.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic proof of breast cancer (invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma). Breast
             sarcoma and lymphoma are not eligible.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer (Stage IIB (T3,N0,M0), Stage
             IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC, according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
             Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) Cancer Staging), including inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  Ability to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease (identified on chest x-ray, liver ultrasound, bone scan
             or other imaging tests);

          -  Previous chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for breast cancer;

          -  Significant concurrent medical problems that result in the patient being unfit for
             surgery (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, active cardiac disease, severe chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease);

          -  Known pregnancy or lactating female (e.g. positive serum beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (B-hCG) pregnancy test);

          -  Inability to lie supine for imaging with Positron Emission Tomography (PET);

          -  Any contraindication to undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or PET;

          -  Currently receiving Antabuse;

          -  Inability to provide informed consent (e.g. dementia or severe cognitive impairment).
