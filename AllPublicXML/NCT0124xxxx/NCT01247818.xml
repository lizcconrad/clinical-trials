  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PH-10 is an aqueous hydrogel formulation of rose bengal disodium (RB) for topical
      administration to the skin, and is being studied for the treatment of cutaneous skin
      disorders, specifically psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. This multicenter phase 2 study of
      subjects randomized sequentially by center to one of four treatment cohorts will assess
      efficacy and safety of topical PH-10 applied once daily to areas of mild to moderate plaque
      psoriasis.

          -  Subjects who have received psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy or systemic
             antipsoriatic therapy (immunosuppressants, cytostatics, corticosteroids) within 28
             days of study initiation (two weeks for methotrexate).

             initiation.

          -  Subjects who have received topical antipsoriatic therapy (including corticosteroids,
             tar, anthralin or Vitamin D analogs) to the study plaque areas within 14 days of study
             initiation.

          -  Subjects who have received agents posing a clinically significant risk of
             photosensitivity reaction within 5 half-lives of study initiation.

          -  Subjects who have received any approved or investigational biologic drug therapy for
             psoriasis within 90 days or 5 half-lives of study initiation.
