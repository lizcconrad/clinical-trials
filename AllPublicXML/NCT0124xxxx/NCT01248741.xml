  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High Dose Rate (HDR) temporary prostate brachytherapy offers a precise form of dose
      escalation for prostate cancer. Needles are placed, the position is confirmed and treatment
      is delivered. Previously High Dose Rate prostate brachytherapy was performed under
      TransRectal UltraSound (TRUS) guidance but planned with Computed Tomography (CT) imaging
      which introduced a source of error through needle displacement while transporting and
      repositioning patient. Recently Varian has introduced a one-step procedure where both implant
      and planning are based on UltraSound imaging and performed without patient repositioning.
      This planning system is approved by Health Canada and is commercially available.

      This study will use High Dose Rate brachytherapy to treat 15 men. Treatment will be planned
      with TransRectal UltraSound but validated pre-treatment using Computed Tomography imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen men with intermediate risk prostate cancer, suitable for the combination of external
      beam radiotherapy and High Dose Rate brachytherapy will be entered in this study. High Dose
      Rate brachytherapy will be performed using TransRectal UltraSound guidance and then planned
      using both cone-beam Computed Tomography and TransRectal UltraSound. Planning by Computed
      Tomography is to check the reliability and reproducibility of UltraSound imaging to correctly
      identify the needle positions. Correct needle localization is essential because this is the
      basis for determining source dwell positions, dose calculation and dose optimization.
