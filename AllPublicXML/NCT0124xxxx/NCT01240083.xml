  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as well as Theta- Burst Stimulation of
      the frontal cortex are used to modulate the neuronal excitability in patients with
      depression. In the proposed study we investigate whether high frequent rTMS or Theta-Burst
      Stimulation of the DLPFC is more effective in patients with a depressive episode.

    <textblock>
      Depression is a common mental disorder that presents with depressed mood, loss of interest,
      feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor
      concentration. These problems can become chronic or recurrent and lead to substantial
      impairments in an individual's ability to take care of his or her everyday responsibilities,
      at its worst, depression can lead to suicide.Depression can be reliably diagnosed in primary
      care. Antidepressant medications and brief, structured forms of psychotherapy are effective
      for 60-80 % of those affected and can be delivered in primary care.

      In patients with depression the cerebral metabolism is deranged in some specific areas such
      as hypoexcitability in frontal cortical areas. High-frequency rTMS of the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been investigated for the treatment of hypoexcitability
      disorders. Pilot data indicate that the mild effects of the rTMS could be increased by a
      special kind of TMS, the Theta-burst stimulation. In the proposed study we investigate
      whether high frequent rTMS or Theta-Burst Stimulation of the DLPFC is more effective in
      patients with a depressive episode.
