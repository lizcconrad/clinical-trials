  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last ten years there have been significant developments in CLL treatment. The advent
      of fludarabine, rituximab and the association of chemo-immunotherapy have substantially
      increased overall response rate, CR rate, time to progression and may also have an impact on
      overall survival.

      Even though, CLL remains incurable and all patients eventually relapse and progressively
      become resistant to treatment. The development of an effective therapy that is not
      cross-resistant with the ones currently available as front-line treatment, is one of the
      clinical unmet needs within CLL.

      BendOfa is a non comparative phase II trial designed to determine the therapeutic benefit of
      bendamustine given together to ofatumumab in relapsed or resistant patients with CLL.

      Bendamustine is approved by FDA for CLL treatment, it is an hybrid drug with alkylating
      agents and purine analogue properties that may lack of cross resistance with fludarabine. It
      was utilized in CLL as a single agent and its association with rituximab is currently under
      clinical investigation.

      Ofatumumab is a new fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with high in vitro efficacy on
      CD20 low-expressing CLL cells. An early report showed that ofatumumab in single therapy is
      effective in highly pre-treated refractory CLL patients.

      Both drugs were generally well tolerated without unexpected untoward toxicity. On the basis
      of these data, bendamustine and ofatumumab could be a new effective and well tolerated
      combination for patients with relapsed and refractory CLL.

        Understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child and the need for effective
        contraception;

        Be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures.

        Be informed and understand the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to notify

        following a negative pregnancy test.

        Understand the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the frequency
        outlined in this protocol.

        Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two
        reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from

        FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests prior to starting study drug.

        FCBP must agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4
        weeks after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal
        sterilization. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who
        practice complete and continued abstinence.

        Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at
        least 28 days after study drug discontinuation.

        - Male patients must:

        Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant
        female or a female of childbearing potential.

        a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study,
