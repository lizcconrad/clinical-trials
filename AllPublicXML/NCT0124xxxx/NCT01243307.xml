  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of CT327 to placebo against
      experimental induced superficial, deep and hyperalgesic pain.

      The secondary objectives are to elucidate the mechanisms of CT327 using experimental pain
      models.
