      The present study is designed to test the feasibility and efficacy of a stand alone self help
      program for decreasing stress and anxiety and enhancing quality of life. The intervention
      will be offered in the form of a self help book and three handouts with no in-person
      instructor time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress is a ubiquitous problem and a mediator of symptoms for a variety of medical
      conditions. Most medical diagnoses, procedures, and physician visits are associated with
      considerable stress. Excessive stress is associated with adverse medical outcomes, unhealthy
      coping mechanisms, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and overall a poor quality of life. No
      specific pharmacologic treatment is available for treating stress. Further, it is often
      difficult or sometimes impossible to change the reality of circumstances causing stress in an
      individual. Thus increasing individual coping mechanisms and ability of a person to handle
      stress, rather than changing the stressors itself might be a more feasible approach towards
      reducing stress.

      Several interventions are available to decrease stress. Majority of these programs entail
      extensive in-person training which impacts on widespread dissemination of the program. We are
      interested in applying an innovative approach toward stress management by testing the
      efficacy of a stand alone self help program offered in the form of a book with no in-person
      instructor time. Participants will receive a copy of the book, &quot;Train Your Brain Engage Your
      Heart Transform Your Life&quot; along with three handouts summarizing the contents of the book.
      This book describes the program of Attention and Interpretation therapy that is designed to
      help decrease stress and anxiety and has been developed at Mayo Clinic Rochester.
