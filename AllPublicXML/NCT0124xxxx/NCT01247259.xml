  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, interest has increased in sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for treating allergic
      rhinitis. It is often suggested that polysensitized patients might not benefit from specific
      immunotherapy as much as monosensitized patients, although further research on this subject
      is needed. This study compared the efficacy of SLIT with standardized house dust mite extract
      in mono- and polysensitized allergic rhinitis patients.

      Patients who were sensitized to house dust mites and treated with SLIT for house dust mites
      for at least 1 year between November 2007 and March 2010 were included. The mono-allergen
      sensitized group (Mgr) was defined as the patients who were sensitized to Dermatophagoides
      pteronyssinus (Dp) or D. farinae (Df; n = 70). The poly-allergen sensitized group (Pgr) was
      defined as the patients who were simultaneously sensitized to house dust mites and other
      allergens (n = 64). A standardized extract of house dust mites was used for immunotherapy.
      Anti-allergic medication and the total nasal symptom score (TNSS), including rhinorrhea,
      sneezing, nasal obstruction, and itchy nose, were evaluated before and 1 year after SLIT.

      This study enrolled 134 patients. The TNSS improved significantly after SLIT in both groups,
      while the change in the TNSS did not differ significantly between the groups. The
      anti-allergic medication scores also decreased significantly in both groups, but there was no
      significant difference between the groups.

      In polysensitized allergic rhinitis patients, SLIT for Dp/Df gave comparable improvements in
      both nasal symptoms and rescue medication scores to those in monosensitized patients,
      regardless of other positive allergens. SLIT for Dp/Df might be considered in polysensitized
      allergic rhinitis patients.

    <description>During a 4-week increasing-dose phase, the patients increased the daily dose from 1 to 5 drops of 1.6 STU/mL solution from day 1 to 10, 1 to 5 drops of 8 STU/mL solution from day 11 to 15, 1 to 5 drops of 40 STU/mL solution from day 16 to 20, 1 to 5 drops of 200 STU/mL solution from day 21 to 25, and 1 to 5 drops of 1000 STU/mL solution from day 26 to 30. After reaching the maintenance dose, 5 drops of 1000 STU/mL solution, the patients took the allergen three times per week during the maintenance phase.</description>
