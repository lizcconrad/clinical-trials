  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of treatment of chronic hepatitis B is determined by viral and host interaction,
      thus the combination therapy of immunomodulator (PEG-IFN) and potent antiviral drug
      (entecavir) should improve the response rate. In addition, the simultaneous assessment of
      viral and host genetic factors associated with SVR may help to identify predictors of
      treatment outcomes, which will in turn significant reduce the cost/effect of therapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women 18 to 65 years of age

          -  Patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B

          -  Positive for HBsAg for at least 6 months, negative for anti-HBs and HBeAg

          -  Serum HBV DNA levels â‰¥ 2,000 IU/mL at screening

          -  Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels [greater than the upper limit of
             normal (ULN) and less than 10xULN}

          -  No signs or symptoms of advanced liver disease

          -  Patient has had a liver biopsy within 1 year of screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient had previous treatment with IFN, peg-IFN, and/or entecavir

          -  Patient has evidence or history of chronic hepatitis not caused by HBV, including but
             not limited to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), drug-induced hepatitis, and
             autoimmune hepatitis

          -  Patient has co-infection with hepatitis C virus and/or human immunodeficiency virus

          -  Patients with liver cancer

          -  Female patient is pregnant, lactating, expecting to conceive or donate eggs, or is of
             childbearing potential throughout treatment.

          -  Patient has any other condition that is contraindicated for treatment with PEG-IFN or
             entecavir

          -  Patient has any condition or pre-study laboratory abnormality, or history of any
             illness, which in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the
             study or pose additional risk in administering the study drug
