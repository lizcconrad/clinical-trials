  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 88 children between 2 and 9 years of age will be randomized to receive a two dose
      schedule of either licensed live attenuated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (LAIV) or
      licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV)or TIV followed by LAIV or LAIV followed
      by TIV separated by 28 days. Children with a laboratory documented history of prior H1N1
      infection will be excluded.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, prospective, open-label evaluation of the
      clinical tolerability, vaccine virus shedding, and serum and mucosal antibody response to
      vaccination with either live trivalent influenza vaccine (LAIV) or trivalent influenza
      vaccine (TIV) in healthy children between the ages of 2 and 9 years. Children will be
      screened for antibody to A/Brisbane/57/07 (H1N1) and A/California/07/09 (H1N1),
      A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 before and at indicated times after the start
      of the study. They will not be randomized based on antibody levels. Children with prior
      documented infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus will be excluded. Vaccine will be
      administered on days 0 and 28.

      Safety of vaccination will be assessed using symptoms collected by parents for 7 days after
      each dose of vaccine. Serum will be obtained prior to and on day 28 following each dose of
      vaccine and assessed for antibody by HAI, ELISA, and neutralization techniques. Nasal
      secretions will be obtained by nasal wick prior to and on day 28 after each dose and assessed
      for HA-specific IgA (immune globulin A) and IgG (immune globulin G)antibody by ELISA. Nasal
      swabs will be obtained on days 2, 4, and 7 after each dose of live vaccine and assessed for
      the presence and magnitude of vaccine virus shedding of the live attenuated vaccine by
      rtRT-PCR (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction)and TCID50 (50% tissue
      culture infectious doses)on MDCK(Madin Darby Canine Kidney) cells.

    <description>Nasal washes were collected on days 2, 4 and 7 after vaccination. Nasal swab specimens were tested for the presence of vaccine viruses by quantitative viral culture in MDCK cells at 33º C and by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) amplification. The limit of detection of vaccine viruses was 10^0.6 tissue culture infectious doses (50%)/ml for virus culture and 10^0.4 tissue culture infectious doses (50%)/ml for qRT-PCR.</description>

             temperature &lt;100.0ºF (fahrenheit); medical history; and targeted physical examination,
             when necessary, based on medical history. Stable medical condition is defined as: no
             recent increase in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the
             last 3 months and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within
             acceptable limits in the last 6 months.

          -  The subject/parents are able to understand and comply with the planned study
             procedures, including being available for all study visits.

          -  The subject/parents have provided informed consent prior to any study procedures. (An
             assent will be obtained for all children as required by the institutional IRB
             (Institutional Review Board.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a laboratory documented history of previous novel H1N1 infection.

          -  History of egg allergy or allergy to other components of vaccine.

          -  History of wheezing.

          -  The subject has an active neoplastic disease.

          -  The subject has long-term (greater than 2 weeks) use of oral or parenteral steroids,
             or high-dose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 mg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or
             equivalent) within the preceding 6 months (nasal and topical steroids are allowed).

          -  The subject received immunoglobulin or another blood product within the 3 months prior

          -  The subject has an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would interfere with the evaluation
             of responses. These conditions include chronic conditions recognized as risk factors
             for influenza complications or as contraindications for live vaccination, including
             chronic cardiac (exclusive of hypertension) or pulmonary conditions (including
             asthma), diabetes mellitus, or renal impairment.

          -  The subject has an acute illness or an oral temperature greater than 99.9 degreesF
             (37.7 degrees C) within 3 days prior to enrollment or vaccination. Subjects who had an
             acute illness that was treated symptoms resolved are eligible to enroll as long as
             treatment is completed and symptoms resolve &gt; 3 days prior to enrollment.

          -  The subject is currently participating or plans to participate in a study that
             involves an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or
             medication) or has received an experimental agent within 1 month prior to enrollment
             in this study, or expects to receive another experimental agent during participation
             in this study, or intends to donate blood during the study period.

          -  The subject has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator,
             place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury or render the subject unable to
             meet the requirements of the protocol.

          -  The subject has a known human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C
             infection.

          -  The subject has a previous history of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of
             receipt of influenza vaccination.

          -  The subject has any condition that the principal investigator (PI) believes may
             interfere with successful completion of the study.
