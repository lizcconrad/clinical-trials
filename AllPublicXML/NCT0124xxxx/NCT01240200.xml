  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that high blood sugar (glucose) levels are associated with
      diseases caused by the diabetes. Controlling the glucose may prevent these complications. As
      people age, their bodies become unable to make enough insulin to control the blood sugars.
      Pills used to treat diabetes may help for a while, but many times this does not last. When
      the blood sugar is too high, insulin is frequently recommended and used to treat diabetes.
      Insulin is often started by adding a long-acting insulin to the medicines a patient already
      takes. In this study, glargine insulin will be taken together with the diabetes pills
      currently being used. Glargine is a long-acting insulin which is given under the skin once a
      day. Glargine is approved for use in the treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA (Food
      and Drug Administration).

      Currently, insulin delivery is only available as a shot. The purpose of this study is to
      compare how satisfied patients are when using two different types of insulin shots.
      Specifically, this study aims to determine if people over 65 years old are more satisfied
      taking insulin shots by pens or syringes. Everyone who joins in this study will have a chance
      to use the insulin syringes and the insulin pens.

      The ability of patients to give themselves shots can affect how well the sugar is controlled.
      As people age, medical and other problems may develop that affect their ability to do certain
      things. Another aim of this study is to determine if the ability to use an insulin pen and
      insulin syringe is affected by age or some other problem.

      During this 25 week long study, patients will be treated with insulin given by a syringe for
      12 weeks and by a pen for 12 weeks. Questionnaires will be given to determine satisfaction
      with treatment throughout the study. The investigators hypothesize that among elderly
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus failing oral agent therapy, treatment with basal
      insulin via a pen device results in higher treatment satisfaction scores and more accurate
      dosing than treatment with basal insulin via conventional vial/syringe methods.

      A total of 56 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be recruited into this study. The site for
      the study is Grady Memorial Hospital clinics.

    <description>The treatment satisfaction scores were obtained from the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Status (DTSQs). The questionnaire contains eight items scored on a seven-point scale (0-6). DTSQs scores range from, e.g, 6 = very satisfied to 0 = very dissatisfied. The total satisfaction score when using the DTSQs ranges from 0 to 36; and the total score is obtained from summed scores from questions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. This outcome measure is assessed after the first intervention (at 12 weeks into the study).</description>

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction Based on Patient Survey</title>
        <description>The primary outcome of the study is to determine differences in treatment satisfaction scores in elderly patients with diabetes treated with basal insulin delivered via a pen device versus a syringe.</description>

      <outcome>
        <type>Primary</type>
        <title>Treatment Satisfaction</title>
        <description>The treatment satisfaction scores were obtained from the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire: Status (DTSQs). The questionnaire contains eight items scored on a seven-point scale (0-6). DTSQs scores range from, e.g, 6 = very satisfied to 0 = very dissatisfied. The total satisfaction score when using the DTSQs ranges from 0 to 36; and the total score is obtained from summed scores from questions 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. This outcome measure is assessed after the first intervention (at 12 weeks into the study).</description>
