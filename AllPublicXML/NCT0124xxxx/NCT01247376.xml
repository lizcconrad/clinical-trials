      Abstract

      Background:

      Local external cooling of the postoperative field is a treatment paradigm aiming for enhanced
      recovery after joint surgery. It is supposed to reduce pain and improve mobilization,
      enabling same day surgery.

      Hypothesis:

      Systematic postoperative cooling and compression after knee arthroscopy will reduce pain and
      also be reflected by changes in local levels of metabolic and inflammatory variables in the
      synovial membrane.

      Study design:

      Prospective randomised study; Level of evidence 1.

      Methods:

      Forty-four otherwise healthy patients were included in the study and randomised to systematic
      cooling and compression or NO cooling and compression after knee arthroscopy. Microdialysis
      of the synovial membrane was performed postoperatively with measurements of PGE2, glucose,
      lactate, glycerol, glutamate and blood flow (ethanol exchange ratio). Local temperature was
      monitored as well as postoperative pain (VAS and NRS).

      Results:

      The application of a cooling and compression device after knee arthroscopy resulted in
      significantly lower temperature in the operated knee (skin, joint capsule and
      intraarticularly).

      The cooling and compression diminished energy requirements in synovial tissue and a 3
      temperature sensitive influence on inflammation (PGE2) were shown. No effect on postoperative
      pain was detected.

      Conclusion:

      Local cryotherapy and compression after knee arthroscopy significantly lowered local knee
      temperature postoperatively. A correlation with synovial PGE 2 and temperature was shown.

      Since PGE2 is a pain and inflammatory marker this implicates a positive anti-inflammatory
      effect induced by postoperative local cooling and compression. Hypothermia is proposed to
      have a protective effect in ischemic tissue. This is probably due to a decreased metabolic
      rate and therefore decreased energy requirements as shown by stable levels of lactate despite
      lower blood flow indicated by increasing ethanol ratio.
