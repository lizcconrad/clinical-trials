    <textblock>
      This is a research study for advanced prostate cancer. An experimental drug called AN-152
      (also known as AEZS-108) will be used. The purpose of this study is to test the safety,
      tolerability and benefits of an experimental drug called AN-152.

      The participants tumor will be tested for expression of this receptor (using an old biopsy).
      If the participants cancer does not have this receptor, participants will not be eligible to
      participant in this study.

      AN-152 (AEZS-108) is administered intravenously (IV) over 2 hours and will be given at the
      specified dose every 3 weeks. Premedication with dexamethasone 8mg is recommended.

      Participants will continue treatment until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      participants refusal, treatment delay &gt;3 weeks, or the completion of 6 cycles. Continuation
      beyond 6 cycles is left at the discretion of the study doctor.

      The study is planned to last 2 years. Up to 55 (up to 18 for the Phase I portion, up to 37
      for the Phase II portion).
