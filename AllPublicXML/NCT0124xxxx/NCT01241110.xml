      Objective: To compare two oral treatments: Ofloxacin + Metronidazole, and Azitromycin
      +Metronidazole in outpatients with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.

      Materials and Methods: Two hundred patients divided to two groups( A , B). Group A (treated
      by Ofloxacin 400 mg. + Metronidazole 500mg) and Group B (a single dose of oral Azitromicine
      1gr + Metronidazole 500mg) for 10 days, were compared in terms of side effects and efficacy
