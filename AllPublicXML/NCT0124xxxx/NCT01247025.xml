    <textblock>
      The primary research question in this study will ask, among those receiving outpatient mental
      health services (MHS) at the Eastern Colorado Healthcare System (ECHCS)/Denver Veterans
      Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), how many suffer from Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD)? Here, it
      is hypothesized that PGD will occur within the sample. A secondary aim of this study will be
      to investigate how often PGD co-occurs with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or
      depression. Also, while PGD has been shown to have an effect on self-directed violence (SDV)
      among civilians (Prigerson, Bridge et al., 1999), no studies yet have examined the
      relationship between PGD and SDV among Veterans. Therefore, it also is hypothesized that as
      PGD severity increases among the Veteran sample, risk for SDV will increase as well.
      Additional research aims also will be addressed in this study. For one, it will be assessed
      which grief symptoms are most often reported among the Veteran sample. Also, no study has yet
      to examine if there are neuropsychological differences between PGD and PTSD. Therefore,
      another research question here is whether PGD indeed is neuropsychologically different from
      PTSD. Here, the exploratory hypothesis is that PGD sufferers will respond to a measure of
      multiple components of cognition (e.g., planning, sequencing, concentration, multitasking,
      and memory efficiency) in a manner that is significantly different from PTSD sufferers.

        The participants in this observational study will be all individuals willing and eligible
        among those seeking outpatient mental health services at the Eastern Colorado Healthcare
        System (ECHCS)/Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). It is expected that 180
        participants will be enrolled in an effort to obtain up to 150 completed protocols. Women
        and minorities will be recruited as a routine part of the study. However, given the
        participant population within the Eastern Colorado Healthcare System (ECHCS)/Denver
        Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), it is expected the majority of participants will be
        Caucasian men.
