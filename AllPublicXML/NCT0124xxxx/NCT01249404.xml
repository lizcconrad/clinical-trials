    <measure>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the MAS Score in the Gastrocnemius-soleus Complex (GSC) (Knee Extended)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle tone in the treated limb was assessed by MAS in the GSC (with the knee extended) at baseline, at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24, and at end of study. The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0 (no increase in muscle tone), 1 (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion (ROM)), 1+ (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM), 2 (more marked increase in muscle tone), 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone) or 4 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension), and can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs.

    <measure>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in the Tardieu Scale in the GSC (Knee Extended) at Weeks 1, 4 and 12: Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Spasticity Angle (X)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Tardieu Scale in the GSC was used to assess spasticity with the knee extended. Assessments were made at slow (V1) and fast (V3) speeds of stretch. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest (XV1), either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at a fast speed to determine the angle of catch and release (XV3). The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. The Tardieu Scale ratings were made prior to the study treatment at baseline, and then after injection at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, and at discretionary visits if required at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Tardieu Scale in the GSC was used to assess spasticity with the knee extended. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 = no resistance throughout passive movement; 1 = slight resistance throughout passive movement; 2 = clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release; 3 = fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release; 4 = unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. The Tardieu Scale ratings were made prior to the study treatment at baseline, and then after injection at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, and at discretionary visits if required at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline for spasticity grade at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

    <measure>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Lower Limb Pain at Weeks 1, 4 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of lower limb pain was evaluated using the Scale of Pain Intensity (SPIN) which provided a pictorial representation of pain in a 6-point graphic scale with the degree of red shading inside a circle representing the intensity of pain. The bottom and top of the scale are anchored by two extremes: 'no pain' (circle with no red shading and scored as 0) and 'pain as bad as it could be' (circle completely red and scored as 5), marked with either verbal or visual cues. The intervening points are represented by red circles increasing proportionally in size. The subject marks the circle that best indicates their pain intensity. The SPIN assessments were obtained prior to the study treatment at baseline, and then after injection at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, and at discretionary visits when needed at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0 (no increase in muscle tone), 1 (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion (ROM)), 1+ (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM), 2 (more marked increase in muscle tone), 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone) or 4 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension), and can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs. The least squares mean change from baseline at Week 4 is reported.</description>

        <description>An assessment of overall treatment response was conducted at Weeks 4 and 12, and discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study by an investigator who had not assessed the MAS. The investigator rated the response to treatment in the subject's lower limb after injection of Dysport® relative to the status at the baseline. Answers were made on a 9 point rating scale: -4=markedly worse, -3=much worse, -2=worse, -1=slightly worse, 0=no change, +1=slightly improved, +2=improved, +3=much improved, +4=markedly improved.

          <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in MAS Score in the GSC (Knee Extended) at Weeks 1 and 12</title>
          <description>Muscle tone in the treated limb was assessed by MAS in the GSC (with the knee extended) at baseline, at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24, and at end of study. The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0 (no increase in muscle tone), 1 (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the ROM), 1+ (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM), 2 (more marked increase in muscle tone), 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone) or 4 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension), and can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1 and 12 are reported.</description>
          <population>The ITT population included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 injection of study medication and who had a MAS score in the GSC assessed at baseline (pre-treatment) and at Week 4.

The evaluator walked beside the subject during the test and counted the number of steps taken during the 10-metre walk. The gait parameters were measured at baseline, Weeks 1, 4 and 12, discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>
          <population>The ITT population included all randomised subjects who received at least 1 injection of study medication and who had a MAS score in the GSC assessed at baseline (pre-treatment) and at Week 4. Only subjects with data available at each timepoint presented are included in the analysis.</population>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Cadence With Maximal Walking Speed With Shoes at Weeks 1, 4 and 12</title>
        <description>Cadence was assessed during the 10-metre walking speed test at maximal walking speed and with shoes. The evaluator walked beside the subject during the test and counted the number of steps taken during the 10-metre walk. The gait parameters were measured at baseline, Weeks 1, 4 and 12, discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

          <description>Cadence was assessed during the 10-metre walking speed test at maximal walking speed and barefoot. The evaluator walked beside the subject during the test and counted the number of steps taken during the 10-metre walk. The gait parameters were measured at baseline, Weeks 1, 4 and 12, discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in the Tardieu Scale in the GSC (Knee Extended) at Weeks 1, 4 and 12: Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Spasticity Angle (X)</title>
        <description>The Tardieu Scale in the GSC was used to assess spasticity with the knee extended. Assessments were made at slow (V1) and fast (V3) speeds of stretch. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest (XV1), either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at a fast speed to determine the angle of catch and release (XV3). The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. The Tardieu Scale ratings were made prior to the study treatment at baseline, and then after injection at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, and at discretionary visits if required at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in the Tardieu Scale in the GSC (Knee Extended) at Weeks 1, 4 and 12: Spasticity Grade (Y)</title>
        <description>The Tardieu Scale in the GSC was used to assess spasticity with the knee extended. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 = no resistance throughout passive movement; 1 = slight resistance throughout passive movement; 2 = clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release; 3 = fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release; 4 = unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. The Tardieu Scale ratings were made prior to the study treatment at baseline, and then after injection at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, and at discretionary visits if required at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline for spasticity grade at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in the Tardieu Scale in the Soleus (Knee Flexed) at Weeks 1, 4 and 12: Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Spasticity Angle (X)</title>
        <description>The Tardieu Scale in the soleus was used to assess spasticity with the knee flexed. Assessments were made at slow (V1) and fast (V3) speeds of stretch. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest (XV1), either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at a fast speed to determine the angle of catch and release (XV3). The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. The Tardieu Scale ratings were made prior to the study treatment at baseline, and then after injection at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, and at discretionary visits if required at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in the Tardieu Scale in the Soleus (Knee Flexed) at Weeks 1, 4 and 12: Spasticity Grade (Y)</title>
        <description>The Tardieu Scale in the soleus was used to assess spasticity with the knee flexed. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 = no resistance throughout passive movement; 1 = slight resistance throughout passive movement; 2 = clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release; 3 = fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release; 4 = unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. The Tardieu Scale ratings were made prior to the study treatment at baseline, and then after injection at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, and at discretionary visits if required at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline for spasticity grade at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

        <title>Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Lower Limb Pain at Weeks 1, 4 and 12</title>
        <description>The intensity of lower limb pain was evaluated using the Scale of Pain Intensity (SPIN) which provided a pictorial representation of pain in a 6-point graphic scale with the degree of red shading inside a circle representing the intensity of pain. The bottom and top of the scale are anchored by two extremes: ‘no pain’ (circle with no red shading and scored as 0) and ‘pain as bad as it could be’ (circle completely red and scored as 5), marked with either verbal or visual cues. The intervening points are represented by red circles increasing proportionally in size. The subject marks the circle that best indicates their pain intensity. The SPIN assessments were obtained prior to the study treatment at baseline, and then after injection at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, and at discretionary visits when needed at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The least squares mean change from baseline at Weeks 1, 4 and 12 are reported.</description>

      <desc>Adverse event (AE) data is reported as treatment emergent AEs; an AE was reported as emergent if it arose (i.e. started or worsened in severity) after the subject received study medication and were monitored from the time that the subject gave informed consent to the end of the study. All AEs were elicited by direct, non-leading questioning or by spontaneous reports. The safety population consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least 1 injection of study medication.</desc>
