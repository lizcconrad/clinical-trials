      The purposes of the proposed study are (1) to collect data on the feasibility of offering
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as an intervention to reduce fatigue and
      psychological distress in cancer patients who are not in active treatment for their cancer
      and (2) to estimate effect sizes of the intervention for fatigue, depression, anxiety, and
      sleep disturbance. The investigators also will obtain preliminary effect sizes of the degree
      to which the intervention increases mindfulness, and the investigators will evaluate dosage
      effects. Findings will suggest whether a future randomized controlled trial with
      cancer-related fatigue (CRF) as the primary outcome is feasible and warranted.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the MBSR intervention arm or to a wait-list
      control arm. The MBSR intervention will consist of a weekly 2-hour class to be held for seven
      consecutive weeks in the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center Pavilion; the class on week
      six will be extended to a 3-hour &quot;retreat.&quot; Participants will be invited to engage in daily
      home practice of meditation and other mindfulness exercises. All participants will complete a
      series of self-report questionnaires prior to the start of the classes, immediately following
      the end of classes, and 1 month after the class ends. Those in the intervention arm will
      begin the MBSR class the week after enrollment; the control group will be offered the same
      7-week program after 1-month post-intervention follow-up assessments are
      completed—approximately 13 weeks after enrollment.

      Primary Aim 1: Obtain preliminary RCT effect sizes for changes in fatigue of an MBSR
      treatment group compared to a wait-list control group.

      Hypothesis 1: Immediately post-intervention (T2), improvements in fatigue compared to
      pre-intervention (T1) will be greater in the treatment group than the control group.

      Hypothesis 2: At 1 month post intervention (T3), improvements in fatigue compared to
      pre-intervention (T1) will be greater in the treatment group than improvements in the control
      group.

      Secondary Aim 1: Obtain preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) effect sizes for
      changes in depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance of an MBSR treatment group compared to
      a wait-list control group.

      Hypothesis 1: Immediately post-intervention (T2), improvements in depression, anxiety, and
      sleep compared to pre-intervention (T1) will be greater in the treatment group than the
      control group.

      Secondary Aim 2: Obtain preliminary effect sizes of the degree to which the intervention
      increases mindfulness and of the relationship of mindfulness with fatigue, depression,
      anxiety, and sleep disturbance.

      Hypothesis 1: At T2 and 30-days post-intervention (T3), improvements in mindfulness compared
      to pre-intervention (T1) will be greater in the treatment group than in the control group.

      Hypothesis 2: Degree of mindfulness will be negatively correlated with fatigue, depression,
      anxiety, and sleep disturbance at all time-points.

      Secondary Aim 3: Evaluate the feasibility of recruiting fatigued cancer patients to
      participate in MBSR-CRF, as well as the acceptability and dosage effects of MBSR-CRF.

      Hypothesis 1: At least 30% of patients who meet study criteria will choose to enroll in the
      proposed study.

      Hypothesis 2: The MBSR intervention protocol will demonstrate feasibility in that (1) at
      least 70% of participants will attend at least 4 of the 7 scheduled classes, and (2) at least
      70% of participants will practice mindfulness at least 60 minutes per week.

      Hypothesis 3: Class attendance and hours of mindfulness practice per week will be positively
      associated as indicated by correlation effect sizes with improvements in both the process
      variable (degree of mindfulness) as well as the primary outcome variable (i.e., fatigue) and
      secondary outcome variables (i.e., depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals will be eligible to participate based on the following criteria:

                  composite.
