  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An impairment of endothelial function plays the central role in the pathogenesis of
      cardiovascular diseases and their complications. Most of cardiovascular risk factors are
      known to impair endothelial function and the established disease further aggravates
      endothelial dysfunction.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of nebivolol or metoprolol
      succinate on endothelial function and large artery stiffness.

      The aim of this study was to compare the effects between the vasodilating β-blocker nebivolol
      and the cardioselective β-blocker metoprolol succinate on aortic blood pressure and left
      ventricular wall thickness. We conducted a randomized, double-blind study in 80 hypertensive
      patients. Patients received either nebivolol 5 mg or metoprolol succinate 50-100 mg daily for
      one year. Their heart rate, central and brachial blood pressure, mean arterial pressure,
      augmentation index, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and left ventricular wall thickness
      were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.
