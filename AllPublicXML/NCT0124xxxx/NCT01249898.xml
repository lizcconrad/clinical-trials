  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal bone fractures, and second most common wrist
      fractures (second to distal radius fractures). Lack of proper immobilization or displacement
      of these fractures commonly results in fracture nonunion or malunion followed by the
      development of wrist post-traumatic osteoarthritis. In addition, proper reduction and
      fixation of these fractures are challenging to the most experienced hand surgeons.

      The investigators are going to follow-up the patients population suffering from Scaphoid
      fractures(nonunion included) for one year. The investigators will evaluate this follow up
      results in two ways:

        1. Intra-operative imaging of scaphoid fracture fixation - feasibility evaluation.

        2. Treatment of scaphoid fracture non-union.
