      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of transversus abdominis plane
      (TAP) block in reducing postoperative opioid requirements and pain after open pyeloplasty
      surgery in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary open pyeloplasty is a common elective surgical procedure at The Hospital for Sick
      Children. All children are given fentanyl plus local anesthetic wound infiltration for
      intraoperative analgesia. A retrospective audit demonstrated that 63% of children required
      additional opioid treatment in the early recovery period following surgery. Concern exists
      regarding potential side effects of opioids including nausea or vomiting, respiratory
      depression, pruritus, over-sedation and delayed transition to oral intake. More importantly,
      children may under-report their pain or pain may not be recognized by medical staff leading
      to inadequate provision of analgesia. This suggests that the use of a regional technique,
      such as a TAP block, may benefit children undergoing open pyeloplasty.

      The ultrasound guided TAP block introduces a local anaesthetic to the transversus abdominis
      plane which is one of three muscle layers in the abdominal wall. This results in a block of
      the nerves leading to the abdominal wall thereby reducing pain sensations.

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will receive intravenous morphine 0.05 mg/kg if the FLACC is ≥ 3/10 (equivalent to mild-to-moderate pain). Morphine may be given at 10 minute intervals as per standard protocol until the FLACC score is &lt; 3/10, or the child declines additional pain medicine when offered.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of pain scores post-surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores will be assessed using the Faces-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolibility (FLACC) scale for children ≤ 7 years old. Pain scores will be assessed at admission (time = 0, 5, 10, 15, 30), and then every 15 minutes thereafter until discharge from PACU.</description>

    <description>A block needle will be advanced in a medial to lateral direction until the tip is visualized in the transversus abdominis plane. After negative aspiration 0.4 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.25% with 1:200 000 epinephrine will be injected. The total dose of bupivacaine will not exceed 2 mg/kg and the total volume will not be more than 20 ml.</description>
