      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a hand exercise intervention on
      function and osteoarthritis symptoms in persons with hand osteoarthritis .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal diseases in an adult
      population. The disease may have large influences on an individual's function, health related
      quality of life and participation in the society. In recently published clinical guidelines
      for management, non-pharmacological approaches are considered as core treatments.

      Several studies have demonstrated that exercise may reduce pain and improve function in
      persons with knee OA, and a similar effect is suggested for hip OA. Regarding effect of
      exercises in hand OA, available research results are limited, and randomised controlled
      trials (RCT) of good quality are needed.
