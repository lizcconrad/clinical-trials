    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to serve as a pilot showing the feasibility of a &quot;Hub and Satellite&quot;
      Heart Failure (HF) Provider's Network which will aim to provide improved, evidence-based care
      to veterans with HF. Primary Care Providers in the VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics will
      undergo a brief period of intensive training in HF management and then practice in a network
      of primary care providers supported by the Regional HF Center.

      Background:

      Congestive heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem. There is a pressing need to
      improve treatment of HF, but lifesaving therapies remain underused in clinical practice. We
      proposed a novel, potentially cost-effective model of community-based, multidisciplinary,
      collaborative HF care - the &quot;Hub and Satellite&quot; Heart Failure Providers Network. Primary care
      providers trained in HF management would provide improved care to their clinic patients with
      HF in &quot;satellite&quot; clinics, supported by the Regional HF Center &quot;hub&quot;.

      Objectives:

        1. To establish and demonstrate the feasibility of the &quot;Hub and Satellite&quot; Heart Failure
           Providers Network

        2. To obtain data examining clinical effectiveness and barriers

      Methods:

      Volunteer community-based primary care providers underwent 3 days of HF management training
      at the regional HF center (Nashville), consisting of 21 hours of lectures, briefings,
      teaching sessions and case presentations. Multiple choice testing and a survey interview were
      completed at the beginning and end of training. Exclusive access was given to the services of
      a clinical pharmacist to titrate HF medications to clinical guideline-recommended doses.

      Providers received updates on advances in HF management. A confidential feedback report on
      their performance was given to HF providers. Formative evaluation was performed through
      pre-educational and 4 subsequent telephone interviews with HF providers.

      DSS data was used to identify patients with systolic HF (ejection fraction&lt;40%) cared for by
      the HF providers; systolic HF patients in the same clinics cared for by non-HF trained
      providers were randomly selected as controls. Data on the care received over the one year
      period of follow-up was collected from DSS data and the computerized patient record system
      (CPRS).

      Status:

      One year of study follow-up has been completed. Primary data analysis is continuing. Work
      done to date has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a &quot;Hub and
      Satellite&quot; HF Providers network, including high provider satisfaction.
