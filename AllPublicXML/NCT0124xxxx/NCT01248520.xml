      A randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess whether text messaging to an outpatient
      obstetric population can improve maternal influenza vaccine uptake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      History and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic suggest that both seasonal and pandemic
      influenza infections impart disproportionate morbidity and mortality among gravidas. The
      influenza vaccine represents a viable, preventive health intervention to mitigate disease
      burden for gravidas and their neonates. Despite the safety and efficacy of influenza
      vaccines, suboptimal maternal vaccination rates (13-24%) persist nationwide. Barriers to
      influenza vaccination during pregnancy include patient concerns about vaccine safety and
      unappreciated risk of influenza infection. Cellular phone text messaging has emerged as an
      innovative technology with advantages of ubiquity, rapid, confidential information
      transmission, and low cost. Text messaging may represent an effective way to educate pregnant
      women about their particular vulnerability to influenza infection and enhance influenza
      vaccine uptake. We propose a randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess whether text
      messaging to an outpatient obstetric population can improve maternal influenza vaccine
      uptake.

    <description>To assess the ability of direct communication and education to patients using modern technology (cellular text messaging) to enhance vaccine uptake. We hypothesize that text messaging will improve the timing (earlier in flu season) and rate of receipt of influenza vaccination in pregnancy.</description>

    <description>To assess the ability of direct education via text messaging to enhance knowledge about influenza infection and vaccination in pregnancy. We hypothesize that women receiving text messages will be more likely than controls to have accurate knowledge about pregnant women's increased susceptibility to influenza and about the vaccine's safety and efficacy in pregnancy.</description>
