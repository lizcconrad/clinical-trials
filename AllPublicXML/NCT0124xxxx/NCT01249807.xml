      Cancer Screening is necessary for promoting cancer prevention in the area of public health.
      The Department of Health, Executive Yuan of the Republic of China has expanded and included
      colon cancer screening, oral cavity cancer screening, breast cancer screening, and cervical
      cancer screening in national-wide preventive healthcare services. However, most of the
      Taiwanese do not have the concepts of what cancer screening is and regular participation of
      cancer screening. This will easily cause their neglect of quality of personal healthcare and
      habits of cancer screening. Recently, in order to reach the national goal of cancer
      prevention, the parallel methods, multi-promotion for reinforcing concepts and free cancer
      screening, have been utilized to cultivate Taiwanese people's active participation of cancer
      screening. Therefore, this study will use health service utilization model to investigate
      Taiwanese people's concepts of cancer-related knowledge and the major causes of low
      participation of cancer screening.

      In order to investigate Taiwanese people's health service utilization model and quality of
      health life, this study first review the related regulations and screening rates of cancer
      prevention, including cancers of colon, oral cavity, breast, and cervical, in Taiwan. In
      addition, the structured questionnaire will be conducted to collect, investigate, and analyze
      the relationship between the willingness of participating the aforementioned cancer screening
      and personal characteristics, quality of health life, medical history, and concepts of
      cancer, etc. It is expected that the results of this study will provide accurate and
      effective promotions of cancer screening to medical institutions and medical affairs to
      reinforce the concepts of participation for raising the rates of cancer screening;
      furthermore, to awaken Taiwanese people's crucial awareness of early treatment improves the
      chances of recovery on cancer.
