  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if multi-language patients will find the
      multi-language capabilities of the online modules useful for better understanding of the
      general information regarding radiation therapy.

      Research shows that treatment-related information is the most important informational need of
      cancer patients and online media sources are gaining popularity as a cancer communication
      method. It is important to know whether having multi-language online education modules are
      usable for and beneficial to the multicultural cancer patient population at Sunnybrook
      Hospital, given that recent research suggests that this cancer population in general faces
      many barriers to effective online cancer communication. Approximately 10 new patients from
      the radiation oncology clinic at Sunnybrook Hospital will be screened to participate in the
      study. Usability testing will involve a combination of interviewing, observation, think-aloud
      methodology and a short survey.Results will be analyzed by assessing the percentage of
      patients identifying with a certain level of the Likert scale on the survey as well as
      through content analysis of responses to the interview and open-ended survey questions.

    <description>Patients are usually be given a 5-10 minute &quot;new patient teaching&quot; before their radiation therapy simulation and planning appointment and before their first radiation therapy treatment appointment. Patients will be asked to view an online patient education module before their radiation therapy simulation and planning appointment or before their first radiation therapy treatment appointment. Then patients will be asked to participate in an interview session and fill out a survey (attached). They will still receive &quot;new patient teaching&quot; from the therapists before their radiation therapy simulation and planning or radiation therapy treatment appointment.</description>
