    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of islet transplantation when
      performed after kidney transplantation, which may provide more normal control of blood sugar
      without the need for insulin shots. Islets are special clusters of cells within the pancreas
      that produce insulin. These cells will be obtained from cadaver (non-living) donors and given
      to subjects by vein.

    <description>The primary endpoint measured at one year after the last islet transplant. That is the proportion of subjects with both an HbAlc &lt; 6.5% and an absence of severe hypoglycemic events at 1 year after the last islet transplant or a reduction in HbAlc of 1 point and an absence of severe hypoglycemia at 1 year after the last islet transplant.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects age 18 to 68 years.

          -  Subjects who are able to provide written informed consent and to comply with the
             procedures of the study protocol.

          -  Clinical history compatible with T1D with disease onset &lt; 40 years of age and
             insulin-dependence for &gt; 5 years at the time of enrollment, and a sum of subject age
             and insulin dependent diabetes duration of &gt; 28.

          -  Absent stimulated c-peptide (&lt; 0.3 ng/mL) in response to a MMTT [Boost® 6 mL/kg body
             weight (BW) to a maximum of 360 mL; another product with equivalent caloric and
             nutrient content may be substituted for Boost®] measured at 60 and 90 min after start
             of consumption.

          -  Subjects who are &gt; or at 3 months post-renal transplant who are taking appropriate
             calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based maintenance immunosuppression ([tacrolimus alone or
             in conjunction with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, myfortic, or azathioprine; or
             cyclosporine in conjunction with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or myfortic] ±
             Prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day)or subject will receive islets transplant within 72hours after
             kidney transplantation (islets and kidney are from the same donor)

          -  Stable renal function as defined by a creatinine of no more than one third greater
             than the average creatinine determination performed in the 3 previous months prior to
             islet transplantation, until rejection, obstruction or infection is ruled out.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Weight more than 90 kg or body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m2.

          -  Insulin requirement of &gt;1.0 IU/kg/day or &lt;15 U/day.

          -  Other (non-kidney) organ transplants except prior failed pancreatic graft where the
             graft failed within the first two weeks due to thrombosis, followed by pancreatectomy;
             with the pancreas transplant occurring more than 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Untreated or unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

          -  Blood Pressure: SBP &gt; 160 mmHg or DBP &gt;100 mmHg despite treatment with
             antihypertensive agents.

          -  Calculated GFR &lt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the subject's measured serum creatinine and
             the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [1]. Strict

             m2

          -  Proteinuria (albumin/ creatinine ratio or ACr &gt; 300mg/g) of new onset since kidney
             transplantation.

          -  Either Class I or Class II panel-reactive anti-HLA antibodies &gt; 50%. Subjects with
             either Class I or Class II panel reactive anti-HLA antibodies &gt;50% will be excluded if
             any of the following are detected: Positive cross-match, Islet donor-directed anti-HLA
             antibodies detected by Luminex Single Antigen/specificity bead assay including weakly
             reactive antibodies that would not be detected by a flow cross-match, or Antibodies to
             the renal donor (i.e. presumed de novo).

          -  For female subjects: Positive pregnancy test, presently breast-feeding, or
             unwillingness to use effective contraceptive measures for the duration of the study
             and 4 months after discontinuation. For male subjects: intent to procreate during the
             duration of the study or within 4 months after discontinuation or unwillingness to use
             effective measures of contraception. Oral contraceptives, Norplant®, Depo-Provera®,
             and barrier devices with spermicide are acceptable contraceptive methods; condoms used
             alone are not acceptable.

          -  Presence or history of active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, or
             tuberculosis (TB). Subjects with laboratory evidence of active infection are excluded
