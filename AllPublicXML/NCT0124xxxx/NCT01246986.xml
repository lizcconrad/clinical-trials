      The purpose of this study is to estimate the median time to progression in participants with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when treated with LY2157299 as monotherapy and in combination
      with sorafenib or ramucirumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of four Parts: Part A where HCC participants with an increased alpha feto
      protein (AFP) level will be treated with either 160 milligrams (mg) LY2157299 or 300 mg
      LY2157299. Part B where HCC participants with a normal AFP level will be treated with 300 mg
      LY2157299, Part C where treatment-na√Øve HCC participants will be treated with 160 mg
      LY2157299 + sorafenib or 300 mg LY2157299 + sorafenib, and Part D where HCC participants will
      be treated with either 160 mg or 300 mg LY2157299 + ramucirumab.

      Participants who continue to receive benefit from treatment at the time that the study is
      considered completed, may enter the treatment extension period and continue to receive the
      study treatment. The end of the study is the date of last visit or last scheduled procedure
      for the last active subject in the study.

    <description>Per the protocol, following an interim analysis, the decision was taken to no longer randomize participants to the 160 mg LY2157299 arm. As of May 25,2012, all newly enrolled participants will receive 300 mg LY2157299.
160 mg LY2157299 given daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. This on/off schedule constitutes a cycle of 28 days. Participants will continue to receive until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.</description>
