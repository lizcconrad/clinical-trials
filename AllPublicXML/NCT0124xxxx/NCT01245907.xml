  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to evaluate effects of internet-based applied relaxation (a simplified version of
      cognitive behavioral therapy) for women with menopausal symptoms mainly vasomotoric symptom
      (VMS), i.e. hot flashes and sweating. Sixty postmenopausal women with VMS will be recruited
      and 30 randomized to applied relaxation (AR) via internet and 30 to a control group which is
      a non-treated waitlist group.

      At baseline, after 10 weeks of therapy and six, 12 and 24 months after end of therapy women
      will be asked to fill in diaries about hot flashes and answer questionnaires on Quality of
      Life (Women's Health Questionnaire; WHQ, anxiety and depression measured with Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS and one measuring sleep, Insomnia Severity Index; ISI as
      well as one about knowledge of the climacteric and hormone therapy).

      The waiting list group will be offered internet based AR after 10 weeks with the same
      follow-up as the treatment group.
