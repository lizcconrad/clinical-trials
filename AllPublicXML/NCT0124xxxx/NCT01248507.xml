  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD patients frequently suffer intermittent exacerbations of their disease characterised by
      acute deterioration of symptoms. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are associated with
      significant impairment of health status, use of health care resources, poor prognosis and
      increased mortality. The development of simple and practical predictive tools would help to
      identify COPD patients at greater risk of suffering exacerbations, which is important since
      those patients would need more intense and early treatment.

      This one-year prospective cohort non-drug study will evaluate several COPD-specific
      questionnaires as predictive tools and the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities as risk
      factors, for the composite events in study cohorts. The trial duration consists of a
      screening period (4-6 weeks) and a follow-up period (12 months), 4 visits in total along the
      study.
