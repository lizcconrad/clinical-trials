      A formal randomized efficacy trial testing the Mothers and Toddlers' program, an
      attachment-based parenting intervention for mothers enrolled in addiction treatment and
      caring for young children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five years ago the investigators were funded to develop the Mothers and Toddlers Program
      (MTP; R01 DA17294 / Project Period: 8/20/04 - 12/31/09). MTP is the first parenting
      intervention developed for substance abusing mothers based on the attachment theory. It is
      also the only parenting intervention for substance abusing mothers that has led to
      improvement in maternal caregiving sensitivity and responsiveness to infant and toddler
      distress in observed lab-based interactions. The investigators now have all the research
      materials to conduct a Stage II randomized clinical trial including a treatment manual,
      treatment fidelity scales therapist training program and outcome measures. In this Stage II
      formal efficacy trial, the investigators (1) Introduce new measures of dyadic adjustment and
      child attachment, (2) Add an 18 week follow up period to test for sustained treatment
      effects, (3) Measure major constructs (reflective functioning, representations, dyadic
      adjustment, and child attachment) when they are expected to change, (4) Examine temporal
      mechanisms of change proposed in the MTP treatment model (5) Determine whether improvements
      in dyadic adjustment reduces incidence of relapse, (6) Broaden the MTP therapist pool by
      training four new therapists and (7) Broaden the coding pool by training 3 additional coders
      per measure. One hundred and fifty mothers caring for children ages 12 to 60 months of age
      will be recruited from outpatient substance abuse treatment services at the APT Foundation
      into the intention-to-treat sample and will be randomized to 12 weeks of MTP vs. PEP and
      followed for 33 weeks.

    <description>The Parent Development Interview (PDI; Slade, Aber, Berger, Bresgi, &amp; Kaplan, 2002) was used to measure maternal capacity to mentalize about her own and her child's behavior. The PDI is a 1 hour semi-structured interview designed to elicit the mother's narrative about commonly occurring, emotionally-challenging aspects of parenting. A rating of 1 indicates a absence of recognition of mental states. A rating of 3 indicates a limited capacity to acknowledge mental states. A rating of 5 indicates the presence of a rudimentary capacity for reflective functioning.</description>

    <description>The Working Model of the Child Interview (WMCI; Zeanah &amp; Benoit, 1993) is a 1.5 hour interview used to elicit a narrative description of the mother's perceptions of her child and their relationship. The rater was trained by the to reliably code 6e qualitative subscales Openness, Richness, Coherence, Caregiving Sensitivity and Acceptance and Involvement. On the mean of six subscales, a score of three is considered to represent average representational quality, scores of 1 and 2 are considered to represent clinical risk and scores of 4 and 5 are considered to represent optimal quality.</description>

    <description>The NCAST Teaching Scale (Barnard &amp; Eyres, 1979) is a standardized, 73 item tool used to observe and rate quality of interactions with children birth to 36 months. Mothers choose a task to teach the child in a 5 minute teaching session. Maternal behavior is coded on 4 dimensions: Sensitivity to Cues, Response to Distress, Social-Emotional Growth Fostering, &amp; Cognitive Growth Fostering. The Total Caregiver Score is the sum of the 4 subscale scores. The Total Caregiver Contingency Score is the sum of 20 items from the 4 subscales that involve the caregiver's contingent response to child cues.</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) was used to assess maternal symptoms of depression. The BDI is a widely used 21-item questionnaire rated on a 4-point scale and yields a total score ranging from 0 to 63: scores between 13 and 19 indicate mild depression; scores between 20 and 28 indicate moderate levels of depression, and scores between 29 and 63 indicate severe levels of depression (Beck et al., 1996).</description>

    <description>The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Derogatis, 1993) was used to assess maternal global psychiatric distress. The BSI is a standardized, widely used, 53-item, 5-point, self-report measure of psychopathology. The composite Global Severity Index (GSI) measures current overall symptomatology across multiple domains and has demonstrated good reliability and validity (Derogatis, 1993). T scores above 60 on the GSI indicate risk for a clinical disorder.</description>

    <description>. We will use the Curiosity Box Paradigm (Mayes et al., 1993) to assess dyadic adjustment under circumstances of mild uncertainty (i.e., during the child's exploration of unfamiliar toys/objects). Children will explore a box of 9 novel toys or objects (that they are unlikely to have seen before) after an initial 5 minute warm up period with one box of 9 familiar toys. Maternal, child and dyadic behavior will be assessed with the Coding Interaction Behavior Scales (Feldman, 1998).</description>

    <description>PE was developed to represent parent education and support that is typically available to mothers with substance use problems who are at high risk for neglecting their young children. Mothers enrolled in PEP will meet weekly for one hour with a PE counselor who will provide assistance in solving problems related to family basic needs (e.g., health care, child care, housing and education). The PE counselor will also provide a choice of pamphlets on age-related parenting topics each week from a series of pamphlets designed specifically for this study.</description>

    <description>This intervention is an introductory, short-term, supportive, psychodynamic therapy for substance using mothers of young children that emphasizes the development of the capacity for mentalizing. Mothers meet with an individual, MBT-trained psychodynamically-oriented therapist for 12 sessions. The intervention is conducted a clinic where mothers are enrolled in treatment for their substance abuse.</description>
