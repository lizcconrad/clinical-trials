      Introduction Patients with stroke may be silent aspirators or at risk for laryngeal
      penetration or aspiration because of abnormal oropharyngeal functioning and thus are at risk
      for aspiration pneumonia and its serious effects. By providing identification of the
      components of the abnormal swallow, and comparing swallowing across tasks, the investigators
      may avoid aspiration and can instruct patients on preventative or compensatory swallowing
      techniques.

      Materials and methods

        1. Oral examination-A neurologist and speech pathologist examine the patient's swallowing
           function. The patient is interviewed about difficulties with food intake, chewing and
           swallowing during meals.

        2. Ultrasound examination-Ultrasound creates image of areas inside the body using sound
           waves. With the patient in a sitting position, a 3/4-inch transducer (device for
           transmitting and receiving sound waves) is placed under the chin to visualize epiglottis
           movements during swallowing.

        3. Modified barium swallow-While standing or sitting, the patient swallows 1/2 teaspoon of
           flavored barium (a radioactive substance) six times (a total of 3 teaspoons), while the
           tongue and pharynx (tube leading from the mouth to the esophagus) are scanned and
           videotaped at the same time epiglottis movement will be trace with ultrasound. The
           barium is given in three consistencies-thin, medium and thick (pudding-like).

      The investigators will study the oral, pharyngeal and upper esophageal phases of swallow
      using videofluoroscopy and correlate with ultrasound tracing of epiglottis movement in
      patients with stroke conditions. Most of the previous studies of swallowing have utilized
      diagnostic imaging technique to provide a complete swallowing assessment, but limited
      capabilities for screening large population of patients.

      INCLUSION CRITERIA: The Stroke Center inpatients and outpatients with known or suspected
      dysphagia can be included for study as well as patients who are admitted specifically for
      this protocol. (Difficulty swallowing food or pills,changed swallowing ability,coughing or
      choking when eating, shortness of breath during swallowing, food backing up into the mouth or
      nasal passage, fever or voice changes after swallowing, pain when swallowing, unexplained
      loss of weight.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients who are severely demented or severely compromised will be
      excluded if they do not have sufficient cognitive ability to follow directions.
      Non-ambulatory patients will be excluded if they cannot be braced or supported within the
      fluoroscopy unit. Highly agitated individuals will also be excluded if they are unable to
      remain confined in the equipment.

      Analytic Methods The Student t test will be used to analyze the difference in epiglottis
      movements during swallowing amongst different phases. Levene's test for equality of variances
      will be applied to examine the variability of epiglottis movements during swallowing between
      the groups. All statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS.
