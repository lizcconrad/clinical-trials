    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase III study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination
      of eflornithine and sulindac compared to single agent sulindac or eflornithine in reducing
      the number of polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

             genotype: More than 100 polyps in a first-degree relative; More than 25 polyps in 2
             relatives in 2 generations, including a first-degree family member; Genetic diagnosis
             in a relative; Genetic diagnosis by in vitro synthesized truncated protein or similar
