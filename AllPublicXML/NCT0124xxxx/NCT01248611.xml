    <textblock>
      Traditionally cancer pain is treated with long acting opioids such as morphine around the
      clock. However, there is no evidence that all patients have a stable pain requiring around
      the clock medication. So far opioids for self-administration with a rapid onset of action
      have not been available. Recently a nasal formulation of fentanyl (an opioid similar to
      morphine) was released in Europe for treatment of breakthrough pain, i.e. an unpredictable
      pain with short duration that breaks through the otherwise stable pain controlled with the
      around the clock medication. The basic idea is that this formulation may open for patient
      controlled analgesia of chronic cancer pain, due to the ultra rapid onset of action of
      nasally delivered fentanyl. This means that the patient only takes medication when in pain.
      This single center feasibility / safety study is the first part of a study to investigate
      this alternative cancer pain treatment approach.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cancer patients with metastatic disease

          2. Adult (older than 18 years)

          3. Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          4. Cancer-related pain &gt; 3 on an 11 point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)

          5. In the need of opioids (step II or III)

          6. Able to use nasal drugs.

          7. Women of child bearing potential using adequate contraception

          8. Informed consent given according to applicable requirements before any trial-related
             activities. Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not have been
             performed during the routine management of the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of substance abuse

          2. Cognitive impairment which makes the patient unable to complete questionnaires or not
             able to comply with the study procedures

          3. Treated with MAO inhibitor within the last 14 days

          4. Known hypersensitivity to study drug or specific contraindications to the study drug

          5. Nasopharyngeal device such as gastric tube

          6. Concomitant participation in any other trials dealing with pain with an
             investigational drug or device apart from cancer treatment within 14 days prior to
             inclusion in this trial

          7. Pathological conditions of the nasal cavity as contraindication to nasal fentanyl

          8. Sleep apnoea syndrome

          9. Pregnant or breastfeeding women

         10. Psychiatric disease
