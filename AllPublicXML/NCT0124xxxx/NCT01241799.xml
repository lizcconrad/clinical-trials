      Purpose:

      To compare the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration biopsy
      (EUS-FNA) in patient with pancreatic masses with and without the use of a stylet in place
      within the biopsy needle.

      Hypothesis:

      In patients undergoing an EUS FNA for pancreatic indications, patients having a fine needle
      aspiration biopsy (FNA) without the internal stylet will have a greater diagnostic yield
      compared to those with the internal stylet.

      Justification:

      EUS-FNA is an increasingly important means of obtaining tissue samples from lesions within
      the thorax and abdomen. In experienced hands EUS-FNA is a safe alternative to more invasive
      procedures such as mediastinoscopy or laparoscopy. EUS-FNA can be used for sampling suspected
      cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic masses or cysts, submucosal gastric lesions, peripancreatic,
      perigastric or mediastinal lymph nodes and in some cases adrenal or liver masses. Therefore,
      it is a powerful tool for both diagnosis and tumour staging. For example, for the diagnosis
      of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is a common indication for EUS-FNA, the sensitivity
      varies from 75 to &gt;90%, with a specificity of 82-100% and a mean accuracy of 85%. Improving
      the diagnostic yield may lead to an earlier diagnosis with a reduced number of investigations
      and earlier institution of treatment for the patient.

      The FNA needle system consists of a 22 or 19 gauge needle which is manipulated by a handle
      piston that attaches to the biopsy channel of the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) linear scope.
      The tip of the needle has grooves to disperse ultrasound waves making the tip of the needle
      easily seen. The sample is taken by inserting a specially designed needle into the area of
      interest under EUS guidance. Inside the needle is a removable stylet with a rounded or
      bevelled tip to facilitate the passage of the needle into the tissue. The usual practice is
      for the stylet to be extracted after the needle has been passed into its optimum position
      within the tissue and for it to be re-inserted before each pass. However, a recent
      prospective trial with 111 patients, published in abstract form, found this approach was
      associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of adequate samples compared to
      when the stylet was removed before passing the needle. Although there was no significant
      difference in the diagnostic yield between the two groups this study raises the issue that
      the stylet left in place is to the detriment of the tissue sample and, ultimately, may reduce
      the diagnostic yield or increase the number of passes needed to obtain a satisfactory sample.

      One limitation to this study includes the heterogenous patient population. Yields of EUS-FNA
      vary considerably depending on the type of tissue being biopsied. The second limitation is
      that consecutive patients were randomized to having the stylet removed versus having the
      stylet not removed at the time of FNA. There is no control group from which to compare the
      two groups. An improvement in the study design would be to have each patient to be their own
      control group. Successive passes of the FNA needle can increase the bloodiness of the sample,
      so randomization of the order in which each group is done will help eliminate potential bias.

      It is clear from the current published literature that removing the stylet increases the
      cellularity of the sample. However, this increased cellularity may be the result of more
      contamination from the GI tract through which the FNA needle needs to pass in order to get an
      extra-luminal sample. Blood or a traumatic FNA can also lead to increased cellularity that
      can compromise diagnostic accuracy.

      Diagnostic yield depends on both adequacy of the sample and enough cells from the lesion to
      interpret. A preliminary result based on an air dried slide often can lead to fewer FNA
      passes if a diagnosis can be made. If this is not possible, a cell block preparation is made
      from all the washings from the EUS-FNA needle. No study has examined the diagnostic accuracy
      of these two types of samples using an EUS-FNA needle with and without the stylet within the
      same patient.

      Objectives:

      To determine if the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA is increased if the stylet is removed from
      the FNA needle compared with leaving it in place.

      Research Method:

      All patients referred for EUS who are also likely to require FNA will be screened for study
      eligibility by way of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After informed consent has been
      obtained patients will be randomized to 2 different groups by random number generation

        1. Stylet in FNA first, Stylet out FNA second

        2. Stylet out FNA first, Stylet in FNA second As each method of tissue sampling will be
           used for all patients they will effectively act as their own controls.

      In patients randomized to the first group the stylet in is left in place within the needle
      for the first three passes of the needle into the area to be sampled. A new 22 gauge EUS FNA
      is then used to obtain the FNA with the stylet out.

      In patients randomized to the second group a 22 gauge EUS FNA needle with the stylet out is
      used for the first three passes. A new needle with the stylet in is subsequently used for
      further sampling. Three passes will be done for each FNA biopsy.

      For each patient the sample adequacy, the number of bloody passes and the number of passes
      required to obtain an adequate sample will be recorded by the cytopathology technician. Each
      tissue sample will be prepared and analysed by experienced on-site cytopathology staff, who
      will be blinded to the group allocation of the respective patients. A positive or negative
      diagnosis will be recorded when the final cytology result is available. At the end of the
      study period a comparison between the two groups will be made in relation to the parameters
      outlined above.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Endpoints:

      The primary endpoint of our study will be the number of samples with a positive diagnosis in
      each group. Secondary end-points will be the number of bloody passes, the sample adequacy and
      the number of passes needed to obtain an adequate sample.

      Sample size calculation:

      The outcome will be represented as a proportion of FNA samples that have a positive
      diagnosis. The effect size between the stylet in FNA and stylet out FNA is expected to be
      30%. This is at a significance level of p= 0.05 and 80% power. The number of patients in each
      arm is therefore 36.

      Description of methodology All patients who are referred for a pancreatic EUS and are likely
      to require an FNA will be identified and screened for eligibility for entry into the study
      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those patients who are seen in the office
      prior to an EUS appointment will be invited to enter the study by a research nurse or
      research assistant not involved with the procedure. They will be provided with written and
      verbal information on the study prior to making their decision. For patients who are referred
      directly for an EUS-FNA from another physician and who are not seen in the office beforehand
      a written invitation to enter the study will be sent in advance. This will provide detailed
      information on the research proposal as well as a helpline number which patients can use to
      contact one of the study co-ordinators for further advice. A follow up phone call to patients
      will be made by a study co-ordinator before they attend for the EUS; the initial contact
      letter will outline when this call will be made, and by whom.

      If patients elect to enter into the study informed consent will be obtained prior to
      randomization.

      Summary of procedures In patients randomized to the first group, under intravenous sedation,
      a linear endoscopic ultrasound examination is performed. The pancreatic mass is identified by
      endoscopic ultrasound and using a 22 gauge EUS FNA needle with the stylet in is used for the
      first pass. The stylet is then withdrawn and 10cc of suction is applied to the FNA needle. A
      sample is obtained by moving the needle in and out of the lesion for a minimum of 15 times.
      The sample is then collected for cytopathology. The stylet is replaced in the needle and
      another pass is performed by the same technique. Three passes will be done for each FNA
      biopsy. A new 22 gauge EUS FNA is then used to obtain the FNA with the stylet out by the same
      technique as outlined above.

      In patients randomized to the second group, under intravenous sedation a linear endoscopic
      ultrasound examination is performed. The pancreatic mass is identified by endoscopic
      ultrasound and using a 22 gauge EUS FNA needle with the stylet out is used for the first
      pass. The stylet is then withdrawn and 10cc of suction is applied to the FNA needle. A sample
      is obtained by moving the needle in and out of the lesion for a minimum of 15 times. The
      sample is then collected for cytopathology. The stylet is replaced in the needle and once
      loaded into position, the stylet is removed prior to starting another pass performed by the
      same technique. Three passes will be done for each FNA biopsy.

      Adverse events that can potentially occur include oversedation (1:500), pancreatitis
      (1:1000), perforation (1:5000), and bleeding (extremely rare with only one reported case in
      press) For each patient the sample adequacy, the number of bloody passes and the number of
      passes required to obtain an adequate sample will be recorded by the cytopathology
      technician. Each tissue sample will be prepared and analysed by experienced on-site
      cytopathology staff, who will be blinded to the group allocation of the respective patients.
      A positive or negative diagnosis will be recorded when the final cytology result is
      available. At the end of the study period a comparison between the two groups will be made in
      relation to the parameters outlined above.

      Follow-up:

      Within one day, all patients will be contacted to determine if any adverse events have
      occurred.
