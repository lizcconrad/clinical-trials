  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the allergen-induced late asthmatic response (LAR),
      as measured by maximal percent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, in participants
      with stable mild atopic asthma after treatment with JNJ 40929837 as compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), randomized (the study medication
      is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor participant will know which
      of the treatments a participant is receiving, but can access the information in case of an
      emergency), and crossover (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to
      another in a clinical study) study. Approximately 18 participants will participate in the
      study. The study will consist of screening phase (30 days before the administration of study
      drug), treatment phase, and follow-up phase (2 weeks after the end of the last treatment
      period). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive JNJ 40929837, placebo, and
      montelukast. Each participant will receive all the 3 treatments (7 days per treatment) and
      each treatment will be separated by 14 days of wash-out period (no treatment). Safety
      evaluations will include assessments of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination, which will be evaluated throughout
      the study. The maximum study duration for a participant will be approximately 51 days.
