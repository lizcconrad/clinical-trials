      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate leakage, handling and comfort of a new
      ostomy appliance compared to SenSura.

      Peristomal skin problems are reported to have a negative impact on the quality of life of
      people with a stoma and cause one third of all visits to a stoma care nurse. Stoma effluent
      in contact with the peristomal skin (leakage) appears to predispose patients to peristomal
      skin problems.

      To protect the skin against effluent, the appliance used for collection of stoma effluent
      should completely cover the peristomal skin close to the stoma. Coloplast has developed a new
      ostomy appliance to improve the feeling of security and increase comfort by the appliance
      characteristics.

      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate leakage, handling and comfort of a new
      ostomy appliance compared to SenSura.

      The study is a randomised controlled cross-over intervention study, where all study
      participants will test two test products (new ostomy appliance and SenSura). Each test period
      will last 10 ± 2 days and the subjects will follow their usual wear and change pattern. The
      participants will visit the study investigator at study start and at cross-over. Evaluation
      of the test products will occur via questionnaires the subjects fill in at home.

      50 healthy subjects with a colostomy will be included in the study.

SenSura used in this trial is a 1-piece closed ostomy product consisting of a base plate and a bag. The intended use is collecting output from a stoma (e.g. a ileostomy or a colostomy).
Both SS and SenSura is changed 1 till 6 times a day, depending on when the bag is full, or if there is leakage.
The difference between the two products is the adhesive on the base plate where SS have a softer adhesive than SenSura. It is this soft adhesive we wanted to test.</description>

            <description>CE marked and launched SenSura used in this trial is a 1-piece closed ostomy product consisting of a base plate and a bag. The intended use is collecting output from a stoma (e.g. a ileostomy or a colostomy).
Both SS and SenSura is changed 1 till 6 times a day, depending on when the bag is full, or if there is leakage.
The difference between the two products is the adhesive on the base plate where SS have a softer adhesive than SenSura. It is this soft adhesive we wanted to test.</description>
