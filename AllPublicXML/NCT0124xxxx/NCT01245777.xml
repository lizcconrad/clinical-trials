      In pregnancy Restless Legs Syndrome(RLS) is more common than in the general population.
      During pregnancy iron tablets are the only available safe medication but their efficacy is
      rather poor. It is the aim of this study to examine the efficacy, practicability and safety
      of the drug Ferinject® containing the active agent Ferric carboxymaltose for the therapy of
      Restless Legs Syndrome(RLS) during pregnancy in the case of iron deficiency or anaemia.

      20 women with RLS and iron deficiency and/ or anaemia in the third trimester of pregnancy
      will receive intravenous Ferric carboxymaltose in one or two single doses. Repeated blood
      tests, pre-and post-therapy actigraphy as well as repeated answering of questionnaires
      concerning Restless Legs Syndrome(RLS)-symptoms and sleep quality will show the effect of
      iv-Iron supplementation on Restless Legs Syndrome(RLS)-symptoms during pregnancy.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Pregnant women, singleton pregnancy, in the 3rd trimester

          2. Iron Deficiency (Anaemia) defined as Serum Ferritin &lt; 35ug/l with or without Hb &lt;
             11g/dl.

          3. Fulfilling the 4 criteria of the International Restless Legs Study Group (IRLSS)

               -  Uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs

               -  An urge to move the legs due to this discomfort and worsening of the symptoms

               -  The unpleasant sensations are being relieved by movement such as walking or
                  stretching

               -  Worsening of the symptoms in the evening or night

          4. RLS score &gt; 20 (defined as modest to severe RLS symptoms) or RLS symptoms = 3 times
             per week

             medication).

             and multiple sclerosis
