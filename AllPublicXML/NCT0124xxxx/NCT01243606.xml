      Anxiety disorders are common, chronic, costly, debilitating to quality of life, and are more
      prevalent than any other class of disorders in every country in the world where surveys have
      been taken. Deepening understanding of the nature of anxiety and related emotional disorders
      during the last decade has revealed that commonalities in etiology and latent structure among
      these disorders supersedes differences. At the same time, examination of extant single
      diagnosis psychological treatment protocols (SDPs) for these disorders underscores
      mechanistic similarities. These findings suggested the possibility of distilling a set of
      psychological procedures that would comprise an innovative Unified Protocol for
      Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP), and this protocol has now been
      developed. If efficacious, the UP may represent a more efficient and possibly more effective
      strategy which would render treatment implications of comorbidity, not otherwise specified
      (NOS) and subdefinitional threshold anxiety disorder conditions moot.

      The investigators now propose an evaluation of the efficacy of the UP in a group of patients
      with heterogeneous anxiety disorders by way of rigorous comparisons to existing evidence
      based SDPs benchmarked against a wait list control condition, using both statistical
      equivalence and superiority analyses. Additional aims include determining the durability of
      the UP relative to comparison conditions after treatment discontinuation, and ascertaining
      the differential impact of treatments on disorder specific symptoms vs. higher-order
      temperamental variables. Further analyses will indicate if changes in these higher order
      temperamental variables mediate long-term outcome as preliminary data suggests, and if this
      mechanism of action differs among treatments.

      The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate efficacy of the recently developed Unified
      Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP). This protocol takes
      advantage of recent advances in our understanding of the nature of anxiety disorders, as well
      as emerging knowledge of the process of regulation and change in anxious behavior, in order
      to distill and refine basic principles of successful psychological treatments for anxiety
      disorders. It is expected that this approach will simplify training and dissemination,
      provide better coverage for comorbid conditions, cover &quot;not otherwise specified&quot; (NOS) and
      sub-definitional threshold presentations, possibly improve efficacy particularly in the long
      term, and perhaps also shed further light on the nature of anxiety disorders.

      A heterogeneous sample of 250 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for at least one of four
      anxiety disorders: Social Phobia (SAD), Panic Disorder with or without Agoraphobia (PD/A),
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) will be randomized
      to one of three treatment cells: (1) the Unified Protocol (UP); (2) a single diagnosis
      psychological treatment protocol (SDP); or (3) Wait List (WL). A minimum of 50 patients from
      each of the 4 principal diagnostic categories will be included in the randomization to ensure
      adequate representation of each anxiety disorder. The study will consist of two phases: (1) a
      12 or 16 week acute treatment phase (or 16 week WL) and (2) a 12-month follow-up phase,
      during which active treatments will be discontinued and patients will be followed to assess
      the long-term effects of treatment (outcome measures are discussed below). Patients
      randomized to the WL condition will not enter the post-treatment period. Rather, they will be
      immediately assigned to their choice of either UP or SDP treatment at the end of the sixteen
      week waiting period.

      All assessment and treatment procedures will be conducted at the Center for Anxiety and
      Related Disorders (CARD) at Boston University, which is one of the largest research clinics
      devoted to anxiety and related emotional disorders in the world. Total duration for
      participation in the study will not exceed 18 months total.

      The major aims of this proposal are to:

      Primary Aims

      Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of the UP applied to a group of patients with heterogeneous
      anxiety disorders as compared to a group receiving existing evidence-based single diagnosis
      treatment protocols (SDPs) benchmarked against a wait list control condition (WL) to
      determine the treatment responsiveness of the sample on common measures of outcome.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of both the UP and SDPs relative to a benchmark WL condition.

      Aim 3: Determine long-term efficacy of UP relative to SDPs over a 1-year period following
      treatment discontinuation.

      Aim 4: Examine the relative effects of each active treatment approach (UP &amp; SDPs) on comorbid
      anxiety and depressive disorder severity.

      Secondary Aims

      Aim 5: Ascertain the relative effects of each active treatment on higher-order temperamental
      indices.

      Aim 6: Determine if change in higher order temperamental variables mediates long term
      outcome.

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 4 weeks during a 16 week treatment or waitlist period, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ADIS is a semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to establish reliable DSM anxiety, mood, somatoform and substance use disorders. For each current diagnosis, interviewers assigned a 0-8 clinical severity rating (CSR) that indicates their judgment of the degree of distress and impairment associated with the disorder (0=none to 8=very severely disturbing/disabling). The information derived from the interview using the ADIS allows clinicians to determine differential diagnoses and gain a clear understanding of the level and severity of each diagnosis.</description>

    <description>The SIGH-A and SIGH-D were developed to create a structured format for administering the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS; Hamilton, 1959) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD; Hamilton, 1960).
