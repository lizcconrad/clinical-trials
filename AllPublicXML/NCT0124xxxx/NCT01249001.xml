  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the absorption of a prepared aprepitant
      oral suspension with that of the aprepitant capsule in children being treated with
      chemotherapy agents that are likely to cause vomiting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiemetic therapies have improved in recent years, but chemotherapy-induced nausea and
      vomiting (CINV) are still common and are among the most distressing side effects of
      chemotherapy. In a recent survey, parents of children receiving chemotherapy in Ontario
      centres identified nausea as the fourth most prevalent and bothersome treatment-related
      symptom experienced by their children. Aprepitant is commercially available in Canada as
      capsules. An oral liquid aprepitant formulation would be ideal for oral administration to
      children.
