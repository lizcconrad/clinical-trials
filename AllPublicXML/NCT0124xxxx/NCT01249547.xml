      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the activity and safety
      of single-agent axitinib in recurrent or metastatic NPC patients who failed at least one line
      of platinum based chemotherapy.

          -  Age 18 or above; ECOG performance 0 or 1.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic reserve.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of central lung lesions involving major blood vessels;

          -  History of hemoptysis or epistaxis within 4 weeks;

          -  Preexisting uncontrolled hypertension defined as more than 140/90 mmHg despite
