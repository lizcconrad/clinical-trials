    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the frequency and severity of postoperative( after
      surgery) pain between two surgical techniques for treating severe hemorrhoids. The two
      techniques are called: transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) and standard surgical
      excision (removal) of the hemorrhoids
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The THD technique involves using ultrasound equipment to identify the arteries that are
      feeding blood into the hemorrhoids. Once located, stitches are placed around those arteries
      to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoids, which destroys them.

      In the standard surgical excision technique, the hemorrhoids are removed by cutting them out
      with a scalpel.

      Both techniques are widely used in many hospitals today. However, there have been no formal
      studies comparing the two techniques regarding outcomes, particularly regarding pain after
      the procedure. We plan to enroll 60 patients in this study here at Stony Brook; 30 patients
      will have THD and 30 will have the standard surgical excision of hemorrhoids.

    <description>This is a modification of the Milligan-Morgan technique, whereby the incisions are totally or partially closed with absorbable running suture. A retractor is used to expose the hemorrhoidal tissue, which is then removed surgically. The remaining tissue is either sutured or is sealed through the coagulation effects of a surgical device.</description>

    <description>Transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization will be performed using an endoscopic ultrasonic probe. Approximately 7-8 hemorrhoidal arteries will be ligated at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 o'clock position as previously described in the literature. The ligation will be performed using a vicryl suture. The ultrasonic probe locates the arterial signal.</description>

        diagnosis of 3rd or 4th degree hemorrhoids requiring hemorrhoidectomy will be invited to
        participate in this study. The diagnosis of hemorrhoids will be established by a colorectal
        surgeon based on following criteria:

          1. physical exam

          2. anoscopy or proctoscopy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. first and second degree hemorrhoids

          2. recurrent hemorrhoids after previous surgical treatment
