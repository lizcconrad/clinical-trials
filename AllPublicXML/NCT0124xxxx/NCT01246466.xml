  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate how safe a less invasive cardiac
      surgery is using the AtriCure Bipolar System combined with a catheter ablation procedure in
      treating AF, and how effective this combined procedure is using the AtriCure System in
      treating AF. The AtriCure Bipolar System will be used to perform the less invasive cardiac
      surgery and a standard electrophysiology catheter, currently available, will be used to
      perform the catheter ablation procedure. This surgical procedure is considered less invasive
      because it is done through tiny surgical punctures on the sides of the chest near the ribs
      instead of one large surgical incision of the breast bone to completely open the chest and
      access the heart, and it also avoids the need for the heart-lung bypass machine.
