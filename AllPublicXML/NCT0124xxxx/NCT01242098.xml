    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether beclomethasone dipropionate / formoterol
      (BDP/FOR; Fostair® 100/6) is at least equivalent in terms of exacerbation prevention to
      fluticasone dipropionate / salmeterol (FP/SAL; Seretide® 125) in matched asthma patients
      switching to BDP/FOR following treatment with FP/SAL in normal clinical practice compared
      with patients not switched.
