      The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and tolerability of short-term
      omega-3 fatty acids monotherapy in youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The
      investigators hypothesize that Omega-3 fatty acids will be efficacious in improving the core
      and associated features of ASD in youth, and that Omega-3 fatty acids monotherapy will be
      safe and well tolerated by youth with ASD. The secondary aim of this study is to examine the
      neuropsychological effect of Omega-3 fatty acids monotherapy in youth with ASD. The
      investigators hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acids will be efficacious in improving cognitive
      functions in youth with ASD.

    <description>Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders will be randomized to receive either 1500mg (3 capsules) omega-3 fatty acids or placebo. Each 500mg capsule contains 350mg EPA and 50mg DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids dosing will be on a forced titration schedule to 3 capsules per day. All subjects will start with 1 capsule per day with an increase to 3 capsules per day by week 2. Subjects will be maintained at 3 capsules per day thereafter until the end of the trial (completion/discontinuation). During the 12 weeks of the study period, participants will be evaluated at weekly intervals during the first three weeks of the trial (baseline, weeks 1-3) and tri-weekly thereafter till the end of the trial (weeks 6, 9 and 12). At each visit, measures of safety and effectiveness will be administered and subjects will be evaluated for response and side effects to the treatment. Study medications will be prescribed under double blind conditions.</description>

Each 500mg capsule contains 350mg EPA and 50mg DHA. Omega-3 fatty acids dosing will be on a forced titration schedule to 3 capsules per day. All subjects will start with 1 capsule per day with an increase to 3 capsules per day by week 2. Subjects will be maintained at 3 capsules per day thereafter until the end of the trial (completion/discontinuation). During the 12 weeks of the study period, participants will be evaluated at weekly intervals during the first three weeks of the trial (baseline, weeks 1-3) and tri-weekly thereafter till the end of the trial (weeks 6, 9 and 12). At each visit, measures of safety and effectiveness will be administered and subjects will be evaluated for response and side effects to the treatment.
