      The Objective of this study is to introduce a practically feasible multifaceted intervention
      in the preadmission clinic to help reduce smoking in preoperative surgical patients. The
      investigators aim to study the effectiveness of such a program in promoting positive change
      in smoking behavior among patients before surgery. The forced abstinence enforced on patients
      during hospital stay for their surgery can also be used to help smokers remain tobacco free
      long term. A significant percentage of surgical patients will be receptive to smoking
      cessation interventions in the preadmission clinic and will refrain from smoking at 24 and 52
      weeks after starting the treatment.
