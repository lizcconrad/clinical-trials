    <textblock>
      Lung cancer and esophageal cancer remain the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. The
      main problem is lack of effective tool in early detection that accounts for the poor outcome
      of cancer. Clinically, over 80% of patients with cancer were at late stage when they were
      diagnosed. Therefore, it is important for us to find the biomarker that serve as the early
      prediction of cancer.

      The investigators have published that VEGFC over-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer.
      VEGFC plays a critical role in regulating motility of tumor cells, promotes proliferation of
      lymphatic endothelial cells and enhances migration and invasion. Investigator found that
      VEGFC over-expressed in the serum of esophageal cancer patients. Therefore, it is worthwhile
      to investigate the correlation between VEGFC, clinical lung cancer and esophageal cancer.

      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved, endogenous, small, and noncoding RNA molecules of 21~23
      nucleotides that function as post-transcriptional gene regulators. Recent studies indicated
      that certain microRNAs reduced in cancer patients. Therefore it is important to investigate
      whether specific microRNA changed in certain kinds of cancer patients.
