  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the immunogenicity and safety and tolerability of two
      consecutive doses of H5 VLP Influenza vaccine given 21 days apart, at three dose levels: in
      part A: 20 µg, 30 µg and 45 µg combined with Alhydrogel® 1%, or 45 µg without Alhydrogel®,
      compared to the placebo, (100mM phosphate buffer + 150mM NaCl + 0.01% Tween 80).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An adaptive design is proposed for this phase 2 trial. Part A of this study will consist of
      dose-ranging in 135 subjects who will be randomized to receive one injection of either 20 µg,
      30 µg or 45 µg H5 VLP Influenza vaccine combined with Alhydrogel®, or 45 µg without
      Alhydrogel®, or the placebo preparation, (100mM phosphate buffer + 150mM NaCl + 0.01% Tween
      80) at Days 0 and 21. Seven-day (7) safety data after the first immunization for subjects in
      all five treatment groups will be tabulated and reviewed by a panel consisting of 2 external
      medical advisors, prior to permitting the second immunization of vaccine/placebo for all
      treatment groups at Day 21 (Part A). Twenty-one (21) days after the last subject vaccine
      administration in Part A, all safety and immunogenicity data will be collected and analysed
      to determine the optimal dose level. Following selection of the optimal dose, Part B of the
      trial will commence and consist of administration of the selected optimal dose(s) in one
      hundred (100) subjects, plus administration of placebo in twenty (20) subjects (total of 120
      subjects in part B). These subjects will similarly receive two vaccinations 21 days apart and
      will be followed in the exact same fashion as Part A, except that there will be no 7-day
      safety analysis. Depending on data analysis one or a maximum of two vaccine doses could be
      selected to be further evaluated during part B of the trial. All Part A and B subjects will
      be followed for safety until Day 228.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric

             first vaccination up to blood sampling at Day 42 or within 30 days prior to blood
             sampling at Day 228. Immunization on an emergency basis of a tetanus and diphtheria
             toxoids adsorbed for adult use (Td) will be allowed provided the vaccine is not
             administered within two weeks prior to test article administration. Receipt of any

             birth control is oral contraceptives, hormone implants, abstinence (confirmed by
             Investigator), or male condom plus spermicide. All female subjects, regardless of
             birth control history must provide a serum sample for pregnancy screening. Effective
             birth control must be used for the duration of the study for female of child bearing
             potential must have no plan to become pregnant during the study period.;

          -  Among female subjects, either known pregnancy or urine beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (ß-hCG) test results consistent with pregnancy prior to test article
