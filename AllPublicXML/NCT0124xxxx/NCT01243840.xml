      Purpose of the study

        1. The predictive value of central aortic pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) in
           a Japanese population is not known. The purpose of this study is to quantify the
           predictive value of these indices in the determination of cardiovascular risk.

        2. Recently, a non-invasive method to separate the aortic pressure waveform into the
           separate ejection pressure wave and reflected pressure wave has become available. With
           this decomposition method, it is possible to estimate aortic PWV (named AVI). The second
           objective of this study is to determine if AVI can be a substitute for carotid-femoral
           PWV (cf-PWV), the current gold standard for aortic PWV measurement.

        3. To study vascular aging of the Japanese population by evaluating central blood pressure
           and aortic PWV by age, and compare these values to similar studies done in Caucasian and
           Chinese patient populations.

        4. To study the relationship between the magnitude of the aortic reflected pressure wave
           and the degree of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and LV diastolic function.
