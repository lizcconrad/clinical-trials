    <textblock>
      The management of glioblastoma in elderly patients with poor performance status (KPS&lt;70) is
      unsettled. This single arm phase 2 trial trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of temozolomide alone in this population

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of survival and quality of life,
      and safety of up-front temozolomide in elderly GBM patients with poor performance status.

      Patients of 70 years of age or older were eligible to participate in this prospective
      non-randomised multicentric phase II study if they had newly diagnosed and histologically
      proven glioblastoma on the basis of the WHO classification, and a postoperative KPS between
      30 and 60.

      Treatment consisted of temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks
      for a maximum of 12 cycles or until disease progression or prohibited toxicity.

      Patients were assessed at least every month by means of physical and neurological
      examinations, KPS, health-related EORTC questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20), and MMSE.
      Complete blood counts and blood chemistry were drawn before each temozolomide cycle; the
      earlier were also checked every 10 days during the first 2 cycles and every 2 weeks
      afterwards. CT or MRI studies were repeated every 2 months.
