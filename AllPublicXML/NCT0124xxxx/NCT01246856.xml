  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with breastcancer in the past, were treated with TAC. These last years, there
      is more and more focus on the effects of chemotherapy, particularly in children treated with
      this. One of these effects is damage to the heart muscle, which ultimately might affect the
      pump-function of the heart . In adults, the effect of treatment with TAC on the heart, has
      not been previously investigated. The possibility exists that the adverse reactions in
      children are found in adults also could occur. Therefore we have initiated this trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the lack of data on the incidence of subclinical cardiotoxicity after treatment with
      TAC we want to assess whether subclinical cardiovascular damage is present in adult patients
      with breast cancer who have completed treatment with (neo)adjuvant TAC one year previously,
      using MIBG (meta-iodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy, novel echocardiographic techniques and
      blood biomarkers. Following the study by Lipshultz et al. we expect to find at least in 25%
      of the patients signs of subclinical cardiovascular damage with at least one of the three
      techniques.(11) If at least 10% is observed we will conclude that it is useful to further
      pursue the use of these techniques for the detection of subclinical cardiotoxicity in a next
      clinical study which will be powered to assess the predictive value of these techniques for
      the development of clinical heart failure. If a lower percentage is observed we will conclude
      that it is not useful to further pursue the use of these techniques for the detection of
      subclinical cardiotoxicity.
