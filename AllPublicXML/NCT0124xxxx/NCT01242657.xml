    <textblock>
      The long term goal of the study entitled &quot;Quit &amp; Fit&quot; was to revise, evaluate, and
      disseminate the American Lung Association´s (ALA) teen smoking cessation program called Not
      On Tobacco (N—O—T), with an added physical activity module. The physical activity module was
      intended to encourage youth to adopt a more physically active lifestyle. Research showed that
      physical activity may increase the odds of smoking cessation. The general N—O—T program goals
      are to help adolescents quit smoking; reduce cigarette use (for participants who are unable
      to completely quit); increase healthy lifestyle behaviors; and improve life skills such as
      stress management, decision making, communication, and interpersonal skills. The primary aim
      of the current research project was to reduce smoking among West Virginia teens. A two—prong
      secondary aim was to (a) increase participants´ physical activity behavior by supplementing
      the intervention with a physical activity component and (b) assess the mediating/moderating
      impact of physical activity on cessation outcomes. If participants quit smoking, the
      likelihood that they will develop smoking—related diseases is diminished. Participating in
      this project may aid smoking cessation and therefore improve participants´ health. Research
      was conducted among 19 of the 123 West Virginia public high schools. 236 teens were recruited
      to participate in the study over 3 years. This study is a clinical behavioral trial using a
      3-group design, with subsequent random assignment.
