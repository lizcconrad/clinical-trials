  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) test the safety of the vaccine to find out what effects,
      good and/or bad, it has, and 2) to find out if the vaccine stimulates the immune system. The
      vaccine in this study will contain several parts. The first part is called an antigen. These
      antigens or &quot;fingerprints&quot; are found on many cancer cells, especially from the ovaries,
      fallopian tubes, or peritoneal cavity (inside lining of the abdomen) The purpose of this
      study is to see if investigators can help the immune system to recognize that cancer cells
      are not normal and should be removed.

    <description>immunization with the unimolecular pentavalent carbohydrate-based vaccine bearing Globo-H, GM2, sTn, TF and Tn on a single polypeptide backbone, conjugated to KLH, mixed with the immunological adjuvant QS-21, induces an IgG and IgM antibody response against these individual antigens and tumor cells expressing these antigens.</description>

    <description>This trial will investigate the safety and immune responses following immunization with the unimolecular pentavalent Globo-H-GM2-sTn-TF-Tn-KLH conjugate, plus the immunological adjuvant QS-21. This is a phase I study to assess toxicity and immunogenicity.</description>

    <description>The injection will be administered subcutaneously during weeks 1, 2, 3, 7 and 19, totaling five injections over the course of the study. Three dose levels are planned: 25 mcg, 50 mcg and 100 mcg. We plan to vaccinate six patients at each dose level unless 2 dose limiting toxicities are observed, and an expansion cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled at the highest dose level achieved.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any histologically documented stage III or IV epithelial carcinoma arising in the
             ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum.

          -  History of cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy with at least one platinum-based
             chemotherapy regimen as part of primary treatment.

          -  Patients must be in a first complete clinical remission. Complete clinical remission
             is defined as serum CA-125 within institutional normal limits, negative physical
             examination, and no definite evidence of disease by computed tomography (CT) of the
             abdomen and pelvis. Lymph nodes and/or soft tissue abnormalities ≤ 1.0cm are often
             present in the pelvis and will not be considered definite evidence of disease.
             Eligibility is determined by anatomical imaging only (ie. MRI or CT). Positive PET
             image (if performed) will not exclude a patient if other criteria are met and
             anatomical imaging is negative.

          -  Adequate organ function defined by

          -  Bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to
             1,000/mm³, grade 1. Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm³.

          -  Renal function: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x institutional upper limit
             normal (ULN), CTCAE v4.0 grade 1.

          -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin, SGOT, and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5
             x ULN

          -  Negative stool hemoccult (or negative endoscopic evaluation if positive). External
             hemorrhoids are a common source of a positive hemoccult and should not exclude
             patients.

          -  TSH not elevated above normal range

          -  KPS &gt; or = to 80%.

          -  Patients have signed the informed consent document and signed the authorization
             permitting release of personal health information.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patients must have recovered from clinically significant side effects from prior
             chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Patients with other invasive malignancies who had (or have) any evidence of the other
             cancer present within the last 5 years, or whose previous cancer treatment
             contraindicated this protocol therapy are excluded. Non-melanoma skin cancers are an
             exception and will not exclude any patient.

          -  Patients with a history of a seafood allergy.

          -  Patients who have previously received a vaccine with any of the antigens in the
             current trial.

          -  Patients with a history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease (excluding treated
             hypothyroidism).

          -  Patients with active CNS tumor.
