      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of new formulations of GSK
      Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (GSK217744) when administered as a primary vaccination
      course to healthy infants at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.

        <description>A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). All the available blood samples initially tested with ELISA were re-tested using the Chemi Luminescence Immuno Assay (CLIA) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis. Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in milli-International units per milliliter (mIU/mL).</description>
