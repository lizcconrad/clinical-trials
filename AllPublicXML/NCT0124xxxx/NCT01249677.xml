  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose-induced insulin secretion is often diminished in hyperglycaemic patients with type 2
      diabetes. The investigators examined, whether chronic basal insulin treatment with insulin
      glargine lead to improvements in glucose-induced insulin secretion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      14 patients with type 2 diabetes on previous metformin therapy were examined before and after
      eight weeks of treatment with insulin glargine, aimed to normalize fasting glycaemia.
      Intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed with and without previous adjustment of
      fasting glucose levels by means of a 3-hour intravenous insulin infusion.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 18 and 75 years, inclusive

          2. BMI-range 27-50 kg/mÂ²

          3. patients with type 2 diabetes presenting with fasting hyperglycaemia (&gt;126mg/dl) on
             metformin treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1.Pre-existing insulin therapy, treatment with sulphonylureas, glitazones, 2.glinides,
        DPP-4-inhibitors or exenatide 3.patients with type 1 diabetes 4.Patients are investigator
        site personnel directly affiliated with the study, or are immediate family of investigator
        site personnel directly affiliated with the study. Immediate family is defined as a spouse,
        parent, child, or sibling, whether biological or legally adopted.

        5. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become
        pregnant or are not using adequate contraceptive methods (adequate contraceptive measures
        include sterilisation, hormonal intrauterine devices, oral contraceptives, sexual
        abstinence or vasectomised partner). A male subject who is sexually active and has not been
        surgically sterilised must be informed that he must either use a condom during intercourse,
        ensure that his partner practices contraception, or he must refrain from sexual intercourse
        during the trial and until 1 month after completion of the trial. This is to prevent the
        possibility of a pregnancy from spermatocytes that can potentially be damaged by trial
        medication. It is strongly recommended that the female partners use a highly effective
        contraception (Pearl Index &lt; 1%).

        6. Patients have participated in an interventional medical, surgical, or pharmaceutical
        study (a study in which an experimental, drug, medical, or surgical treatment was given)
        within 30 days prior to screening. This criterion includes drugs that have not received
        regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

        7. Patients have alcohol consumption (&gt;20 g daily for males and &gt;10 g daily for females) 8.
        Patients have alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) greater than ten times the upper limit of the
        reference range.

        9.Patients are undergoing therapy for a malignancy, other than basal cell or squamous cell
        skin cancer.

        10. Patients have cardiac disease that is Class III or IV, according to the New York Heart
        Association criteria.

        11. Patients have a history of renal transplantation or are currently receiving renal
        dialysis or have serum creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dL for males and greater than or equal to &gt;1.5
        mg/dL for females. 12.Patients have known hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia 13.Patients
        are receiving chronic (lasting longer than 2 weeks) systemic glucocorticoid therapy
        (excluding topical and inhaled preparations) or have received such therapy within 2 weeks
        immediately prior to screening.

        14. Patients have any other condition (including known drug or alcohol abuse or psychiatric
        disorder) that precludes them from following and completing the protocol, in the opinion of
        the investigator.

        15. Patients fail to satisfy the investigator of suitability to participate for any other
        reason.
