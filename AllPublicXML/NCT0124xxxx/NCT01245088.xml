      Pilot trial of open-label chondroitin sulfate 400 mg TID for adult patients with mild to
      moderate Crohn's disease. Primary endpoint with be evidence of bilogic effect assessed
      through serum and tissue cytokine analysis. Secondary endpoints are evidence of clinical
      effect, endoscopic healing, and histologic improvment. Trial duration is 8 weeks.
