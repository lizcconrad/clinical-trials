  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently our ICU research group developed and validated a delirium prediction model in the
      NetherlandsThis. This model has a high predictive value. We want to examine what the
      predictive value is in ICUs of other European countries.

    <textblock>
      Delirium is a serious and common disorder in ICU patients. It is increasingly recognized that
      screening of ICU patients is a valuable tool for early detection and treatment of delirium,
      which may reduce its incidence, severity and duration. Apart from treatment of delirium,
      delirium prevention (pharmacological and nursing interventions)is an important issue.
      However, it is time consuming to take preventive measures in all ICU patients. The recently
      developed prediction model facilitates the conduct of preventive measures focused on high
      risk groups. This prediction model is developed and validated in the Netherlands. The aim of
      our study is to investigate the predictive value of the model in ICUs in other countries.
