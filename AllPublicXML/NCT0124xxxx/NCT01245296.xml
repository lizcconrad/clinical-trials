  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed clamping of the umbilical cord might prevent or slow the onset of iron deficiency by
      increasing the infant's iron endowment at birth. Compared with early clamping, a delay of
      around 2-3 min provides an additional 25-40 mL of blood per kg of bodyweight.

      The results of previous intervention studies on delayed clamping are mixed, and few followed
      up infants beyond the perinatal period. All longer follow up studies have been performed in
      low income countries. The main objectives, therefore, was to assess whether delayed cord
      clamping improves hematological and iron status at 4 respective 12 months of age in a large
      sample of full-term, Swedish infants.

      The investigators also choose to investigate if the timing of clamping the umbilical cord
      could affect rate of infections during the first four months of life and to assess the
      infants development at 4 and 12 months of age.

    <measure>Are the rates of successful umbilical arterial samples equal between the groups?</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after birth (within 30 seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial blood samples are obtained with different methods between groups: in the early clamped group samples are taken from the placental part of the clamped cord, in the delayed clamped group samples are taken before clamping in the still pulsating cord. At the same time umbilical venous samples are obtained. A arterial blood sample is assessed as successful when ph &lt; 0.2 and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) &gt; 0.5 kPa compared to the venous sample.</description>
