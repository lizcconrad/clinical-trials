      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise
      intervention for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients interested in reducing
      symptoms. The investigators expect that this project will contribute much needed knowledge
      about the role that aerobic exercise can play in managing the effects of OCD. If
      moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is efficacious in helping individuals with OCD manage
      obsessions and compulsions, this will establish that aerobic exercise may be a valuable
      adjunct to other OCD treatments such as medication and therapy.
