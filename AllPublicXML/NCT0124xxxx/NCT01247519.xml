  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, Taiwan's population has become an aging society since recent decade. Those older
      than 65 years had achieved 10.4% in 2008. Meanwhile, the proportion of hosts with underlying
      comorbid illness or immunocomprised status is increasing worldwide. In the trend of aging
      population, telehealth care will be important to extend the care system in
      post-hospitalization home care. In the past, thelehealth care has shown a good executive
      performance in the patients with congestive heart failure and post-operation follow-up.
      However, in dealing the patients with acute illness needing hospitalization, the telehealth
      system has not implemented yet. In regard to National health insurance (NHI) of Taiwan,
      hospitalization costs a lot in overall budget. Reduction of re-hospitalization in those
      with/without co-morbidity is a important issue for Taiwan NHI. Therefore, we plan to conduct
      the telehealth care system in post-hospitalization course in those admitted from emergency
      department. We observe the re-hospitalization rate and analyze the risk factors. In addition,
      we hypothesize the telehealth care will decrease the rate of re-hospitalization.
