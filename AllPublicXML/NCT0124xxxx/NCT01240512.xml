  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 6-month follow-up trial of low (400 IU/day)
      versus high (4000 IU/day) dose vitamin D supplementation in individuals with pre- and early
      stage 1 hypertension and vitamin D deficiency. A total of 530 participants (265 participants
      per treatment arm) will be randomized between 3 sites. Approximately 2,250 participants will
      be screened between the 3 sites. Vital signs, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring,
      clinical laboratory safety tests and adverse event assessments will be performed to evaluate
      the effectiveness of the two doses of vitamin D on blood pressure. Blood samples will be
      stored for future biomarker assessments. The total duration of the study is anticipated to be
      18 months, assuming a 12 month enrollment period.
