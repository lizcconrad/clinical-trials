  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an
      exercised-based programme developed for older people admitted at a geriatric outpatient
      clinic and to see if a home-exercise program enhances the effect. The outcomes considered is
      health-related quality of life, balance-self confidence, balance and mobility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older people discharge from hospital often have decreased functional and physiological
      reserve that make them vulnerable of being dependent of others. Research have shown that
      older people discharge from hospital are vulnerable for functional decline during hospital
      stay and this decline can persist 6 to 18 months after discharge from hospital.Exercise
      interventions are proven to have effect on mobility, balance and falls among
      community-dwelling older people and several studies have shown that deconditioning as a
      consequence of disuse is reversible with training even in very old individuals. However, few
      studies have evaluated the effects of physical activity promotion and exercise intervention
      among elderly recently discharge from a geriatric outpatient clinic.

    <description>The aim of the intervention was to enhance health-related quality of life, self-efficacy and physical function through education and exercise. The education program consisted of information given both oral and in writing regarding the benefits of physical activity. The aim was to increase the participants knowledge about the benefits of physical activity and to stimulate them to integrate physical activity into their immediate environment during daily routines. They were given an exercise-log and were advised to write down all their daily activities and exercise. The exercise program were conducted 2 times per week for 45 min per session. The content of these sessions were balance training with main focus on balance-exercises considered essential for daily living.</description>
