      The purpose of this clinical research study is to investigate the efficacy of predosing
      patients undergoing cataract surgery with the potent corticosteroid difluprednate ophthalmic
      emulsion 0.05% compared to prednisolone acetate 1% on corneal edema (swelling), and retinal
      thickness.
