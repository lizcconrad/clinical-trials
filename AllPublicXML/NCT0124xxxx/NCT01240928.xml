                  avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (Appendix D, Arizona CERT
                  List 3). Similarly, the concomitant use of drugs that are weakly associated with
                  QT prolongation should be generally avoided (Appendix D, Arizona CERT List 4).
                  Arizona CERT List 3 and 4 drugs should be used at the discretion of the
                  Investigator and restricted where applicable. Any therapy given with these drugs
                  should be used with caution, and patients receiving these medications should be
                  carefully monitored.

             blockers, or digoxin

             recurrent diarrhea)

         11. Poorly controlled diabetes defined as HbA1C &gt; 8%

         12. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or lab abnormality that might
             confound the study results, interfere with the patient's participation for the full
             study duration, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the
             opinion of the treating Investigator

         13. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             with trial requirements

         14. Patient is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including
             &quot;recreational use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last
             year) of drug or alcohol abuse

         18. Symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. Patient who is clinically stable following
             treatment for these conditions is eligible

         19. Receiving treatment with oral corticosteroids (note: inhaled corticosteroids are
             permitted)
