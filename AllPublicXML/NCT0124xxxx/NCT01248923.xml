  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
      (MM) or plasma cell leukemia (PCL) will receive investigational study drug ARRY-520 and
      bortezomib, with or without dexamethasone, with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)
      support.

      This study has 2 parts. In the first part, patients will receive increasing doses of study
      drug (2 dosing schedules will be evaluated) in combination with (1) bortezomib with G-CSF
      support or (2) bortezomib and dexamethasone with G-CSF support, in order to achieve the
      highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects.
      Approximately 45 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 1 (Active, not recruiting).

      In the second part of this study, patients will receive the best dose(s) and schedule(s) of
      study drug, in combination with bortezomib ± dexamethasone + G-CSF, determined from the first
      part of the study and will be followed to see what side effects the combination causes and
      what effectiveness the combination has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 42
      patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Active, not recruiting).
