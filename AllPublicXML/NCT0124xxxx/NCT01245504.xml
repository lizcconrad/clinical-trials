  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality and accuracy of prosthetic sockets manufactured by central fabrication facilities may
      be lacking. Poor quality manufacturing can be detrimental to socket fit in amputees and may
      require more work by prosthetists to redesign the socket. The aim of this research is to
      assess the accuracy of prosthetic sockets manufactured by commercial companies. Determination
      of how and where manufacturing errors occur will contribute to better quality of socket fit
      for the amputee patient and improve the efficiency of prosthetists who fit the manufactured
      products to their patients.

      Computer manufactured sockets are made for subjects, then their fits assessed by research
      practitioners.
