  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy and safety of asenapine for the treatment of bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed
      episodes) will be evaluated in participants between 10 and 17 years old, who are either
      hospitalized or non-hospitalized. In this 3-weeks, double-blind, parallel design trial,
      eligible participants will be randomized to receive one out of three fixed dose levels of
      asenapine, or placebo. The study primary hypothesis is that at least one asenapine dose is
      superior to placebo as measured by the change from baseline to Day 21 in Young Mania Rating
      Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Trial medication and placebo are provided as identical-looking
      sublingual tablets; concurrent use of psychotropics is prohibited, except use of short-acting
      benzodiazepines and psychostimulants approved for the treatment of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Main treatment effect is measured using Y-MRS and safety is
      evaluated using the recordings of adverse events, routine blood panels, physical examinations
      (including vital signs), and electrocardiograms. Participants who complete the double blind
      trial may be offered to continue (open-label) treatment with asenapine for an extended period
      of time. Follow-up information on safety parameters will be collected in all participants
      within 30 days following treatment discontinuation.

      Participants' Y-MRS total score at baseline will be subtracted from that at the Day 21 visit
      to determine the amount of change over time with treatment. The responses for the 3 different
      asenapine doses compared to placebo will be evaluated. The Y-MRS is an 11 item scale: seven
      items ranked on scale from 0 to 4 and four items ranked 0 to 8 with a range of possible total
      scores from 0 to 60.

      Participants' overall score on the CGI-BP at Day 21 will be evaluated to determine the amount
      of change over time with treatment. The responses for the 3 different asenapine doses
      compared to placebo will be evaluated. CGI-BP overall score is obtained from a single-item
      clinician-rated scale used to assess the participant's overall bipolar illness. Scores range
      from not ill (1) to very severely ill (7).

      The proportion of participants whose total Y-MRS score is decreased ≥50% from baseline at Day
      4, 7, 14 and 21. Results for the 3 different asenapine doses compared to placebo will be
      evaluated.

      Participants' mania sub-score from the CGI-BP will be evaluated for each study visit (Days 4,
      7, 14 and 21) to determine the amount of change over time with treatment. The responses for
      the 3 different asenapine doses compared to placebo will be evaluated.

      Participants' depression sub-score from the CGI-BP will evaluated at each study visit (Days
      4, 7, 14 and 21) to determine the amount of change over time with treatment. The responses
      for the 3 different asenapine doses compared to placebo will be evaluated.

      Participants' CDRS-R at baseline will be subtracted from those at each study visit at which
      this rating was measured (Days 7, 14 and 21) to determine the amount of change over time with
      treatment. The responses for the 3 different asenapine doses compared to placebo will be
      evaluated. The CDRS-R is a 17-item scale that assesses the presence and severity of
      depressive symptoms: fourteen items are rated from 1 to 7 and three items are rated from 1 to
      5; total scores range from 17 to 113.

      Participants' CGAS at baseline will be subtracted from that at the Day 21 visit to determine
      the amount of change over time with treatment. The responses for the 3 different asenapine
      doses compared to placebo will be evaluated. The CGAS is a 100-point scale, with a possible
      range of 1 to 100. Normal social functioning is defined as a CGAS total score of ≥70.

      Participants' PQ-LES-Q total score at baseline will be subtracted from that at the Day 21
      visit to determine the amount of change over time with treatment. The responses for the 3
      different asenapine doses compared to placebo will be evaluated. The PQ-LES-Q is a 15-item
      scale, with total score calculated as the sum of the first 14 items, with a range of 14 to
      70. Each item is scored by the child from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicative of greater
      enjoyment and satisfaction.

      Participants' PQ-LES-Q overall score (i.e. item 15) at baseline will be subtracted from that
      at the Day 21 visit to determine the amount of change over time with treatment. The responses
      for the 3 different asenapine doses compared to placebo will be evaluated. The PQ-LES-Q
      overall score is determined by the answer to item 15 on the questionnaire (range: 1 to 5).

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The Y-MRS is an 11-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the severity of manic episodes. A severity rating is assigned to each of the 11 items (Elevated mood, Increased motor activity-energy, Sexual interest, Sleep, Irritability, Speech, Language-thought disorder, Thought content, Disruptive-aggressive behavior, Appearance, Insight), based on the participant's subjective report of his or her condition over the previous 48 hours and the clinician's observations during the interview, with the emphasis on the latter. Seven of the 11 items are rated on a scale of 0-4 and 4 of the items are rated on a scale of 0-8, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The Y-MRS total score for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, and can range from 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 21; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 4, 7, 14 and 21</time_frame>
    <description>A total Y-MRS 50% responder was defined as a participant who had a reduction from baseline to the identified study visit of at least 50% in the Y-MRS total score. The Y-MRS is an 11-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the severity of manic episodes. A severity rating is assigned to each of the 11 items, based on the participant's subjective report of his or her condition over the previous 48 hours and the clinician's observations during the interview, with the emphasis on the latter. The Y-MRS total score for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, and can range from 0-60 with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. This analysis used a Last-Observation-Carried-Forward (LOCF) approach; if at a given visit no Y-MRS total score was available for determining whether a participant was a responder, the last available post-baseline on-treatment assessment prior to that visit was used.</description>

          <description>Y-MRS is an 11-item instrument for assessing the severity of manic episodes. Seven of the 11 items are rated on a scale of 0-4 and 4 are rated on a scale of 0-8, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The Y-MRS total score for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, and can range from 0-60. Summary statistics presented are for efficacy population (Full Analysis Set [FAS]): N=98, 101, 98, 98 and 395 for Placebo, asenapine 2.5 mg BID, asenapine 5.0 mg BID, asenapine 10.0 mg BID and Total groups, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Y-MRS Total Score at Day 21</title>
        <description>The Y-MRS is an 11-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the severity of manic episodes. A severity rating is assigned to each of the 11 items (Elevated mood, Increased motor activity-energy, Sexual interest, Sleep, Irritability, Speech, Language-thought disorder, Thought content, Disruptive-aggressive behavior, Appearance, Insight), based on the participant’s subjective report of his or her condition over the previous 48 hours and the clinician’s observations during the interview, with the emphasis on the latter. Seven of the 11 items are rated on a scale of 0-4 and 4 of the items are rated on a scale of 0-8, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The Y-MRS total score for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, and can range from 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 21; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in CGI-BP overall score at Day 21 is the Key Secondary Outcome Measure. The CGI-BP is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing bipolar illness that includes subscales assessing mania and depression. This measure reports one item within the CGI-BP, which is a 7-point scale assessing the severity of the participant’s overall bipolar illness, with ratings from 1=normal, not ill to 7=very severely ill. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 21; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <title>Total Y-MRS 50% Responders at Days 4, 7, 14 and 21</title>
        <description>A total Y-MRS 50% responder was defined as a participant who had a reduction from baseline to the identified study visit of at least 50% in the Y-MRS total score. The Y-MRS is an 11-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the severity of manic episodes. A severity rating is assigned to each of the 11 items, based on the participant’s subjective report of his or her condition over the previous 48 hours and the clinician’s observations during the interview, with the emphasis on the latter. The Y-MRS total score for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, and can range from 0-60 with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. This analysis used a Last-Observation-Carried-Forward (LOCF) approach; if at a given visit no Y-MRS total score was available for determining whether a participant was a responder, the last available post-baseline on-treatment assessment prior to that visit was used.</description>

          <title>Total Y-MRS 50% Responders at Days 4, 7, 14 and 21</title>
          <description>A total Y-MRS 50% responder was defined as a participant who had a reduction from baseline to the identified study visit of at least 50% in the Y-MRS total score. The Y-MRS is an 11-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the severity of manic episodes. A severity rating is assigned to each of the 11 items, based on the participant’s subjective report of his or her condition over the previous 48 hours and the clinician’s observations during the interview, with the emphasis on the latter. The Y-MRS total score for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 11 individual items, and can range from 0-60 with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. This analysis used a Last-Observation-Carried-Forward (LOCF) approach; if at a given visit no Y-MRS total score was available for determining whether a participant was a responder, the last available post-baseline on-treatment assessment prior to that visit was used.</description>
          <population>Randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had both a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline on-treatment Y-MRS total score (this group is termed the efficacy FAS); also, to be included for a visit, a Y-MRS total score must be available for that visit or a prior post-baseline on-treatment visit</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CGI-BP Mania Score at Day 4</title>
        <description>The CGI-BP is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing bipolar illness that includes subscales assessing mania and depression. This measure reports one item within the CGI-BP, which is a 7-point scale assessing the severity of the mania component of the participant’s bipolar illness, with ratings from 1=normal, not ill to 7=very severely ill. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 4; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in CGI-BP Mania Score at Day 14</title>
          <description>The CGI-BP is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing bipolar illness that includes subscales assessing mania and depression. This measure reports one item within the CGI-BP, which is a 7-point scale assessing the severity of the mania component of the participant’s bipolar illness, with ratings from 1=normal, not ill to 7=very severely ill. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 14; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>
          <population>Randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had both a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline on-treatment Y-MRS total score (this group is termed the efficacy FAS); also, to be included a baseline and an on-treatment Day 14 value of CGI-BP mania score must be available for a participant.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CGI-BP Depression Score at Day 7</title>
        <description>The CGI-BP is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing bipolar illness that includes subscales assessing mania and depression. This measure reports one item within the CGI-BP, which is a 7-point scale assessing the severity of the depression component of the participant’s bipolar illness, with ratings from 1=normal, not ill to 7=very severely ill. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 7; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CGI-BP Depression Score at Day 21</title>
        <description>The CGI-BP is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing bipolar illness that includes subscales assessing mania and depression. This measure reports one item within the CGI-BP, which is a 7-point scale assessing the severity of the depression component of the participant’s bipolar illness, with ratings from 1=normal, not ill to 7=very severely ill. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 21; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <description>The CDRS-R is a 17-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in children. Fourteen of the 17 items are rated on a scale of 1-7 and 3 of the items are rated on a scale of 1-5, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The CDRS-R total score for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 17 individual items, and can range from 17-113, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 7; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in CDRS-R Total Score at Day 14</title>
          <description>The CDRS-R is a 17-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in children. Fourteen of the 17 items are rated on a scale of 1-7 and 3 of the items are rated on a scale of 1-5, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The CDRS-R total score for each participant is the sum of the ratings for the 17 individual items, and can range from 17-113, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 14; improvement in symptoms is represented by negative values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) Score at Day 21</title>
        <description>CGAS is a 100-point scale measuring psychological, social, and school functioning in children aged 6-17. Minimum scores ranged from 1-10, representing the need for constant supervision (worse result) to maximum scores of 91-100, representing superior functioning (better result). The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 21; improvement in functioning is represented by positive values. This analysis used an LOCF approach; if no Day 21 value was available for a participant, the last available post-baseline on-treatment assessment prior to the Day 21 assessment was used.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ-LES-Q) Total Score at Day 21</title>
        <description>PQ-LES-Q is a questionnaire to assess quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction in children and adolescents. The participant is asked to rate 15 items reflecting quality of life with respect to the previous week on a scale of 1=very poor to 5=very good. Items 1-14 assess specific areas (e.g., your health, your mood or feelings); Item 15 is a global assessment of overall quality of life. The PQ-LES-Q total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the first 14 items, and ranged from 14 to 70 with a higher score indicating better quality of life. The reported measure is the change from baseline at Day 21; improvement in quality of life is represented by positive values. This analysis used an LOCF approach; if no Day 21 value was available for a participant, the last available post-baseline on-treatment assessment prior to the Day 21 assessment was used.</description>
