      The object of study is the patients who are going to undergo pedicle screw fixation
      operation. there are two clinical trial centers.one is beijing jishuitan hospital,the other
      is beijing shuili hospital.the study protocol will be reviewed by the Ethics Committee of
      Beijing Jishuitan Hospital. after the patients sign the informed consent,they will be divided
      into two groups randomly.the patients' basic information and medical informations including
      the accuracy and safety will be collected.the data above all will be compared.
