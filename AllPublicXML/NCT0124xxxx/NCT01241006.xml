  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to compare the effectiveness of a single dose of oral dexamethasone versus 5
      days of oral prednisone in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations to prevent
      relapse with an unscheduled return visit to a health care provider for additional asthma
      treatment within 14 days. The investigators hypothesize that the two treatments will be
      equally effective in relapse prevention.

    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone and Prednisone are both systemic corticosteroids. The study will compare a
      single dose of oral dexamethasone to 5 days of oral prednisone in the treatment of asthma.
      Oral corticosteroids are commonly prescribed following an asthma exacerbation as it has been
      demonstrated that these medications prevent relapse.

      Oral prednisone is the most common corticosteroid prescribed for asthma relapse prevention.
      The half life is around 4 hours and is typically prescribed for minimally 5 days.

      The study is evaluating the efficacy of a single dose of dexmethasone. The drug's efficicacy
      has been shown to be longer acting and up to 72 hours. A single dose would eliminate the need
      for a prescription for a drug like prednisone to hopefully improve compliance.
