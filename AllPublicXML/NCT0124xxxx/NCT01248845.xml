    <textblock>
      Exploration of the effects on diaphragmatic electrical activity (EMG) and on respiratory
      pattern of various level of assistance delivered by the ventilator in intubated spontaneously
      breathing patients in pressure support (PS) and in Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist
      (NAVA) by step by step increasing of the level of assistance. Flow, airway pressure,
      transesophageal EMG signal and transcutaneous EMG signal will be recorded.

      Exploration of the effects on diaphragmatic electrical activity (EMG) and on respiratory
      pattern of various level of assistance delivered by the ventilator in intubated spontaneously
      breathing patients in pressure support (PS) and in Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist
      (NAVA) by step by step increasing of the level of assistance. Flow, airway pressure,
      transesophageal EMG signal and transcutaneous EMG signal will be recorded.

      Aims of the study:

        1. To study the electrical diaphragmatic signal variations and the ventilatory profile
           variations under various level of assistance (delivered by the ventilator) in PS and in
           NAVA in intubated spontaneously breathing patients

        2. To compare a non invasive technique of diaphragmatic electrical activity recording under
           various levels of assistance with the invasive reference technique
