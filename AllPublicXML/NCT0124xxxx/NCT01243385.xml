      RATIONALE: Metformin hydrochloride may make some enzymes active. These enzymes may block
      other enzymes needed for cell growth and stop the growth of tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the safety of giving metformin hydrochloride as
      first-line therapy in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the activity and safety of metformin hydrochloride as first-line therapy in
           patients with locally advanced or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral metformin hydrochloride twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Previously collected and post-treatment tumor tissue may be analyzed for PTEN status and
      PI3kinase-dependent pathway activation via immunohistochemistry. Blood samples may also be
      collected periodically and analyzed for biomarkers, pharmacogenetics, pharmacodynamics,
      pharmacokinetics.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <description>50 % PSA response is defined as a decrease in PSA level of at least 50 % (compared to baseline PSA).
30 % PSA response is defined as a decrease in PSA level of at least 30 % (compared to baseline PSA).
Best response is defined as the percentage of change in PSA from baseline to the maximum decline in PSA at any point under treatment at 12 weeks or later. If there is a steady increase after baseline, the best response is defined as the percentage of change in PSA from baseline to the minimum increase in PSA at any point under treatment at 12 weeks or later.</description>
