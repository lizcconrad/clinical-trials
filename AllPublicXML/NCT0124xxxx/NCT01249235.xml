  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patching the eye or a bandage contact lens along
      with Tylenol #3 is more effective for pain control following pterygium surgery.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary pterygium (no previous surgeries or radiotherapy) requiring excision due to
             ocular discomfort or disruption in vision

          -  Size of pterygium greater than 2.5 mm over the cornea (pterygia smaller than this do
             not result in much postoperative eye pain)

          -  Ability to understand the nature of the procedure and to complete all measurement
             requirements

          -  Adults (age greater than 18)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular surface disease apart from pterygium (such as severe dry eye, corneal disease,
             scarring from previous infection, radiotherapy, inflammatory diseases or trauma)

          -  Patients who have had previous ocular surface surgery

          -  Contraindications to local anesthetics (such as known allergy)

          -  Pregnancy (as the risk to the fetus with the use of topical antibiotic drops and local
             anesthetics are not known)

          -  Patients already on systemic analgesics for any other reason (such as rheumatoid
             arthritis)

          -  Allergy to codeine (in order to standardize the systemic analgesic used so that we can
             compare the effect of bandage contact lens versus 24 hour patching)
