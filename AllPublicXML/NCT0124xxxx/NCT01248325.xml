      Sixty subjects will take part in this study. The subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1
      ratio between the two arms of study. (Group A: Solution of Luffa Nasal Operculate 5mg/mL,
      Group B: saline).

      The subjects will use the study medication or comparative, according to their randomization,
      for a treatment period of 3 to 7 days. A follow-up visit will be made 15 days after
