  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to review whether musculoskeletal shockwave therapy (ESWT) can speed up the
      healing of second-degree burns as well as skin-graft donor sites.

      In both cases, the primary hypothesis is the shortened period leading up to the complete
      healing of the wound (reepithelization).

      The secondary hypothesis in the course of the study assesses:

      the rare manifestation of undesirable local events (e.g. reddening, swelling, hematoma).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESWT is administered as a one-off treatment on the wound surfaces within 24 hours of a 2nd
      degree burn trauma and immediately after an intraoperative skin graft excision procedure. A
      defocused sound head is orthogradely applied to the burn wound or the donor site. 100
      impulses/cm² is administered at 20 seconds per cm². The defocused sound head is placed on the
      wound along with a sterile gel (Lavaseptgel®, Octenidingel®) and a sterile protection foil.
      The shockwaves deployed are not at an energy density that is painful. This single application
      of ESWT is followed by routine dressing using Mepitel® in combination with
      Polyhexanid/Octenidin®.
