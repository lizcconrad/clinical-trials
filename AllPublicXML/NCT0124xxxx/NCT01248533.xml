  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male subjects, 65 years of age, living in Oslo, Norway will be invited to be screened for
      abdominal aortic aneurysm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The invited population will be offered ultrasound investigation of their abdominal aorta.
      Further information regarding risk factors will be noted and measurement of ankle-brachial
      index will be measured/calculated. A further step in the future will be to sample blood with
      focus on different cytokines and genmediators.
