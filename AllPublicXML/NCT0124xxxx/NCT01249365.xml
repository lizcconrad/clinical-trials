      This extension study is designed to assess the safety of GSK Biological's HPV vaccine
      GSK580299 in female subjects who took part in the primary study NCT00294047 and received the
      control vaccine in countries for which the licensed GSK HPV vaccine is not indicated for the
      subject's age group (26 years and older). This study is thus conducted to enable all women
      who received the control placebo in the primary NCT00294047 study to receive the GSK580299
      vaccine.

          -  A subject previously enrolled in the study NCT00294047, who received the control
             vaccine, and who cannot receive the GSK580299 vaccine because the subject is above the

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the

             cytology at their concluding HPV-015 study end visit;

          -  if they are pregnant so that no cervical sample can be taken at their concluding
             HPV-015 study end visit;

               -  Previous administration of any components of the vaccine.
