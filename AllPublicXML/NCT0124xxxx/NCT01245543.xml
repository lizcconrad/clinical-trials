      AC480IV will be administered as a monotherapy and then in combination with docetaxel in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom there are no standard or
      curative therapies available. It is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic
      parameters of AC480IV as monotherapy and also in combination with docetaxel under the
      conditions of the study.

             non-measurable tumors (a lesion in a previously irradiated area is eligible to be
             considered as measurable disease as long as there is objective evidence of progression
             of that lesion prior to enrollment)
