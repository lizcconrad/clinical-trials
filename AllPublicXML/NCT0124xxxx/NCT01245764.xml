  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a 3-dose
      regimen of GARDASIL™ administered to healthy females between 9 and 26 years of age, in
      Sub-Saharan Africa. Data from the current study are needed in order to complement existing
      extensive safety data from the GARDASIL™ clinical trials program, and confirm that GARDASIL™
      may be administered safely and will induce immune responses in populations from and living in
      Sub-Saharan Africa, as GARDASIL™ has not previously been studied in this region of the world.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase A of the study, healthy females between 9 and 12 years of age will be randomized
      (4:1) to receive the 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL™ or placebo, and those between 13 and 26
      years old will receive GARDASIL™. In Phase B of the study, participants who received placebo
      in Phase A will have the option to receive the 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL™.

          -  Subject has a history of recent or ongoing alcohol or other drug abuse.

          -  Female subject has a prior history of abnormal Pap test showing squamous
             intraepithelial lesion (SIL), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
             (ASC-US), atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out a high grade lesion (ASC-H), or
             biopsy showing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or worse.

          -  Subject has any prior history (or at Day 1) of genital warts or treatment for genital
             warts.
