  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite certain notable progress, treatment of patients with Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia (CLL)
      is still disappointing. Although thanks to the use of treatment of (immune) chemotherapy,
      mainly based on fludarabine, rituximab and alemtuzumab, the rate of complete response (CR)
      has increased from minus 10% observed when clorambucil was the core of the therapy to a
      60-70%, with time all patients relapse and most of them die at the end due to the disease or
      to involvements related to the treatment. Progress when understanding the CLL biology have
      cleared a series of aspects: 1) there is a significant proportion of CLL cells actively
      copying themselves, contrary to the opinion that most of CLL cells are in G0 phase of the
      cell cycle; 2) Immune regulatory mechanism basically measured by T cells and NK cells have an
      important role in the continuous accumulation of CLL cells in the body; 3) Cells of the
      stroma are essential to maintain survival of CLL cells through a series of cytokines or
      chemokines. Under the light of this evidence, it is worth studying new treatment modes
      directed not only to CLL cells but also to the microenvironment and immune functions.

      Lenalidomide is being investigated as treatment for several oncologic indications including
      myelodysplastic syndromes, multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the scope of
      CLL, it has been proved that lenalidomide is active in patients with relapsing / treatment
      resistant CLL patients. Forty five patients with relapsing CLL, 51% resistant to fludarabine,
      where included in a phase II study and were treated orally with 25 mg of lenalidomide on days
      1 to 21 of a cycle of 28 days. The total response rate was of 47% with up to a 9% of complete
      responses.

      The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is being investigated in multiple myeloma
      and has revealed as a highly efficient treatment in relapsing/ treatment resistant patients
      as well as in those newly diagnosed. Bearing in mind that both drugs, lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone, are clinically active in CLL the investigators have designed a study with this
      combination in relapsing or treatment resistant patients following treatments containing
      fludarabine which do not meet the requirements for an intensive rescue treatment.

      Given initial doses of 10 and 25 mg of lenalidomide daily may be associated with tumor lysis
      cases, it is proposed a low initial dose of lenalidomide in the first cycle 2.5mg., with
      further increases to prevent the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome
