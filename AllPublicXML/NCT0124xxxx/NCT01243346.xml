  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is designed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
      crenolanib (CP-868,596) in patients with D842-related mutant metastatic GIST.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crenolanib (CP-868,596) is an orally bioavailable, selective inhibitor of PDGFR receptor
      tyrosine kinase with IC50s of 0.4 ng/mL and 0.8 ng/mL for PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, respectively.

      In preclinical models of cell lines with the D842V mutation in the PDGFRA gene, crenolanib
      (CP-868,596) blocked phosphorylation of PDGFRα at nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that
      it may provide a clinical benefit to patients with D842V mutant GIST.

      In addition, crenolanib was also active in inhibiting phosphorylation of cell lines with two
      point mutations (double mutants) PDGFRA V561D + D842V and PDGFRA T674I + D842V.

             compliance with the protocol e.g. impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function, or GI
             disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs
