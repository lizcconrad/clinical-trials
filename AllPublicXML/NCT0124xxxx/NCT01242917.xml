             screen, and the hepatitis C screen;

         10. Judged to be otherwise healthy by the Investigator, based on medical history, physical
             examination (including electrocardiogram [ECG]), and clinical laboratory assessments;

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential, and male subjects with partners of
             childbearing potential, may participate if adequate contraception is used during, and
             for at least the four weeks after administration of study medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with RA prior to 16 years of age;

          2. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have a positive serum pregnancy test at
