      The purpose of this study is to measure if there is any difference in how the body breaks
      down or inactivates either fluoxetine or LY2216684 when both of these medicines are given
      together. This study will look at how fluoxetine might affect LY2216684 and how giving
      LY2216684 might affect fluoxetine in the body.

      The duration of study participation in this study is approximately 36 days not including the
      screening appointment. This study requires 1 research unit confinement of 29 days/28 nights
      followed by 1 outpatient appointment. A screening appointment is required within 30 days
      prior to the start of the study.
