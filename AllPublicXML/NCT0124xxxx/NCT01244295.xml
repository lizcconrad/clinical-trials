      A comparison study of 16 week treatment with either specialized psychotherapy for complicated
      grief (CGT) or with standard interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) in older adults with
      complicated grief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Council on Aging (1), in 2005, there were more than 10 million
      older Americans who were widowed (8.6 million women (43%) and 2.1 million men (14%) over the
      age of 65). These people are at risk for a debilitating reaction called Traumatic or
      Complicated Grief (CG: the term now used for this condition). Studies confirm that
      Complicated Grief can be reliably identified and occurs in about 10-20% of bereaved
      individuals. CG appears to carry much of the risk for negative outcomes of bereavement. CG
      can affect health status and influence decisions about personal health care. The risk of
      hypertension is 10 times greater among widowed subjects who meet consensus criteria for CG
      compared to those who do not, while subjects with CG are 17 times less likely to have visited
      a physician in the months since the death. Despite its high prevalence and significant
      morbidity, there are no proven efficacious treatments. The PI of this project developed a
      novel psychotherapy called Complicated Grief Treatment (CGT), and has now completed a study
      (MH60783) comprised of adults over age 18, that confirmed efficacy of this approach.
      Participants â‰¥ age 60 (n=29) were less likely to be employed and more likely to live alone.
      We observed better response to CGT than IPT, as in younger adults. However, confirmation of
      efficacy among seniors is important, since older people have different vulnerabilities and
      different problems in adjusting to grief than younger adults. We plan to conduct a randomized
      controlled study of CGT v IPT in individuals &gt; 50 years of age who meet criteria for
      complicated grief and have no contraindications to study participation. Our specific aims
      are: 1) To compare results of 16 sessions of either CGT or standard IPT. We hypothesize that
      CGT will produce a higher response rate and shorter time to response than IPT, and that
      responders will show significantly greater reduction in associated symptoms and impairment
      than non-responders.

    <measure>Responder status on Complicated Grief Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Brief rating scale frequently used in clinical trials. For this study, version modified for complicated grief will be used. The rating will be done by the Independent Evaluator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ICG is a 19-item self-report instrument that assesses symptoms of CG. This scale has been utilized previously in treatment studies of CG. Random regression model will be applied to evaluate the score trajectory from baseline to week 20 and from week 20 to week 48.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The WSAS is a modification of a scale introduced by Hafner and Marks (1976), consisting of 0-8 point ratings of the extent to which symptoms interfere with five areas of daily functioning: work, home management, private leisure, social leisure, and family relationships. It is a well-validated, widely used self-report measure. Random regression model will be applied to evaluate the score trajectory from baseline to week 20 and from week 20 to week 48.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on Grief Related Avoidance Questionnaire (GRAQ) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>GRAQ is a questionnaire developed by the study investigators to elicit information related to avoidance of common situations and activities following the death. This scale has good psychometric properties and will be used to assess avoidance as a possible moderator predicting better outcome with CGT. It will be analyzed using random regression model.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in results from Structured Interview for Complicated Grief (SCI-CG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The SCI-CG is a clinician-administered structured interview developed for the study. It includes a composite of diagnostic criteria proposed by Horowitz and Prigerson. The interview was piloted and refined in the initial phase of current study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in results on Typical Beliefs Questionnaire (TBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 16 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>TBQ is a 34 item questionnaire evaluating how strongly subjects endorse certain beliefs that are common during bereavement related to self, the relationship, and perceptions of the world.</description>
