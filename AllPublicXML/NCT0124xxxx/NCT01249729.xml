      We use the three-dimensional image software reconstruct MRI. The propose of this research
      purposes as follows: 1. 3D reconstructed image processing from MRI to realize the short term
      nervous system response after dynamic acupuncture stimulation.2. Realizing the corresponding
      area in the brain caused by electroacupuncture. 3. Realizing the connection between
      electroacupuncture stimulation and brain physics, chemistry, and physiology. The implement
      the two-dimentional image into three-dimensional image by Amira software, in order to find
      out the difference of the pre-and post- response of the nervous system. In addition, we will
      use &quot;describe statistics&quot; and &quot;Paired t-test&quot; statistical analysis, compare the statistical
      difference of blood oxygen concentration.

      Anticipate of results: Using the three-dimensional software reconstruct magnetic resonance
      imaging to realize the immediate response of nervous system after acupoint acupuncture
      stimulation, and find out the meridian, nerve or physiological corresponding relationship. It
      will be a tremendous finding to the world if we can deliver a brain mapping concerning the
      localization of the response on the central nervous system after various acupoints
      stimulation.

        The study expect to seek 100 patients to use the magnetic resonance imaging of brain before
        and after the acupoint electroacupuncture, measuring the response of all the brain
        activities, and then implement the two-dimentional image into three-dimensional image by
        Amira software.
