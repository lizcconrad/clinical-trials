    <textblock>
      Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological disease characterized by verbal and motor tics. The
      currently available drug treatments are considered to be inadequate. This clinical trial is
      designed to test if ecopipam is effective for the treatment of Tourette's Syndrome in adults.

    <textblock>
      Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological disease characterized by verbal and motor tics.
      Although its causes are unknown, many researchers believe that changes in brain chemicals
      (called neurotransmitters) are critically involved. One of these neurotransmitters is called
      dopamine, and it exerts its actions through its receptors (called D1-type or D2-type). It has
      been suggested that the symptoms of Tourette's Syndrome are due to an overactivity at the
      D1-type receptor. Ecopipam is a selective antagonist of the D1-type receptors. The present
      clinical trial is designed to test if ecopipam is able to relieve the symptoms of the disease
      in adults patients with Tourette's Syndrome. Eligible patients will be treated for eight
      weeks.

    <measure>Yale Global Tic Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale Global Tic Severity Score is a composite of subject reported severity of motor (range 0-25) and vocal (range 0-25) tics , as well as an impairment score (range 0-50). The outcome we are using is the Total Tic Severity score which is the sum of the motor and vocal tic severity scores (range 0-50). The higher the score on this scale, the more severe the symptoms. A positive drug effect is associated with a decrease from baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have TS (Tourette's Syndrome) based on the clinician-administered DCI
             (Diagnostic Confidence Index) for TS.

          -  Subjects must exhibit both motor and vocal tics.

          -  Subjects must have exhibited tics for &gt;5 years.

          -  Subjects must have a minimum score of 20 at both Screening and Baseline (just prior to
             the first treatment) on the YGTSS (Yale Global Tic Severity Score).

          -  Subjects must be age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Women must be postmenopausal (&gt; 12 months without menses) or surgically sterile (i.e.,
             by hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy) or must be using effective
             contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, double barrier method
             of condom and spermicide) and agree to continue use of contraception for the duration
             of their participation in the study. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use
             contraception for 30 days after their last dose of study drug.

          -  Sexually active male subjects must use a barrier method of contraception during the
             study and agree to continue the use of male contraception for at least 30 days after

        <title>Yale Global Tic Severity Score</title>
        <description>The Yale Global Tic Severity Score is a composite of subject reported severity of motor (range 0-25) and vocal (range 0-25) tics , as well as an impairment score (range 0-50). The outcome we are using is the Total Tic Severity score which is the sum of the motor and vocal tic severity scores (range 0-50). The higher the score on this scale, the more severe the symptoms. A positive drug effect is associated with a decrease from baseline.</description>
