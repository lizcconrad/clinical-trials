  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with kidney disease have a high risk of heart disease. This is not related to
      traditional risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or being overweight.
      A lack of vitamin D could be the reason why blood vessels become damaged and could explain
      the link between heart disease and kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most people living in Canada do not receive enough vitamin D from the sun or from the food
      they eat. When a person has kidney disease this is a particular problem as kidney disease
      stops what little vitamin D we do have being activated in the body. Low levels of activated
      vitamin D causes a domino effect with calcium and phosphate and all the hormones that control
      calcium and phosphate. Some people believe that this imbalance damages the blood vessels
      causing them to become stiff and inflexible (arterial stiffness) and this in turn could cause
      heart disease. In addition there are two different types of vitamin D that can be prescribed
      and it is currently not known whether there is any difference between the two types of
      vitamin D and the effect they have on the blood vessels.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether providing vitamin D as a medication can
      have a direct affect on the stiffness of the blood vessels. The findings of this study will
      help both physicians and dietitians decide whether Vitamin D therapy is beneficial to
      patients and should help decide which type of Vitamin D is best to give to people with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD).

    <description>The specific measurements to establish the primary outcome measure include:a pulse wave velocity test which is a non-invasive test used to measure the elasticity of the blood vessels (randomized groups will be compared from baseline to 6 months); blood pressure measurements (randomized groups will be compared for rate of change in BP over 6 months); blood and urine collection (randomized groups will be compared for rate of change in proteinuria, fibroblast growth factor-23, serum parathyroid hormone, phosphate, calcium and C-reactive protein).</description>
