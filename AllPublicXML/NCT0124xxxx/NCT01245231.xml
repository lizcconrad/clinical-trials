      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood or tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying prognostic biomarkers in cell samples from young
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the percentage of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples with
           increased Stat3 signaling pathway activity.

        -  To evaluate the presence of constitutive Stat3 activation and the sensitivity of Stat3
           activation to low- and high-doses of cytokines.

        -  To evaluate the expression levels of Stat3 protein and the upstream and downstream
           regulators of Stat3 activation.

      Secondary

        -  To classify samples according to a Stat3 activation pattern and correlate this result
           with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved AML specimens are analyzed for pStat3 and pStat5 levels, response to
      cytokine levels, and expression level of proteins known to influence stat activity by flow
      cytometry and western blot assays. Results are also compared with prognostic variables
      determined in CCG-291 study, including age, race, WBC, and cytogenetic risks.
