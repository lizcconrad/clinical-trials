    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study was whether gut focused hypnotherapy, in a group format, was
      successful in reduction of symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. The secondary
      goal was to see if any outcome predictors could be determined.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome entering a group hypnotherapy program are asked to
      complete a series of questionnaires at the outset, and repeat a symptom severity scale at
      intervals over the one year period after termination of treatment. Eligibility was limited to
      patients with age greater than 20.

      Outcome measures were improvement in symptom score. Outcome predictors studied included
      quality of relationships, measured with a Quality of Relationship Inventory and attribution
      of IBS to physical or emotional cause, measured with a Mind-Body IBS Questionnaire, both
      administered before onset of hypnotherapy.

    <description>The IBS Symptom Severity Scale has four components, severity of abdominal pain, number of days with pain in past 10 days, abdominal distension, bowel habit and interference with life in general. Maximum score is 500, minimum score is 0. The lower the score, the lower the symptom severity. Participants are considered clinically improved if they have a reduction in score of 50 points or greater.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited at their initial visit to an IBS treatment center, on a purely voluntary basis into a group hypnotherapy program, from 2005 to 2009. 75 patients were entered into the study. Another 14 filled out initial questionnaires but then declined to enter treatment or dropped out after 1 or 2 sessions.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was no control group assignment in this preliminary study which was designed to see if hypnotherapy, already proven effective in individual treatment was effective when using a group format.</pre_assignment_details>
