  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diffusion of gastrointestinal (GI) chronic diseases is significantly increased during the
      last century in western countries. In the USA and Northern Europe, constipation is twofold
      the prevalence found in the East and Southern Europe. In Italy, constipation affects up to
      15-17% of the whole adult population. Of them, more than half (about 10%) treats this
      disorder by assuming laxatives, while the remaining does not even assume drugs. A close
      relationship between intestinal environment and bacterial flora has been found. As a matter
      of fact changes in the intestinal physiology can modify the composition of bacterial flora as
      well as modifications in the intestinal microbiota can modify the physiology of the gut. The
      probiotic effects on the GI motility can be due to substances released by bacteria and/or
      products of their fermentation. Also, probiotic may indirectly act by the release of
      neuroendocrine factors and/or substances released by the immune system. Clinically, it has
      already been demonstrated that probiotics exert a positive effect on symptoms and intestinal
      habit in constipated IBS patients. In this framework, the idea to perform a long lasting
      intervention study in patients with functional constipation treated with probiotics sounds
      convincing. The present study is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, monocentric
      study, concerning the evaluation of efficacy of 3 months administration of Lactobacillus
      reuteri DSM 17938 in patients with functional constipation, as defined by the Rome criteria.
      Clinical, physiological, hematological and immunologic variables will be evaluated.
