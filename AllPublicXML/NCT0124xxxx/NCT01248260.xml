      The purpose of this study is to find out if folic acid prevents of the reduction of fetal
      body and brain size in infants whose mothers smoke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking during pregnancy remains a common practice despite smoking cessation programs offered
      to mothers. Only 20-40% of women quit smoking during pregnancy which implies that a majority
      of smokers continue smoking despite the associated feto-infant morbidity and mortality. It is
      therefore important to identify ways and means of protecting these infants as they grow and
      develop during intrauterine life. In this study, we propose to assess the utility of
      higher-strength folic acid (4mg) combined with smoking cessation programs as compared to
      standard of care (smoking cessation program and low-strength (0.8mg) folic acid) in reducing
      the level of morbidity (specifically fetal body and brain size) sustained by infants of
      smokers

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline (first trimester) until delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Low birth weight will be defined as birth weight less than 2500g; Small for gestational age will be defined as birth weight in the lowest 10th percentile; The fetal growth ratio will be expressed as the ratio of the observed birth weight to the expected mean birth weight for each gestational age.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from baseline (first trimester) until delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Head Circumference at birth: will be measured at birth as routinely performed at the study site. Observed: Expected head circumference ratio: This is the ratio between the actual head circumference and the expected head circumference according to gestational age (this could also be expressed in terms of percentage of expected head circumference). Brain weight: will be estimated from formula: brain weight (g) = 0.037 X head circumference (cm)2.57. Brain-to-body ratio (BBR): The BBR is defined as 100 the ratio of the infant's estimated brain weight to its birth weight.</description>

    <description>This is defined as live birth after 20 weeks of gestation but before 37 completed weeks. Genetic and Epigenetic Markers of Fetal Brain Growth and Development: Cord blood obtained at delivery will be analyzed for selected regulatory genes.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        ((1) Smoker, based on presence of detectable cotinine in saliva (biomarker).; (2) Ages
        18-44 years; (3) Singleton gestation (&lt; 20 weeks), confirmed by sonogram; (4) Residents of
        Tampa, Florida or surrounding area in order to facilitate follow-up and reduce attrition
        rate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (a) an indication for chronic blood transfusion. Women receiving chronic blood transfusions
        will not be enrolled, as transfused red blood cells (RBC) can result in inaccurate analysis
        of folate RBC levels88; (b) generalized seizure disorder treated with anti-convulsant
        medication: Patients with generalized seizure disorder treated with anticonvulsant
        medication will be excluded because of the potential association with folic acid
        deficiency88.
