    <textblock>
      Background: Solar lentigines are a common dermatologic condition that manifest as
      circumscribed single or multiple brownish macules usually located on sun-exposed skin such as
      face, hands or forearms. An effective, safe, daily-use, homecare whitening product may
      alleviate the cosmetic concerns for the general population. The efficacy and safety of the
      previous generation BEX-2009 (Blanc Expert Spot Eraser, L'Oreal, France), a whitening
      cosmetic product containing ellagic acid, salicylic acid, licorice root extract, etc., has
      been established in Caucasian and Asian populations with facial solar lentigines.

      Objective: The purpose of this placebo-controlled, single-center study is 1) to evaluate the
      efficacy of the new generation whitening cosmetic product BEX-2011 (Ultimate Whitening Spot
      Eraser, L'Oreal, France) in the improvement of solar lentigines on the dorsum of hands or
      forearms, and 2) to evaluate the efficacy of BEX-2011 by harmonic generation microscopy to
      obtain information of the epidermal melanin continuum, compared to other standard tools for
      melanin measurement.

      Method: 40 subjects, who are non-gravid women between 45 to 65 years old and need to have ≥10
      solar lentigines on the forearms/hands, will be recruited. One to three flat lesions which
      are larger than 4 mm and with the same pigmentation intensity on the left or right
      forearm/hand, respectively, are designated the target lesions. However, all lesions on the
      randomly selected side will be treated with BEX-2011 twice a day. The opposite site will be
      treated with vehicle and is served as the control. Evaluation will be performed at week 0, 4
      and 8. At each visit, treated and control spots as well as their surrounding spotless skin
      will be evaluated using Pigmentation Index Scores, VISIA-CR, SIAscope, Dermascore, and
      harmonic generation microscopy. Evaluation of the efficacy of whitening will be compared to
      the baseline and to the control area between week 0 and week 8. Safety will be assessed using
      clinical monitoring and adverse event reporting.
