  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the proof of concept study to evaluate the performance of an early stage prototype of
      a hand-held fundus camera.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We tested a novel fundus camera. The images obtained were acceptable to move to the next step
      in development.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The PI wanted to make additional changes to the hand held camera therefore he terminated the
    study rather than continue with an outdated camera design.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Have an Acceptable Image (Image Score of 3 or Higher) of Their Eye With the Hand Held Camera</measure>
    <time_frame>estimated 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will determine if the hand held camera is comparable to the traditional table mount camera in quality of images. The quality of the image of the participant's eye taken with the hand held camera will be compared to the quality of the image taken with the table mount camera using the following scale. We will determine the number of participants who have a score of 3 or higher.
Scale Image scored as follows
Unacceptable: cannot see fundus detail
Unacceptable: fundus detail visualized, but inadequate for meaningful analysis
Acceptable: fundus detail visualized to make general comments, modest improvement image would be of sufficient quality for use
Good: fundus detail visualized, meaningful analysis possible, std photo superior
Excellent: fundus detail visualized as well as std photo
Superior: fundus detail of higher quality than std photo</description>
