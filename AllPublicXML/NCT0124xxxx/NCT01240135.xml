    <measure>Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed by the investigator using a composite score based on three lens fit measures: static, push-up, and centration. Static and pushup were assessed on a 5-point scale, where -2=reduced movement unacceptable, -1=reduced movement acceptable, 0=optimal movement, 1=excessive movement acceptable, 2=excessive movement unacceptable. Centration was assessed on a 3-point scale, where 0=optimal lens centration, 1=acceptable decentration, 2=unacceptable decentration. A subject with an assessment of optimal or acceptable for each measure was considered acceptable on all measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline for Circumlimbal Conjunctival Staining Sum Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>The bulbar conjunctiva was assessed by the investigator at baseline and Day 14 utilizing a slit-lamp and ophthalmic dye. Staining coverage was scored separately in each of four regions (nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior) using a 5-point photographic reference scale, where 0=0.00% coverage and 4=10% or greater coverage. The scores for the four regions were summed, with a sum score range of 0-16.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline for Circumlimbal Conjunctival Staining Sum Score</title>
        <description>The bulbar conjunctiva was assessed by the investigator at baseline and Day 14 utilizing a slit-lamp and ophthalmic dye. Staining coverage was scored separately in each of four regions (nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior) using a 5-point photographic reference scale, where 0=0.00% coverage and 4=10% or greater coverage. The scores for the four regions were summed, with a sum score range of 0-16.</description>
