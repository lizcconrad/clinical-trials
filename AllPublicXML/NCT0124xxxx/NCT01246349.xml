      The investigators studied the effect of motivational interviewing (MI) on self-efficacy,
      health behaviors, and health outcomes in overweight children and adolescents (ages ranging
      from 10 to 18 years).

    <textblock>
      One empirically supported intervention with a large evidence base for improving adult
      outcomes in behavioral health-related disorders is Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is
      strongly rooted in the client-centered therapy of Rogers (1951). Its relational stance
      emphasizes the importance of understanding the client's internal frame of reference and
      displaying unconditional positive regard for the client. Motivational interviewing can thus
      be defined as a client-centered, directive method of therapy for enhancing intrinsic
      motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence. MI manifests through specific
      strategies, such as reflective listening, summarization, shared decision making, and agenda
      setting.

      Adolescent participants exposed to motivational interviewing in conjunction with usual care
      (diet and exercise program) are expected to endorse greater self-efficacy, report increased
      engagement in healthy behaviors, demonstrate a decrease in body weight and report improved
      psychological outcomes. While motivational interviewing has been shown to increase adults'
      motivation to make healthy behavior changes, few adolescent studies have demonstrated this
      effect.

    <measure>Weight Efficacy Life-style Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A self-efficacy instrument, the Weight Efficacy Life-style Questionnaire (WEL; Clark, Abrams, Niaura, Eaton, &amp; Rossi, 1991) was used to measure participants' beliefs about and confidence in their own ability to make a behavior change, specifically their ability to lose weight.
The questionnaire yields a total score, with higher scores indicating higher levels of health-related self-efficacy, as well as 5 situational sub-scores (negative emotions, availability, social pressure, physical discomfort, and positive activities). Individuals rate statements on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (not confident) to 9 (very confident).
The WEL is made up of 20 items (4 items per sub-scale) which are summed to obtain a total score, with the lowest total score possible being 0 and the highest 180. Only the total WEL score was used in the study's analyses.
The difference in self-efficacy (WEL) change between treatment and control groups from baseline to a 6 month follow-up was examined.</description>

    <measure>Child Dietary Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A second self-efficacy scale, the Child Dietary Self-Efficacy Scale (CDSS; Parcel et al., 1995) was used to measure participants' confidence in their ability to choose lower fat, lower sodium foods.
The questionnaire is made up of 20 likert items with 3 response options, including &quot;not sure&quot;, &quot;a little sure&quot;, and &quot;very sure&quot;. Each item asks the participant to indicate how sure he/she is that they would make a healthy choice, for example, &quot;How sure are you that you could eat cereal instead of a donut?&quot; Individual items are scored -1, 0, or 1 and subsequently summed for a total score, with the lowest possible score a -20 and the highest a 20, whereby higher scores signify higher dietary self efficacy.</description>

          <description>The control group received social skills training in place of motivational interviewing, conducted over 6 months by an interventionist not trained in MI to avoid cross-contamination.
The social skills interventionist used a standardized treatment manual, developed and validated for children and adolescents. The social skills interventionist offered advice (as opposed to eliciting ideas from the client, as is the case with MI) and clients were assigned goals to work on without specific regard for the clientsâ€™ readiness to change.

        <title>Weight Efficacy Life-style Questionnaire</title>
        <description>A self-efficacy instrument, the Weight Efficacy Life-style Questionnaire (WEL; Clark, Abrams, Niaura, Eaton, &amp; Rossi, 1991) was used to measure participants' beliefs about and confidence in their own ability to make a behavior change, specifically their ability to lose weight.
The questionnaire yields a total score, with higher scores indicating higher levels of health-related self-efficacy, as well as 5 situational sub-scores (negative emotions, availability, social pressure, physical discomfort, and positive activities). Individuals rate statements on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (not confident) to 9 (very confident).
The WEL is made up of 20 items (4 items per sub-scale) which are summed to obtain a total score, with the lowest total score possible being 0 and the highest 180. Only the total WEL score was used in the study's analyses.
The difference in self-efficacy (WEL) change between treatment and control groups from baseline to a 6 month follow-up was examined.</description>

            <description>The control group received social skills training in place of motivational interviewing, conducted over 6 months by an interventionist not trained in MI to avoid cross-contamination.
The social skills interventionist used a standardized treatment manual, developed and validated for children and adolescents. The social skills interventionist offered advice (as opposed to eliciting ideas from the client, as is the case with MI) and clients were assigned goals to work on without specific regard for the clientsâ€™ readiness to change. Sessions were based around finding appropriate ways to navigate typical social situations (for example, how to negotiate with parents, how to manage emotions or how to make friends).</description>

MI is a client-centered, directive method of therapy for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence (Miller and Rollnick, 2002).

            <groups_desc>Based on previous research , baseline CDSS means were expected between 5 - 6.5 with a SD of 3 - 4. It was hypothesized that an attributable effect of 1.5 would be detected.
Published results comprise baseline and follow-up means and standard deviations for both the MI and control group (reported above), as well as the absolute attributable effect of intervention (i.e., the difference in self-efficacy [CDSS] change between the treatment and control groups from baseline to a 6 month follow-up).</groups_desc>

          <title>Control Group</title>
          <description>The control group received social skills training in place of motivational interviewing, conducted over 6 months by an interventionist not trained in MI to avoid cross-contamination.
The social skills interventionist used a standardized treatment manual, developed and validated for children and adolescents. The social skills interventionist offered advice (as opposed to eliciting ideas from the client, as is the case with MI) and clients were assigned goals to work on without specific regard for the clientsâ€™ readiness to change. Sessions were based around finding appropriate ways to navigate typical social situations (for example, how to negotiate with parents, how to manage emotions or how to make friends).</description>

          <title>Motivational Interviewing Group</title>
          <description>The Treatment group received Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is a client-centered, directive method of therapy for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence (Miller and Rollnick, 2002). MI manifests through specific strategies, such as reflective listening, summarization, shared decision making, and agenda setting.
A clinical psychology doctoral student trained in MI administered the intervention over the course of 6 months to participants assigned to the treatment group. The MI intervention comprised six individual MI treatment sessions, each approximately 30 minutes in length.</description>
