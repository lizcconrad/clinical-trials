  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that organized cardiac rehabilitation is effective in improving exercise capacity
      in coronary heart disease patients. Less is known about the long-term results after cardiac
      rehabilitation. Earlier studies have shown that many patients quit exercising when no longer
      attending formal rehabilitation. The investigators wish to investigate the effect of a
      maintenance program after ending a rehabilitation program, and to compare this to usual care.
      The investigators hypothesis is that the maintenance program will result in higher exercise
      capacity and more physical activity compared to usual care.
