      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preemptive
      treatment with CMX001 versus placebo for the prevention of AdV disease in recipients of HSCT
      with asymptomatic AdV viremia.

    <measure>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preemptive treatment with CMX001 versus placebo for the prevention of AdV disease in recipients of HSCT with asymptomatic AdV viremia</measure>
    <description>The outcome measure for the primary endpoint will be &quot;treatment failure&quot;. Treatment failure is a composite endpoint consisting of:
Progression to probable or definitive AdV disease.
OR increasing AdV viremia during randomized therapy (defined as increase from baseline in AdV viremia by ≥ 1 log10, confirmed on a second measurement, at least one week apart) AND requiring discontinuation from randomized therapy</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>1. To compare the safety and efficacy of two dosing regimens of CMX001 versus each other and versus placebo in this indication.</measure>
    <description>2. To compare the incidence of treatment emergent dsDNA viral infections (other than those caused by AdV), in subjects treated with CMX001 QW versus CMX001 BIW versus placebo, initially, for the preemption of adenoviral disease.
3. To characterize the safety and efficacy of CMX001 open-label therapy in patients who meet the primary endpoint of treatment failure during randomized therapy.</description>

          1. Males and females ≥ 3 months and ≤ 75 years of age.

          2. Subjects have received an allogeneic HSCT.

          3. Positive serum AdV PCR (&gt; 100 copies/mL) as measured by the central laboratory.

          4. Subject or guardian(s) are willing to comply with the protocol.

          5. Subject or guardian(s) are willing and able to understand the informed consent/assent.

          6. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum
             beta-hCG) and sexually active females must use a reliable and medically approved
             method of contraception throughout the study. Sexually active males of procreation
             potential must be able and willing to use a reliable and medically approved
             contraceptive method throughout the study. At least one barrier method of
             contraception must be used, in subjects of procreation potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has possible, probable, or definitive AdV disease. See Appendix 2Error!
             Reference source not found. for a definition and criteria outlining possible, probable
             or definitive AdV disease.

          2. Suspected gut graft versus host disease (GVHD) that is not biopsy-proven (subjects
             with a biopsy performed may be included in the study).

          3. Subject has an eGFR ≤ 30 mL/minute and is not currently on dialysis.

          4. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 10 times the ULN,
             conjugated bilirubin &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          5. Subject has mucositis preventing ingestion of oral medication.

          6. Subject is Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody positive, based upon available
             medical records.

          7. Subject has ocular hypotony, uveitis, or retinitis or any other intraocular pathology
             that would predispose the subject to one of these conditions.

          8. Subject has participated in any other investigational drug study or was exposed to an
             investigational drug within 14 days of enrollment.

          9. Is pregnant or breast-feeding or intending to conceive during the course of the study,
             including the follow-up period after drug discontinuation.

         10. Known immunologic hypersensitivity to CDV or CMX001 drug or any of its excipients.

         11. History of illicit drug use or alcohol abuse within the previous 6 months.

         12. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with

             confounds the assessment of the subject (e.g. severe cardiovascular, central nervous
             system (CNS) or pulmonary disease).

         13. Subject has received CMX001, CDV, ribavirin, or leflunomide within the previous 14
             days.
