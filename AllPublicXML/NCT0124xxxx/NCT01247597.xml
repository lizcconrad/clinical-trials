  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare fast-growing lung tumor that is associated with
      other, rare tumor types. Most cases of PPB appear in children younger than 6 years of age.
      Recently, it has been shown that this condition can be inherited (e.g., mutation of the
      DICER1 gene). Researchers are studying both clinical and genetic aspects of this newly
      described condition. They are interested in collecting further medical history and genetic
      information on individuals and close relatives of individuals who have PPB or other rare
      associated tumors.

      Objectives:

      - To study individuals with a personal or a family history of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB)
      or other rare tumors that can be associated with PPB (e.g., cystic nephroma, nasal
      chondromesenchymal hamartoma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, ocular medulloepithelioma).

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals who have been diagnosed with PPB and/or PPB-related tumors.

        -  Close blood relatives (e.g., parents, siblings, grandparents) of individuals who have
           been diagnosed with PPB and/or PPB-related tumors.

      Design:

        -  Interested participants can enroll or inquire about this study by calling
           1-800-518-8474.

        -  Participants will be asked to complete family history and medical history
           questionnaires. They will complete the questionnaire if they are at least 18 years of
           age, or another person will complete the questionnaire if the key family member is too
           young to do so on his or her own.

        -  Participants will be asked to sign a medical record release form to allow researchers to
           examine detailed medical history information.

        -  Participants may be asked to have a physical examination and imaging studies, provide
           blood and saliva samples, or provide tumor tissue from prior biopsies or cancer
           surgeries.

        -  Annually, participants will update the family history and individual information
           questionnaires to document important changes in medical history, and will also update
           the medical record release form. Participants may be asked to provide additional cheek
           lining cells and/or blood samples, as well as tumor tissue from any new or planned
           biopsies or tumor surgeries.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.

      BACKGROUND:

      In 2009, Hill and colleagues identified heterozygous germline mutations in DICER1, a gene
      which encodes a crucial component of the microRNA processing machinery, in patients with
      familial pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB). This disorder represents the first reported cancer
      predisposition syndrome that is due to altered microRNA biogenesis, and its discovery
      presents a unique and extraordinary opportunity for CGB and DCEG to play a substantial role
      in the development of this new area, one which is virtually certain to have etiologic
      ramifications far beyond those related to PPB itself.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To establish a cohort of patients with PPB and/or specific neoplasms of the PPB spectrum
           (cystic nephroma, nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell and
           other sex cord-stromal tumors, ocular medulloepithelioma, Wilms tumor, embryonal
           rhabdomyosarcoma, pineoblastoma, others to be defined), in order to determine the
           frequency of DICER1 germline mutations in these patients and their family members. This
           will also allow us to identify DICER1 mutation-negative patients who will be crucial for
           future gene discovery efforts.

        2. To characterize the clinical phenotype of, and study the incident and prevalent cancer
           rates in, these patients and their family members, for all cancers combined, and for
           each type of cancer, and to identify and confirm the specific types of cancer and benign
           neoplasms associated with this disorder.

        3. To identify differences between patients with a germline mutation in DICER1 (or another
           gene(s) from this pathway) who do develop cancer and those who do not develop cancer.
           These differences may include genotype/phenotype/cancer susceptibility differences,
           modifier genes (gene-gene interactions) and environmental risk factors (gene-environment
           interactions). The latter two may be informative for modification of cancer risk in the
           general population.

        4. To develop evidence-based management guidelines for cancer prevention and risk-reduction
           strategies for PPB patients and their family members prior to and after obtaining
           answers to the questions/objectives above.

        5. To evaluate various parameters related to psychosocial and behavioral issues resulting
           from being a member of a family at increased risk of PPB.

        6. To create a biospecimen repository of carefully-annotated tissue samples for use in
           subsequent etiologically-oriented translational research projects. These samples
           comprise an invaluable resource for current and future studies related to the etiology
           of, and outcomes following, the various neoplasms that are now known, or later found to
           be, part of the DICER1 syndrome.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Individuals with PPB and their relatives of interest (parents, siblings, grandparents,
           other affecteds).

        -  Individuals in the general population with one or more of the unique tumors reported in
           patients and families with PPB: cystic nephroma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors,
           ocular medulloepithelioma, and nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, and other associated
           conditions that will be identified under objective 2. Relatives of these patients will
           be eligible for study enrollment as well (parents, siblings, mutation carriers, other
           affecteds).

      DESIGN:

        -  Multidisciplinary natural history study with self-administered questionnaires,
           clinical/epidemiologic/genetic evaluations, clinical and research laboratory tests,
           review of medical records, cancer surveillance, and biospecimen acquisition:

             -  Field Cohort: consented subjects who provide questionnaire data, biological
                samples, medical records, imaging results, etc., from their home communities.

             -  NIH Cohort: consented subjects who do all the above, and who also travel to the NIH
                Clinical Center for a detailed in-person assessment and data collection.

        -  Primary endpoints include all cancers, with specific attention to those currently
           thought to be part of the DICER 1 syndrome.

        -  Secondary endpoints include non-malignant health issues.

        -  Systematic analysis of the entire data set will occur on a yearly basis.

        -  Ancillary studies will be performed using the data and biospecimens collected from study
           participants, as new collaborative opportunities and research hypotheses become
           available. We will do our best to articulate the specific uses that will be made of the
           information and materials collected as part of this project. We also recognize that both
           knowledge and technology are progressing at such a rapid rate that it is impossible to
           predict all the ways in which this material will be used in the future. The Consent Form
           will provide an outline of the kinds of research anticipated, and seek subject approval
           for our having some latitude in how these samples/data are used (with an opportunity to
           opt out of such uses), in order to minimize the likelihood that additional consent would
           need to be sought in the future, and to ensure that we are positioned, as the public
           stewards of this incredibly valuable resource, to take maximum advantage of its utility
           for advancing scientific and clinical knowledge.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with histologically-confirmed PPB and other (DICER1-associated tumors) and
             their relatives of interest (parents, siblings, extended family). Individuals with a
             known or suspected DICER1 mutation and family controls (those without a known or
             suspected DICER1 mutation) are eligible. Given the rarity of this disorder, we are
             open to patients from all over the world, at the discretion of the PI (e.g.
             availability of medical records in English, ability of patient/family to communicate
             in English) but will follow NIH travel regulations.

          -  Patients from the general population with one or more of the unique tumors of the
             types seen in patients/families with PPB, cystic nephroma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell
             and other sex cord-stromal tumors, ocular medulloepithelioma, nasal chondromesenchymal
             hamartoma, Wilms tumor, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, pineoblastoma, pituitary blastoma,
             thyroid cancer - regardless of family history. Relatives of these patients will be
             eligible for the study as well (parents, siblings, extended family). As above,
             individuals with a known or suspected DICER1 mutation and family controls (those
             without a known or suspected DICER1 mutation) are eligible. Additional
             syndrome-associated neoplasms may be identified in the future, and they will be added
             to the protocol as needed.

          -  There is no age restriction.

          -  There is no restriction related to organ and marrow function.

          -  Ability of the proband or their guardians to understand, and their willingness to
             sign, a written informed consent document

          -  All types and amounts of prior therapies are allowed.

        Pregnant Women: Pregnant women will be included in this study as several endpoints are
        assessed during pregnancy; counseling, education, and other minimal risk procedures (i.e.
        blood draw) may be done. We will postpone full clinical evaluations at the Clinical Center
        for pregnant women until the subject has recovered post-partum. No imaging studies will be
        performed on pregnant women at the Clinical Center.

        Research Eligibility Evaluation: This is entirely a function of meeting the inclusion
        criteria and not being excluded by the exclusion criteria. In most instances, patients with
        histologically-confirmed PPB and/or another neoplasm within the DICER1 syndrome and their
        families will be referred to the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) by the IPPBR, provided that
        the family has previously or currently indicated a desire to be notified of such research
        opportunities. In non IPPBR-cases, the diagnosis will be confirmed by reviewing relevant
        medical records and relevant surgical pathology material.

        Adult patients and family members who are unable to provide consent: This category includes
        adults who lack the capacity to consent, for whom the legal representative or appropriate
        surrogate may give consent. This group is included because below normal intellectual
        function may be observed in a small proportion of families although it has not been
        described in association with the DICER1 syndrome. The permission of the appropriate
        surrogate will be obtained per the latest NIH Policy M87-4 (rev). It would be
        discriminatory as well as scientifically biased to exclude this group. This protocol is
        designated as &quot;more than a minimal risk with generalizable knowledge with no prospect of
        direct benefit,&quot; and patients who are unable to provide consent may receive the same
        benefit. Where appropriate we will ask the subject to sign an assent form; we will honor a
        verbal dissent by the subject with regard to specific studies/procedures.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals and families referred for evaluation in whom reported diagnoses are not
        verifiable.
