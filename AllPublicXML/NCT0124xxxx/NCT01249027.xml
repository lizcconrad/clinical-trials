      This is a prospective, observational, single-arm, open-label, multicenter, postapproval
      registry study in China. The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Evaluate the continued safety and effectiveness of the XIENCE V EECSS in a cohort of
           real-world patients receiving the XIENCE V EECSS during commercial use

        -  Evaluate patient compliance to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
