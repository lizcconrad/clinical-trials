    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to determine if subjects treated with oseltamivir in addition to
      standard of care treatment for influenza demonstrate a greater improvement in attention /
      working memory / processing speed / mood as compared to subjects receiving standard of care
      alone. The cognitive tests employed are objective measures developed and administered online
      by HeadMinder Inc.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine if subjects treated with oseltamivir in addition to standard of care treatment
      for influenza demonstrate a greater improvement in attention as compared to subjects
      receiving standard of care alone.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To determine if subjects treated with oseltamivir in addition to standard of care treatment
      for influenza demonstrate a greater improvement in working memory and processing speed as
      compared to subjects receiving standard of care alone.

      Supportive Objectives:

        1. To determine if subjects treated with oseltamivir in addition to standard of care
           treatment for influenza demonstrate a greater improvement in self-rated alertness as
           compared to subjects receiving standard of care alone.

        2. To determine if subjects treated with oseltamivir in addition to standard of care
           treatment for influenza demonstrate a greater improvement in self-rated calmness and
           contentment as compared to subjects receiving standard of care alone.

        3. To determine if there is a correlation between the rate of improvement in symptom scores
           and the rate of change in attention and working memory.

    <description>Attention assessed using simple reaction time measured in milliseconds. Simple reaction time calculated as the mean of the following 2 sub-tests:
Reaction Time Subtest
Cued Reaction Time Subtest
The lower the value, the better the attention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Working Memory Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Working memory assessed with the Dot Memory Test.
The higher the value, the better the working memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Processing Speed Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Processing speed assessed with the animal number decoding subtest
The lower the value, the better the processing speed</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mood Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Mood was assessed using the Bond-Lader 10 cm (100 mm) visual analogue scales for mood (16 scales in total); factored for alertness (mean of 9 scales), calmness (mean of 2 scales) and contentment (mean of 5 scales).
The range in score for each scale and for each factor (alertness, calmness and contentment) was 0 - 100 mm.
Each scale was anchored such that the lower the value, the better the mood.</description>

             or B strains) that started within a maximum of 2 days prior to Visit 1 as per the
             Tamiflu® Canadian product label. Signs and symptoms may include the following:

               -  Fever

               -  Respiratory symptoms (cough, coryza, sore throat, rhinitis)

        <description>Mood was assessed using the Bond-Lader 10 cm (100 mm) visual analogue scales for mood (16 scales in total); factored for alertness (mean of 9 scales), calmness (mean of 2 scales) and contentment (mean of 5 scales).
The range in score for each scale and for each factor (alertness, calmness and contentment) was 0 - 100 mm.
Each scale was anchored such that the lower the value, the better the mood.</description>
