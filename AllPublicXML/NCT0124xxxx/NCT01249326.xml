  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the protein requirement associated with
      postoperative weight loss caused by by-pass (shunt which leads to a certain degree of
      malabsorption) or sleeve gastrectomy (more technically conservative with less malabsorption),
      through the study of nitrogen balance. The benefit of protein supply easily absorbed and with
      high essential amino acids content (proteins &quot;fast&quot; soluble milk) on protein metabolism and
      muscle function will also be studied. Endotoxemia and intestinal flora variations were
      measured before and after bariatric surgery.

      This is a prospective longitudinal study of the effect of bariatric surgery on protein
      requirements and protein metabolism, and protein supplementation interest, appropriate to the
      digestive tract changes, for the mass and muscle function. Three groups of patients will be
      studied: One group undergoing sleeve gastrectomy in Clermont-Ferrand (group 1: n = 20) will
      be followed by current recommendations. A second group undergoing sleeve gastrectomy in
      Clermont-Ferrand (group 2: n = 20) will receive during three months, protein supplement
      (powder whey protein (&quot;fast&quot;)) at dose of 40g / day. 10 patients in group 1 and 10 patients
      in group 2 will participate in protein metabolism study. The third group undergoing gastric
      bypass in Lyon (group 3: n = 20) will be followed by the current recommendations and will
      participate in study of endotoxemia.
