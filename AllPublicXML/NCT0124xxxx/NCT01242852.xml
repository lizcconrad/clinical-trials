    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Despite the numerous advances in the field of in vitro
      fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI), there still exists a maximum
      implantation rate per embryo transferred of about 30%. Next to the physiological and physic
      burden that comes with every IVF treatment cycle, implantation failure also adds up to the
      considerable costs associated with ART. Studies have shown, that minor intrauterine
      abnormalities can be found in 11-40% of the infertile women with a normal transvaginal
      sonography. Detection and treatment of these abnormalities by office hysteroscopy have led to
      a 9-13% increase in pregnancy rate. Therefore, it is increasingly advocated to screen all
      infertile women on intracavitary pathology prior to the start of IVF/ICSI.

      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the proposed study is to assess whether diagnosing and treating
      unsuspected intrauterine abnormalities by saline infusion sonography and/or routine office
      hysteroscopy prior to a first IVF/ICSI treatment cycle improves the cost-effectiveness of the
      fertility treatment.

      STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter randomized intervention study. POPULATION: Asymptomatic women,
      indicated for a first IVF/ICSI treatment cycle and a normal transvaginal ultrasonography.

      INTERVENTION: Participants will be randomized for a (SIS and) hysteroscopy with
      treatment-on-the spot of predefined intrauterine abnormalities versus no diagnostic work-up.
      In both groups standard IVF/ICSI treatment will be initiated.

      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE:

      Cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate resulting in live birth achieved within 18 months of
      IVF/ICSI treatment after randomization (obtained in both treatment cycles with fresh embryos,
      as well as in subsequent cryo/thaw cycles)

      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE:

        -  Cumulative implantation rate achieved within 18 months of IVF/ICSI treatment after
           randomization (obtained in both treatment cycles with fresh embryos, as well as in
           subsequent cryo/thaw cycles)

        -  Cumulative miscarry rate within 18 months of IVF/ICSI treatment after randomization
           (obtained in both treatment cycles with fresh embryos, as well as in subsequent
           cryo/thaw cycles)

        -  Cost calculations of, SIS, hysteroscopy procedures and the IVF treatment

        -  Patient preference and tolerance of a SIS and diagnostic/therapeutic hysteroscopy
           procedure

        -  Prevalence of unexpected intrauterine abnormalities

        -  Diagnostic accuracy of SIS in diagnosing intrauterine abnormalities

    <description>Routine fertility work-up, added up with diagnostic tests. In 5 research centers the extra tests consist of SIS &amp; hysteroscopy (HY). In the other research hospitals it consists of only a HY. The HY examination will be scheduled on Day 3-12 of a cycle. It will be performed in an outpatient setting with a vaginoscopic approach. A 5-mm diameter continuous flow hysteroscope and a 30ยบ direction of view will be used. The uterus will be inspected methodically a endometrial biopsy obtained and the findings recorded into a standardized form. Intrauterine pathology is defined as septum, endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, adhesions &amp; endometritis. These will be treated, using scissors, Versapoint, grasping forceps, polyp snare or antibiotics. In 5 of the research hospitals, 1 week prior to the HY, also a SIS will be performed. Via a catheter saline solution will be infused into the uterine cavity as distention media. The findings at the following sonography will be standardized recorded.</description>
