      The study hypothesizes superiority of the video-based training (observation combined with
      motor exercise, &quot;video&quot;) over motor exercise alone (&quot;non-video&quot;) and standard rehabilitation
      (&quot;standard&quot;).

      The clinical study is a multicenter, open, randomized, controlled, paralleled group trial
      with three investigative arms. The study recruits at least 375 first stroke patients with
      certain motoric disabilities that are randomly assigned to either one experimental condition
      or one of two control conditions. Every individual patient participates for 31 (+/- 1) weeks
      in the trial (see fig. 1), the whole study is planned to last at least for 3 years. The
      recruitment and treatment of patients will last for 17 months during the trial. Patients
      undergo a baseline assessment for screening purposes and during the course of participation
      three further assessments of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. These endpoints will
      refer to the degree of recovered objective and subjective physical abilities due to the
      experimental treatment in comparison to the control comparators. Studies' hypotheses claim
      that the experimental treatment will lead to effects on the motoric abilities superior the
      effects elicited by the control treatments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized patient: discharge from rehabilitation within the following week;
             outpatient: insult between 6 weeks and 2 years in the past (controlled via medical
             history).

          -  Age between 30 and 80 years, since older patients could probably not exercise the
             stamina necessary for a participation throughout the whole time course of the
             treatment (controlled via discharge letter from hospitalized patients, and note from
             the general practitioner from outpatients, respectively).

          -  First clinically evident stroke so that the patient has no history of stroke related
             trainings and treatments (controlled via medical history).

          -  Ischemic cortical or subcortical lesions in middle cerebral artery territory resulting
             mainly in defined motoric impairments (controlled via medical history).

          -  Upper limb paresis (controlled via standard neurological examination).

          -  Minimal movement ability of the paretic limb (controlled by MRC index ≥2 and ≤4: hand
             extension against gravity at wrist = 20° and at metacarpophalangeal and
             interphalangeal joints of each of the fingers = 10°) to participate in the treatments'
             physical training tasks.

          -  If medication is needed: stable concomitant medication (controlled via discharge
             letter from hospitalized patients, and note from the general practitioner from
             outpatients, respectively)

          -  Signed informed consent to participate in the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Brain stem infarction. These lesion site results in further impairments that could
             interfere with treatment (controlled via discharge letter from hospitalized patients,
             and note from the general practitioner from outpatients, respectively).

          -  Impaired level of consciousness that could prevent patient to understand and follow
             instructions throughout the intervention, and further result in inabilities to hold
             attentiveness and concentration to the treatment (controlled via standard neurological
             examination).

          -  Severe aphasia that could prevent patient to understand and follow instruction
             throughout the intervention (controlled by administration of the Token test, TT, &gt; 11
             incorrect reactions).

          -  Dementia that could lead to impaired abilities to follow instructions (controlled by
             administration of the Mini-Mental-State Examination, MMSE, score &lt; 26).

          -  Depression that could result in major difficulty of the patients motivational
             compliance to follow instructions and to participate in the interventions' tasks
             throughout the treatment (controlled by administration of the Beck Depression
             Inventory, BDI, score &lt; 15).

          -  Apraxia that could lead to impaired abilities to follow instructions (controlled by
             administration of the Florida Apraxia Screening Test, FAST, &lt; 10 correct re-actions
             and/ or &gt; 10 incorrect reactions).

          -  Neglect that could lead to impaired abilities to participate in the treatments
             observational tasks (controlled by administration of the Albert's Neglect Test, &gt; 1
             line unchecked).

          -  Severe psychiatric disorder, severe pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, or epilepsy
             that could lead to reduced abilities to participate in the treatments' task
             (controlled via discharge letter from hospitalized patients, and note from the general
             practitioner from outpatients, respectively).

          -  Severe joint deformity of arthritic origin that could reduce the patients abilities in
             tasks demanding a functional physical execution thus resulting in the masking of
             possible training effects (controlled via standard neurological examination).

          -  Motor problems not primarily unilateral or excessive pain in major affected limb that
             could reduce the patients abilities in tasks demanding a functional physical execution
             thus resulting in the masking of possible training effects (controlled via standard
             neurological examination).

          -  Actual treatment with Botox or neuroleptics; no constant concomitant medication
             (controlled via discharge letter from hospitalized patients, and note from the general
             practitioner from outpatients, respectively).

          -  Planned start of other rehabilitation therapies that might interfere with the trial
             treatment in the next eight weeks from time point of recruitment.

          -  Insufficient knowledge of german language to understand and fill in the questionnaires
             (clinical judgement during standard neurological examination).

          -  Residence more then 300 kilometres from participating centre, that would exacerbate
             the regular visits of the patient in the respective centre (controlled by questioning
             of the patient).

          -  People who are accommodated in an institution by court or administrative order
             (controlled by questioning of the patient).

          -  Any other illness or medical treatment or drug or narcotics misuse that could
             interfere with the assessment of the safety, tolerability and efficacy, e.g. current
             bone fractures of the stroke affected limb. (controlled via discharge letter from
             hospitalized patients, and note from the general practitioner from outpatients,
             respectively) .

          -  Simultaneous participation in another (clinical) trial or interfering examination or
             participation in a study within 90 days prior to screening
