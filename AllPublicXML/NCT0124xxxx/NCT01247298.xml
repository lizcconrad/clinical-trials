      Primary objectives of this research

        1. Evaluate the safety of a combination of TACE and high dose SBRT

        2. Measure time to progression (TTP) and local recurrence rate of HCC treated with a
           combination of TACE &amp; SBRT.

      Secondary objectives of this research

        1. Assess failure patterns and survival of patients treated with TACE &amp; SBRT.

        2. Analyze dose volume characteristics that influence Radiation Induced Liver Disease
           (RILD) among patients treated with a combination of TACE and SBRT.

        sterile) must use a medically accepted contraceptive regimen. Male patients must agree to
        use a medically approved method of contraception.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT): This investigational study will evaluate the combination of TACE along with high dose SBRT. TACE has been used extensively in the palliative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It will be performed by the Interventional Radiologist prior to radiation therapy.</description>
