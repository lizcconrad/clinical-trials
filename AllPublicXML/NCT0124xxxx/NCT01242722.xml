    <textblock>
      This study will collect data, from an implanted Cardiac Resynchronization
      Therapy-Defibrillator (CRT-D) device, to further evaluate a new feature for future heart
      failure devices.

      ELEVATE 2.0 is an acute, prospective, multi-center, feasibility study randomized within
      patient test sequence and pulse width, designed to characterize the performance of the Left
      Ventricular Auto Threshold (LVAT) feature.

    <measure>Collect ventricular evoked response signals and CRT-D device data during LV only and Bi-ventricular (Bi-V) voltage step down pacing</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 24 hours post CRT-D implant</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to collect real-time signals during LV pacing voltage step-down from patients with implanted COGNIS CRT-D devices in a follow-up setting. This data will be used to assess the stability of the LV evoked response electrogram signal and will be used in an offline assessment of the LVAT algorithm. One or two data points will be collected per patient in the trial. Patients must be at least 24 hours post implant of their COGNIS CRT-D device</description>
