  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary strategies for alleviating health complications associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D)
      are being pursued as alternatives to pharmaceutical interventions. Berries such as bilberries
      that are rich in polyphenols may influence carbohydrate digestion and absorption and thus
      postprandial glycaemia. In addition berries have been reported to alter incretins as well as
      to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may also affect postprandial
      glycaemia. This study investigated the acute affect of a standardised bilberry extract on
      glucose metabolism in T2D.

      Eight male volunteers with T2D controlling their diabetes by diet and lifestyle alone were
      given a single oral capsule of either 0.47g standardized bilberry extract (36% (w/w)
      anthocyanins) which equates to ∼50 g of fresh bilberries or placebo followed by a
      polysaccharide drink (equivalent to 75 g glucose) in a double blinded cross over intervention
      with a two week washout period.

      This study demonstrates that the ingestion of a concentrated bilberry extract reduces
      postprandial glycaemia and insulin in volunteers with T2D. The most likely mechanism for the
      lower glycaemic response involves reduced rates of carbohydrate digestion and/or absorption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary strategies for alleviating health complications, such as premature vascular disease,
      associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are actively being pursued as alternatives
      to pharmaceutical interventions. The genus Vaccinium (e.g. blueberry, bilberry, cranberry)
      has been used traditionally as a source of folk remedies for established diabetic symptoms.

      Berries from this genus are enriched in anthocyanins, polyphenols recognized for their
      ability to provide and activate cellular antioxidant protection and inhibit inflammatory gene
      expression, activities that may contribute to the efficacy of the Vaccinium genus as
      ameliorators for type 2 diabetes. Consumption of a freeze-dried blueberry beverage for an 8
      week period for example decreased plasma concentrations of the cardiovascular risk factors
      oxidized LDL, malondialdehyde and hydroxynonenal. In another trial, bioactives from
      blueberries improved insulin sensitivity in obese insulin-resistant men and women. In both
      these studies the investigators reported no change in inflammatory markers following
      supplementation although bilberry juice was shown to modulate plasma markers of inflammation
      C-reactive protein and IL-6 in subjects with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These
      beneficial responses from human studies are supported by data that demonstrate long-term
      beneficial effects of anthocyanins from mouse models of obesity and diabetes.

      There are also a number of studies in vitro and in vivo that suggest that polyphenols
      influence carbohydrate digestion and absorption, resulting in improved postprandial glycaemia
      in the short term. Polyphenols inhibit intestinal alpha glucosidase activity and glucose
      transport in vitro. In association with this, polyphenols administered to rodents suppress
      the elevation of blood glucose concentration after oral administration of mono- and
      di-saccharides. In humans, several studies have examined the effect of polyphenols on the
      post-prandial glycaemic response. In one study a test meal of mixed berry purée with sucrose
      showed a lower plasma glucose concentration after 15-30 min compared with a control matched
      for sugars.

      Overall, evidence suggests that consuming edible berries, particularly from the genus
      Vaccinium, that have high concentrations of anthocyanins could provide a supplementary
      intervention to improve glycaemia in subjects with T2D or impaired glucose tolerance. The
      object of this study was to investigate whether a single supplementation with a standardised
      (36% w/w anthocyanins) concentrated bilberry extract could alter glucose metabolism in
      overweight/obese volunteers with impaired glucose intolerance or T2D compared with a control
      capsule matched for sugars and to explore the possible mechanisms of action.

    <description>Volunteers were fasted (10-12 h) overnight before the OGTT. Venous blood samples were taken through an indwelling cannula inserted into a forearm vein at -15, -10 and -5 (fasted) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 300 min after consuming 75 g of Polycal liquid (carbohydrate, 61·9%; polysaccharide, 49·2
%; sugars, 12·2%; glucose, 0·6%; maltose, 11·6%; http://www. nutricia.co.uk). Polycal was selected as the main carbohydrate as it is in the form of polysaccharides and this is closer to normal dietary consumption than glucose only.The volunteers consumed the appropriate capsule (0 min), glucose load and a further sample of water (70 ml) within 3 min.
For those volunteers taking the control capsule, additional sugar (fructose and dextrose/glucose) was added double-blinded to the water to match the free sugar content of the Mirtoselect® capsules. Movement during the 300 min OGTT was kept to a minimum.</description>

        <title>Plasma Glucose iAUC (Incremental Area Under the Curve; mM*Min)</title>
        <description>Volunteers were fasted (10–12 h) overnight before the OGTT. Venous blood samples were taken through an indwelling cannula inserted into a forearm vein at –15, –10 and –5 (fasted) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 300 min after consuming 75 g of Polycal liquid (carbohydrate, 61·9%; polysaccharide, 49·2
%; sugars, 12·2%; glucose, 0·6%; maltose, 11·6%; http://www. nutricia.co.uk). Polycal was selected as the main carbohydrate as it is in the form of polysaccharides and this is closer to normal dietary consumption than glucose only.The volunteers consumed the appropriate capsule (0 min), glucose load and a further sample of water (70 ml) within 3 min.
For those volunteers taking the control capsule, additional sugar (fructose and dextrose/glucose) was added double-blinded to the water to match the free sugar content of the Mirtoselect® capsules. Movement during the 300 min OGTT was kept to a minimum.</description>
        <time_frame>Plasma was collected at -15, -10 and -5 (fasted) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 300 min post capsule</time_frame>

            <description>In a cross-over design, volunteers (n 8) were randomised and double-blinded into two groups matched for BMI as well as age and given a single capsule of either 0·47 g of Mirtoselect® (a standardised bilberry extract (36 % (w/w) anthocyanins)) which equates to about 50 g of fresh bilberries formulated in gelatin capsules or a control capsule consisting of microcrystalline cellulose in an opaque gelatin capsule, followed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). The reverse procedure was conducted following a 2-week washout period. The volunteers were asked to consume a low-phytochemical diet 3 d before taking the capsule and for the 24 h after taking the capsule on both occasions. In addition the volunteers were asked to record what they ate over the same period in a food diary to ensure that they adhered to the low-phytochemical diet. Subjects were reimbursed travelling expenses on completion of the study.</description>
