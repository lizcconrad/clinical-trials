      This pilot trial will evaluate the following in patients with acute pancreatitis:

        1. Safety profile of early treatment with intravenous dexamethasone

        2. Impact of dexamethasone on systemic inflammation in patients with acute pancreatitis

        3. Provide preliminary data on potential impact of early treatment with steroids on
           clinical outcomes

    <description>A composite clinical endpoint including development of either 1) pancreatic necrosis, 2) persistent organ dysfunction defined according to Atlanta symposium criteria 3) requirement for treatment in an intensive care unit and/or 4) development of culture-documented infection will be used to evaluate impact of treatment with dexamethasone on clinical outcomes in the study population.</description>
