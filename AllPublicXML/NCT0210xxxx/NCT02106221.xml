    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to support enhancement, implementation, and evaluation of an
      improved model for delivering improved primary care to high-risk older adults through the use
      of health IT tools, focusing on issues related to the patient-centered primary care home
      (PCPCH) and other similar high-value elements that are proposed to improve patient outcomes.
      During this study, participating clinics will utilize the already-implemented Integrated Care
      Coordination Information System (ICCIS). Clinic staff will meet with a practice facilitator
      (monthly and as needed), and will track study activities and submit invoices via ICCIS
      reporting. These invoices will be used to simulate a shared savings model where clinics will
      be reimbursed based on their progress and effort towards their goals.

      Clinics will set and work towards goals that they have chosen. Goals for the control arm are
      self-selected by the clinics themselves; goals for the invention arm are related to
      high-value elements (HVE) that have been identified as areas that can improve patient
      outcomes. These HVE are:

        1. Evidence-based Care Management Based on Need

        2. Identification of At-Risk Populations

        3. Patient Engagement and Alerts Based on Goals

        4. Integrated Information for Care Management, especially around Utilization

        5. Population Management Tools
