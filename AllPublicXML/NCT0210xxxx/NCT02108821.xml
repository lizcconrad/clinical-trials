  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A disturbance in the diversity of gut bacterial composition could be linked to several immune
      mediated diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). IBD can be classified into
      Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Both these diseases occur from abnormal
      immune reaction to resident gut bacteria.The process of fecal microbiota transplantation
      (FMT) where fecal bacteria from a healthy individual is transferred into a recipient, has
      recently received attention as an alternative therapy for individuals affected with these
      life-altering diseases. In this study, the investigators will perform fecal transplantation
      on the subjects meeting inclusion criteria, to determine the efficacy and safety of this
      therapy in subjects with IBD (CD and UC) who are not responding to first line therapy, and
      are in a flare.

      50 subjects (25 subjects with Crohn's Disease and 25 subjects with Ulcerative Colitis) who
      are 2 to 22 years of age will be enrolled in the trial over 3 years. The fecal donors,
      preferably a parent or sibling, will be extensively screened for infectious diseases prior to
      providing stool for the transplant. Patients who are failing primary therapy, are in a flare,
      and require restaging of their IBD by an endoscopy and colonoscopy will be approached for the
      study. Standard of care endoscopy and colonoscopy will be performed on each subject and 2
      additional biopsies will be taken for analysis. Microbiota analysis will also be performed on
      both the donor and recipient stool sample prior to transplantation, and on the recipient
      sample at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post transplantation. The primary objective will be
      to study the safety of FMT in all enrolled subjects. The study will also correlate efficacy
      and patient outcomes with the fecal microbiome prior to, and after FMT. The secondary
      objectives are to examine the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of children with IBD using the
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and the Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity
      Index (PCDAI) analysis. Correlate the patient outcomes with the fecal microbiome prior to,
      and after FMT.

    <description>Fecal Microbiome Transplantation will be done at the time of EGD and colonoscopy. A parent or sibling or a healthy relative will be tested for several infections like hepatitis, H. Pylori, HIV, syphilis, ova and parasites, culture and C.diff. They will fill out a donor questionnaire used for blood donors prior to the sample collection. After eligibility criteria have been met, appropriate consent has been obtained, and the screening labs have been assessed, the fecal transplant procedure will take place in the procedure center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Fresh stool sample will be obtained from the donor. The fecal sample will be prepared for transplantation in a designated area in the procedure center. Frequency: once. Duration: Approximately 1 hour</description>
