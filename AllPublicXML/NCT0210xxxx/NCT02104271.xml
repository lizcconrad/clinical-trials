  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a wide variability of options for treatment of chronic radiation proctitis. However,
      studies are still limited, usually case reports from a single center and few are comparative
      studies between methods. Therefore, the choice of treatment is determined by availability and
      local expertise for each method. The variability of treatment options range from
      anti-inflammatory medical treatment, sucralfate, short chain fatty acids, antioxidants and
      hyperbaric oxygen to such endoscopic and surgical treatments. Surgery is usually the last
      therapeutic option due to the high morbidity and mortalityassociated. Various endoscopic
      treatment modalities have been reported. Formalin topic is effective in up to 48% of patients
      with chronic radiation proctitis.

      The endoscopic treatment with argon plasma (APC) is low cost, easy to apply and
      transportation, safe and effective in the treatment of rectal bleeding in patients with
      chronic radiation proctitis. Currently, the APC is the preferred endoscopic modality.

      Most studies on the use of APC in radiation proctitis showed benefit. The APC controls the
      mild to moderate rectal bleeding in 80% to 90% of cases and improves symptoms of urgency,
      diarrhea and tenesmus in 60% to 75% of cases.

      APC is usually applied with a power of 40-60W and 1.2-2.5 L/min of gas flow by using a
      electrosugical generator coupled with an argon delivery unit. However, high gas flow have
      been associated to high rates of complication such as rectal stenosis and deep rectal ulcer.

      In this context, the present study aims to compare the effectiveness and safety between two
      different paramenters of argon plasma coagulation (40-50W and 2.0 L/min of gas flow vs 40W
      and 1.2 L/min of gas flow) in the treatment of patients with symptomatic chronic radiation
      proctitis.

    <description>Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) treatment will be delivered using a &quot;spray-painting&quot; technique, with short applications at 40W power and argon gas flow of 1.2 L/min. The APC equipment consists of a high frequency electrosurgical generator combined with a source of argon gas (Argon + SS601MC 4 , WEM Electronic Equipment Ltda , Ribeirão Preto , Brazil ). A flexible catheter of 2.3 mm diameter ( WEM ) Teflon coated and with a hint of heat resistant ceramic is inserted through the working channel of the colonoscope and connected to the current generator and the gas source for APC implementation.</description>

    <description>APC was performed during sigmoidoscopy exam. Bowel preparation begins on the eve of the exam associated with waste liquid diet without oral intake of 10mg of bisacodyl (5mg/dragee) at 14 o'clock and 18pm and 130ml of phosfoenema (16g of sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and 6g of sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate per 100ml) diluted in 100ml of orange juice or lemon to 19h. On the day of the exam is administered 130ml of phosfoenema rectally immediately before the exam.
All patients were previously sedated with fentanyl (0.05mg/ml), midazolam (5mg/5ml) and propofol (10mg/ml) and have intravenous introduction of the flexible colonoscope to the transverse colon to the exchange of gases following the routine of the Department of Endoscopy, Cancer Hospital Barretos.</description>
