      This study is to investigate whether it is possible to use a special type of ultrasound scan
      (CEUS, Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Scan) to view the shape, assess blood supply and
      calculate the amount of oxygen being carried to a transplanted kidney and pancreas. We
      currently use a nuclear scan (Transcan) to assess this in the kidney. This is cumbersome,
      involves nuclear medicine and takes 45- 60 minutes to complete.

      We do not routinely image the blood supply to the pancreas post-surgery, despite the most
      common complication post pancreas transplantation being vascular in origin. In an emergency a
      CT angiogram is carried out. This involves transfer of a sick patient to the CT scanner and
      injection of contrast which is harmful to the kidneys.

      CEUS involves injection of a safe contrast prior to conducting an ultrasound scan. This can
      be carried out at the bed-side, provides instant results and is cheap and safe enough to do
      on a routine basis for all kidney and pancreas transplant recipients. Although the uses of
      CEUS are well recognised, it is currently not routinely used in transplantation. CEUS has
      been compared to other modes of imaging and has been found to be comparable/ beneficial.
      However, it has never been compared to Transcan. We will therefore perform CEUS on our kidney
      transplant recipients and compare the results to Transcan. We will also assess whether CEUS
      is able to visualise the blood supply to the kidney and pancreas and quantify the perfusion
      to the pancreas.

    <measure>To ensure feasibility of conducting CEUS post renal and pancreas transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>Likely to be 24 hours post surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>To ensure that conducting CEUS in the peri-operative period is logistically feasible in our centre at short-notice and it is possible to obtain images which are usable for analysis, given the presence of dressings and drains on the abdomen post surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess patient acceptability of performing CEUS in the peri-operative period</measure>
    <time_frame>Likely to be within 24 hours post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A validated pain questionnaire will be completed by the patient, assessing pain scores prior to and after the CEUS, compared to prior to and after the renogram.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the quantification (likely expressed as percentage) of organ perfusion from CEUS, with our current gold standard, the nuclear renogram.</measure>
    <time_frame>Once both, renogram and CEUS have been performed. Likely to be within 24 hours of surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The quantification analysis of the CEUS and renograms will be correlated using descriptive statistics and either parametric or non-parametric statistical analysis to produce a correlation coefficient.</description>

    <measure>Post-operative complications</measure>
