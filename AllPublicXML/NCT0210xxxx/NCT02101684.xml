  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Granulosa Cell ovarian carcinoma is an infrequent subtype of neoplasia well differentiated
      from epithelial tumors. They account for 5% of all ovarian malignancies and, with an
      incidence of 0.4-1.2 cases per 100000 habitants, is considered as a rare disease.

      Though most cases are identified at initial stages and can be cured through surgical
      resection, distant recurrences have been documented even 10 years after resecting the primary
      tumor. At advanced stage it is a lethal disease.

      Unfortunately because of the low incidence of this disease randomized clinical trials are
      lacking. In fact current evidence for treatment is provided by case reports, retrospective
      studies and phase II clinical trials performed one decade ago.

      Orteronel, a novel, orally active, selective inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, is being developed as
      an endocrine therapy for relevant hormone-sensitive cancers such as prostate cancer and
      breast cancer. Orteronel is expected to suppress sex hormone levels in both circulation and
      relevant hormone-dependent malignant tissue. Since sex hormone overproduction has been
      demonstrated in granulosa cell ovarian tumors and seems to play a major role in this disease,
      this study will assess the efficacy or orteronel treating such tumors.

          -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be
             &lt;=2.5 X ULN.

          -  Total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 X ULN.
