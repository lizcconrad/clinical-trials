      This pilot clinical trial studies photodynamic therapy during surgery in treating patients
      with pleural (the protective lining or membrane that covers the lungs and chest cavity)
      malignancy. Photodynamic therapy is an anti-cancer treatment that combines a photosensitizer
      (a substance that makes cells more sensitive to light), such as porfimer sodium, together
      with oxygen and visible light to kill tumor cells and/or damage the tumor's blood supply.
      Intraoperative (during surgery) photodynamic therapy may kill any tumor cells that remain
      after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. To determine the feasibility and toxicities of incorporating surgical
      resection and intra-operative Photofrin (porfimer sodium)-mediated photodynamic therapy in
      patients (pts) with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) or non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) with pleural spread.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall survival rate of pts with NSCLC and pleural spread treated with
      standard frontline chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and intra-operative
      Photofrin-mediated photodynamic therapy.

      II. To determine the overall survival rate of pts with MPM after radical pleurectomy and
      intraoperative Photofrin-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT).

      III. To determine the progression-free survival and pleural progression-free survival in the
      above mentioned pts.

      IV. To determine the absolute Photofrin levels in tumor and normal tissues resected from pts
      using spectrofluorometric assay. Photofrin levels in tumor to normal tissue ratios will be
      determined.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive porfimer sodium intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes. Beginning 24 hours
      later, patients undergo tumor resection and/or radical pleurectomy followed by intraoperative
      PDT to the pleural space.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months.

    <measure>Porfimer sodium uptake defined as the ratio of the porfimer sodium concentration in tumor tissue to normal tissue (i.e. skin) using spectrofluorometric assay</measure>
    <time_frame>After surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Porfimer sodium concentration in the tissue will be calculated based on the increase in fluorescence resulting from the addition of a known amount of porfimer sodium to each sample after its initial reading. Absolute concentrations of porfimer sodium will also be measured. Distribution of uptake will be summarized by mean, median, standard deviation, range, and histogram. The tumor: normal tissue ratio from direct and indirect measurements will be calculated. Spearman's correlation will be employed to correlate and compare direct and indirect measurements.</description>
