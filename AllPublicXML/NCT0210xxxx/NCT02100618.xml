  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the long-term persistence of the immune response
      and safety of the HPV vaccine in healthy females who were aged 9 to 25 years in the primary
      study (NCT00541970).

  <why_stopped>
    Due to late study start, the possibility to enroll enough subjects dropped below the limit to
    provide scientifically acceptable data, hence study was cancelled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol or subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable
             Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will
             comply, with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Subjects who completed their primary vaccination and received either two or three
             doses of GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 vaccine according to a 0,6-months schedule or a
             0,1,6-months schedule in the study HPV-048 PRI (110659) (NCT00541970).

          -  A female between, and including, 9 and 14 years of age or 15 and 25 years of age, at
             the time of first vaccination, depending on which group they belonged to in the study
             HPV-048 PRI (110659) (NCT00541970), i.e., 9-14 year old subjects should have received
             two doses of GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 vaccine according to a 0,6-months schedule and
             15-25 year old subjects should have received three doses of GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18
             vaccine according to a 0,1,6-months schedule.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject/from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the
             subject. In addition, subjects below the legal age of consent should sign and
             personally date a written informed assent form.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             HPV-16/18 study vaccine administered in the study HPV-048 PRI (110659) (NCT00541970)
             from the last visit of the primary study up to the current study visit or planned use
             during the study period.

          -  Administration of any HPV vaccine from the last visit of the primary study up to the
             current study visit or planned use during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within three months prior to blood sampling. Inhaled
             and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within the period starting 30 days before study entry, with the exception of routine
             meningococcal, inactivated influenza, hepatitis B, diphtheria/tetanus and/or
             diphtheria/tetanus-containing, poliomyelitis and/or pertussis vaccines up to 8 days
             before study entry. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of
             specified window.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the blood sampling.
