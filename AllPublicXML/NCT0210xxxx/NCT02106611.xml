  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether cardiac MRI can improve early detection of Hodgkin lymphoma
      associated heart disease compared to a stress echocardiogram. By doing both stress
      echocardiography and cardiac MRI, we will compare the ability of the two tests to detect
      heart disease.

    <description>This is a prospective cross-sectional study of 200 HL survivors whose treatment included mediastinal RT at initial diagnosis or relapse, and are at least 5 years from last HL treatment.</description>

    <description>HL treatment will be determined by review of available medical records as archived at MSKCC. Recorded variables will include: (1) RT - field, fractional and cumulative dose, and duration; (2) chemotherapy - regimen, planned interval, dose per cycle, and cumulative dosages. Patients will also be asked to complete the FACT-LYM questionnaire and the FACIT Fatigue questionnaire.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Classical or nodular lymphocyte predominant HL treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
             Cancer Center.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Treatment for HL that included mediastinal RT at initial diagnosis or relapse.

          -  ≥ 5 years from last HL treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary HL diagnosis prior to 1980.

          -  Additional mediastinal RT or subsequent cardiotoxic systemic therapy for secondary
             malignant neoplasm.

          -  Known CAD/CHF (defined as documented myocardial infarction, cardiac revascularization,
             angiographic obstructive CAD, or decreased LV function [EF &lt; 55%] during prior
             clinical care).

          -  Contraindication to MRI (i.e. pacemakers, defibrillators, or aneurysm clips, or other
             implanted ferromagnetic objects), gadolinium (i.e. known hypersensitivity to
             gadolinium, advanced renal insufficiency as defined by glomerular filtration rate &lt;30
             ml/min/1.73m^2).

          -  Contraindication to exercise stress testing other than the above (i.e. unstable angina
             or severe valvular stenosis).
