      This is an extension study of Protocol CA194002 to allow 2 specific participants with basal
      cell nevus syndrome in the CA194002 study at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre who are still
      benefitting from the study drug BMS-833923 to continue receiving the study drug. This study
      will continue to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMS-833923 in these participants.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMS-833923
      administered on an extension protocol in subjects with basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS). This
      is an extension study of Protocol CA194002 to allow 2 specific participants with BCNS in the
      CA194002 study at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre who are still benefitting from the study
      drug BMS-833923, to continue receiving the study drug. In this open-label extension protocol,
      no new subjects will be recruited. The two BCNS subjects from Protocol CA194002 (subjects
      CA194002-1-14 and CA194002-1-25) will continue to receive BMS-833923 at the dose and schedule
      administered on CA194002 until fulfilling protocol criteria for discontinuation. These
      patients are receiving different doses: one being 60mg once every 2 weeks, and the other is
      receiving 300mg once daily. This study will continue to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of BMS-833923 in these participants.
