  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men who present with erectile dysfunction as defined as an IIEF (International Index of
      Erectile Function) score less than 21 will be evaluated for risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). This is a single-blind study. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion for
      treatment (ARM 1) versus placebo (ARM 2). Adipose tissue (fat) will be harvested from all
      patients and stem cells will be cultured. For those patients in the placebo arm the stem
      cells will be frozen for later use after one year when the patients cross over into the
      treatment arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline assessment of patients will include completion of 6 questionnaires, EKG
      (electrocardiogram), vision testing using a standard eye chart, markers of endothelial
      dysfunction hormone evaluation, laboratory blood tests, vital signs, penile ultrasound
      (optional), echocardiogram, chest x-ray, and endothelial function assessment (Endopat).

      The adipose tissue sample is sent to Celltex's state-of-the-art laboratory in Houston, Texas.
      For those subjects in the placebo arm, the stem cells will be frozen for later use after one
      year when the patients cross over into the treatment arm. The subject (patient) will receive
      an infusion of either autologous stem cells (cells made from his own fat tissue) or placebo
      every 2 weeks for 3 months. Placebo will be in the form of normal saline. Subjects will be
      closely monitored every two weeks for first 3 months and once the treatment is complete,
      subjects will be monitored every 3 months for the first year. Each of the previously
      mentioned tests will be performed at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 month mark. However, the penile
      ultrasound (optional) and the echocardiogram will be performed only at the 3 and 12 month
      mark.
