  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the CG-100 device, a single use, temporary
      intraluminal bypass device,intended to reduce contact of fecal content with an anastomotic
      site, following colorectal surgery (open or laparoscopic).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is scheduled to undergo an elective colorectal surgery (open or
             laparoscopic) which will require the creation of an anastomosis, maximally 20 cm
             proximal from the anal verge

          -  The patient is willing to comply with protocol-specified follow-up evaluations

          -  The patient signed Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing female subjects

          -  Patient surgical treatment is acute (not elective)

          -  Patient has infections at the time of intervention

          -  Major surgical or interventional procedures within 30 days prior to this study or
             planned surgical or interventional procedures within 30 days of entry into this study

          -  Patients with ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) classification &gt; 3

          -  diagnosis of bowel obstruction, bowel strangulation, peritonitis, bowel perforation,
             local or systemic infection, ischemic bowel, carcinomatosis or extensively spread
             inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Patient is participating in another clinical trial within 30 days of screening

          -  Patient has been taking regular steroid medication in the last 6 months

          -  Contraindications to general anesthesia

          -  Patient has preexisting sphincter problems or evidence of extensive local disease in
             the pelvis

          -  Internal diameter lumen of the colon is smaller than 25 mm or larger than 34 mm

          -  Blood loss (&gt; 500 cc)

          -  Leak test failure during surgery

          -  Any condition or surgical incidence where the device deployment can jeopardize the
             patient's safety or interferes with study outcome per the discretion of the
             investigator
