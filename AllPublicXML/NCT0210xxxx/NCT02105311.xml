  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct this study to access the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty
      on 24-hour circadian tension curves of patients with open-angle glaucoma, normal tension
      glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This treatment effect is compared with that of the
      prostaglandin analogue, travoprost.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selective laser trabeculoplasty is an effective treatment for lowering intraocular pressure
      in patients with open-angle glaucoma. Clinical evaluations of its effectiveness in individual
      patients usually are derived from baseline and post-laser measurements of intraocular
      pressure during office hours in the sitting position. Only a few studies have examined the
      efficacy of laser trabeculoplasty beyond office hours. Although the 24-hour effect of laser
      trabeculoplasty has been studied ,the study was conducted before the use of these new and
      more potent intraocular pressure lowering drugs. So it doesn't have any study to determine
      the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty and travoprost to reduce the diurnal and
      nocturnal variation of Iintraocular pressure.
