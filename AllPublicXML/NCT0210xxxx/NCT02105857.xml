      The purpose of the study is to find the best way to mobilize a knee after total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA). In particular, the aim of this study will be to investigate the
      advantages of adding a gentle knee mobilization to the standard rehabilitation used by
      physiotherapists in this hospital after TKA.

      All individuals waiting for TKA from the &quot;Departement de l'appareill Locomoteur (DAL) -
      Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudoise (CHUV)&quot; will be considered for this research trial.
      The number of individuals necessary to complete this study is 32.

      Participants deciding to take part will be given an information sheet and asked to sign a
      consent form. If deciding to take part, they will still be free to withdraw at any time and
      without giving a reason. A decision to withdraw at any time, or a decision not to take part,
      will not affect the standard of care they receive.

      People who agree to take part will be randomly selected into 2 groups: one group will follow
      the standard treatment used in physiotherapy after TKA, the other group will have the same
      treatment and the technique of A+ mobilization in investigation added. Participants have 50%
      chances to be allocated to either of the groups. Before surgery, at the first and seventh day
      after operation, the researchers will measure the range of motion (ROM) of the replaced knee.
      This means that the study will last till the moment the last participant leaves the DAL -
      CHUV, which is estimated to be in 12 months after the first recruitment.

      Individuals over 18 years old undergoing unilateral primary TKA caused by osteoarthritis will
      included. Exclusion criteria will be: a) insufficient French language skills to agree a
      written consent, b) body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 kg/m2, c) symptomatic OA in the contralateral
      knee (defined as self-reported knee pain &gt;4 on a 10-point verbal analogue scale), d) other
      lower extremity orthopedic problems limiting function, e) neurologic impairment or g)
      cognitive dysfunction.

      No life-style restrictions will be requested. Patients will just need to follow the
      physiotherapist's usual advices during the in-hospital period at the DAL - CHUV. This study
      does not alter the standard procedures, patients will receive all the techniques used in
      physiotherapy as every other TKA patient. If allocated into the mobilization group, a
      specific knee splint will be positioned on the patient's knee. This position will be held for
      20 minutes with the leg straight and 20 minutes bent, twice a day. The person in charge of
      these procedures is the principal investigator of the study, a certified orthopedic
      physiotherapist on the staff of the DAL - CHUV. No additional changes to patients' daily
      routine will be involved.

      To the investigators knowledge, there are no side effects due to use of this mobilization.
      Nevertheless, the pain levels of every patient will be recorded to identify any differences
      between groups. If, during or after the clinical study, any patient will face unexpected
      health problems related with the study, they will be kindly asked to transmit the information
      to the principal investigator of the study. The mobilization technique involves no additional
      risk over that of standard treatment performed in the hospital. This study hypothesis that
      adding A+ graded mobilization combined with the standard in-hospital rehabilitation protocol
      will improve ROM without increasing pain.

      All information collected will be kept strictly confidential. Any information used will have
      names and addresses removed. All data will be stored, analyzed and reported in compliance
      with the Data Protection Legislation of Switzerland.
