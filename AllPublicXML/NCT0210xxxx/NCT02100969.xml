      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hizentra is a safe and effective treatment
      for people with myasthenia gravis (MG).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disorder which causes the muscles to become weak
      because the immune system attacks the connection between the nerves and the muscles.

      Hizentra is a subcutaneous (under the skin) immunoglobin (SCIg). An immunoglobin is a blood
      protein. Hizentra is being studied for the treatment of patients with MG. Hizentra is
      administered by an injection into the skin through a portable infusion pump, which may be
      easier for patients to administer than the current treatments.

      Participants will be asked to complete 9 clinic visits and 3 telephone calls. It could take
      up to 30 weeks to complete all study visits.
