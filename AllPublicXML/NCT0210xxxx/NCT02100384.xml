    <textblock>
      Nowadays, dental implants are a very attractive and affordable treatment option for patients.
      According to the American Society of Implant Dentistry the dental implant market in the U.S
      is projected to reach $1.3 billion by 20101. Despite the high success rates of dental
      implants, it is clear that osseointegrated implants are susceptible to diseases. The
      prevalence of dental implant complications are rising as the number of individuals that are
      receiving implant treatment is also increasing. One of these peri-implant complications is an
      inflammatory condition known as peri-implant mucositis that occurs in 64.6% to 80% of the
      implant population.

      The lack of preventive maintenance therapy in subjects with peri-implant mucositis is
      associated with a high incidence of peri-implantitis, which eventually may lead to implant
      loss. One important method in the prevention of peri-implant mucositis is the reduction in
      plaque accumulation, through individual oral hygiene procedures and regular peri-implant
      professional maintenance. It is highly important that patients be educated about the
      importance of developing good oral hygiene habits and to attend regular periodontal
      maintenance appointments. The clinicians have to recognize the significance of monitoring and
      maintaining peri-implant health.

      Unfortunately, it is unclear which of the different maintenance regimens and treatments
      strategies for peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis are more effective. There is lack
      of information about which peri-implant maintenance protocol offers the best outcome in terms
      of reduction of inflammation and improved patient comfort. According to Grusovin et al,
      &quot;there is only low quality evidence for which are the most effective interventions for
      maintaining or recovering health of peri-implant soft tissues and there is no reliable
      evidence as to which regimens are most effective for long term maintenance&quot;. Moreover,
      current approaches to implant maintenance are somewhat haphazard and not standardized.

      It is assumed that what is appropriate for teeth is also beneficial for implants; as stated
      by Persson et al, 2010 &quot;therapies proposed for the management of peri-implant diseases are
      currently based on the evidence available from the treatment of periodontitis&quot;. Two
      conventionally used methods of biofilm and calculus removal from teeth in North America are
      hand instruments (curettes and scalers) and ultrasonics. In teeth these two modalities of
      treatment have been studied extensively; conversely, there are fewer studies on dental
      implants. Renvert et al, 2008 concluded that mechanical non-surgical treatment might be
      effective to treat peri-implant mucositis but not peri-implantitis; however, the data
      supporting this literature review was scarce. The same research group compared ultrasonic
      instrumentation with specific-implant tips to titanium curettes in the treatment of
      peri-implantitis founding no group differences in the treatment outcomes with improvements in
      plaque and bleeding scores but no effects on probing depths. In addition, both methods failed
      to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts and no group differences were found in the ability to
      reduce the microbiota in a six months period.

      One of the main concerns for dental implants is that metal scalers and ultrasonics generate a
      roughened surface on the implant, which in turn facilitates plaque accumulation and therefore
      makes maintenance of plaque free surfaces more difficult. It was observed in a recent study
      that special coated scalers and ultrasonic tips have been shown in vitro to be compatible
      with implant surfaces, however this has not been confirmed in vivo. The previous finding is
      in agreement with a current study, which demonstrated that the roughness values of the
      titanium surface of implants treated with piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers with a newly
      developed metallic tip and plastic hand curettes, are equal to the surface's roughness of
      untreated implants. Mann et al, 2012 showed in an in vitro study that plastic-coated scalers
      cause minimal damage to the implant surface but leave plastic deposits behind on the implant
      surface, suggesting further research is needed to evaluate the use of such plastic tips in
      the debridement of implants.

      An additional factor, in evaluating the efficacy of different instrumentation in peri-implant
      maintenance, which needs to be taken into consideration, is patient perception. There is
      currently no data evaluating patient perception of comfort in regards to hand vs. ultrasonic
      instrumentation. This information is very important because should both methods of
      debridement be considered of equal efficacy, patient preference may play a role in the
      practitioner's selection of instrumentation. Knowing that patient comfort will increase the
      patient's compliance to the maintenance therapy, further evaluation of this factor is
      necessary.

      Long term comparison of ultrasonic and hand instrumentation in the maintenance of
      peri-implant tissues: A randomized clinical trial

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to determine the clinical effects, presence of inflammatory
      cytokines, and the patients' perceived discomfort by comparing titanium scalers to ultrasonic
      instrumentation using implant inserts in a patient population with healthy peri-implant
      tissues and implants with peri-implant mucositis during a one-year period of peri-implant
      maintenance.

      Hypothesis

      There are insufficient studies in the literature to guide the clinician which technique will
      offer better results in maintaining health or in decreasing inflammation long term around
      dental implants during peri-implant maintenance. It is postulated in this study that (1)
      peri-implant therapy will have a beneficial clinical effect, will decrease the presence of
      inflammatory cytokines and will be well tolerated by the patient population and that (2)
      there will be no differences in the outcomes between the two peri-implant maintenance
      therapies.

      Materials and Methods

      Previous approval by the Biomedical Research Ethics Board of the University of Manitoba a
      randomized clinical trial will be conducted between May, 2014 and May, 2015 at the
      Periodontics Clinic of the University of Manitoba. The Oral Biology Laboratory of the
      University of Manitoba will perform the analysis of samples of the peri-implant crevicular
      fluid. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, CONSORT Statement will be followed.

      66 participants with at least one single dental implant will be recruited and randomly
      assigned to one of the two peri-implant maintenance groups. Subjects enrolled in the study
      will be regular patients of the Periodontics Graduated Clinic at the University of Manitoba,
      Faculty of Dentistry. Each participant will sign a written informed consent. The
      randomization will be computer-generated by a second person not involved in the study.

      A total of 352 sites (6sites/implant) will be studied. Cohen effect size has been used to
      calculate the sample size. Small to medium effect size ranges by Cohen: 0.2mm to 0.5mm. In
      addition, independent t-test with alpha=0.05, power (1-beta) =80%, 95% confidence interval
      and two tailed test. Allocation ratio, n1/n2=1. G*Power 3.1.7 software was used in sample
      size calculation. An attrition rate of 6 participants was calculated.

      A code will be assigned to each participant. Only the research coordinator will have access
      to the patients/codes matching list and its corresponding therapy. The peri-implant
      maintenance will be performed by two experienced Dental Hygienists previous intra and
      inter-examiner calibration. A single blinded calibrated examiner (MC) will do the recording
      of clinical findings and sampling at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.

      The following are the inclusion criteria: (1) subjects having at least one single unit dental
      implant (2) probing depths no more than 5mm in 6 aspects around each implant (MB, B, DB, ML,
      L and DL), (3) no bone loss beyond 2mm/implant at baseline confirmed with periapical
      radiographs with a cone paralleling technique. The next criteria will be excluded from the
      study: (1) implant supported removable prostheses, (2) use of antibiotics within the
      preceding 3 months (3) smokers (4) missing exam at baseline.

      The parameters to be assessed at 6 sites/implant are the following: (1) Modified plaque index
      by Mombelli (2) Modified gingival index by Mombelli, (3) probing depths (PD), (4) presence of
      keratinized gingiva (0, 0.5-1.5mm, 2 or greater), (5) recession (REC) distance between
      gingival margin and most occlusal point of restoration, (6) Cytokine levels in peri-implant
      crevicular fluid, 1 sample from the deepest site of implant(s) will be collected at baseline,
      3, 6 and 12 months. In addition, patients will also be asked to fill in a pain questionnaire
      at the end of the study period (Visual analogue scale, VAS).

      To collect the peri-implant crevicular fluid, the site will be isolated from saliva using
      cotton rolls and drying before the sampling. Periopaper strips (Oraflow) will be introduced
      at the deepest site of the implant sulcus for 30 sec. The volume of peri-implant crevicular
      fluid will be measured using a Periotron. Until further analysis strips will be store at -80C
      in sealed plastic tubes previously identified with a code corresponding to the name of the
      patient. Pro-inflammatory/pleiotropic cytokines, which are found during inflammatory
      processes at cellular level will be assess. The fluorescence based multiplex protein
      quantification system (BioPlex, BioRad, Hercules CA, USA) will be used to measure the
      following eight cytokines: GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α.

      Ethical Considerations

      The patients will be asked to review and sign a written consent form. Only individuals
      involved in this study will have access to the data collected during the study. The records
      for each patient will be assigned with a unique number and will be stored by the principal
      investigator at her desk within the clinic premises. The master sheet linking the patient
      identifiers to the unique number will be stored in a safe in the clinic administrative
      office. In case of possible continuation of line of investigation, the data could be compared
      with new data (introduction of air abrasive). The master sheet and patient records will be
      shredded at the end of 4-5 years. To thank them for their participation in the study they
      will receive a free maintenance appointment at the end of the study (12 months).

      Relevance of the study

      This study is relevant because there is currently no long term in vivo studies that determine
      the effectiveness of peri-implant maintenance and also the possible differences and/or
      similar outcomes between curettes and ultrasonics in the peri-implant maintenance protocol.
