      To assess whether the daily use of NeutraSal will prevent or reduce dry mouth in patients
      undergoing CPAP therapy for OSAS and improve CPAP compliance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) who have started CPAP
      treatment and have complained of dry mouth or developed worsening of a pre-existing dry mouth
      as an effect of CPAP treatment will test the effectiveness of NeutraSal mouthwash in
      preventing or reducing his/her dry mouth perceptions and improving their compliance with
      CPAP.
