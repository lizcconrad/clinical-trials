  <brief_summary>

      To test the effects of 2 different 5-wk stress management interventions (cognitive behavioral
      training or relaxation training) vs. a time-matched 5-wk health education condition on
      psychosocial adaptation and physiological adaptation in women being treated for breast
      cancer. Participants assigned to either of the stress management conditions will show
      improved psychosocial adaptation and physiological adaptation compared to those assigned to
      the health education condition.

      The study tests the effects of two 5-wk group-based stress management interventions
      (Cognitive Behavioral Training [CBT] (stress awareness, cognitive restructuring, coping
      skills training, interpersonal skills training), Relaxation Training [RT] (muscle relaxation,
      deep breathing, guided imagery, meditation) vs. a time-matched 5-wk group-based Health
      Education Training control condition (information about breast cancer diagnosis and
      treatment, side-effect management, recurrence, physical activity and nutrition, and life
      after breast cancer) in women who have recently had surgery for breast cancer but have not
      yet started adjuvant therapy. The study evaluates the effects of CBT and RT on psychological
      adaptation (includes measures of negative adaptation [negative affect and social disruption]
      and positive adaptation [positive affect and benefit finding]) at 6-month and 12-month
      follow-up. The study also evaluates the effects of CBT and RT on physiological adaptation
      (includes levels of PM serum cortisol and T-helper-type 1 (Th1) cytokine [interleukin-2,
      IL-2, and interferon-gamma, IFN-g, production after anti-CD3 stimulation of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
