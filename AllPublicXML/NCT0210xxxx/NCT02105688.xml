  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study. The purpose of Part A is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      grazoprevir (MK-5172) 100 mg in combination with elbasvir (MK-8742) 50 mg for 12 weeks in the
      treatment of chronic HCV GT1, GT4, or GT6 infection in treatment-naïve participants who are
      on opiate substitution therapy (OST). The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of
      participants who receive grazoprevir/elbasvir fixed-dose combination (FDC) in the Immediate
      Treatment Arm and achieve a Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after the end of all study
      therapy (SVR12) will be superior to 67%. In addition, participants who received at least 1
      dose of grazoprevir/elbasvir in Part A will be eligible to participate in Part B, which is a
      3-year observational follow-up.

    <description>Blood was drawn from each participant to assess Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) plasma levels using the Roche COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® Taqman HCV Test, v2.0, which had a lower limit of quantification of 15 IU/mL. SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of detection (&lt;LLOQ) at 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to construct 95% confidence intervals for the SVR12 rate. As pre-specified in the protocol, the Deferred Treatment Arm was not included in the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

    <description>An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an adverse event. For this study, the primary safety analysis compared the safety data in the Immediate Treatment Arm during the double-blinded treatment period to those of the Deferred Treatment Arm during the double-blinded placebo treatment period.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s product, is also an adverse event. For this study, the primary safety analysis compared the safety data in the Immediate Treatment Arm during the double-blinded treatment period to those of the Deferred Treatment Arm during the double-blinded placebo treatment period.</description>
