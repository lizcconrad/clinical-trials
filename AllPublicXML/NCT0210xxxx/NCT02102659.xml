    <textblock>
      1. Clinical nutritional support therapy is an important progress of modern medicine.

        2. Conventional methods of clinical nutrition assessment (Anthropometric, lab, etc.) not
           just lack of accuracy and immediacy but also difficult to dynamically reflect the
           fluctuation trend of nutrition status.

        3. It has been reported that malnutrition affects proliferation and apoptosis of human
           cells in vivo. This preliminary study was initiated by the hypothesis that changes in
           nutritional status may be reflected rapidly in fast proliferating cells.

        4. In the previous studies the investigators already found that apoptosis rate of oral
           mucosal epithelium could reflect changes in nutritional status.There were an obvious
           decreasing in apoptosis and proliferation rate of oral mucosal epithelium in
           malnourished patients.

        5. Based on the patient's curve of apoptosis rate of oral mucosal epithelium, the plateau
           being achieved by increase the nutrition amount continuously, Maintain this amount of
           nutrition given until the end of treatment. The investigators call this amount of
           nutrition the &quot;upper limit nutrition support therapy&quot;.

        6. The patients applying for&quot;upper limit nutrition support therapy&quot; and &quot;Formula nutrition
           support therapy&quot; separately, comparing of the two methods influences on postoperative
           wound healing, postoperative complication rate ,inflammatory response, side effects of
           chemotherapy, hospital stays and hospitalization expenses.
