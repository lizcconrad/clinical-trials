      Research Problem:

      Bladder cancer is one of the major health concerns of the world. The present methods of
      diagnosis are: Ultra sound, Cystoscopy, CT scan and urine cytology. All these are stressful
      to the patients, particularly Cystoscopy which is commonly employed for the follow up of
      Bladder cancer patients.

      Research Significance:

      The present study will employ a new photodynamic diagnostic procedure to quantify a certain
      cancer specific biomarker called Porphyrin, which selectively binds on to the bladder cancer
      tissues. In this context the present technique offer viable, very easy and reliable table top
      instrumentation for diagnosis and continual monitoring of disease regression through urine.

      Research Objectives:

        -  To quantify bladder cancer specific biomarkers such as Porphyrin using photodynamic
           diagnostic procedure

        -  To find out whether this technique might be a new and easy tool for bladder cancer
           diagnosis only by urine.

      Research Methodology:

      The bladder cancer patients is required to swallow a chemical called ALA (5 Amino levulinic
      Acid hydrochloride), about 10mg/kg body weight which will play a role of biological
      indicator. ALA gets metabolized into certain types of porphyrins which selectively bind on to
      the tumor tissues (for a longer time than the normal tissues). 5ml of blood and one urine
      samples will be taken before using ALA. The patient must drink water then the urine will be
      collected after 4, 8 and 12 hours of taking ALA and the samples will be analyzed by
      photodynamic diagnostic procedure.

    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is one of the most common urologic cancers in Saudi Arabia. its cases
      represent a significant and challenging part in the daily practice for the majority of
      urologists practicing. The present methods of diagnosis are: Ultra sound, Cystoscopy, CT-scan
      etc. All these are stressful to the patients, particularly Cystoscopy which is commonly
      employed for the follow up of Bladder cancer patients.

      In recent years, fluorescence cystoscopy, in contrast to conventional white light cystoscopy,
      has been investigated as a tool to enhance detection of occult papillary lesions and
      carcinoma in situ. Recent fluorescence photo detection strategies have used 5-aminolevulinic
      acid (5-ALA); a precursor of heme biosynthesis.

      5-Aminolevulinic acid-enhanced cystoscopy does appear to have improved sensitivities in
      detecting nonmuscle invasive bladder tumors such as carcinoma in situ . Aminolevulinic acid
      (ALA) may have a role in other applications in surgical oncology based on its ability to
      discriminate neoplastic tissue from adjacent normal tissue. Aminolevulinic acid is not a
      photosensitizer, but rather a metabolic precursor of porphyrin, which is a photosensitizer.

      The present study will employ photodynamic diagnostic procedure to quantify only in urine a
      specific cancer biomarker Porphyrin which selectively binds on to the bladder cancer tissues
      for a longer time than the normal tissues. In this context, the present study will offer
      viable, very easy and reliable table top instrumentation for diagnosis and continual
      monitoring of disease regression.

    <description>The patient must drink water then the urine will be collected after 4, 8 and 12 hours of taking Amino levulinic Acid and the samples will be analyzed by photodynamic diagnostic procedure. Amino levulinic Acid gets metabolized into certain types of porphyrins which selectively bind on to the tumor tissues (for a longer time than the normal tissues).The above samples is taken in a four side polished quartz cuvette of 1cmx1cmx4cm and put into the table top spectral scan. This consists of a 5 mw, blue diode laser, of 405nm wavelength. The collimated laser beam falls on the urine sample and excites fluorescence and Raman signals from the porphyrin molecules which have been metabolized from the oral administration of Amino levulinic Acid.</description>
