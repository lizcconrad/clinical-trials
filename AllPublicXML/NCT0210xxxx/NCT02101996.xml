  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The average American diet consumed by a significant proportion of the adult population,
      supplies excessive calories and large amounts of saturated fat. Saturated fats can be cleared
      and used in skeletal muscle, but in obese individuals, biomarkers of saturated fat are found
      in the blood, along with markers of poor muscle metabolism.

      Both fats and amino acids are processed by the same metabolic pathways in muscle, and the
      investigators hypothesize that meals with greater amounts of saturated fat slow muscle
      metabolism. A better understanding of the interaction of these to metabolites will allow for
      the development of future medications to treat muscle loss in sick individuals and the
      elderly.

      This study includes two parts, a baseline study and a three-week dietary study. The baseline
      study will be performed to test how the body absorbs and stores meal fat after a meal. In the
      three-week dietary study, the subjects will consume only the meals provided by the
      investigators for three weeks before the tests, and then participate in a hospital stay. The
      three-week dietary study is to test the chronic effect of a high fat diet on how body absorbs
      and stores the fat.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Lean/insulin sensitive (n=10, BMI ≤ 24 kg/m2 and glucose infusion &gt; 4.0 mg/min))

          2. Overweight/obese insulin resistant (n=10, BMI 26-35 and glucose infusion &lt; 4.0 mg/min)

          3. 30-50 years of age

          4. Men and pre-menopausal women

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Insulin resistance is defined by insulin clamp as the rate of glucose infusion ≤ 4.0
             mg/min.

          2. BMI over 35 kg/m2

          3. Abnormal thyroid function, kidney or liver disease

          4. Uncontrolled hypertension, or occasional or regular smoker, use of medications or
             supplements that interfere with lipid, protein, or carbohydrate metabolism

          5. Pregnancy (urine test), breast feeding an infant, or anemia

          6. Alcohol intake: Males &gt;140 g/week, Females &gt; 70 g/week.

          7. Fasting plasma triglycerides &gt;300 mg/dL. Extreme hypertriglyceridemia could be due to
             either elevations in very low-density lipoproteins or chylomicrons, either of which
             would impair our ability to resolve dietary metabolic processes.

          8. Need to consume acetaminophen-containing medications on a regular basis.
