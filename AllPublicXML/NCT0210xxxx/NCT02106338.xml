  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CRS3123, a methionyl-tRNA
      synthetase inhibitor. In this study, doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg, or 100mg are planned and
      will be given orally every 12 hours for 10 days. Up to 30 healthy male and female subjects 18
      to 45 years, inclusive. The primary objective: of the study is to determine the safety and
      tolerability of escalating doses of CRS3123 following oral administration of multiple doses
      to healthy adults. The study duration is 46 weeks.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CRS3123,a fully synthetic,
      oral, antimicrobial that targets methionyl-tRNA synthetase of gram-positive bacteria,
      including Clostridium difficile. This protocol will study oral doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg,
      or 100mg given orally every 12 hours for 10 days. Subjects will be divided into 3 cohorts, A,
      B, and C. Cohorts A and C will be given 200mg and 600mg of CRS3123 or placebo.The dose for
      cohort B and study progression and dose escalation to Cohorts B and C will require a full
      (planned) SMC review of all safety data obtained through Day 18. Should safety data review of
      the 200 mg dose result in an unfavorable safety profile, the study design allows for
      reduction in dose to 100 mg to be given in Cohort B. If this is the case, there will be no
      Cohort C. Up to 30 healthy male and female subjects 18 to 45 years, inclusive. The primary
      objective: of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of
      CRS3123 following oral administration of multiple doses to healthy adults. The secondary
      objective will be to determine the plasma, urine and fecal concentrations and systemic
      exposure of CRS3123 after multiple oral doses.The study duration is 46 weeks.
