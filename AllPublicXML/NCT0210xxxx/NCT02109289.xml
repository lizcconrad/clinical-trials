  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this preliminary project is to study the effect of etanercept, a medicine
      approved by Health Canada for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, on the inflammation of
      certain blood vessels. In particular, the inflammation of the aorta and the carotid arteries
      will be studied.

      This study's goal is to determine if etanercept (that blocks TNF (tissue necrosis factor)
      alpha) could have an effect on blood vessel inflammation. As well, the information from this
      study will be used to determine the number of patients to recruit in a future study.

      This study will evaluate the effect of etanercept on 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis at
      one rheumatology clinic in Montreal. The 10 patients will be recruited at the Montreal
      Rheumatology Institute (Institut de Rhumatologie de Montr√©al) and the images of the blood
      vessels taken at a medical imaging center will be analyzed by the Montreal Heart Institute.

      To evaluate vascular inflammation subjects will undergo a PET scan (Positron Emission
      Tomography).

      This study is a 16 week, single center, open label trial, to study the effect of etanercept
      on vascular inflammation of the ascending aorta and carotid arteries in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      Patients with active RA already receiving methotrexate for at least 3 months will receive
      etanercept for 16 weeks. Etanercept will be administered sub-cutaneously using the dose
      approved in the Canadian product monograph for RA (50 mg every week). Patients will continue
      methotrexate at a stable dose during the study unless a dose reduction or cessation is
      required as judged necessary by the study investigator. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
      Scan will be performed at baseline and after16 weeks of study treatment with etanercept. At
      the end of the study, all PET Scan images will be analyzed in a blinded manner by the
      Montreal Heart Institute core laboratory.

      Safety will be assessed using adverse events collection and laboratory hematology and
      chemistry analysis (screening and Week 4) and pregnancy test.
