    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder
      characterised by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort and diarrhoea. This trial
      aims at the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of oral ibodutant 10 mg once daily as
      compared to placebo in women with IBS-D over a 12-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ibodutant 10 mg, given once daily for 12 weeks
      in comparison with placebo in female IBS-D patients. Randomisation to ibodutant and placebo
      will be 1:1. Efficacy is evaluated in terms of weekly response for abdominal pain intensity
      and stool consistency over 12 weeks of treatment in at least 50% of the weeks of treatment.

      The clinical phase of the study comprises up to 2 weeks of screening for patient's
      eligibility, a 2-week run-in period (treatment-free) for IBS severity assessment, a 12-week
      double-blind treatment period, a 4-week randomised withdrawal (RW) period and a 2-week safety
      follow-up, resulting in a maximum 22-week overall duration of the study for each patient.

      Patients report their IBS-related symptoms daily in a telephone-based electronic diary from
      run-in until end of treatment.

    <description>The patient will be considered a weekly responder if she meets both of the following criteria in the same week:
Abdominal pain response: decrease in weekly average of worst abdominal pain score in the past 24 hours of at least 30% compared with baseline;
Stool consistency response: decrease of at least 50% in the number of days per week with at least one stool that has a consistency of Type 6 or 7 compared with baseline. The patients reported Bristol Stoll Chart score based on a 1 to 7 scale where 1 corresponds to hard stool and 7 corresponds to watery diarrhoea.</description>

    <description>Comparison between average abdominal pain intensity (worst abdominal pain on a 0 to 10 NRS scale, where 0 corresponds to no pain and 10 corresponds to worst possible pain) and average stool consistency score (the patients reported Bristol Stool Chart score based on a 1 to 7 NRS scale where 1 corresponds to hard stool and 7 corresponds to watery diarrhoea) during the 4-week RW presented as change to baseline.
The analysis only included the patients randomised to ibodutant in the 12-week treatment period and re-randomised to placebo for the 4-week RW period. Baseline was considered as the average abdominal pain intensity/stool consistency in the 2-week Run-in period.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The first patient was screened on 27th February 2014 and the first patient randomized on 21st March 2014. The last patient completed the study on 22nd June 2015. The study was conducted at 158 clinical sites in 11 countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, the USA and the United Kingdom).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1237 patients entered a 2-week Screening period, 1034 entered the qualifying 2-week Run-in period and 535 of them were randomised. After completion of the double-blind 12-week treatment, 453 patients entered into the Randomised Withdrawal (RW) period.</pre_assignment_details>
