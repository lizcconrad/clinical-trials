  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine extreme responders to second- and third-line Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)
      therapy using a retrospective approach and patients with slow or fast diabetes progression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PILOT Phase (March 2013 - Dec 2014) Patients will be recruited initially from 2 centres, plus
      Exeter as a pre-PILOT centre. Patients with particularly good or poor response to second- and
      third-line Type 2 diabetes treatments and patients progressing to insulin either particularly
      quickly or particularly slowly will be recruited from primary, secondary, or community
      settings. Fasting blood and urine samples will be collected, along with standard biomeasures
      and information will be collected about medical history and prescribing history.

      All study documentation and sample materials will be sent out to sites from the coordinating
      centre. Sites will be expected to process and freeze samples and send them to the Central
      Laboratory managed by the Chief Inspector's site where they will be analysed for genetic
      factors, glycaemic markers and other markers related to drug response.

      POST-PILOT Phase (Jan 2015- Oct 2017): Subject to feasibility, interim analysis and
      continuation of funding from Medical Research Council (MRC), this project will continue for
      another three years.

    <description>The primary outcome will be to compare the clinical characteristics of the patients who show an excellent response or poor response to specific second- and third- line classes of treatment for Type 2 diabetes; and of those patients that show rapid progression of Type 2 diabetes or slow progression of Type 2 diabetes to markedly high blood glucose despite the treatment that they require.</description>

      At Visit 1 a fasting blood sample (approximately 35 mls) will be taken for DNA extraction,
      and to measure for markers of the progression of diabetes or response to diabetes medication
      and for secondary markers that may predict response. A urine sample is also collected to
      measure for biomarkers.

        Participants will be identified in primary care and secondary care. The method for patient
        identification may differ between sites and could involve:

        GP Searches; Secondary Care Clinician Referral; Research Database Searches.
