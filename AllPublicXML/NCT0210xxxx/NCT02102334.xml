  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In total hip arthroplasty (THA), radiographic preoperative planning and postoperative
      evaluation of acetabular component, femoral offset (FO) and leg length discrepancy (LLD)
      require good validity, interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility.

      Questions/purposes: (1) Evaluate the validity of the Sundsvall method of FO measurement by
      comparing it to a standard FO measurement method. (2) Evaluate the interobserver reliability
      and intraobserver reproducibility of measurement of FO, LLD, acetabular cup inclination and
      anteversion.

      90 patients with primary unilateral osteoarthritis (OA) were included in this prospective
      study. On postoperative radiographs FO by the Sundsvall method, FO by a standard method, LLD,
      acetabular cup inclination and anteversion were measured. The interobserver reliability and
      intraobserver reproducibility were made by three independent observers. The validity and
      degree of prediction of Sundsvall method are measured by comparing its results with the
      standard method.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Leg Length Discrepancy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>LLD on radiographs was defined as the difference in perpendicular distance in millimetres between a line passing through the lower edge of the teardrop points to the corresponding tip of the lesser trochanter. The interobserver reliability was assessed from the measurements made by three independent observers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Femoral offset (Sundsvall method)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of FO using the Sundsvall method was carried out on the AP view of the pelvis as the horizontal distance (parallel to Hilgenreiners line) between the femoral axis (a line drawn through the center of the femoral shaft) and the mid line of the pelvis, at the height of the lateral tip of the greater trochanter. The measurement was performed bilaterally to compare the femoral offset on the operated side to the non-operated hip. The interobserver reliability was assessed from the measurements made by three independent observers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Femoral offset (standard method)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of FO with the standard method was carried out on AP view as the addition of the distance between the longitudinal axis of the femur to center of femoral head and the distance from the center of the femoral head to a perpendicular line passing through the medial edge of the ipsilateral teardrop point of the pelvis. The measurement was repeated bilaterally to compare the FO of the operated side to non-operated hip. The interobserver reliability was assessed from the measurements made by three independent observers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cup inclination</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Cup inclination was measured on AP view as angle in degrees, between a line drawn along the angle of rim of the cup and trans-ischial line (a line drawn between the most inferior point of the ischial tuberosities). The interobserver reliability was assessed from the measurements made by three independent observers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acetabular cup anteversion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Acetabular cup anteversion was measured on lateral radiograph as the angle formed by the intersection of a line drawn across the face of acetabulum and a line perpendicular to the horizontal plane, according to the Woo and Morry method. The interobserver reliability was assessed from the measurements made by three independent observers.</description>
