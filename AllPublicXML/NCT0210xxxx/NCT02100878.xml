  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise has been shown to significantly reduce subsequent energy intake in obese
      adolescents but not in lean, without altering their appetite feelings. Although previous
      studies have pointed out the role of gastric peptides in this post exercise nutritional
      response, some recent work question the role of the neural system in the post exercise drive
      to eat. This study tends to explore whether or not an acute bout of exercise can affect the
      neural response to food cues in adolescents, obese or lean.

      After a medical inclusion, the adolescents will have to realise a DXA to assess their body
      composition and a submaximal exercise to evaluate their aerobic capacities.

      They will have then to enter the laboratory on 2 different occasions in a randomized order
      from 8am to 330pm: At 8am they will receive a calibrated breakfast. then, at 1045; they will
      have to complete one of the experimental condition: 1) a cycling exercise or 2) remaining
      sitting fpr one hour. after the one hour sitting station or the exercise bout, they will be
      asked to complete a computer task while and electroencephalogram will be recorded. This
      computer task consists in visual recognition of rare pictures compared to frequent ones
      (oddball method). at 1215 they will be offered ad libitum meals. At regular intervals through
      the day, their appetite feelings will be assessed using Visual analogue scales.

      Ad libitum energy consumption will be assessed by investigators and recorded for each
      participants.

        Lean and obese adolescents will be recruited accodring to the international curves for
        obesity. they will be between 12 to 15 years old and will have no medical limitations to
        complete exercise testings.
