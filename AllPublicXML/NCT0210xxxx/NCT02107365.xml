  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Success rates, after retreatment with Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin bitherapy, in patients
      infected with HCV (hepatitis C virus) genotype 4 and non-responders to a first standard
      treatment, are disappointing. The association of Asunaprevir and Daclatasvir in combination
      with the standard-of-care bitherapy has been shown to increase the efficacy of the treatment
      in non-responders genotype 1-infected patients.

      Given the absence of current solutions and urgent therapeutic needs for HCV genotype
      4-infected patients previously treated with pegylated Interferon/Ribavirin, this pilot study
      aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a quadritherapy associating Asunaprevir,
      Daclatasvir, pegylated Interferon alpha-2a and Ribavirin, in this very difficult to treat
      population.

      60 subjects will be enrolled.

      The primary endpoint will be the rate of sustained virological response (SVR), defined by an
      undetectable HCV RNA, at Week 36 (12 weeks after the end of a 24 weeks quadritherapy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population studied presents the maximum of factors of non-response to the retreatment of
      hepatitis C: non-response to well followed prior treatment with pegylated Interferon and
      Ribavirin, infection with HCV genotype 4, and the presence of cirrhosis (in less than 50% of
      the included patients) that could diminish the chances of SVR to a standard bitherapy.

      The likelihood of SVR with standard bitherapy in this study population is thus considered
      low, around 15%.

      The principal objective of this multicentric, national, single-arm, open-labeled,
      non-randomized phase II pilot study in 60 patients, is to assess the rate of SVR 12 weeks
      after 24 weeks of quadritherapy and to determine whether this rate is significantly greater
      than 20%.

      The proportion of patients presenting with cirrhosis (defined by a METAVIR F4 score on liver
      biopsy or with hepatic impulse elastometry ≥ 15 kPa) will be limited to 50% of all patients
      included.
