      1)Preliminarily evaluate the treatment effect of continuous vein injection of recombinant
      human endostatin on NF2; 2)Preliminarily evaluate the safety and the patient's tolerance of
      the treatment of endostatin; 3)Provide an objective basis for an enlarged randomized

    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome caused by
      mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. Individuals with NF2 have a higher likelihood to
      develop multiple nervous system tumors, including schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas.
      The hallmark of NF2 is bilateral vestibular schwannomas. Historically, most NF2 patients
      experience complete hearing loss either from tumor progression or after treatment of the
      tumors with surgery or radiation. Effective treatments are urgently needed for NF2 patients
      with progressive hearing loss because hearing loss is associated with impairment in social,
      emotional,and communication function and with increased depression.

      Previous studies of NF2 patients treated with bevacizumab suggested that inhibition of
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could result in hearing improvement and reduction
      in tumor size.Recombinant human endostatin can inhibit the formation of blood vessels by
      inhibiting the migration of vascular endothelial cells .In this way, endostatin can inhibit
      the nutrition of the tumor and decrease the tumor's growth and metastasis. In vitro tests,
      endostatin can inhibit the cell migration and Tube formation of the microvascular endothelial
      cell line HHEC. Besides, it can inhibit blood vessels' formation of the chicken embryo sac
      membrane. Based on these studies, we perform this clinical trial to known the treatment
      effect and tolerability of endostatin on NF2.
