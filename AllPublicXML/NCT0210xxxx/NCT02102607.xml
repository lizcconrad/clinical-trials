  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study was to determine the median effective dose (ED50) for motor
      block of intrathecally-administered ropivacaine in adults (20-80 years), and to assess the
      effect of age on ED50 required for motor block.

      This study was performed in adult patients undergoing transurethral, urological or lower limb
      surgery under combined spinal and epidural anesthesia. Patients were stratified according to
      age: 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and 71-80 years. The spinal component of the
      anesthetic was established by bolus administration of various up-and-down doses of 0.75%
      ropivacaine, determined by Dixon's method, with the first patient receiving 15 mg, and with
      testing intervals of 1.5 mg according to failure or success of the preceding patient's motor
      block. The degree of motor block after intrathecal administration of each dose was evaluated
      by the modified Bromage and Hip motor function score. The primary outcome was obtained by
      administration of the mean dosage that was determined from the midpoints of all independent
      pairs of patients involving a crossover from failure to success during 5 minutes after the
      spinal injection. The ED50 were estimated from the up-and-down sequences using the method of
      Dixon and Massey and logistic regression. Other endpoints were included on the basis of
      sensory block level, duration of motor blockade, hypotension, and vasopressor requirements.
