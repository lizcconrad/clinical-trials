    <measure>Rate of Serious Device and/or Procedure Related Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months (2 year)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoint is to demonstrate the 24-month serious device-related adverse event rate is no worse than the objective-performance criterion (OPC) of 1%.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Complete PDA Closure as a Measure of Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is to demonstrate the 12-month (1 year) complete closure rate for the device is no worse than the OPC of 85%. The closure of the ductus arteriosus will be assessed by absence of residual flow at 12 months (1 year) by transthoracic echocardiogram with 2-D color flow mapping and pulse wave Doppler (ECHO).</description>

    <description>The secondary safety endpoint is to demonstrate that the rate of device-related adverse events reported through 24-months post procedure is no worse than 6% (OPC rate of 3% plus an added 3% margin).</description>
