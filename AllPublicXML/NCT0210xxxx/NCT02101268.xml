    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the efficacy of momelotinib (MMB) versus best available therapy
      (BAT) in anemic or thrombocytopenic adults with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), or
      post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-PV/ET MF) who
      were treated with ruxolitinib as measured by splenic response rate at Week 24 (SRR24).

      Participants will be randomized to receive either MMB or BAT for 24 weeks during the
      randomized treatment phase, after which they will be eligible to receive MMB in an extended
      treatment phase for up to an additional 204 weeks. After discontinuation of study medication,
      assessments will continue for 12 additional weeks, after which participants will be contacted
      for survival follow-up approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of
      enrollment or until study termination. For those subjects planning to continue treatment with
      MMB following the end of the study, the End of Treatment, 30-day, 12-Week, and survival
      follow-up visits are not required.
