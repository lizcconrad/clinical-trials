          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the
             head and neck.

             local or regional recurrence in a previously irradiated site that is unresectable (or
             patient declines resection).

          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥10 mm with CT scan, as ≥20 mm by chest
             x-ray, or ≥10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. (Phase I only: patients without
             measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria but with evaluable disease by imaging or
             physical exam will be eligible as well.)

          -  Phase I only: any (or no) prior therapy for metastatic disease is allowed, including
             cetuximab. If a patient has not received prior standard therapy, s/he must have been
             offered and refused prior standard therapy.

          -  Phase II only:

               -  Arm 1: disease progression after at least one cycle of prior treatment with

                  cavity) or p16-negative unknown primary SCC presenting with a level 2 or 3 neck
                  node. p16 will be assessed by IHC; a specimen showing any staining will be
                  considered p16-positive.

               -  Arm 3: disease must be HPV-related SCCHN (defined as OPSCC or unknown primary
                  presenting with a neck mass that is either p16 positive or HPV ISH or PCR
                  positive).

          -  Patient must not have a history of or clinical evidence of central nervous system
             metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, except for individuals who have had
             previously-treated CNS metastases, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for
             steroids or anti-seizure medications (with the exception of Keppra) for 1 month prior
             to first dose of PD 0332991.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test within 28 days of study entry. Female patients must be surgically
             sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraceptive during the
             period of the trial and for at least 90 days after completion of treatment. The
             decision of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal
             investigator or a designated associate.

          -  Phase I and Arm 1 of Phase II: Known HIV-positivity and on combination antiretroviral
             therapy because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with PD 0332991. In
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

        Arms 2 and 3 of Phase II: patients with HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy are not
        excluded, as there are no pharmacokinetic tests being performed.
