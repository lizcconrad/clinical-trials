  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological disease characterized by motor and vocal tics. It has
      been hypothesized that abnormal interactions of dopamine with its receptors may cause the
      tics. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a drug (ecopipam) that
      selectively blocks dopamine D1/D5 receptors can reduce the frequency and severity of the
      tics.

      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study to determine whether
      ecopipam can reduce the symptoms of Tourette's in children age 7-17 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:• Subjects must have Tourette's Syndrome (TS) based on the
        clinician-administered Diagnostic Confidence Index (DCI) for TS.

          -  Subjects must exhibit both motor and vocal tics.

          -  Subjects must have a minimum score of 20 at both Screening and Baseline (just prior to
             the first treatment) on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale.
