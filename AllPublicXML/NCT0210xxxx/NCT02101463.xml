      This trial evaluates surgeon-modified fenestrated-branched stent-grafts (sm-FBSG) for
      Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) that are custom-made intra-operatively with no waiting
      period by a qualified vascular surgeon. In addition, it aims to examine the alternative
      sm-FBSG for patients with restricted access to centers performing clinical trials with
      commercially available devices and those patients with aortic emergencies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complex aortic aneurysms are those involving the renal and visceral arteries, and open repair
      of these aneurysms requires more extensive dissection, aortic clamping above the renal or
      mesenteric arteries, and possible reconstruction of aortic branches. Recovery time tends to
      be longer, including more hospital days, than for endovascular repair, and there is a greater
      potential for complications. Many high-risk patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta
      (AAA), including thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), and significant co-morbidities
      will be denied elective open surgery because of heightened risks associated with open repair
      of complex aneurysms, and therefore, the potential benefit of an endovascular option
      increases as well.

      Endovascular aneurysm repair has been shown to be an effective alternative in treating
      uncomplicated infrarenal and thoracic aneurysms in both the elective and urgent setting, yet
      there is limited experience with this technology in complex conditions. Fenestrated grafts
      have been developed as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with complex aortic
      aneurysms who are unfit for traditional open surgery.

      Surgeon-modified fenestrated-branch stent grafts (sm-FBSG) with branches for the visceral
      vessels are custom-made by a qualified vascular surgeon for patients with complex aortic
      conditions. It is expected that they will minimize surgical risks and promote quicker
      recovery, and they could represent a therapeutic option for high-risk patients unfit for open
      surgery.

All-cause death
Bowel ischemia
Myocardial infarction
Paraplegia
Renal failure
Respiratory failure
Stroke
Blood loss &gt;=1,000cc
The primary effectiveness endpoint is the proportion of treatment group subjects that achieve treatment success. Treatment success is a composite endpoint assessed at 12 months that includes successful delivery and deployment of the graft with branch vessel preservation (technical success) as well as freedom from Type 1 and 3 endoleaks, graft migration, and AAA enlargement or rupture.
Technical success is defined as successful delivery and deployment of the physician modified endovascular graft with preservation of those branch vessels intended to be preserved. Includes freedom from the following at 12 months: Type I &amp; III endoleak, stent graft migration, AAA enlargement, AAA rupture and conversion to open repair through 12 months.</description>
