  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most incapacitating symptoms because it is a complex experience that
      includes sensory and emotional perceptions, in which sensory, affective, cognitive,
      behavioral, cultural and social characteristics interact. Around 79% of advanced cancer cases
      present pain.

      There is evidence that non-pharmacological therapeutic activities are useful for controlling
      oncological pain and other symptoms resulting from such diseases.

      This study evaluated the results relating to pain modulation and improvement of emotional
      symptoms and quality of life, from an occupational therapy program applied to oncological
      patients who were receiving palliative care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Occupational therapy provides a variety of practical and psychosocial interventions to enable
      individuals to adapt to the difficulties that result from advanced disease. In this form of
      therapy, the use of certain manual play activities are highlighted as a working tool, with
      the aim of intervening in relation to the limitations and/or physical and psychological
      diseases. Such interventions may transform some of these patients' interests in life,
      facilitate the development of undiscovered talents and skills and allow them to discover
      their artistic, artisanal or physical potentials.

      The role and interventions of occupational therapy within palliative care are wide-ranging
      and challenging, with a vocation to help individuals to value the remainder of their lives
      and live for the present moment in the best way possible, through providing options for them
      to keep themselves in a physical and emotional condition that allows them to carry out
      activities that would be gratifying and stimulating. The effects from this will assist them
      in preparing for the end of life with more dignity and respect.

      The relevance of occupational therapy interventions in relation to oncology and, in
      particular, palliative care has been little studied. However, it is known that this may
      contribute towards improving the quality of life in interpersonal relationships and
      diminishing pain and distress, through providing guidance regarding activities of daily
      living and through the use of therapeutic activities, especially in relation to
      hospitalization processes.

    <description>All patients received pharmacological treatment for pain in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO)'s analgesic ladder and occupational therapy follow-up, with guidance regarding activities of daily living (ADLs).
They also carried out therapeutic activities such as embroidery onto gauze (tapestry), weaving a scarf on a nail frame and playing dominos.</description>

    <intervention_name>Tapestry</intervention_name>
    <description>A gauze screen, wool thread appropriate for tapestry and a large needle were used.
The entire screen was filled with a striped pattern made of embroidered half-stitches in the individuals' preferred colors. To fill the screen with half-stitches, the needle was always worked in diagonal movements, point to point. The stitches were started keeping a distance of three points from the four edges.</description>

    <description>All the patients were followed up daily for 10 days by a single occupational therapist for around 30 minutes, during which they received guidance regarding how best to perform their ADLs, i.e. how to position themselves when sitting down and standing up, dressing and undressing, feeding themselves, performing personal hygiene and undertaking leisure activities, with the aim of protecting their joints, reducing the pain and expending less energy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Weaving a scarf on a nail frame</intervention_name>
    <description>Weaving a scarf on a nail frame: this activity used a rectangular wooden frame (30 cm x 10 cm), with an empty space in the middle and nails distributed at 1 cm intervals along all sides, together with a crochet needle and wool thread.
Procedure: The thread was measured out on the frame and all the fringes were cut to the same length. After this, each thread was knotted, leaving a loop that was placed over each nail. A wool thread was tied to the nail at the corner and a zigzag pattern was woven between alternate nails. On the return, the zigzag weave went via the nails that had initially been missed out. Using the crochet needle, the loop of the fringe was pulled across on top of the zigzag. The scarf went on coming out from under the frame. The zigzag sequence and the needle movement were repeated until the scarf reached the desired length.</description>

    <intervention_name>Domino game</intervention_name>
    <description>Each player received seven dominos and kept them concealed from the adversaries' eyes. The player with the double-six (domino with the number six at both ends) started the game. If this domino had not been dealt out to any player, the one with the highest double domino started. Following on from this first player, in clockwise direction, each subsequent player placed one domino at one of the ends of the chain that was formed as the dominos were played. If a player did not have a domino that could be played, he would go to the pile and keep on picking up dominos until getting one that would fit. If no such domino existed, the player would then pass his turn on to the next player. The first player to get rid of all his dominos was the winner. If the game became &quot;blocked&quot;, i.e. there was no longer any possibility of adding dominos to the chain, the points in each player's hand were counted and the winner was the one with the lowest number of points in his hand.</description>
