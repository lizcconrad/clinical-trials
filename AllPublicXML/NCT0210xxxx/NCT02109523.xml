  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is often performed in elderly patients, but
      non-adherence to post-CABG guideline medications is a common and serious clinical concern in
      this age group. A recent systematic review found that higher medication adherence
      significantly improved primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease outcomes
      in all the included studies. Another systematic review assessed studies published from
      1999-2009 about motivational interviews, such as implementation intention, in relation to
      cardiovascular health. They found that motivational interview was an effective means of
      changing behavior, while offering promise in improving cardiovascular health status. The
      study is aimed to investigate effectiveness of long term volitional intervention in proving
      medication adherence in the CABG patient.
