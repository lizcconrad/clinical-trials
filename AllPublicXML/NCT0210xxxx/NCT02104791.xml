      Study population

        -  This study will be conducted at the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology recruiting
           pregnant women selected from the attendees of antenatal clinic, emergency department and
           from inpatient wards of Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital from Mars2014.

        -  Group 1: Healthy preterm Group: will include 50 pregnant females all at 24-34 weeks of
           gestational age .

        -  Group 2: Preterm premature rupture of membrane Group: will include 50 pregnant females

        Patients are with singleton pregnancies. Rupture of membranes will be diagnosed by history,
        sterile speculum examination to confirm fluid leakage from the cervical canal and
        ultrasound to confirm oligohydraminos.

        Subclinical infection will be detected with laboratory indices (WBC count of ≥15, 000
        c/mm3, CRP of ≥1 mg/dL) without any clinical symptoms and signs of infection as urinary
        tract infection in group 1 patients.

        Women with multiple pregnancies. Clinical signs of infection as (fever,abdominal
        tendernes). Cervical dilatations of 2 cm or more. Maternal disease like diabetes or fetal
        complications like intra-uterine fetal death.
