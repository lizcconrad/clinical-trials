    <textblock>
      The purpose of the GRECO study were to: a) to provide national data on overweight and obesity
      prevalence in a representative sample of primary schoolchildren aged 10-12 years old, b) to
      identify those socio-economic, demographic factors, as well as dietary and physical activity
      habits and familial characteristics that are associated with childhood and preadolescent
      overweight and obesity, c) to identify lifestyle and dietary patterns that are associated
      with elevated blood pressure levels and dietary sodium intake.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overweight and obesity prevalence in a representative sample of primary schoolchildren aged 10-12 years old</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of overweight and obesity by measuring body weight and standing height. Body mass index was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by standing height squared (m2). Obesity and overweight among children were calculated using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) age and gender specific body mass index cut-off criteria</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary assessment was based on a validated self-reported, semi-quantitative picture-aid food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), consisted of 48 food items commonly used in the local Greek cuisine.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of eating behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the frequency of breakfast consumption and number of eating occasions (number of meals and snacks during the day), as well as the frequency of having meals in front of a screen (watching television/DVD/videos and/or using of games consoles/computer), and the frequency of having meals together with the whole family or at least with one family member.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of physical activity and inactivity levels</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity levels assessment was performed by the Physical Activity Questionnaire for older Children. Children were also asked whether they had television or computer in their room and were asked to report the average weekdays and weekend time (h/d) spent on sedentary activities and more specifically on watching television/DVD/movies and/or recreational usage of games consoles/computer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure was measured in a single occasion within the schools' settings using validated oscillometric devices</description>
