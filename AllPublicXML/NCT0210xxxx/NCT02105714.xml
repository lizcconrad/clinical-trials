    <textblock>
      NIDIAG is an international collaboration on integrated diagnosis-treatment platforms, funded
      by the European Commission (EC). NIDIAG aims to develop an improved, patient-centred system
      for delivering primary health care in resource-constrained settings. NIDIAG will investigate
      three clinical syndromes, namely (i) persistent digestive disorders, (ii) persistent fever
      and (iii) neurological disorders, due to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The current
      study focuses on persistent digestive disorders, which are defined as diarrhoea or abdominal
      pain that last for at least 2 weeks.

      While acute diarrhoea has been studied globally, few research activities have focused on the
      epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of long-lasting diarrhoeal episodes (2 weeks and
      longer) in the tropics. The spectrum of possibly involved pathogens includes more than 30
      bacterial, parasitic and viral infectious agents. This lack of data may be explained by the
      fact that people suffering from NTDs might only seek care at a late stage of the disease.
      Furthermore, health systems in affected regions are often weak and their primary health-care
      centres are often under-staffed and lack essential diagnostic equipment.

      The hypothesis of this study is that development of an evidence-based syndromic approach can
      lead to better diagnosis and management of NTDs in patients with persistent digestive
      disorders. The study will be carried out in two West African countries (Côte d'Ivoire and
      Mali) and in two Asian countries (Indonesia and Nepal). The study will follow a
      &quot;case-control&quot; design and patients and controls will be prospectively enrolled. In order to
      address the knowledge gaps, three specific objectives will be pursued. First, the
      contribution of NTDs to the 'persistent digestive disorders syndrome' will be assessed.
      Second, the value of clinical features and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the diagnosis of
      target NTDs that give rise to persistent digestive disorders will be determined. Third, the
      clinical response to standard empiric and targeted treatment of several NTDs in patients with
      persistent digestive disorders will be evaluated. These objectives will provide a long-term
      benefit for the communities by improving the clinical decision-making process for the target
      NTDs and thus, better diagnostic work-up and patient management can be achieved in the study
      countries and other similar resource-constrained countries
