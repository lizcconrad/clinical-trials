  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if high dose supplementation with the omega-3 fatty
      acids EPA and DHA, when added to a weight loss program, is well tolerated in the study
      population and if there is an increase in the favorable change in blood and tissue breast
      cancer risk factors when compared to weight loss alone.

    <description>Participants will be instructed to follow a diet that is reduced by 500-700 kcal/day below maintenance requirements for 24 weeks or until the individual has reached a BMI of 25kg/m2 (generally 1000-2000 calories/day). Participants will be given one capsule of Omega-3 FA (fatty acids) a day beginning 2 weeks after starting their diet and exercise routine. Omega-3 FA will be increased by 1 capsule/day or every other day until participant is taking 5 capsules per day.Each Amber 4020 Ethyl Ester (EE) 1000 mg omega-3 capsule contains 420 mg of EPA and 210 mg of DHA both as the ethyl esters (380 mg EPA and 190 mg DHA)</description>
