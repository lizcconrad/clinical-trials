      Aim: To evaluate the feasibility and safety of a restrictive versus liberal red blood cell
      (RBC) transfusion policy in adult patients admitted with Acute Upper Gastrointestinal
      Bleeding (AUGIB) in order to inform the design of a definitive phase III randomised
      controlled trial.

      Trial overview: TRIGGER is a pragmatic trial aiming to recruit adult patients admitted with
      all cause AUGIB (non-variceal and variceal). The study will take place in six United Kingdon
      hospitals and they will be randomly allocated to a transfusion policy at the cluster level;
      three sites will be allocated to a restrictive transfusion policy and three to a liberal
      transfusion policy. Given the challenges that will be involved in early recruitment and
      cross-speciality care, a feasibility study is essential to determine whether a sufficient
      proportion of eligible patients can be recruited into the trial and that clinicians can
      adhere to the allocated transfusion policy. Recruitment will operate for 6 months in total.
      The investigators will compare recruitment rate, protocol adherence, clinical characteristics
      of patients recruited, exposure to RBC transfusions and the difference in Hb concentrations
      between the restrictive and liberal transfusion policies. The investigators will collect
      important clinical outcomes which the investigators anticipate being central to the phase III
      trial, including 28-day mortality, further bleeding rates and serious adverse events between
      the restrictive and liberal transfusion policies. The investigators will also collect data to
      enable us to plan a health economic evaluation and quality of life assessment for the phase
      III trial.

    <measure>Further Bleeding</measure>

    <description>Further bleeding up to Day 28: Further bleeding is a composite outcome that includes persistent bleeding (defined as any bleeding present at the end of the index endoscopy, regardless of whether endoscopic therapy was attempted or not), and recurrent bleeding. Recurrent bleeding is only assessed in patients without persistent bleeding, and must be confirmed by the presence of high-risk stigmata of bleeding either endoscopically, radiologically, or surgically. Recurrent bleeding should initially be suspected in the event of any combination of the following: fresh haematemesis, continuous melaena, or aspiration of fresh blood from a naso-gastric tube, with a pulse rate of &gt;100 bpm, a fall in systolic blood pressure of &gt;30mm Hg or a drop in Hb of &gt;2g/dL in the preceding 24 hours. Persistent bleeding and recurrent bleeding will also be assessed separately.</description>
