      The AGES-CM consortium aims to study the interaction between the polymorphisms of the
      candidate genes related with neurodevelopment, neurotransmission, brain progressive changes,
      cognitive functioning and stressful life events (prospective- and retrospectively assessed)
      and the association of the interactions with structural and functional brain measures,
      neuropsychological performance, biochemical and oxidative status in both in patients and
      controls. The investigators study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a parallel,
      structured, and specific psychoeducational group intervention (PE) for adolescent patients
      and their families by comparing it with treatment as usual).

      Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a structured psychoeducational group intervention
      for adolescents with early onset psychosis and their families. The intervention was
      implemented in parallel in 2 separate groups, by focusing specifically on problem solving
      strategies and structured psychosis-related information to manage daily life hassles
      associated with the disease in order to manage crises and prevent relapses.

      Method: The investigators performed a 9-month, randomized, rater-blind clinical trial
      involving adolescent patients with early onset psychosis and 1 or both of their parents. The
      primary outcomes were number of hospitalizations, days of hospitalization, and visits to the
      emergency department. The secondary outcome measures were clinical variables and family
      environment and well being.
