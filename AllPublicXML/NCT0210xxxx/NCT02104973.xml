      context in which obesity is generated is evaluated. The evaluation will be performed by
      collection of qualitative and quantitative information, 2) design a strategy from the
      information obtained. The intervention will include working sessions with teachers, parents
      and children, establishment of schools in window counseling in nutrition and physical
      activity and the secretion of a website to not communicate with the public and Provide
      information, 3) evaluation of the strategy in a community trial with two groups of schools,
      one intervention and one control.
