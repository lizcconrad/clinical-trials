    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is threefold. First, the ability of experienced colonoscopists to
      recognize the type of loop formed will be assessed and whether the use of the MEI improves
      this accuracy. Second, to determine which maneuvers are used for loop reduction and whether
      certain loops have set ways to reduce them. The third component will assess whether the
      colonoscopist thought that the imager helped or not.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of loop recognition by experienced colonoscopists compared to the magnetic imager.</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 mths</time_frame>
    <description>When an endoscopist encounters looping they will verbalize what type of loop they think they have and this will be recorded by the endoscopy nurse on a pre-printed data collection sheet. The magnetic imager will then be turned on and a photo of the imager loop will be saved. A physician not involved with the colonoscopy will compare the image to the endoscopist's answer to determine whether they were correct or incorrect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative description of maneuvers used for loop reduction.</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 mths</time_frame>
    <description>When an endoscopist encounters looping they will verbalize what type of loop they think they have and what maneuvers (example, reducing with clockwise torque) they used to reduce the loop. The magnetic imager will be turned on and the endoscopist will comment on whether the imager was helpful in reducing the loop. This information will be collected on a pre-printed data collection sheet.</description>
