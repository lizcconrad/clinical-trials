    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate patients who had In-vitro fertilization treatment and who
      had COH (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) cycles applying long protocol with GnRH
      (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogue with suboptimal response to the rFSH. The
      investigators evaluated and compared the addition of rLH, increasing the dose of rFSH and the
      control groups regarding the results of IVF in these patients.

      1. Aim

           -We aimed to evaluate patients who had In-vitro fertilization treatment and who had COH
           (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) cycles applying long protocol with GnRH
           (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogue with suboptimal response to the rFSH. We
           evaluated and compared the addition of rLH, increasing the dose of rFSH and the control
           groups regarding the results of IVF in these patients.

        2. Material and Methods -Between 01.01.2009-30.04.2011, 137 patients presented with
           infertility to the unit of Assisted Reproduction Techniques- of the Department of
           Obstetrics and Gynecology- Meram Medical Faculty- Selcuk University and were planned for
           ICSI-ET (intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer) with normal ovarian function,
           who had long protocol of GnRH analogue and COH (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation)
           with rFSH were included in the study. 52 patients were considered responsive to
           stimulation and composed the normal control group (Group 1). On the 7th day of
           stimulation transvaginal ultrasonography was carried out. Patients who had at least 6
           follicles about 6-10mm but had no follicle above 10mm and E2 (Oestradiol) level of &lt;250
           pg / ml were considered to have suboptimal response to stimulation and were divided into
           two groups. For Group 2 (n = 50), 75IU / L rLH was added to the treatment, for Group 3
           (n = 35), 75IU / L of rFSH was added to the treatment. IVF results were compared between
           the groups.
