      The hypothesis of this study is that a Ketamine / Propofol mixture will produce more stable
      hemodynamics as compared to Etomidate during emergent intubations in the intensive care unit.
      Patients that require a breathing tube to be placed in the ICU will be randomized to receIve
      either a Ketamine / Propofol mixture or Etomidate for sedation in order to place the
      breathing tube.

    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is a procedure that may cause significant hemodynamic perturbations
      and can severely impact the outcome of the critically ill. To ensure a safe outcome during
      this particular procedure, there are many factors that the clinician is faced with. One
      decision that confronts the critical care physician involves the correct combination of
      medications with which to facilitate such a safe outcome. Given the reported hemodynamic
      stability, etomidate is a medication that is chosen by many providers in this particular
      situation. However, its association with a possible increase in mortality makes it less than
      ideal for a number of critical care physicians. In recent years, an admixture of propofol and
      ketamine has been studied that demonstrates hemodynamic stability based on the balancing of
      the hemodynamic effects of these two individual agents alone. This novel medication
      combination, sometimes referred to as &quot;ketofol&quot;, may offer a valuable alternative to the
      critical care physician. Therefore, a randomized parallel-group clinical trial of adult
      critically ill patients admitted to a medical (MB-6B/G) and/or surgical intensive care unit
      (MB-7D/E) at Mayo Clinic Rochester who meet the criteria designated below for which urgent
      and/or emergent intubation is needed will receive one of two interventions based on
      stratified randomization. The &quot;active&quot; intervention arm will receive ketamine/propofol
      (ketofol) to facilitate endotracheal intubation. The comparison arm will receive etomidate.
      The primary outcome will focus on hemodynamic data recorded during the first 15 minutes
      post-administration with secondary outcomes addressing intensive care unit length of stay,
      mortality, adrenal function, and vasoactive medication use, among others.

    <description>Primary Specific Aim: To determine if the decrease in mean arterial pressure for the ketamine/propofol group at a 1:1 dose ratio is lower as compared to the etomidate group within the first 15 minutes post-administration in patients in need of urgent and/or emergent endotracheal intubation, as defined by any intubation within the intensive care unit excluding intubations for elective procedural events and codes.
Hypothesis: The decrease in mean arterial pressure for the ketamine/propofol arm will be reduced as compared to the etomidate arm during the first 15 minutes post-administration within the population of critically ill patients needing urgent and/or emergent endotracheal intubation.</description>

Hypothesis 2: The use of vasoactive medications to restore the blood pressure post-administration will be reduced in the ketamine/propofol combination as compared to the etomidate group.</description>

    <description>Secondary Specific Aim 3: To determine if this admixture is associated with a decreased incidence of adrenal insufficiency, defined as a pre-cosyntropin cortisol of less than 10ug/dL or if the post-cosyntropin cortisol increased by less than 9ug/dL after 250uq of cosyntropin, as compared to etomidate in the critically ill.
Hypothesis 3: The use of ketamine/propofol admixture will be associated with a reduced incidence of adrenal insufficiency as compared to etomidate.</description>
