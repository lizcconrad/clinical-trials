    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Australian study was to assess the efficacy and safety of nilotinib 300mg
      twice daily in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase who were intolerant but
      responsive to 1st line treatment with imatinib or dasatinib. Eligible patients have been
      previously treated with imatinib or dasatinib for at least 3 months and are experiencing
      non-hematologic toxicity whilst having documented responses that meet PBS authority for 1st
      line treatment of CML without current MR4.5.

      The study was planned to enroll 130 patients to achieve the sample size requirement for a
      meaning full conclusion. Study got terminated with 20 patients because of slow recruitment.
      Therefore, due to small sample size, the results cannot be considered clinical significant.

    <measure>Deep Molecular Response (MR4.5) Rate: Percentage of Patients Who Have Achieved a 4.5-log Reduction in BCR-ABL Level Within 24 Month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 96 weeks (24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Deep Molecular Response (MR4.5) rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved a 4.5 -log reduction in Breakpoint cluster region - Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) levels. BCR-ABL levels are measured in patients by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) testing of peripheral blood by the 24 months following the commencement of nilotinib therapy.
MR4.5 corresponds to a BCR-ABL ratio 0.0032% international scale (IS) using RQ-PCR. If a post-baseline value for BCR-ABL is &lt; 0.1 X the baseline value, the patient were classified as achieving a 1 log reduction in BCR-ABL.</description>

    <measure>Mean M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, 24, 48, 96</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) self-administered questionnaire for adult CML patients. The questionnaire consisted of 13 core questions in part I measuring the severity of symptoms, 6 questions in part 2 assessing the interference of symptoms on daily living. The CML component of the MDASI provided an additional 7 CML-specific symptom items: diarrhea, swelling, rash/skin change, muscle soreness/cramping, bruising/bleeding easily, malaise, and headache. In part I (13 questions) and the CML component (7 questions) each question was scored from 0 to 10 where 0 indicates a symptom is not present and 10 indicate the symptom is &quot;as bad as you can imagine&quot;. For part 1 the total score can therefore range from 0 to 130 and for CML 0 to 70. Part 2 is also recorded on a 0 to 10 scale, but 0 now indicates that the symptom &quot;did not interfere&quot; and 10 &quot;interfered completely&quot;. The total score can range from 0 to 60.</description>

        <title>Deep Molecular Response (MR4.5) Rate: Percentage of Patients Who Have Achieved a 4.5-log Reduction in BCR-ABL Level Within 24 Month</title>
        <description>Deep Molecular Response (MR4.5) rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved a 4.5 -log reduction in Breakpoint cluster region - Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) levels. BCR-ABL levels are measured in patients by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) testing of peripheral blood by the 24 months following the commencement of nilotinib therapy.
MR4.5 corresponds to a BCR-ABL ratio 0.0032% international scale (IS) using RQ-PCR. If a post-baseline value for BCR-ABL is &lt; 0.1 X the baseline value, the patient were classified as achieving a 1 log reduction in BCR-ABL.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients With MR4.5 Response by Baseline BCR-ABL Response Level Within 24 Months</title>
        <description>Deep Molecular Response (MR4.5) rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved a 4.5 -log reduction in Breakpoint cluster region - Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) levels. BCR-ABL levels are measured in patients by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) testing of peripheral blood by the 24 months following the commencement of nilotinib therapy.
MR4.5 corresponds to a BCR-ABL ratio 0.0032% international scale (IS) using RQ-PCR. If a post-baseline value for BCR-ABL is &lt; 0.1 X the baseline value, the patient were classified as achieving a 1 log reduction in BCR-ABL.</description>

            <description>Nilotinib was administered orally at 300 mg BD at approximately 12 hour intervals which had to be taken without food. The capsules were to be swallowed whole with water and no food should have been consumed for at least 2 hours before and at least 1 hour after the dose was taken. Prior to the first dose of nilotinib, patients were required to have an imatinib or dasatinib washout period of at least 3 days. Therapy with nilotinib was to be continued for up to 24 months while on study.</description>

        <title>Mean M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML)</title>
        <description>Quality of life was assessed using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) self-administered questionnaire for adult CML patients. The questionnaire consisted of 13 core questions in part I measuring the severity of symptoms, 6 questions in part 2 assessing the interference of symptoms on daily living. The CML component of the MDASI provided an additional 7 CML-specific symptom items: diarrhea, swelling, rash/skin change, muscle soreness/cramping, bruising/bleeding easily, malaise, and headache. In part I (13 questions) and the CML component (7 questions) each question was scored from 0 to 10 where 0 indicates a symptom is not present and 10 indicate the symptom is &quot;as bad as you can imagine&quot;. For part 1 the total score can therefore range from 0 to 130 and for CML 0 to 70. Part 2 is also recorded on a 0 to 10 scale, but 0 now indicates that the symptom “did not interfere” and 10 “interfered completely”. The total score can range from 0 to 60.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, week 12, 24, 48, 96</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) consists of all patients enrolled into the study. 'n' in the categories represents the number of patients with evaluable data for MDASI part 1/MDASI part 2/CML component at different time points. Week 96 includes end of study results for patients that did not complete the study.</population>

            <title>Nilotinib</title>
            <description>Nilotinib was administered orally at 300 mg BD at approximately 12 hour intervals which had to be taken without food. The capsules were to be swallowed whole with water and no food should have been consumed for at least 2 hours before and at least 1 hour after the dose was taken. Prior to the first dose of nilotinib, patients were required to have an imatinib or dasatinib washout period of at least 3 days. Therapy with nilotinib was to be continued for up to 24 months while on study.</description>
