      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a software for smartphones and tablets
      on type 1 diabetes control and quality of life
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis underlying this project, is that most calculations necessary for flexible
      intensive insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes in children can be performed using software
      installed on a smartphone or tablet that nowadays is carried by most parents and children.
      Smartphones and tablets can easily communicate with each other and with a desktop computer
      via the Internet, thereby permitting the exchange of information such as blood glucose values
      or types of meals among family members and physicians. Finally, software collecting blood
      glucose values and merging values obtained on different devices easily permits reviewing
      these values by the patient and sending them to the physician's office, thereby avoiding
      consultations during which no blood glucose values are brought by the patient.

      We hypothesize that the Webdia software, that will be tested in this randomized crossover
      study, will increase treatment compliance and therefore will improve diabetes
      self-management. We believe, the software will facilitate the adaptation of insulin schemes
      by physicians and therefore will lead to improved HbA1C values. We also think that this
      software will improve the patient's quality of life.
