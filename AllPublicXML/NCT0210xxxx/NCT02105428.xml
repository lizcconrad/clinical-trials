  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A goal of this study is to use a novel methodology to determine whether insulin resistance in
      women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is related to the accumulation of proteins with
      modifications. This could lead to future research to determine if these modifications
      interfere with their proper function. Additionally, the investigators will determine how
      protein quality is affected by exercise training. Aerobic exercise enhances the endogenous
      oxidant buffering systems which may minimize oxidative damage to proteins. The investigators
      propose that aerobic exercise minimizes the accrual of modified proteins by increasing the
      synthesis of new proteins, but also by increasing the degradation and removal of old and
      damaged proteins. Based on our previous studies the investigators observed that insulin
      affects plasma protein synthesis and aerobic exercise improves insulin sensitivity not only
      in muscle but also in liver. The investigators therefore propose that aerobic exercise and
      related increase in insulin sensitivity (and decline in insulin levels) will reduce
      accumulation of old and modified skeletal muscle and plasma proteins leading to improved
      function.

    <measure>Protein modifications and accumulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Alterations in protein modifications and accumulation will be measured by a novel methodology developed within our laboratory. Infusion of stable amino acid isotopes will be used to measure the accumulation of proteins before and after 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training or sedentary behavior. Plasma and muscle will be resolved using a two dimensional gel electrophoresis which will allow the identification of protein modifications and age.</description>
