  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the promising results with hypofractionated in low and intermediate risk prostate
      cancer, our proposal is to translate this experience to patients with high risk prostate
      cancer. Patients with high risk disease would receive hypofractionated RT to the prostate and
      to the external and internal iliac lymph nodes using IMRT plus long-term hormonal therapy.
      The objective of the study is to show that long term grade&gt;2 late toxicity is acceptable and
      similar to published data using hypofractionated technique in the prostate only.
