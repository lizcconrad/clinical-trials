    <description>Constipation was diagnosed by the Rome III criterion. The diagnosis consists in the presence, for at least three months, of two or more of the following symptoms: &quot;fewer than three evacuations per week&quot;, &quot;straining on evacuation&quot;, &quot;lumpy or hard stools&quot;, &quot;incomplete evacuation&quot;, &quot;anorectal obstruction&quot; and use of &quot;manual maneuvers&quot; to facilitate evacuation. Each symptom is scored as: 0=never or rarely, 1=sometimes, 2=often, 3=most of the time and 4=always. In the present study, the frequency of the symptoms was considered as a continuous variable and, a final score ranging from 0 to 24 was calculated. Lowest scores were indicative of fewer symptoms of constipation.</description>
