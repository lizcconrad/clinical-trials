  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the clinical outcome in patients with Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is largely
      dependent on early initiation of effective treatment with antifungal drugs, diagnosing IA is
      still a critical problem. Symptoms are non-specific and available diagnostic tools are either
      invasive or have low sensitivity and specificity. This often results in a diagnostic delay,
      with patients developing more extensive disease. Furthermore, as long as IA is present,
      oncological follow-up treatment is not feasible. Inaccuracy in diagnosing IA can cause
      serious treatment delay and increased mortality. However, an empirical strategy with
      prophylactic anti-mould therapy is not feasible considering both possible side effects and
      costs. In order to safely continue the use of a pre-empirical strategy, improved
      (non-invasive) diagnostic tools are desirable.

      In a pilot study de Heer et al. showed that it is possible to discriminate between patients
      with IA and their neutropenic controls by exhaled breath analysis using an electronic nose
      (eNose). In this study the investigators aim to test whether an eNose could be useful as a
      diagnostic tool in a prospective setting.

      The gold standard in exhaled breath analysis is Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry
      (GC-MS). This technique enables identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath
      of patients. It is possible that there are Aspergillus specific VOCs in the breath of
      patients with IA.

      The composition of the lung microbiome seems to be an important factor in both health and
      disease. It is likely that the microbiome of the lung changes in prolonged neutropenia,
      therefore possibly creating a niche for molds and yeasts. Comparing the microbiome of
      patients with prolonged neutropenia who develop IA with those who do not, can learn us more
      about the pathogenesis of this disease. This knowledge could be used to investigate new
      treatment options for Invasive Aspergillosis.

      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that airway microbial (viral, bacterial) presence
      and exhaled molecular profiles as obtained from patients with prolonged neutropenia due to
      treatment of hematological malignancies, are different between patients who develop IA and
      patients who do not.

      Aims

        1. To compare the exhaled molecular profiles (GC-MS and eNose) between neutropenic patients
           who develop IA and neutropenic controls.

        2. To investigate whether exhaled molecular profiles can serve as surrogate to predict IA
           at an early stage.

        3. To compare the alterations in the viral/bacterial microbial profiles during the
           neutropenic episode between patients who develop IA and controls.

        4. To examine the relationship between microbial and molecular profiles in order to
           generate mechanistic hypotheses.

    <description>Exhaled molecular profiles (by eNose and GC-MS) and the accuracy with which serial analysis of these profiles can discriminate between patients with probable or proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and neutropenic controls in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the predictive algorithm.
Breath will be collected twice weekly during the neutropenic episode, resulting in an average of 5 exhaled breath measurements (eNose as well as GC-MS) per patient. Approximately 150 patients will be included for exhaled breath analysis.</description>
