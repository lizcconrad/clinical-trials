  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of angiomyolipomas is based on invasive techniques such as surgery or embolization.
      Development of anti-angiogenic therapies is a major and growing field of research in
      hypervascularized tumors. Angiomyolipomas have been shown to regress after prolonged
      treatment with mTOR inhibitors (Sirolimus), but with a large proportion of secondary effects.
      We showed recently that beta-blockers were able to induce regression of infantile hemagiomas.
      Consequently, we looked for and found, histologically, in a few cases of angiomyolipomas the
      presence of beta2 receptors.

      The aim of the study is to estimate if beta-blockers could induce regression or stabilization
      of renal angiomyolipomas in tuberous sclerosis in a pilot study.
