    <textblock>
      Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an impaired fertility and significant higher
      complication rates during infertility treatment, pregnancy and the perinatal period.
      Complications include the occurrence of multiple gestations, ovarian hyper stimulation
      syndrome, early pregnancy loss, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension,
      pre-eclampsia and need for caesarean section. Moreover, their infants are more frequently
      born preterm, have higher perinatal mortality rates and are more often admitted to a neonatal
      intensive care unit. The etiology of PCOS is not particularly mapped, but a genetic
      background can be assumed by analyzing PCOS families. In utero androgen excess has also been
      suspected to be an important risk factor. Animal studies have demonstrated that intrauterine
      hyperandrogenic environment affects the offspring by leading to biochemical and morphological
      features of PCOS. Sex differences in prenatal androgen levels have been observed and
      testosterone levels in umbilical cord blood and in amniotic fluid are higher in healthy male
      babies than in healthy female babies. There are just a few reporting on the relation between
      maternal androgen levels during pregnancy and the respective offspring. The aim of this
      clinical study is to determine maternal androgen metabolism and the impact of androgen
      disorders on mothers and infants.
