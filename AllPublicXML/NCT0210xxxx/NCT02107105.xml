      The goal of this study is to learn about quality of life in patients who have or have had
      rectal cancer.

      Participant may be eligible to take part in this study if they have not yet had surgery for
      rectal cancer or if they had surgery up to 2 years ago.

      If participant chooses to take part in this study, they will complete 7 questionnaires about
      their quality of life and utilities. Participant will complete the questionnaires before
      surgery for rectal cancer (if they have not yet had surgery), and at multiple time points
      after the completion of surgery. Participant will receive and return the questionnaires in
      the clinic, although if they are unable to come to the clinic for their regular follow-up,
      they may be able to receive and return their surveys by mail.

      In addition, participant's medical records will be reviewed to learn about what kind of
      treatments they may have had, and whether they have had any complications related to their
      treatment.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 330 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
