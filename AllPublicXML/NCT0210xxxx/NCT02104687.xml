  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to confirm the hypothesis that flow treatment algorithm based on
      cardiac index trending by transesophageal Dopplerometry would result in reduced complications
      and reduced length of hospital stay in major abdominal surgery patients, when compared to
      patients treated with press treatment algorithm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite standardisation of intraoperative care provided for risk surgery patients, the
      preoperative mortality remains higher than expected. The aim of the goal-directed
      heamodynamic therapy (GDT) is to improve the altered cardiovascular function and to reach the
      desired intraoperative values of oxygen supply (DO2) and cardiac index (CI). Standard
      haemodynamic measurements, such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central
      venous pressure (CVP) remain relatively unchanged despite reduced blood flow. However, GTD is
      able to detect early hypo perfusion abnormalities. The aim of goal-directed heamodynamic
      therapy, based on the titration of fluids and vasoactive drugs to physiological flow-related
      end points is to reduce perioperative complications, perioperative morbidity and mortality.
      We hypothesise, that following this treatment regimen results in reduced postoperative
      complications (primary endpoint) and reduced length of hospital stay (secondary endpoint).

    <description>The Flow therapeutic algorithm will be responsible for adjustment of intraoperative interventions - volumotherapy and administration of vasoactive drugs, with the aim to maintain the CI value &gt;2.5 l/m/m2 (FTc - flow time &lt;330 ms was chosen as variable defining preload; PV, peak velocity &lt;70 ms-1 will be used as a variable defining contractility; SVR, total systemic vascular resistance between 1000-1800 cdyn.s/cm5m2 will be used as variable defining after load). After the desired values of CI have been obtained, no further increase of therapeutic intervention (fluids, vasoactive drugs) will be performed.</description>

    <description>The Press therapeutic algorithm will be responsible for adjustment of intraoperative interventions based upon standard pressure parameters and will include volumotherapy and administration of vasoactive drugs, with the aim to maintain the desired values of MAP of 65-105 mmHg and CVP 8-12 mmHg. After the desired values of MAP and CVP have been obtained, no further increase of therapeutic intervention (fluids, vasoactive drugs) will be performed.</description>
