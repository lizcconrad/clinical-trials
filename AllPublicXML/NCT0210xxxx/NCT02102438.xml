  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is major concern regarding chemotherapy related toxicity in the group of women older
      than 65 years old diagnosed with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive
      breast cancer (BC). Nevertheless, these patients are at a particularly high risk of breast
      cancer recurrence and death. Of note, older patients may experience higher risk for
      Trastuzumabe related cardiotoxicity, especially when this agent is combined with an
      anthracycline.

      Recent studies have shown extremely favourable outcomes in early HER2+ BC patients treated
      with a combination of paclitaxel and trastuzumab, omitting anthracyclines from treatment.

      Investigators sought to investigate safety and outcome data on a cohort of elderly patients
      treated with weekly paclitaxel combined with carboplatin and trastuzumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common female cancer and the second most common cause of cancer
      death in women. BC incidence is markedly increased with aging.

      Amplification or overexpression of HER2 oncogene is present in approximately 18 to 20% of
      primary invasive BC. In the absence of HER2 target therapy combined with adjuvant or
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, HER2 overexpression or amplification is associated with high rates
      of disease recurrence and death.

    <description>Treatment schedule Weekly paclitaxel and Carboplatin at 80mg/m2 and Area under the curve (AUC) of 2, respectively. Weekly trastuzumab will be combined with chemotherapy (at a loading dose of 4mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 2mg/kg). Chemotherapy will be given at D1, D8 and D15 in a 28-day cycle, for a total of 4 treatment cycles.
After completion of four chemotherapy cycles, Trastuzumab will be given at a dose of 6mg/kg every 21 days, for a total 14 cycles.</description>
