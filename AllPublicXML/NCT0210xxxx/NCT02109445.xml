  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a Phase 1b portion aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and
      the safety profile of PF-03084014 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel followed
      by a Phase 2 portion to evaluate the efficacy of the triple combination in terms of overall
      survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma not previously treated
      with anticancer therapies.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Worsening QTc Results in Phase 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Cycle 1 Days 3 and 22, Cycles 2 and 3 Day 1, end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) were corrected for heart rate (QTc) using Fridericia (QTcF) and Bazett (QTcB) formulas. Any change from baseline in QTc was considered as worsening in ECG and was classified accordingly to the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade. Grading was as follows: prolonged QTc of 450 to 480 milliseconds (msec)=Grade 1, 481 to 500 msec=Grade 2, more than or equal to (&gt;=) 501 msec on at least 2 seperate ECGs=Grade 3, &gt;=501 or more than (&gt;) 60 msec change from baseline and Torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or signs of serious arrhythmia=Grade 4.</description>

    <description>Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST).
CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease.

PR was defined as more than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

    <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf are 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each question is answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 10; '0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine'. Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>

Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.</description>

          <description>PF-03084014 was administered twice daily (BID) orally via tablets at a starting dose of 100 milligrams (mg). Nab-paclitaxel (nab-P) and gemcitabine (GEM) were administered intravenously at a starting dose of 125 mg/square meter (m^2) and 1000 mg/m^2, respectively. Decisions to escalate, de-escalate or stay at the same dose were made based on the number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed. In any case, PF-03084014 dose was not to exceed 150 mg BID and nab-P and GEM were not to exceed 125 mg/m^2 and 1000 mg/m^2, respectively.</description>

Nab-paclitaxel (nab-P) and gemcitabine (GEM) were administered intravenously at a starting dose of 125 mg/square meter (m^2) and 1000 mg/m^2, respectively. Decisions to escalate, de-escalate or stay at the same dose were made based on the number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed. In any case, PF-03084014 dose was not to exceed 150 mg BID and nab-P and GEM were not to exceed 125 mg/m^2 and 1000 mg/m^2, respectively.</description>

          <description>Counts of participants who had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as newly occurring or worsening after first dose. Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category. Severity was graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, Grade 4=life-threatening.</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated.

        <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf are 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each question is answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 10; ‘0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine’. Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>

        <title>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) - Phase 2</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30: included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.</description>

Nab-paclitaxel (nab-P) and gemcitabine (GEM) were administered intravenously at a starting dose of 125 mg/square meter (m^2) and 1000 mg/m^2, respectively. Decisions to escalate, de-escalate or stay at the same dose were made based on the number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed. In any case, PF-03084014 dose was not to exceed 150 mg BID and nab-P and GEM were not to exceed 125 mg/m^2 and 1000 mg/m^2, respectively.</description>
