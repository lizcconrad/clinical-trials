    <textblock>
      Patients with back pain with spinal stenosis of the lower back will be asked to volunteer for
      this research study. These patients don't need immediate surgery for this problem. Treatment
      of this kind of back pain with spinal stenosis usually includes physical therapy exercises
      and steroid injections. Both treatments are usually helpful in patients with back pain with
      spinal stenosis. However, physicians and other healthcare providers don't know which
      treatment is better to give first. The purpose of this research is to answer that question.
      Patients enrolled in this study will receive both treatments: physical therapy (PT) and a
      steroid injection (&quot;shot&quot;). However, patients may get the shot first followed by PT, or they
      may have PT first, followed by the shot. Their time in this study will last up to 6 months,
      and there will be five outcome measurements (via visits or telephone). All study visits will
      take place at the Atlanta VA Medical Center (Atlanta VA). Investigators hope to enroll about
      120 subjects from the Atlanta VA. Enrolled patients will be randomized using a randomization
      computer program.

        Inclusion Criteria: chronic low back pain (at least 3 months in duration), a Visual
        Analogue Scale (VAS) greater than 30 (on a 100 point scale), between the ages of 18 to 80
        years, either without radiating leg pain (below the knees) or with low back and/or buttock
        pain greater than leg pain (in which case the VAS for leg pain must be 20 or less), ability
        to read English and complete the assessment instruments, and diagnosis of lumbar spinal
        stenosis by a board certified radiologist or a board certified physiatrist either by
        magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed-tomography (CT) that has previously been done
        as part of a normal course of patients medical treatment. All underlying etiology or
        diagnoses that are the source for lumbar spinal stenosis will be recorded (e.g.
        spondylolisthesis, herniated or degenerative discs, spondylosis).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of lumbar surgery, acute disc herniation as reported on a radiologic imaging
             report, acute or severe chronic illness that are unstable, cognitive impairment which
             prevents the patient from providing accurate data or giving informed consent,
             neurological conditions (e.g. stroke, Parkinson's, brain injury), lower extremity
             amputees, fibromyalgia or chronic generalized pain, unstable opioid use or any signs
             or evidence of alcohol dependence or illicit drug use (as determined by screening
             questionnaire), clinical suspicion of facet joint-originating back pain or a positive
             response to prior facet joint block, lumbar epidural steroid injections within the
             last 6 months, uncontrolled psychiatric disorders, serious concomitant medical illness
             (e.g. acute heart failure, acute renal failure) or severe pain that may impair
             patient's ability to participate in physical therapy exercises or pain that is deemed
             so severe such that withholding of an ESI until after completion of the PT exercises
             is seen as causing unreasonable suffering to the patient, and conditions that would
             prevent the patient from undergoing fluoroscopy (e.g. pregnancy).
