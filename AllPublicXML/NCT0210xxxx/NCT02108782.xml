    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dovitinib lactate works in treating patients with
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Dovitinib lactate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of dovitinib (dovitinib lactate) in patients with progressive
      well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (PNETs) in reference to 6-month
      progression free survival (PFS) historical-controlled patients and in two cohorts defined by
      prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-inhibitor therapy (Cohort 1 - no prior VEGF,
      Cohort 2 - prior VEGF).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of dovitinib in patients with progressive well-differentiated
      PNETs.

      II. To evaluate time to treatment failure, time to progression, and overall survival.

      III. To evaluate radiographic and biochemical response rates.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of dovitinib on plasma biomarkers by measuring
      concentrations of circulating growth factors and soluble receptors (e.g. basic fibroblast
      growth factor [bFGF], VEGF, placental growth factor [PLGF], soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sVEGFR1)
      and 2, collagen IV, fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF23]).

      II. Archival tissue collected from patients prior to registration will be banked to later
      analyze baseline expression of potential biomarkers (e.g., bFGF, FGFR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months,
      every 3 months for 6 months, and then periodically for 2 years.
