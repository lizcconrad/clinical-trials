  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, influenza A infection caused great mortality and morbidity, especially among the
      elderly and individuals with chronic illness. Many of these patients are 'late presenters'
      who are admitted to hospital a few days after symptoms onset and have developed complications
      secondary to immunodysregulation. Antiviral treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor is of
      limited usage for patients who presented to the hospital 48 hours after symptom onset. Apart
      from ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, treatment options for these
      patients are limited. Recent animal study has demonstrated that combinations of an antiviral
      agent with a COX-II inhibitor can reduce mortality in mice infected with influenza virus. The
      investigators therefore propose to enrol patients with severe influenza A infection requiring
      hospitalization and oxygen support on a randomized controlled trial with celecoxib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this double blind randomized controlled trial is to compare the clinical efficacy
      and safety of celecoxib combined with neuraminidase inhibitors in patients with severe
      influenza A infection. The hypothesis of this study is that treatment of severe influenza A
      infection with celecoxib will reduce mortality. The primary outcome to be assessed will be
      the 28-days mortality rate from hospitalization. The secondary outcomes to be assessed will
      be safety of the treatment, duration of intensive care, duration of ventilatory and oxygen
      support, the viral load and cytokine change.

        criteria are defined as hospitalization with fever or one of the symptoms suggestive of
        influenza infection including sore throat, rhinorrhea, cough or shortness of breath 2)
