  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label, parallel, randomized clinical trial that will evaluate the
      immunogenicity and safety of the trivalent influenza vaccine (inactivated and fragmented)
      produced by Instituto Butantan among adult kidney transplant recipients, when administered in
      three vaccination regimens: i) the recommended dose; ii) a single double dose; iii) two doses
      administered with a 21 day interval.

      The randomization ratio among the three groups of kidney transplant recipients will be 1:1,
      and 60 participants will be included in each group. After vaccination all participants will
      be followed for 26 weeks.

      In addition, 15 healthy adults will be included as a control group, and will receive the
      recommended dose.

      The study hypothesis is that a different vaccination regimen can improve the immune response
      of kidney transplant recipients after vaccination with the trivalent influenza vaccine
      (inactivated and fragmented).
