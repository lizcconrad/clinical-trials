  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes type two is a debilitating disease that leads to chronic morbidity such as
      accelerated microvascular disease. Accelerated microvascular disease may produce blindness,
      end stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and limb ischemia. Strategies to
      prevent or delay microvascular disease have the potential to improve the lives of millions
      and prevent catastrophic illness. The major focus of prevention of microvascular disease in
      diabetes has been on the endothelium and its role in protection of blood vessels. An
      unexpected means to prevent microvascular disease in diabetes may be coupled to the function
      of vitamin C in red blood cells (RBCs) of diabetic subjects. Based on new and emerging data,
      vitamin C concentrations in RBCs may be inversely related to glucose concentrations found in
      diabetes. Based on animal data, we hypothesize that RBCs with low vitamin C levels may have
      decreased deformability, leading to slower flow in capillaries and microvascular hypoxia, the
      hallmark of diabetic microangiopathy. Low vitamin C concentrations in RBCs of diabetic
      subjects may be able to be increased, by using vitamin C supplements. Findings in animals may
      not accurately reflect effects in humans because of species differences in mechanisms of
      vitamin C entry into RBCs. Therefore, clinical research is essential to characterize vitamin
      C physiology in RBCs of diabetic subjects. In this protocol we will investigate physiology of
      vitamin C in RBCs of diabetic subjects as a function of glycemia, with and without vitamin C
      supplementation. We will screen type II diabetic subjects on insulin and select those with
      low vitamin C levels and hemoglobin A1C concentrations of 8-12%. Selected subjects will be
      hospitalized twice, each time for approximately one week. As inpatients, subjects will have
      two venous sampling periods each of approximately 24 hours. For the first sampling period,
      controlled hyperglycemia will be induced by withdrawing insulin and providing a high
      carbohydrate load diet (70-75% carbohydrate). Hyperglycemia will not exceed 9 hours, and will
      be reversed by reinstituting insulin. The second sampling period, also for 24 hours, will be
      performed under conditions of euglycemic control.

      During the two sampling periods, samples will be withdrawn via venous catheter for RBC
      deformability and vitamin C concentrations. At discharge, subjects will be placed on a
      vitamin C supplement and seen as outpatients at weekly intervals. After 3 or 6 weeks
      (depending on RBC vitamin C levels), subjects will be hospitalized again, and sampling
      repeated as described. In this manner, each subject serves as his/her own control, and
      deformability of red blood cells can be determined in relation to glycemia and to vitamin C
      concentrations in RBCs and plasma.
