  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) 2011 report states that the market for
      cosmetic procedures has shown significant growth over the past two years, with 13.8 million
      cosmetic plastic surgery procedures performed in the United States in 2011, up 5% since 2010.
      While surgical cosmetic procedures significantly increased from 2010 to 2011, the overall
      growth in cosmetic procedures is primarily driven by a substantial rise in minimally-invasive
      procedures, that increased 6%, with nearly 12.2 million cosmetic minimally-invasive
      procedures having been performed in 2011. This highlights the growing consumer demand for
      non- or minimally-invasive cosmetic procedures that do not involve surgical procedures such
      as liposuction and the associated risks, potential complications and lengthy and painful
      recovery processes.

      Low level laser light therapy offers a simple, non-invasive, safe, effective and side-effect
      free alternative to achieving body circumference reduction.

      Justification for the assertion of anticipated safety and effectiveness of application of the
      Erchonia® EZ6 Laser low level laser therapy for the reduction of body circumference is found
      through three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearances for Erchonia® Low Level Laser
      devices for body circumference reduction indications, as follows:

      K123237 (532 nanometer (nm) green light diodes): Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser: is indicated
      for use as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for individuals
      intending to undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of hips,
      waist, and thighs.

      K121695 &amp; K082609 (635 nm red light diodes): Erchonia® ML Scanner (MLS) &amp; Erchonia® Zerona:
      is indicated for use as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for
      individuals intending to undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of
      hips, waist, and thighs.

      K121690 &amp; K120257 (635 nm red light diodes): Erchonia® MLS, Zerona: is indicated for use as a
      non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for individuals intending to
      undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of the upper arms.

      Therefore, Erchonia low level lasers have been determined safe and effective by the FDA for
      application for body circumference reduction indications for multiple body areas. The
      intended application/indication of the EZ6 in this study is comparable to the above
      FDA-cleared indications, with the study intent being to evaluate the comparative efficacy of
      a six week, once weekly 60 minute treatment administration protocol employing 6 red light
      diodes to the established efficacy of the current two week, thrice weekly 40 minute treatment
      administration protocol with application of five red light diodes on reduction of hips,
      waist, thighs and upper abdomen circumference.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Combined Circumference Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Combined circumference measurement is calculated as the sum of the measurements for the individual body areas of the right and left thighs, hips, waist and upper abdomen. Change in combined circumference measurements is calculated as the difference in measurements from baseline to after completion of the 6-week procedure administration period. A negative (-) change indicates a reduction in combined circumference measurement across the evaluation period and is positive for study success. A positive (+) change indicates an increase in combined circumference measurements across the evaluation period and is negative for study success.
A mean change for the study subject group of -3.0 inches or more in combined circumference measurements will be considered a clinically meaningful and statistically significant positive change indicative of study success.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight was measured in pounds at each evaluation point. The change in body weight measured in pounds at 6 weeks post-procedure administration relative to baseline was calculated. An increase in body weight indicated that weight was gained across the study evaluation period while a decrease in body weight indicated that weight was lost across the study evaluation period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index (BMI) was measured in kilograms per meter squared (kg/m2) at each evaluation point. The change in BMI measured at 6 weeks post-procedure administration relative to baseline was calculated. An increase in BMI indicated that BMI increased across the study evaluation period which is negative for study success, while a decrease in BMI indicated that BMI decreased across the study evaluation period which is positive for study success.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction With Study Outcome Rating</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the study procedure administration phase, the subject was asked to indicate how satisfied or dissatisfied they were with any change noticed in the appearance of the thighs, hips, waist and upper abdomen area after having received the procedures with the EZ6?&quot;, using the following five-point scale: Very Satisfied; Somewhat Satisfied; Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied; Not Very Satisfied; Not at All Satisfied</description>

        <title>Change in Combined Circumference Measurements</title>
        <description>Combined circumference measurement is calculated as the sum of the measurements for the individual body areas of the right and left thighs, hips, waist and upper abdomen. Change in combined circumference measurements is calculated as the difference in measurements from baseline to after completion of the 6-week procedure administration period. A negative (-) change indicates a reduction in combined circumference measurement across the evaluation period and is positive for study success. A positive (+) change indicates an increase in combined circumference measurements across the evaluation period and is negative for study success.
A mean change for the study subject group of -3.0 inches or more in combined circumference measurements will be considered a clinically meaningful and statistically significant positive change indicative of study success.</description>
