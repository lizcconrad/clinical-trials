      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the VPA (Valproate) dose can be reduced by
      additional administration of LTG (Lamotrigine) in Japanese pre-menopausal female epilepsy
      patients aged 15 years or older, whose seizures are well controlled by VPA monotherapy.

      RATIONALE In several studies that investigated the effects of in utero exposure to AEDs
      (antiepileptic drugs) on fetal malformations and intellectual development in children after
      birth, it has been reported that VPA causes neonatal malformations and decreases intelligence
      of children in a dose dependent manner, whereas such a risk is low in LTG (Hernandez-Díaz et
      al., 2012; Meador et al., 2013). It has also been reported that LTG as adjunctive therapy
      with VPA is effective in inhibiting seizures in patients with poorly controlled seizures, and
      adverse events under VPA monotherapy can be relieved by subsequently reducing VPA dose after
      LTG is combined (Sale et al., 2005; Jozwiak et al., 2000; Morris et al, 2004; Buchanan,
      1996). Thus, by considering the benefits of replacing VPA by LTG in childbearing women, we
      will examine whether VPA dose can be reduced by introducing LTG in Japanese female epilepsy
      patients under VPA monotherapy (aged ≥ 15 years, pre-menopausal).

      STUDY DESIGN Single arm, multicenter, and open-label study TIME FRAME

        -  Screening(Retrospective review of medical records for 12 weeks)

        -  LTG escalation phase (8-18 weeks)

        -  VPA reduction phase (3-16 weeks)

        -  LTG &amp; VPA maintenance phase (12 weeks)

        -  Follow up (1-4 weeks) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To examine whether the VPA dose can be reduced
           by additional administration of LTG (up to 200 mg/d if there are no safety concerns) in
           Japanese pre-menopausal female epilepsy patients aged 15 years or older, whose seizures
           are well controlled by VPA monotherapy (fixed maintenance dose of 400-1200 mg/d).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To investigate the steady state concentration of LTG immediately before VPA dose
           reduction, at the time of VPA dose reduction, and during the LTG&amp;VPA maintenance phase.

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability associated with additional administration of
           LTG followed by dose reduction of VPA.

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 46 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>QOLIE-31-P is a questionnaire analyzed according to the scoring manual at Baseline, at the end of LTG/VPA Maintenance Phase and withdrawals for the participants aged 18 years and older (n=26, excluding 1 participant withdrawn due to protocol violation). Overall score was calculated as an average of sub scores that were normalized to 0 to 100. QOLIE-31-P has 7 subscale items (energy, mood, daily activities, cognition, medication effect, seizure worry and overall QOL). Higher score presents higher quality of life. Epileptic symptoms generally affect the QOL of participants, and so QOLIE-31-P is world widely used for the QOL assessment of adult participants. Baseline is defined as Day 1 (pre-dose) value. Change from Baseline is calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

    <description>QOLIE-AD-48 is a questionnaire analyzed according to the scoring manual at Baseline, at the end of the LTG/VPA Maintenance Phase and withdrawals for participants aged 15-17 years (n=6). Particpants who has started by QOLIE-AD-48 were using the same questionnaire even after 18 years old. Overall score was calculated as an average of sub scores that were normalized to 0 to 100. QOLIE-AD-48 has 8 subscale items (epilepsy impact, memory/concentration, physical fuctioning, stigma, social support, school behavior, attitudes towards epilepsy and health perceptions). Higher score presents higher quality of life. Epileptic symptoms generally affect the QOL of participants, and so QOLIE-AD-48 is world widely used for the QOL assessment of non-adult participants. Baseline is defined as Day 1 (pre-dose) value. Change from Baseline is calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

    <description>Following cases were considered for participants to have completed a part of or whole of the study. For whole period completion: participants who completed the last LTG and VPA Maintenance Phase visit (M5) in the LTG and VPA Maintenance Phase and follow-up examination. For LTG Escalation Phase completion: participants who reached 200 mg/d of LTG (or 100-200 mg/d of LTG if there were safety concerns) within 8-18 weeks of the phase. For VPA Reduction Phase completion: participants who completed the last fixed dose of VPA Reduction Phase visit (0 mg/d) (FR4) of the phase. For LTG and VPA Maintenance Phase completion: participants who completed M5 of the phase. Participants who met any of the withdrawal criteria after the start of investigational product were considered to have discontinued the study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants (par.) receiving monotherapy treatment with sodium valproate (VPA) maintenance dose of 400-1200 milligrams/day [mg/d]) due to a history of partial seizures (including secondary generalized seizures) or tonic-clonic seizures, and whose seizures had been controlled for 12 weeks (wk) prior to start of treatment were enrolled in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 33 participants were enrolled into the study and 20 participants completed the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Escalation Phase: LTG Plus VPA</title>
          <description>Participants received a fixed maintenance dose of VPA (400-1200 mg/d) along with lamotrigine (LTG) which was gradually escalated to 200 mg/d in accordance with the information of package insert: i.e. 25 mg of LTG was orally administered once every other day for the first 2 weeks and then once daily for the following 2 weeks. Thereafter, LTG was gradually escalated by 25 to 50 mg every 1 to 2 weeks for once or twice daily administration. If there were safety concerns, the LTG dose was decreased to 100 mg/d at the discretion of the investigator or sub-investigator. If there were still safety concerns despite the dose reduction to 100 mg/d, LTG was discontinued. The total duration of this phase was 8 to18 weeks.</description>

          <title>Reduction Phase: LTG Plus VPA</title>
          <description>Participants received a range of VPA dose reduction as follows: When VPA was reduced to 300 mg/d, the range of reduction was determined at the discretion of the investigator or sub-investigator: e.g., 1000 mg/d (2 weeks), 800 mg/d (2 weeks), 600 mg/d (2 weeks), 400 mg/d (2 weeks), 300 mg/d OR 1000 mg/d (4 weeks), 600 mg/d (4 weeks), 300 mg/d and when VPA was reduced to less than 300 mg/d, the dose was reduced to 300, 200, 100, and 0 mg/d in 100 mg decrements in steps of at least one week duration. When VPA was concomitantly used, LTG was administered twice daily with 200 mg/d as a maintenance dose. If there were safety concerns during the LTG Escalation Phase, a fixed maintenance dose of 100 to 200 mg/d of LTG was administered twice daily. When VPA was withdrawn (that is, VPA was reduced to 0 mg/d), LTG was required to be increased by 50-100 mg/d. If there were any safety concern, 25 mg increment was also available. The total duration of this phase was 4 to16 weeks.</description>

          <title>Maintenance Phase: LTG Plus VPA</title>
          <description>Participants received two different treatments. In one group, participants received a fixed maintenance dose of LTG 200 mg/d (or 100 to 200 mg/d if there were safety concerns during the LTG Escalation Phase) and VPA 100 mg/d (or higher if seizures occurred during the VPA Reduction Phase) were administered twice and 1-3 times daily, respectively, for 12 weeks. The frequency of administration was not changed. If seizures occurred, VPA dose could be increased/re-introduced. On the other group, after VPA was withdrawn, LTG dose was escalated up to 300 mg/d with 50-100 mg increment per 1-2 weeks. If there was safety concern or if remaining dose to 300 mg/d was below 50 mg, 25 mg increment was also available. If seizures occurred, LTG dose was increased up to 400 mg/d. If there was safety concern, LTG dose was decreased to 100 mg/d. If there was still safety concern at 100 mg/d, the participants were discontinued from the study. The total duration of this phase was 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31-P (QOLIE-31-P) in Participants Aged 18 Years and Older</title>
        <description>QOLIE-31-P is a questionnaire analyzed according to the scoring manual at Baseline, at the end of LTG/VPA Maintenance Phase and withdrawals for the participants aged 18 years and older (n=26, excluding 1 participant withdrawn due to protocol violation). Overall score was calculated as an average of sub scores that were normalized to 0 to 100. QOLIE-31-P has 7 subscale items (energy, mood, daily activities, cognition, medication effect, seizure worry and overall QOL). Higher score presents higher quality of life. Epileptic symptoms generally affect the QOL of participants, and so QOLIE-31-P is world widely used for the QOL assessment of adult participants. Baseline is defined as Day 1 (pre-dose) value. Change from Baseline is calculated as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>
