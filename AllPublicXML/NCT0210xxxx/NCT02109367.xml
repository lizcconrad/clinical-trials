  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves women who are scheduled to have surgery for a pelvic or ovarian mass that
      is suspicious for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The physician will perform an additional
      procedure on all consented subjects known as 'culdocentesis'. This will be done just prior to
      their scheduled surgery while the patient is under general anesthesia. Culdocentesis is a
      procedure typically used to check for abnormal fluid in the space just behind the vagina.
      This pocket of space is called the cul-de-sac. The purpose of this study is to determine if
      levels of tumor markers, CA-125 and HE4, are measurable from the cul-de-sac fluid. If these
      tumor markers are measurable from the cul-de-sac fluid and correlate with the patient's
      diagnosis, this procedure may be used in the future as an additional diagnostic tool for EOC.
      In addition, a single urine sample will be collected from each patient to measure the ratio
      of &quot;good&quot; to &quot;bad&quot; estrogen. Investigators hypothesize this ratio will also correlate with
      EOC diagnosis. Study results could lead to development of an alternative, minimally invasive
      and low risk diagnostic tool in patients with an ovarian mass suspicious for malignancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single cohort, exploratory pilot study of 60 participants to assess if ovarian
      cancer markers, cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) and human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), are
      measurable from cul-de-sac washings collected via culdocentesis. Immediately prior to the
      scheduled surgery, while the patient is under general anesthesia, a long, thin needle will be
      inserted through the wall of the vagina (just below the uterus) to access the cul-de-sac. A
      saline wash will then be performed and this fluid will be collected for analysis of tumor
      markers. CA-125 and HE4 levels will be compared to serum levels for correlation with a
      diagnosis of ovarian cancer. A urine sample will also be collected from this same cohort to
      measure estrogen metabolites. Estrogen metabolism is associated with cancer progression in
      estrogen sensitive tissues. Estrogen metabolites, 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) the &quot;good&quot;
      byproduct and 16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OHE1) known as the &quot;bad&quot; byproduct, have been
      implicated in the development of breast cancer. Study investigators are proposing to expand
      the utility of this predictive ratio to ovarian cancer by measuring the potential imbalance
      of these metabolites.

      If results indicate an association between cancer diagnosis and levels of CA-125 and HE4 or
      the ratio of estrogen metabolites from the urine, this could allow for a new minimally
      invasive, low-risk diagnostic modality for all suspected ovarian cancer cases. This would be
      particularly invaluable for patients at higher risk for poor surgical outcomes. Data from
      this pilot study will confirm the potential effect size needed to identify an optimal
      cut-point useful for the prediction of EOC within this study population.
