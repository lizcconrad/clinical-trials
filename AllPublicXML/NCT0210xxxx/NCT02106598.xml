  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current imaging devices usually detect cancer prior to surgery. However, these devices cannot
      be used during the surgical procedure to visualize lymph nodes with cancer (called &quot;sentinel
      lymph nodes&quot;). The groups are for head and neck melanoma, gynecologic, and breast cancers. As
      a part of the standard of care, the they will initially undergo imaging of their lymph nodes
      prior to their surgery. Melanoma and breast cancer patients will be injected with a
      radioactive dye around the tumor site, and images will be acquired about 2 hours the location
      of the later using a device to image the dye. For gynecologic cancer patients, they will be
      injected with a indocyanine green in the operating room and then images will be acquired soon
      after. In addition, the investigators will test, for the first time in humans, a new,
      experimental dye-labeled particle (dots), cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C dots for lymph node mapping. This
      particle, the size of a small protein, will be injected around sites of melanoma before or
      during your surgery to identify diseased nodes using a hand-held camera system. The
      dye-labeled particle can be viewed in tissues that may contain tumor. Based upon the clinical
      diagnosis, the patient may have a procedure called Reverse Lymphatic Mapping, which is a new
      form of sentinel lymph node mapping. The doctor will discuss this with the patient. If the
      patient is undergoing reverse lymphatic mapping, they will have the experimental particle
      injected into their hand or foot (based on their tumor type) and the standard of care
      injection will be injected around the tumor. This will allow the surgeon to remove only the
      lymph nodes that directly link to the tumor. The particles will not treat the cancer and any
      images or information found during this study will not be used for your treatment. The
      information collected may be used to guide the design of future studies to detect and/or
      treat tumors.

    <description>Participants will be investigated comprising 2 different regions of the body (breast and gynecologic malignancies). Each cohort will be analyzed separately to assess the feasibility of conducting pre-operative SLN mapping using real-time optical detection procedures and intradermal single- or double-dose injection/s of non-radioactive cRGDY-PEGCy5.5-C dots about the primary tumor site.</description>

    <description>The first 20 participants will be enrolled and imaged at a fixed optimized dose (5 nanmoles) and volume (up to 1ml) of fluorescent cRGDY-PEGCy5.5-C dots will be locally administered about the primary tumor site, while varying the timing interval between the injection and visualization of fluorescence signal in optically-active nodes, in order to maximize detection of metastases. Fixed optimized dose, volume, and timing intervals from these studies will then be applied to another 40 enrolled participants to assess efficacy.</description>
