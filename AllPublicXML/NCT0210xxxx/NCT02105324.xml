    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable automated bionic pancreas system that
      automatically delivers both insulin and glucagon can improve glycemic control vs. usual care
      for young people with type 1 diabetes ages 6-11 years old in a diabetes camp environment.
