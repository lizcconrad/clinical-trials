    <textblock>
      This exploratory trial will fulfill a medical data gap for the dopamine-agonist rotigotine,
      as so far no data on elderly population is available.

      Primary objective: To assess efficacy and safety of rotigotine in patients with late onset
      Parkinson's Disease (PD), starting at age 70 or later, on motor symptoms.

      Secondary objective: To assess efficacy and safety of rotigotine in patients with late onset
      Parkinson's Disease (PD), starting at age 70 or later, on selected non motor symptoms : sleep
      quality; depression; cognitive function.

      Subjects ≥70 years, with diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) based on the presence of at
      least two of three cardinal features (bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity), within 12
      months since diagnosis and no longer than 12 months from onset to diagnosis, and for whom the
      caring physician is uncertain on whether or not to start treatment.

      Outcome Measurement: Percentage of Responders to treatment in motor (part III) and Activities
      of daily living (ADL) (part II) components of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
      (UPDRS) at visit 4 and 6; Percentage of Responders to treatment in sleep quality in relation
      to Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS)-2 at visit 4 and 6; Responders to treatment in mood
      in relation to Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) at visit 4 and 6.

      Exploratory, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study: 80 patients with late onset
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) are randomized in 2 parallel groups, ratio 1:1.

      One group will be treated with rotigotine and one group will be treated with placebo, for 12
      weeks after titration.

      Treatment is titrated to optimal dose (that at which investigator and subject felt that motor
      and non motor impairment are adequately controlled), starting at 2 mg/24 hr and increasing
      with weekly increments of 2 mg/24 hr up to a maximum of 8 mg/24 hr. The dose is maintained at
      the optimal or maximal dose for a 8-week period (maintenance period) .
