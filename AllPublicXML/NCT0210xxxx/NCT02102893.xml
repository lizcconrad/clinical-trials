      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms originating from neuroendocrine cells located
      throughout the body. They secret various peptides and cause various symptoms (carcinoid
      syndrome) or not. The incidence of NETs was not well-known till recently when Yao et al. and
      Hausa et al. published their surveys of NETs using data from the US Surveillance,
      Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and from the Norwegian Registry of Cancer (NRC).
      The incidence of NETs in Taiwan by using the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) data was increased
      from 0.3 to 1.51 per 100,000 from 1996 to 2008. The increased incidence for NET worldwide
      probably was partially due to the awareness and improvement of diagnostic technology.
      Compared with the incidence in western countries, the incidence of NET is much lower in
      Taiwan. And the incidence of NETs in Asian Pacific Islanders was also lower than the whites
      and blacks in US. Gastroenteral-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs), accounting for half to two thirds
      of all NETs, is the most common site of NETs. As the progress in the understanding of
      pathophysiology for GEP-NET, there are two novel targeted agents shown to be effective for
      the treatment of GEP-NET. Meanwhile, response to mTOR inhibitor was better for Asian than
      Caucasian in the phase III study using everolimus for advanced pancreatic NETs. These
      information suggests that there is racial difference for either genetic or environmental risk
      factors and these factors result in different incidence and/or clinical outcome. Currently,
      there is limited data for thorough epidemiologic study in Taiwan. The aim of this study is to
      collect clinical information for GEP-NET, and survey the prognostic factors for GEP-NET in
      Taiwan. We suppose that this epidemiologic study would provide a database potentially to
      improve the diagnosis, and treatment of GEP-NET. This study plans to include 600 GEP-NET
      patients. NET patients diagnosed after 2011.1.1 is included in this study.

      Furthermore, we will provide the check of immunohistochemical staining for the tumor tissue
      of GEP-NET patients, including the functioning status (insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma,
      VIPoma) and the degree of differentiation, the expression of SSTR2 or SSTR5 and the check of
      possible primary site for unknown primary NET patients. This examination will provide more
      accurate diagnosis for the patients and further treatment suggestion for the patients.

      2.0 OBJECTIVES

      2.1 To establish the database for GEP-NET by register the clinical presentation, diagnosis,
      stages, treatment and clinical outcome of GEP-NET patients.

      2.2 To analyze the risk and prognostic factors of GEP-NET patients. 2.3 To make a treatment
      consensus for GEP-NETs

      3.0 PATIENT POPULATION There are approximately 500 patients estimated to meet the inclusion
      criteria from 10 hospitals in Taiwan. This recruitment estimate may vary and will be flexible
      since no formal sample size is required.

      3.1 Inclusion Criteria: 3.1.1 histologically proven GEP-NET patients, according to the WHO
      classification in any stage.

      3.1.2 Signed informed consent 3.2 Exclusion criteria: 3.2.1 patients of GEP-NET without
      histological proof

    <description>Survival analysis will be conducted to calculate the hazard ratio of GEP-NET outcomes (overall survival, disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, and second primary) associated with potential prognostic factors. First, univariate survival analysis will be performed using Kaplan-Meier method. Those variables that are significantly (p&lt;0.05) associated with GEP-NET outcomes will be included in the multivariable analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression model. With accrual interval of 10 years,an average follow-up of 5 years, and a median time to outcome of 5 years, the proposed sample size of 500 cases has a statistical power of 1.0 to detect a hazard ratio of 1.5 or more.</description>
