      Purpose: To evaluate the performance of several dental adhesives used for bonding
      tooth-colored fillings to teeth 6 years after the fillings have been placed.

      Participants: Subjects which had participated in the study entitled &quot;Clinical Evaluation of
      New Total-Etch and Self-Etch Dental Adhesives&quot; (IRB Study #07-0673).

      Procedures (methods): Fillings that had been placed 6 years ago will be evaluated by a
      direct, visual examination. Close-up intra-oral clinical photographs of each filling will be
      made. An impression of the filling may be obtained.

      The specific study aim of this 6-year recall of the patients treated in IRB Study #07-0673 is
      to evaluate the fillings placed according to the following characteristics: Retention; Color
      match; Cavosurface margin discoloration; Secondary caries; Anatomic form; Marginal adaptation
      and/or integrity; Post-operative sensitivity.
