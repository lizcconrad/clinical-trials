  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, single-arm study is designed to evaluate the effect of atezolizumab treatment
      in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer. Participants
      will be enrolled into 1 of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will consist of participants who are
      treatment-naïve and ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The results of Cohort 1
      are reported separately (NCT02951767). Cohort 2 (reported here) will contain participants who
      have progressed during or following a prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Participants
      in both cohorts will be given a 1200 milligrams (mg) intravenous (IV) dose of atezolizumab on
      Day 1 of 21-day cycles. Treatment of participants in Cohort 1 will continue until disease
      progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or
      unmanageable toxicity. Treatment of participants in Cohort 2 will continue until loss of
      clinical benefit or unmanageable toxicity.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed Objective Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as Assessed by the Independent Review Facility (IRF) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (assessed at every 9 weeks for the first 12 months, thereafter every 12 weeks until data cutoff date 04 July 2016, up to maximum length of follow-up of 24.48 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR was reported. The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

    <description>Tumor response was assessed by the investigator according to modified RECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new measurable or unmeasurable lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR.

    <description>DOR was defined as the time from the initial occurrence of documented CR or PR (whichever occurred first) until documented disease progression or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurred first. Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Disease progression or progressive disease (PD) was defined as ≥20% increase in sum LD in reference to the smallest on-study sum LD, or the appearance of new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR.</description>

        <description>Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR was reported. The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by the IRF According to RECIST v1.1</title>
        <description>DOR was defined as the time from the initial occurrence of documented CR or PR (whichever occurred first) until documented disease progression or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurred first. Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Disease progression or progressive disease (PD) was defined as ≥20% increase in sum LD in reference to the smallest on-study sum LD, or the appearance of new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline until confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (assessed at every 9 weeks for the first 12 months, thereafter every 12 weeks until data cutoff date 04 July 2016, up to maximum length of follow-up of 24.48 months)</time_frame>

          <title>Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by the IRF According to RECIST v1.1</title>
          <description>DOR was defined as the time from the initial occurrence of documented CR or PR (whichever occurred first) until documented disease progression or death due to any cause on study, whichever occurred first. Tumor response was assessed by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Disease progression or progressive disease (PD) was defined as ≥20% increase in sum LD in reference to the smallest on-study sum LD, or the appearance of new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR.</description>

        <description>Tumor response was assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions in reference to Baseline sum LD. Response was to be confirmed ≥4 weeks after the initial assessment of CR or PR. The percentage of participants with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR was reported. The exact 95% CI was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
