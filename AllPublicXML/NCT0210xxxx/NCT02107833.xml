    <textblock>
      : This is a Phase I, study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of oral OPRX-106 in
      healthy volunteers. Up to 18 healthy male subjects (age 18 years and older) will be
      randomized to one of three dose cohorts (up to 6 subjects per cohort), receiving OPRX-106
      doses equivalent to 2mg, 8mg or 16mg Tumor Necrosis Factor receptor-Fc fusion protein.
      Subjects will receive once daily oral administrations of OPRX-106 for 5 consecutive days.
      Subjects will remain at the clinical center for 24 hours after the first administration (Day
      1) of OPRX-106 including PK sampling and then return to the site daily for additional
      administrations and study procedures.
