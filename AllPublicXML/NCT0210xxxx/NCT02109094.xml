  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to examine the metabolic changes that occur amongst obese and lean
      pregnant women with normal glycemic control as well as pregnant women with diabetes mellitus
      (gestational diabetes and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus) compared to non-pregnant age
      matched controls. Given the adaptive tendency of the maternal body to use alternative energy
      sources such as ketones and free fatty acids rather than glucose and to shunt glucose and
      amino acids to the fetus, the investigators hypothesize that the amino acid and fatty acid
      profile will be reflective of this adaptive change and that maternal insulin resistance will
      result in alterations in this pattern in both the plasma and CSF. Furthermore, the
      investigators also hypothesize that maternal degrees of insulin resistance will also be
      reflected in CSF hormonal changes.

      We seek to investigate for the first time whether CSF branched chain amino acid, free fatty
      acid, and energy regulatory hormone levels are altered in comparison to plasma levels among
      pregnant and non-pregnant individuals with varying degrees of insulin resistance.
      Furthermore, we seek to understand the effects of pregnancy on central and peripheral energy
      metabolism using metabolomic profiling as well as traditional hormonal measurements in
      maternal blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid as well as cord blood.

        All pregnant subjects will be women recruited from the Women's Center, the high-risk
        prenatal care unit at Tompkins, Long Wharf and L&amp;D.

        The target population in this study includes pregnant women with pregnancies complicated by
        gestational diabetes, DM, and uncomplicated controls.

        The Yale New Haven Hospital Lumbar puncture clinic, located in the Yale Physicians
        Building, is a weekly referral clinic in the department of Neurology. The target population
        for this study includes non-pregnant women, age greater than 18 who require large volume
        lumbar puncture for medical purposes such as for symptomatic treatment of pseudotumor
        cerebri.
