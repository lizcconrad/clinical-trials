    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, chronic-dosing (14 Days),
      three-period, placebo-controlled, multi-center, cross-over study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of two dose levels of a dual pharmacology molecule with the combined properties of a
      long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA); (AZD2115)
      delivered by a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in subjects with moderate to severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Diagnosis: Subjects with an established clinical
             history of COPD for more than 1 year at Screening, according to the COPD GOLD
             guidelines.

          -  Current or former smokers with a history of â‰¥10 pack years of cigarette smoking.

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;70%.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 must be &lt;80% predicted

          -  Women of non-child bearing potential (ie., physiologically incapable of becoming
             pregnant, including any female who is 2 years post-menopausal); or women of child
             bearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and agrees to
             acceptable contraceptive methods for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Significant diseases other than COPD, ie., disease or condition which, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of participation in the study
             or may influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability to
             participate in the study.

          -  Primary diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency as the cause of COPD

          -  Other active pulmonary disease such as active tuberculosis, lung cancer,
             bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, idiopathic interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, primary
             pulmonary hypertension, or uncontrolled sleep apnea.

          -  Poorly controlled COPD (hospitalization due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months
             of Screening or requiring treatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics in the 6 week
             interval prior to Screening or during Screening.

          -  Unstable ischemic heart disease, left ventricular failure, or documented myocardial
             infarction within 12 months of Randomization.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal ECG.
