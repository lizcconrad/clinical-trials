      This Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will assess
      the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in adult patients with mild to moderate asthma
      treated with short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) therapy alone. Patients will be randomized in a
      1:1:1 ratio to receive either blinded lebrikizumab or placebo treatment by subcutaneous (SC)
      injection (every 4 weeks for a total of 3 doses) or open-label treatment with Singulair
      (Montelukast; 10 mg daily). Time on study treatment will last 12 weeks.
