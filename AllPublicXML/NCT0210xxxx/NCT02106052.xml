  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment affects roughly 50% of people with multiple sclerosis (MS). There are
      currently no satisfactory medical treatments for cognitive impairments related to MS and
      alternative forms of treatment are needed. Exercise training can improve cognition in older
      adults and people with mild cognitive impairments, including those with early Alzheimer's
      disease. Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct the first definitive study that will
      test the theory that moderately intense aerobic exercise can improve cognition in people with
      MS-related impairment - specifically in information processing speed - more so than
      non-aerobic stretching and toning (both forms of exercise will be performed 3 days per week
      for 6 months).

      Primary study hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize greater improvement in speed of
      information processing from pre- to post-treatment in the aerobic exercise group compared to
      the stretching and toning group (attention control).

      Secondary study hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize greater improvement in other
      cognitive domains and patient reported outcomes from pre- to post-testing in the aerobic
      exercise group compared to the stretching and toning group (attention control).

      The investigators plan to recruit 125 adults with MS who can walk without assistance and
      without rest for at least 100 meters and have mild weaknesses in information processing
      speed. The investigators will randomly assign 50% of participants to an aerobic exercise
      program and 50% to a non-aerobic exercise program (stretching and toning). In order to
      determine whether the intervention is successful, the investigators will compare cognitive
      functioning in both exercise groups before the exercise-training program, at the end of the
      6-month training program and three months after the end of the training program. If our study
      findings support our hypotheses, this would be a relatively no-barriers treatment option to
      further explore for other people with MS including people with greater and lesser baseline
      disability.

    <measure>Composite score of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3 (PASAT-3&quot;) and the oral version of the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six months after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The PASAT-3&quot; is an auditory processing speed measure in which patients are exposed to single digit numbers voiced every three seconds. After each number presentation, the patient's task is to respond with the sum of the last two digits presented. There are 60 stimuli. The main score is the number of correct responses. The SDMT will be used to measure visual processing speed. This test presents a stimulus key of numbers paired with abstract symbols at the top of a page. Patients scan the page below the key that has rows of symbols without the paired numbers. The task is to generate the associated numbers orally as fast as possible.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Sorting Test (DKEFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The DKEFS will be administered at six months after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The DKEFS will be used to assess higher executive function. Six cards are presented which can be sorted in at least eight different ways (e.g., card color, card shape, semantic association). Patients are allowed four minutes with each deck to sort the cards in as many ways possible. The dependent variables are the total number of correct sorts and the total verbal description score among the two decks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>California Verbal Learning Test, second edition (CVLT2)</measure>
    <time_frame>The CVLT2 will be administered at six months after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The CVLT2 will be used to evaluate multi-trial learning and long-term recall for verbal information. The test presents a list of 16 words over 5 learning trials using a selective reminding procedure. Patients are asked to recall as many words as they can after each trial followed by a delay interval, after which they are again asked to recall as many words from the list as possible. The investigators will use the total number of words recalled during the initial learning trials and the number of words recalled after the delay interval as outcomes for this study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised (BVMTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>The BVMTR will be administered at six months after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The BVMTR will be used to assess visuospatial memory. The test presents a matrix of six visual designs over three learning trials, each time for 10 seconds. After each trial the patient is asked to reproduce the figures in their correct location. After a 20-25 minute delay, patients are again asked to redraw the designs. The investigators will use the total score over the three learning trials and the total number recalled after the 20-25 minute delay as outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>The COWAT will be administered at six months after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The COWAT will be used to assess verbal fluency. The test requires patients to generate words orally that begin with a given letter of the alphabet. The outcome is the total number of correct words over the three trials.</description>

    <description>The aerobic exercise condition is a graduated program of supervised aerobic exercise up to one hour per day, three days per week, and lasting 6 months. The structured exercise portion of the sessions will initially last for 15-20 minutes at 40-50% heart rate reserve (HRR) and progressively increase up to 35-40 minutes in duration at 65-75% HRR during the last month of the program. The program will focus on large, dynamic movements of the lower extremities (e.g. leg cycling ergometry). There may be some individual variation in adaptations that dictate the exact characteristics of the program.</description>

    <description>The stretching and toning condition is a supervised stretching program with Therabands up to one hour per day, three days per week, and lasting 6 months. The stretching exercises will be based on a manual published by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) that has been standardized, manualized for reproducibility, and the investigators will progressively include more exercises and sets with Therabands for resistance over the course of the 6-month period.</description>
