  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Endometriosis is a disease affecting 8-15 % of fertile women and is a cause of
      abdominal pain and suffering during women's menstrual periods. A subgroup of patients with
      DIE has an infiltration into the rectosigmoid bowel wall (4-37%). Knowledge of the growth
      pattern of rectosigmoid lesions related to subjective symptoms is mandatory in order to
      assess the need for follow-up with transvaginal ultrasound during medical treatment.

      Hypotheses:

      Symptoms will follow growth of rectosigmoid endometriosis.

      Material and methods:

      Two different cohorts of women, based on time of diagnosis of rectosigmoid endometriosis and
      treatment with hormonal intrauterine device or continuous oral contraceptives will receive a
      questionnaire and a transvaginal ultrasound scan (measuring size and volume) at inclusion,
      (6) and 12 months later.

      Perspectives:

      Patients treated conservatively may be followed by questionnaires, thereby reducing the need
      for time consuming clinical controls.
