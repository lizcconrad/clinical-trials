    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of obesity on the pharmacokinetics of
      the levonorgestrel (LNG) only emergency contraceptive (EC) regimen and on markers of
      ovulation

      Primary hypothesis:

      1) Obese users of LNG-EC have a pharmacokinetic profile that is consistent with a larger
      volume of distribution of LNG.

      Secondary hypothesis:

        1. Alterations in these pharmacokinetic parameters of the LNG-EC regimen in obese women
           affect the primary mechanism of action, which is inhibition of ovulation.

        2. Obesity may affect other factors that alter levels of LNG, such as sex-hormone binding
           globulin (SHBG) and albumin, which bind LNG and potentially lowers the amount of free
           LNG.
