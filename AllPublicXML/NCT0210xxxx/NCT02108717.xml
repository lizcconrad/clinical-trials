      1. Purpose

           - The investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of iPhone based remote control
           system as a real-time remote CT reading tool for suspected appendicitis under 3G network
           and the suboptimal illumination.

        2. Methods

             -  A total of 120 abdominal CT examinations; sixty had no findings of appendicitis,
                while the other sixty showed signs of acute appendicitis, were selected. The 16
                raters reviewed these images using an LCD monitor of the PACS workstation and also
                an iPhone which was connected to the PACS workstation via remote control system,
                grading the probability of presence of acute appendicitis on each examination by a
                five Likert scale.

             -  The investigators will compare the diagnostic performance between two devices.

      The 16 raters were randomly divided into two groups

        -  The raters in group one reviewed the CT examinations numbered from one to 60 using LCD
           monitor and reviewed the remaining CT examinations numbered from 61 to 120 using iPhone
           with TeamViewer at their first visit

        -  The other group firstly reviewed the CT scans numbered from one to 60 using iPhone with
           TeamViewer and 61 to 120 with the LCD monitor.

        -  They visited twice with an interval of four weeks and reviewed the CT scans using
           revered devices at each session.

        -  The raters were instructed to rate the likelihood of the presence or absence of
           appendicitis in each case using a five-Likert scale (1 = obvious no appendicitis, 2 =
           unlikely appendicitis, 3 = unsure, 4 = likely appendicitis, 5 = obvious appendicitis).
