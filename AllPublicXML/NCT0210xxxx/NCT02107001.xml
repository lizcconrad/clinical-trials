  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest pain is an alarming symptom and one of the most frequent causes of access to the
      Emergency Departement. Although chest X-ray remains an essential step in the diagnostic
      process, several studies showed numerous limitations of radiography which frequently is
      inconclusive. Ultrasonography is a non-radiating imaging technique. Albeit a wide use of
      ultrasound, the utilization of ultrasound in the study of the lung has only recently been
      introduced in the clinical practice. Several studies proved that lung ultrasound is useful in
      the diagnosis of lung consolidation in community acquired pneumonia. Nowadays, ultrasound is
      not routinely used in the presence of chest pain. Our hypothesis based on clinical experience
      is that, in patients with pleuritic chest pain, lung ultrasound is very sensitive in
      detecting pneumonia and other lung diseases (such as pneumothorax) thus performing better
      than radiography. The primary aim of this study is to verify, in patients affected by
      pleuritic chest pain, the accuracy of lung ultrasound compared to chest-X-ray. The secondary
      aim is to evaluate the accuracy of lung ultrasound consolidations in distinguishing lung
      consolidation in pneumonia, atelectasis, pulmonary infarction, or tumors.
