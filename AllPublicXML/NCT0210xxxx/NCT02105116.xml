      This pilot clinical trial studies if cells donated by a close genetic relative can help keep
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from coming back after standard chemotherapy induces a complete
      remission. Blood cells obtained from a donor include a variety of blood cells that may
      trigger the patient's immune system to react against AML cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity of haploidentical allogeneic cellular therapy in patients in complete remission
      (CR) (or CR with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) after induction chemotherapy with
      fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate)-cytarabine.

      II. Efficacy of haploidentical allogeneic cellular therapy in patients in CR (or CRp) after
      induction chemotherapy with fludarabine-cytarabine (remission rates at 6, 12, 18, 24 months).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immunologic parameters before and after haploidentical therapy: host anti-leukemia T
      cells; host regulatory T cells.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour
      once daily (QD) for 5 days and cytarabine IV over 4 hours for 5 days. Treatment may continue
      for 1 or 2 courses at the discretion of the treating physician.

      ALLOGENEIC CELLULAR THERAPY: Patients undergo irradiated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) of 3
      x 10^8 cluster of differentiation (CD)3+ cells/kg at 8 weeks. Patients with stable disease
      may repeat irradiated DLI every 8-12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.
