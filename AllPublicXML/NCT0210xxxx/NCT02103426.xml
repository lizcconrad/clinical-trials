    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether ASP0113 (a CMV deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]
      vaccine) can be detected in plasma after intramuscular (IM) injections, and to determine
      whether CMV-seropositive healthy volunteers, CMV-seronegative healthy volunteers,
      CMV-seronegative dialysis patients mount an immune response to the CMV proteins produced by
      the vaccine after repeated ASP0113 IM injection.

      Part 1 is open-label with no randomization, and Part 2 is single-blind and randomized. The
      purpose of Part 1 is to obtain pilot pharmacokinetic data so as to optimize pharmacokinetic
      sample collection times in Part 2.
