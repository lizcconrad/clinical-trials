  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe brain injuries induce alteration of state of consciousness. These functional
      limitations can be significantly alleviated by treatment neurorehabilitation, particularly if
      this is established early. It has been shown that treatment of vertical integration in
      patients in a vegetative state or minimally conscious state can improve the level of
      supervision and positive influence on rehabilitation. Therefore, there are sufficient
      indications that anticipate the treatment of vertical integration, since the phase of
      hospitalization in ICUs, may improve the functional outcome of the patient.

      Early verticalization and stepping with the equipment Hocoma Erigo, during monitoring of
      vital parameters. The device Erigo is already CE marked and, for the purposes of the study,
      will be used in accordance with the intended use of the same mark (after-market clinical
      investigation).
