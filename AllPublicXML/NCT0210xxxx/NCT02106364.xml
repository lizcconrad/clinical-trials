    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a new basal insulin,
      insulin peglispro, to insulin glargine in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Both drugs will be given by an injection under the skin. Participants may continue to take
      oral antihyperglycemic medication (OAM) during the study, as prescribed by their personal
      physician. The study is expected to last about 12 months for each participant.

          -  Renal: have a history of renal transplantation, or are currently receiving renal
             dialysis or have serum creatinine ≥2 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL) (177 micromole/liter
             [mol/L]).

          -  Hepatic: have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease (excluding

             steatohepatitis (NASH), or elevated liver enzyme measurements.

          -  Lipid-lowering medications:

               -  Are using niacin preparations as a lipid-lowering medication or bile acid
                  sequestrants within 90 days prior to screening; or,
