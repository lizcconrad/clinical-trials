    <description>It was provided by the nurses during obstetric consultation in pre-natal period and averaged 30 minutes in duration. The intervention group received education to facilitate successful breastfeeding and symptom management as nipple pain. This was supported by strategies designed to (1) prevent problems associated with breastfeeding (nipple lesions, cracks and mastitis), (2) perform breast-care procedures, (3) strengthen information about the advantages of maternal breastfeeding (nutritional support, importance as food for the baby, availability, post-partum recovery) and (4) provide asepsis and hygiene measures. The nurses encouraged participation and gave the education in personalized dialogue with the woman. The information was reinforced with an illustrated explanatory leaflet.</description>
