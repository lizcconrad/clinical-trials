  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to will evaluate and compare two Ranibizumab treatment
      regimens (Standard of care) in patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular
      degeneration (wAMD) aiming to achieve and to maintain a maximum visual function benefit. The
      results will be used to generate further recommendations on the timing of treatment
      administration for patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wAMD).
      In this context, the study will use the anatomical imaging (for example, optical coherence
      tomography [OCT]) to evaluate wAMD disease activity impacted by the recurrence of disease
      instability and for decision making in the treatment decision algorithm.

    <description>Visual Acuity (VA) will be assessed using best correction determined from protocol refraction during screening and every 3 months throughout the study; in the monthly regimen and during screening and at every visit thereafter throughout the study in the treat and extend regimen. VA measurements (number of letters correctly identified) will be performed with the patient in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like VA testing charts at an initial testing distance of 4 meters. This outcome measure will describe the difference in the VA mean changes between the two regimens from Baseline to Month 12.</description>

    <description>Three consecutive months of 0.5 mg Ranibizumab intravitreal injections (Day 1, Month 1, and Month 2). Monthly injections will continue until evidence of disease stability is observed. Specifically, monthly treatment will continue until visual acuity is deemed stable as indicated by a gain in visual acuity of ≤ 3 ETDRS letters from the prior month, no clinical evidence of lesion growth, fluid or blood, and no intraretinal or subretinal fluid on OCT. When this is achieved, the intervals between each subsequent injection will be extended by 2 weeks (intervals of 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, to a maximum of 12 weeks) until clinical or diagnostic evidence of disease instability is observed based on OCT findings and/or BCVA ETDRS.</description>

    <description>All eligible patients will initially be treated in a fixed loading phase, consisting of one intravitreal injection of Ranibizumab 0.5 mg per month for 3 consecutive months (Day 1, Month 1, and Month 2). After the loading phase, patients will be treated according to the treatment arm to which they have been assigned, either a continued once monthly dosing regimen, or an extended schedule of Ranibizumab intravitreal injections as described below. The planned duration of total treatment is 24 months.</description>

        The study population will consist of male and female Canadian patients diagnosed with
        visual impairment due to wAMD and for whom Ranibizumab has been prescribed as their
        standard of care by the treating physician. Eligibility for Ranibizumab will be determined
        by the study physician according to the current prescribing information. A total of 580
        patients will be enrolled from approximately 20 to 25 centers.
