      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of specific bone marrow maps developed
      with18F-FLT PET/CT imaging on the ability to spare proliferating bone marrow using proton
      beam radiotherapy compared to IMRT. Participants will be 18 years of age or old with a
      history of gynecologic cancer. Subjects will undergo 3 FLT-PET scans (one before treatment,
      one during the course of RT, and one 2-5 weeks after initiation of RT). Scans will take place
      in the Department of Radiation Oncology.
