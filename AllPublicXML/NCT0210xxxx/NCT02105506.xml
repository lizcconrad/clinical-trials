  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The construction of esophageal anastomoses is associated with considerable risk at
      postoperative anastomotic leakage. Application of TachoSil®, a tissue sealant with human
      fibrinogen and thrombin, can improve strength of the esophageal anastomosis and potentially
      prevent anastomotic leakage.

      Objective: Evaluation of feasibility and safety of TachoSil® application on esophageal
      anastomoses.

      Study design: Non-randomized, non-blinded, single-center intervention study. Study
      population: Patients, 18-80 years old, undergoing an elective total gastrectomy with an
      esophago-jejunostomy or esophagectomy with a planned esophagogastric anastomosis will be
      enrolled. A total number of 15 patients will be included in the study.

      Intervention: Gastric or esophageal resection will be executed according to the common
      procedures used in the UMC Utrecht. After construction of the esophageal anastomosis, all
      enrolled participants will receive a TachoSil® patch, which will be applied on the esophageal
      anastomosis intra-operatively. Hence, TachoSil® is used as an add-on therapy. TachoSil® will
      be degraded enzymatically in a period of approximately 24 weeks after application.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is feasibility, which is assessed by
      evaluation of adherence of the patch. A time-action analysis of the application of the
      Tachosil patch will be performed.

      Nature and extent of the burden associated with participation: The burden for the patient is
      minimal. The total surgical procedure will be prolonged with 10-15 minutes. Postoperative
      care and outpatient visits do not differ from regular protocol. TachoSil® is approved and
      registered for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis and to promote
      tissue sealing by the European Commission.
