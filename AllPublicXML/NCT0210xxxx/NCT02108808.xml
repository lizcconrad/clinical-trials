  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an established invasive method for assessing the
      physiological significance of coronary artery stenosis. Adenosine, an important endogenous
      regulator of coronary blood flow during both stress and ischemia, is widely used to achieve
      conditions of stable hyperemia required for measurement of FFR.

      Studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) post
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) receiving ticagrelor revealed a differential
      coronary blood flow velocity response during increasing doses of adenosine compared to
      placebo or prasugrel treated subjects, respectively. It has also been demonstrated that
      patients treated with ticagrelor have increased plasma adenosine levels. Therefore, it has
      been hypothesized that the degree of hyperemia obtained with adenosine infusion may be
      greater in patients on ticagrelor than that obtained in patients taking clopidogrel or
      prasugrel. If this proves to be true, it would lead to a lower FFR value with possible
      important clinical implications in ticagrelor receiving patients in need for FFR measurement.

      This is a prospective, single center, randomized study of parallel design. Consecutive
      ticagrelor naive patients who are referred for coronary angiography and have an
      angiographically moderate to severe de novo stenosis (&gt;50% and &lt;90% diameter by visual
      assessment) in at least one major epicardial coronary artery amenable to PCI are candidates
      for this study. Patients after informed consent will be randomized (hour 0) to receive
      immediately post FFR (with adenosine iintravenous infusion at 140 Î¼g/Kg/min for a 3 minute
      period) either ticagrelor 180mg loading dose or prasugrel 60mg/clopidogrel 600mg loading dose
      (as clinically indicated). FFR examination will be repeated 2 hours post loading dose.
