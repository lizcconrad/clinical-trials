      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether F-18 FLT PET/CT is useful in early
      response assessment of induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia patients.

    <textblock>
      Assessment of treatment response in AML is very important to determine the next treatment.
      Standard treatment of AML begins with induction chemotherapy. NCCN guideline recommend to
      assess the treatment response via bone marrow examination approximately 7-10 days after
      completion of induction chemotherapy. However, the possibility of sampling error and risks of
      infection and bleeding are the limitation of bone marrow biopsy.

      F-18 fluorodeoxythymidine (FLT) is a radiopharmaceutical for PET, reflecting the
      proliferation of the cell. F-18 FLT is trapped after phosphorylation by thymidine kinase1,
      whose expression is increased in replicating cells. There have been several studies that
      reported F-18 FLT PET could measure health and proliferation of the bone marrow.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if F-18 FLT PET/CT is suitable for early response
      assessment of induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia patients.

    <description>All PET/CT scans were performed using a hybrid PET/CT scanner (Gemini TF 64 with Astonish TF, Philips). F-18 FLT (2.96 MBq/kg) in 2-5 mL of normal saline was injected intravenously. One hour after FLT injection, CT began at the vertex and progressed to the upper thigh (120 kVp, 100 mA and 4 mm slice thickness). PET emission data were acquired immediately for 1 min at each bed position followed. The CT data were used for attenuation correction. Images were reconstructed using a standard ordered-subset expectation maximization algorithm with 3 iterations and 33 subsets.</description>
