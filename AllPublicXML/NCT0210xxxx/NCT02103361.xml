  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the OTIS Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy Study is to monitor planned and
      unplanned pregnancies exposed to certain medications, to evaluate the possible teratogenic
      effect of these medications and to follow live born infants for one year after birth. With
      respect to fetal outcome, it is important to evaluate the spectrum of outcomes that may be
      relevant to a medication exposure during pregnancy, and these include both easily
      recognizable defects which are visible at birth, as well as more subtle or delayed defects
      that may not be readily identifiable without special expertise and observation beyond the
      newborn period.

      The purpose of the Stelara Pregnancy Exposure Registry OTIS Autoimmune Diseases in Pregnancy
      Project is to follow pregnant women or women who have delivered a baby, who have been treated
      with Stelara within 3 months of their last menstrual period (LMP) or during pregnancy to
      evaluate the possible effect of this medication on the pregnancy outcome including child
      development and growth up to one year of age.
