    <textblock>
      The purpose of this combined retrospective and prospective clinical study is to examine
      safety and efficacy of the ROI-C® anterior cervical interbody fusion device with VerteBRIDGE®
      plating to treat single level degenerative disc disease between C2 and T1 in the short term,
      with a focus on fusion rates.
