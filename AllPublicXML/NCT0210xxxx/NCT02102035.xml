    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of soft tissue defects in the fingers continues to be a challenge problem. The
      study reports reconstruction of small to moderate defects of the fingers with the direct and
      reversed dorsal digital island flaps and evaluates the results of the use of the flaps.The
      main outcomes are static 2-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament scores of
      the flap and joint motion.

      At final follow-up, sensory restoration of the flap is measured using the static 2-point
      discrimination (2PD) test and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test. Active motion of the
      joints is measured using a standard hand goniometer. For the direct DDIF, total active motion
      is calculated as the sum of degrees of active flexion of the interphalangeal and the
      metacarpophalangeal joints subtracted from the degrees of extension deficit. For the reversed
      DDIF, total active motion of the donor finger is calculated as the sum of degrees of active
      flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints subtracted from the degrees of
      extension deficit.

    <description>The test points are at the center of the flap. Each area is tested 3 times with a Discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). We stop at 4mm as a limit of static 2-point discrimination test and consider this normal.</description>

    <description>Active motion of the joints is measured using a standard hand goniometer. For the direct DDIF, total active motion is calculated as the sum of degrees of active flexion of the interphalangeal and the metacarpophalangeal joints subtracted from the degrees of extension deficit. For the reversed DDIF, TAM of the donor finger is calculated as the sum of degrees of active flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints subtracted from the degrees of extension deficit.</description>
