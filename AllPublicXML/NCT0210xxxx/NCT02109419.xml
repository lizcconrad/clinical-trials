  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While standard pencil-and-paper test have continued to be useful for the monitoring of
      cognition, mood, and life space (LS) in the elderly they do have considerable limitations.
      Use of these pencil-and-paper tests requires that individuals come to the clinic for
      assessments, which results in significant clinical costs and practical limitations in the
      conducting of assessments in large numbers of individuals, and provides a time consuming and
      non-automated means of quantifying and recording changes in brain function. It is
      increasingly recognized that there is a need to develop valid and reliable computer based
      assessments to allow for the remote assessment of cognition, mood, and LS. Development of
      computerized based assessments will significantly increase the scale, scope, and speed with
      which cognition, mood, and LS can be measured in the elderly.

      Helping Hands Technology LLC (HHT) has developed a number of web based assessments of
      cognition, mood, and LS. These new computerized assessments will be developed using new
      technology, and are based on the general principles found in existing pencil-and-paper based
      assessments of cognition, mood, and LS. In addition, HHT is developing proprietary means of
      reporting the results of the computerized assessments in an easy to use narrative format.
      This study will focus on quantifying the feasibility and validity of using HHT computerized
      assessments.

        Participants will undergo screening to confirm eligibility, completion of initial screening
        form, and MMSE evaluation. Study subjects meeting study criteria will then be categorized
        as being in the control (MMSE 29-30: inclusive), mild cognitive impairment (MMSE 25-28:
        inclusive), or dementia (MMSE 10-24: inclusive) categories.
