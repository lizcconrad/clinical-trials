  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty or replacement (TKA), a commonly performed surgery for osteoarthritis
      of the knee, is a painful procedure and requires a multimodal analgesic approach. A method
      for analgesia is local infiltration analgesia (LIA), where a mixture of drugs is injected
      around the knee joint.

      Adductor canal block (ACB) is an alternative regional anaesthesia technique which has been
      shown to result in minimal thigh weakness.

      The investigators aim to study if the analgesia provided by ACB is superior to LIA while
      preserving quadriceps strength.
