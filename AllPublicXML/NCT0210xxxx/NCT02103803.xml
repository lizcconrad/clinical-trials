  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal aims to describe the oculometric features present during King-Devick (K-D)
      testing for subjects who experienced sports-related concussion. The investigators aim to
      better describe the underlying oculomotor anomalies present in this cohort that lead to
      increased K-D test time. Understanding these anomalies will allow for better understanding of
      the effects of sports-related concussion and may provide a rapid and reliable metric for
      diagnosing concussion as well as monitoring long-term recovery.

      This proposal aims to describe the oculometric features present during K-D testing for
      subjects who experienced sports-related concussion. The investigators aim to better describe
      the underlying oculomotor anomalies present in this cohort that lead to increased K-D test
      time. Understanding these anomalies will allow for better understanding of the effects of
      sports-related concussion and may provide a rapid and reliable metric for diagnosing
      concussion as well as monitoring long-term recovery.

      The main objectives include:

        1. Describing the oculometric deficits present in subjects with acute sports-related
           concussion.

        2. Analyzing and quantifying the oculometric changes that occur during subject recovery.

        3. Identifying possible oculometric features as potential biomarkers that may lead to
           reliable, rapid method for recognizing acute concussion.

    <description>The King-Devick Test (K-D Test) is a two-minute test that requires an athlete to read single digit numbers displayed. Subjects will be seated in front of a computer screen and eye tracking device connected to the computer. The eye tracking device consists of infrared cameras, which captured eye movements by tracking the reflections of infrared reference lights on the subjects' retinas. Before the start of the experiment, they will begin by watching a moving target on the computer screen to calibrate the system. Then, the subject completes a computerized version of the K-D test. The K-D test requires that the subject rapidly read aloud the numbers presented on the three test cards. Reading the three test cards requires less than two minutes to complete. The number of errors will be counted. Oculometric data will be collected during the test and analyzed offline. The total time required to complete all three test cards is the completion time for the entire K-D test.</description>
