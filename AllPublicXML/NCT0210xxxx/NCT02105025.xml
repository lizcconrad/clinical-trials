      Colonoscopy is the current common method for management of colorectal diseases, and
      effectiveness of colonoscopy associate with complication rate. A lot of patients were failed
      because of technical difficulty, those required more than 10 min to intubate the cecum are
      consider as difficult colonoscopy, in such condition, specialized equipment or maneuvers may
      be required for a successful colonoscopy. Thus, it is important to set up a clinical model to
      predict the technical difficulty of the examination in preoperational stage.
