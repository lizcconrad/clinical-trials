  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the most common biliary malignancy and the second most common
      hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A majority of the CCA (50-70%) was
      presented in the area of the biliary duct bifurcation. Recent retrospective study included
      heterogeneous group of malignant diseases demonstrate that draining more than 50% of was
      associated with a longer median survival.

      However, in recent European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) biliary stenting
      clinical guideline and Asia-Pacific consensus recommendations for endoscopic and
      interventional management of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA), whether we should deployment
      bilateral or unilateral metal stent for patients with HCCA was not clearly recommended due to
      the absence of randomized controlled trials.

      Patients with advanced hilar obstruction (Bismuth III and IV), PTBS had a higher success rate
      of cholestasis palliation and a low rate of post cholangitis when compared with endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP). The advantage of percutaneous approach is the
      precise lobar selection for drainage and this approach should yield a lower rate of
      cholangitis.

      Guideline recommendation European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) biliary
      stenting clinical guideline and Asia-Pacific consensus recommendations the goal of palliative
      stenting of HCCA is drainage of adequate liver volume (50% or more), irrespective of
      unilateral, bilateral, or multi-segmental stenting was based on heterogeneous group of
      malignancy by ERCP in retrospective study.There are no randomized clinical trials compared
      with these two internal biliary drainage methods in HCCA using metal stent.

      The aim of the present study was to compare the effect and safety of bilateral versus
      unilateral stenting in patients with HCCA.
