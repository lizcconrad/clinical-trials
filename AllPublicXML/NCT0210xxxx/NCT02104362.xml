  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, HDR brachytherapy delivering only a 19 Gy fraction was proposed as exclusive
      treatment for low and intermediate risk prostate cancers. With a median 3-year follow-up, the
      Spanish team reported a biochemical control rate of 100% and 87%, respectively, for low risk
      and intermediate risk tumors. In parallel with these encouraging results regarding
      biochemical control, the authors described excellent urinary and digestive tolerance, notably
      the absence of grade &gt; 2 complications. However, it should be noted, in this study, that
      special protection was provided to the anterior aspect of the rectum by means of a 10 ml
      transperineal injection of hyaluronic acid into the prostate-rectal interspace.

      The idea of using a single high dose (in one fraction) was proposed at the MSKCC by the team
      of Fucks et al. which, in 2008, following a median 18-month follow-up, published a a 90%
      local control rate for spinal metastases after a single dose at 18 to 24 Gy.

      The aim of the present study is to analyze acute urinary and digestive toxicity (&lt; 180 days)
      observed following interstitial high dose rate prostate brachytherapy delivering a total dose
      of 20 Gy in one fraction.

      Expected benefit(s) of the trial

        -  Improved quality of life during brachytherapy on account of the absence of radioactive
           seeds in the prostate:

             -  Fewer early urinary complications,

             -  No urine filtration,

             -  No post-operative use of condoms,

             -  No 2-year ban on cremation following treatment,

        -  Health cost savings,

        -  Acquisition of dosimetric data for inverse optimization.

      Predictable risk(s) for patients Predictable risks in the context of this trial involve the
      frequency of essentially urinary disorders.

      Methodology Open, monocentric, phase I-II study.
