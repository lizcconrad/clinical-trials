    <textblock>
      The research group will choose no more than 10 patients having a lower extremity venous
      ulcer(s), less than 5cm diameter and with an estimated one month time of re-epithelization.
      In this study the investigators will follow and monitor the healing of the wound and
      effectiveness of compression therapy using bioimpedance measurement based method. The
      investigators will also treat the wounds using periodical low intensity direct current (LIDC)
      stimulation therapy.

      Bioimpedance monitoring and wound stimulation functionalities are provided by a purpose built
      wound patch. The patch features a printed 4 x 4 stimulation and impedance measurement
      electrodes array (in contact with wound surface) surrounded by a 4-part dual purpose counter
      and impedance reference electrodes (in contact with the intact skin surrounding the wound
      area).

      Objectives of the study

      Primary: Proof-of-concept study of bioimpedance measurement based method for monitoring of
      chronic wound healing and assessment of efficacy of compression therapy. Gathering
      bioimpedance data from the patients with a lower extremity ulcer of venous etiology over
      their healing process. The investigators will seek methods for processing the collected data
      to find the best correlation with visually observed healing of the wound.

      Secondary: Proof-of-concept study of periodical LIDC wound stimulation. The investigators
      will compare the LIDC enhanced healing outcome with appropriate archived data of previous
      studies performed in TAYS.

      Other: Analysis of the received data and reliability evaluation of the methods. Gathering
      relevant user feedback from medical personnel and patients.

    <measure>2-electrode bioimpedance data of wound and intact skin. 4-electrode bioimpedance data related to local interstitial fluid status of affected leg.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>We aim to determine how well bioimpedance measurement based method for monitoring of chronic wound healing and assessment of efficacy of compression therapy comply with the results of conventional wound monitoring methods.
We will measure the impedance of the wound and intact skin from multiple locations using 2-electrode configuration. To obtain this a purpose built electrode array will be placed on the wound, covering also area of intact skin. The electrode array will also be used for determining the interstitial fluid status of the leg by 4-electrode impedance measurement.</description>
