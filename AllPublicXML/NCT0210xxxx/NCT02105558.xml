      To compare the effects of epidural versus CSE anesthesia on the success of TOLAC. This will
      be a prospective clinical study randomizing 60 eligible women into either an epidural group
      or CSE group. The effects of the specific regional anesthetic on patient's individual labor
      efforts will then be closely monitored. Written informed consent shall be obtained to enroll
      the patients in either group. Pain scores and electronic medical record information will be
      used with non-identifiable coding to determine the resulting outcomes.

      Though it has been said, &quot;once a cesarean, always a cesarean,&quot; the current medical stance has
      changed and now encourages VBAC in a select population of patients. VBAC has several
      advantages over a repeat cesarean including decreased recovery period, decreased risk of
      infection, avoidance of major abdominal surgery, and lessened blood loss (1). Predictors for
      success of VBAC include previous spontaneous vaginal birth, singleton pregnancy, and previous
      low transverse scar for C-section delivery (1). TOLAC is a reasonable option for select
      pregnant women and is associated with a 74% likelihood of VBAC (3). Risk factors for failure
      of VBAC include labor dystocia, advanced maternal age, maternal obesity, fetal macrosomia,
      gestational age (GA) &gt;40 weeks, short inter pregnancy interval, and preeclampsia (1).

      While success of VBAC is associated with fewer complications, failure of VBAC may be
      associated with increased complications (1). A major concern for VBAC is the possibility for
      uterine rupture, which may result in hysterectomy and intrapartum fetal hypoxia/death.
      According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines,
      effective regional analgesia should not be expected to mask the signs and symptoms of uterine
      rupture, particularly because the most common sign of rupture is fetal heart tracing
      abnormalities. Adequate pain relief achieved with either CSE or epidurals may even encourage
      more women to opt for VBAC. The decision to proceed with TOLAC should occur only after
      appropriate discussion of the risks and benefits has occurred between the patient and her
      obstetrician and as long as no other contraindications exist. The final decision should be
      left up to the patient. There is no reliable way to predict risk of uterine rupture, but it
      may be associated with classical and low vertical uterine scars, induction of labor, and
      increased number of prior cesarean deliveries and risk may be decreased by previous vaginal
      birth (3). Other aspects of VBAC versus repeat cesarean pertaining to the fetus to consider
      include respiratory function, mother-infant contact, and initiation of breastfeeding, which
      may be delayed in cesarean deliveries (3).

      There is very little research concerning the effects of CSEs and epidurals on women
      undergoing TOLAC.There have been multiple studies comparing CSE and epidurals on nulliparous
      and multiparous women, but none have been done specifically on patients undergoing TOLAC.
      According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) practice guidelines for
      obstetric anesthesia &quot;nonrandomized comparative studies suggest that epidural analgesia may
      be used in a trial of labor for previous cesarean delivery patients without adversely
      affecting the incidence of vaginal delivery. Randomized comparison of epidural versus other
      anesthetic techniques were not found.&quot; They agree that neuraxial techniques improve the
      likelihood of vaginal delivery for patients attempting VBAC and suggest neuraxial catheter be
      placed in event of operative delivery (9). Because no study to date has compared CSEs and
      epidurals and their effects on the success of VBAC, we would like to further investigate this
      arena.

      Inclusion criteria: (all patients meeting ACOG guidelines for TOLAC) ASA ll Patients 18 years
      of age or more with at least one previous elective cesarean delivery, &lt;40 weeks gestational
      age (GA), vertex singleton pregnancy with use of continuous fetal monitoring.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients undergoing TOLAC but refusing regional anesthetic or with
      contraindication for regional anesthesia, less than 18 years of age, body mass index (BMI)
      &gt;40 or with associated comorbidities such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, abnormal
      placentation, etc.

      Specific outcomes to be looked at include:

      Primary outcome:

        -  Success of vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC)

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Success of analgesia/ maternal satisfaction (self- rated pain score of 1-10 prior to, 30
           minutes after the regional anesthetic is performed and 24 hrs post-delivery)

        -  If requiring a repeat C-section or instrumental delivery the success of regional
           anesthesia for the procedure. (self- rated pain score of 1-10 and necessity to use
           additional IV pain medication or conversion to general/ spinal anesthesia)

        -  Immediate side effects: fetal bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, hypotension
           requiring vasopressors

        -  Late side effects i.e. post dural puncture headache

      Methods:

      When the patient on the obstetric service requests an epidural for labor analgesia, a consult
      is immediately placed to the Anesthesia service. Patients who request neuraxial anesthesia
      for labor analgesia will then be screened for the study. Written informed consent shall be
      obtained from the patient prior to enrollment in this prospective randomized clinical study.
      The regional anesthetics will be placed by the obstetrical anesthesia team at Lyndon B.
      Johnson Hospital, a well-established partner of the University of Texas Medical School at
      Houston and a facility capable of performing an emergent C-section if necessary. Patients
      shall be randomized via computer generated randomization sequence and assigned a separate
      study number different from their medical record number. The study code and medical record
      number (MRN) will be saved on a linking log on a password protected drive. Standard ASA
      monitors will be applied to all patients including non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse
      oximetry and fetal heart monitors. Patients will be bolused with 1 liter of lactated ringer's
      (LR) prior to the procedure via intravenous catheters. In the epidural group, epidurals will
      be placed in a sterile fashion using a 17g Tuohy needle to locate the epidural space via
      loss-of-resistance to saline at the lumbar vertebral level. 3 ml of 1.5% lidocaine with
      5ug/ml of epinephrine will then be used for test dose to exclude intrathecal or intravenous
      placement of the catheter. Epidural solution composed of 5ml of 0.2% ropivacaine and another
      5 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine will then be administered. In the CSE arm, the epidural space will
      again be located with a 17g Tuohy needle and dural puncture performed with 25g Pencan needle
      via needle-through-needle technique. Spinal injection of 2ml 0.2% ropivacaine will then be
      performed and spinal needle removed. An epidural catheter will then be placed and test dose
      performed with 3 ml of 1.5% lidocaine with 5ug/ml of epinephrine. Maintenance dose will be
      via an epidural pump using 0.2% ropivacaine at a rate of 12 ml/hr. Self-determined numeric
      pain scores will be obtained prior to and after placement of the regional anesthetic and
      after delivery by nursing staff. Analgesia will be considered successful if the numerical
      pain score value is 3 or less.

      Data collection will be performed via pain scores obtained prior to and following placement
      of the regional anesthetic and establishment of analgesia, along with data on maternal
      satisfaction. Electronic medical records will also be used to gather the resulting outcomes.

        -  date and time at which the following occur:

        -  spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD)

        -  c-section

        -  instrumentation Maternal Satisfaction

        -  pain relief

        -  childbirth experience

      Data Analysis Plan:

      Power Analysis Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in success of VBAC between
      epidurals and CSEs for women undergoing TOLAC. Our alternative hypothesis is that CSE will
      result in more successful VBAC than will epidurals.The success rate of VBAC is around 74%.
      Based on the literature, we expect the success rate with CSE to increase by 20-25%;
      therefore, given our sample size of 60, we will have 80% power to detect a difference between
      the two groups.

      Primary Outcome The primary outcome, success for VBAC, will be assessed using χ2 or the
      Fisher Exact test, in case of cell sizes &lt;5, to determine if the difference in success rates
      between the two analgesia groups, CSE and epidural, is statistically significant. Logistic
      regression analysis will be used to adjust for potential confounders and other factors
      associated success or failure of VBAC.

      Secondary Outcomes The secondary outcome, success of analgesia, as measured by pain score on
      a scale of 1 to 10, will be assessed using ANOVA. Difference in mean pain score between the
      two groups will be determined in a model with the continuous/count variable pain score as the
      dependent variable and analgesia group as the independent variable. Categorical outcomes,
      including success of regional anesthesia for patients requiring C-section or instrumental
      delivery, immediate side effects, and late side effects will be evaluated using χ2 or the
      Fisher Exact test.
