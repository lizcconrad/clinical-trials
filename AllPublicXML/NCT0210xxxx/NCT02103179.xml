      The investigators study the VEGF signaling in ECC cell lines,patients and its mechanism in
      ECC growth, proliferation and apoptosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have documented the elevated expression of VEGF, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in cancer
      cell lines. Another study observed a sequential elevation of VEGF in low-grade dysplasia,
      high-grade dysplasia and early stage liver cancer. Clinical analyses have discovered the high
      expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis
      and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF
      signaling in ECC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating ECC growth.Therefore,we try
      to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in ECC growth,proliferation and apoptosis.

      Cut tissue into small pieces (~2 mm2)and wash in drops of saline (1x PBS). Place pieces
      individually into LN2 in Styrofoam cup. Transfer pieces into LN2-cooled 1.5 mL cryovial. Pour
      out excess LN2 from vial, then seal and keep in LN2 until freezer storage.
