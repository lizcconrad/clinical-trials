  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial trigger point is one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal disorders.
      Myofascial trigger point in upper trapezius has been reported as a symptom in patients with
      neck and upper thoracic pain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prolonged
      effect of dry needling on myofascial trigger point in upper trapezius muscle.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Presence of a palpable taut band in muscle.

          -  2. Presence of a hypersensitive tender spot in the taut band.

          -  3. Reproduction of the typical referred pain pattern of the MTP in response to
             compression. To detect active TrPs, TrP pressure tolerance was assessed using a
             mechanical pressure algometer. The investigator applied continuous pressure with the
             algometer with an approximate pressure of 2.5 kg/cm2.

          -  4. Spontaneous presence of the typical referred pain pattern and/or patient
             recognition of the referred pain as familiar.

          -  5- Pain of at least 30 mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The selected MTP of the UT
             muscle was located in the middle of the more nearly horizontal fibers of the UT 40.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  had a history of fibromyalgia syndrome, whiplash injury, cervical spine surgery and
             fracture, cervical radiculopathy, having therapy within the past month before the
             study

          -  any systematic disease such as rheumatism and tuberculosis or cervical myelopathy,
             multiple sclerosis

          -  local infection,

          -  pregnancy

          -  taking anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin)

          -  long-term steroid using
