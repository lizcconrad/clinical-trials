      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of azilsartan tablets (Azilva Tablets)
      in patients with hypertension complicated by diabetes mellitus whose blood pressure cannot be
      sufficiently reduced by monotherapy with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) other than
      azilsartan, in routine clinical practice

      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of azilsartan tablets (Azilva Tablets) in
      patients with hypertension complicated by diabetes mellitus whose blood pressure cannot be
      sufficiently reduced by monotherapy with ARBs, other than azilsartan, in daily medical
      practice.

      Subject enrollment will be started on April 1, 2014. The usual dosage for adults is 20 mg of
      azilsartan administered orally once daily. The dose can be adjusted according to the
      patient's age and condition. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.
