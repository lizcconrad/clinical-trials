  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of our study is to identify the first genetic etiology of primary
      Premature Ejaculation (PE). We will test and evaluate the existence of genetic determinism
      conferring susceptibility to a life-long syndrome (primary premature ejaculation) in some
      patients. To this end, we plan to establish a collection of biological samples and a database
      of patients with this extreme syndrome, which we will analyze by Genome Wide analysis. This
      will lead to improvements in the biological understanding, the &quot;knowledge&quot; of physicians of
      the disease, and should improve the patients' quality of life. Not all PE cases have the same
      physiopathology and treatment efficiency, which depend on the specific mechanism involved in
      the clinical context. Our work will make it possible to develop new therapeutic approaches
      suitable for a large proportion of individuals presenting PE. This integrative approach
      combining researchers, patients and ethics committees will facilitate profound reflection,
      promoting the creation of suitable structures capable of receiving patients for appropriate
      consultations. This unique study of PE should also favor industrial partnerships.

      2.1 Main Objective

        -  To identify the molecular basis of primary premature ejaculation (PPE) in humans for the
           development of new adapted therapy.

        -  Check and confirm the genetic hypothesis of PPE to fill the void of genetic knowledge
           about this syndrome.

        -  Improve knowledge of physicians on this disease to increase the comfort of life of
           patients.

      2.2 Secondary Objectives

        -  Provide the basis for new therapeutic approaches.

        -  Expanded knowledge of the aetiology of PE and allow better management of patients.

        -  Develop strategies to prevent the consequences, sometimes severe , of this condition on
           the intimate, personal, social and professional life of these patients. Because all the
           PE do not have the same pathophysiology and treatment success depends on its relevance
           to the specific mechanism of the clinical form concerned.

        -  Increase the comfort of life of the patients.

        -  Eliminate public prejudice based on misconceptions.

    <description>We will perform WES (Whole Exome Sequencing) to identify shared defective genes in 20 patients. In case of genetic uniformity and of a genetically homogeneous recruitment, we hope to highlight such a gene in several individuals. As primary PE are very rare, this group should have defective genes at much higher frequencies than in the control population (NCBI, 1000 genome and housing-genome). This will allow us to identify genetic mutations of susceptibility to primary PE.</description>
