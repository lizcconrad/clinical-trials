  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to determine whether a family history of psychosis is
      associated with an altered cannabinoid system. This will be tested by studying individuals
      with and without a family history of psychosis and comparing their responses to delta
      9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a probe of the cannabinoid system. We hypothesize, that
      compared to controls with no family history of psychoses, individuals with a family history
      of psychoses will have an altered response to THC.

    <measure>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS)</measure>

    <measure>Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>-30 min, +15 min, +80 min, +150 min, +240 min</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptual alterations will be measured using the CADSS. This is a scale consisting of 19 self-report items and 8 clinician-rated items (0=not at all, 4=extremely). The scale captures alterations in environmental/time/body perception, feelings of unreality, and memory impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>-30 min, +15 min, +80 min, +150 min, +240 min</time_frame>
    <description>Feeling states associated with cannabis intoxication will be measured using a self-reported visual analogue scale of four feeling states (&quot;high&quot;, &quot;anxious&quot;, &quot;calm and relaxed&quot;, and &quot;tired&quot;) associated with cannabis effects. Subjects will be asked to score the perceived intensity of these feeling states at that moment on a 11 mm line (0=not at all, 100=extremely). These data will be captured to validate that the experiment is relevant to cannabis effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>+50 min</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT is a 12 word list that is semantically organized. The task consists of 5 trials, an interference list, and free delayed recall and recognition. A different version of the AVLT will be administered on each test day and counterbalanced across subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>-30 min, +240 min</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI is a measure of drug induced psychotomimetic states. This self-report scale consists of 28 items rated 0 (not at all) to 3 (extremely) and will facilitate the characterization of a wide range of dissociative/hallucinatory phenomena as well as cognitive disorganization associated with the administration of THC.</description>
