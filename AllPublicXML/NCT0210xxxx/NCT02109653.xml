  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of novel BRAF (B-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) inhibitor encorafenib
      (LGX818) when used as single agent in patients with advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB or IV)
      BRAF V600 mutant NSCLC. Patients must have progressed on or after at least one previous
      systemic, anti-cancer therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
