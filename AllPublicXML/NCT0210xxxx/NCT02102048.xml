  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association between HIV infection , insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus is the topic
      of many studies that have attempted to analyze the problem from different points of view. In
      fact, the risk of insulin resistance in HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy seems
      to depend not only on the same factors that determine its incidence in the general population
      , but also on the effects of antiretroviral therapy on glucose metabolism. To confirm this
      observation, studies that have evaluated the incidence of diabetes in patients with HIV
      infection on antiretroviral therapy have shown that the incidence of diabetes in infected
      individuals is significantly higher than that observed in the uninfected population. Moreover
      others preliminar stadies observed that protease inhibitors may induce hyperglycemia and
      diabetes mellitus. Anyway at this moment no large data are available that indicate the
      utility to modify the antiretroviral therapy in HIV positive patients with a damage of
      glucose metabolism.

      ATAGLU is a cohort composed by HIV positive patients in effective and stable combined
      antiretroviral therapy (cART) with undetectable viral load. All patients studied had carried
      out a therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) + optimal backbone therapy (OBT) and then in
      part switch to Atazanavir (ATV) + OBT or Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) + OBT , in part
      continue with LPV/r + OBT .

      The objective was to characterize the changes of carbohydrate profile of a cohort of patients
      who made a switch from a regimen with LPV/r to boosted or unboosted ATV.
