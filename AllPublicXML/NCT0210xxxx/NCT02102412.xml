      A clinical study in Zagreb Croatia, intended to evaluate the Aer-O-Scope Colonoscope System.
      The study includes 120 subjects and has the following endpoints:

      Evaluation of the Aer-O-Scope advancement, imaging and retraction throughout the Colon.

      Safety: No occurrence of any device related major adverse event (for details see section 9.5)

      Efficacy:

        1. Advancement of device towards the ceacum and retraction

        2. Visualization of the colon mucosa by the traveling imaging device

        3. Procedure duration

        4. Handling and operation (assessment by operator)
