      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of OPC-1085EL ophthalmic
      solution in comparison with latanoprost ophthalmic solution in subjects who are
      insufficiently responsive to latanoprost ophthalmic solution.

    <description>Comparison of each group in intraocular pressure at Week 8 Predose. The number of subjects showed in the Participant Flow comes from all the subjects administered IMP. For efficacy analysis, on the other hand, several subjects were excluded from the analysis according to the statistical analysis plan. For example, subjects without IOP after administration were excluded. In addition, IOP measurement at 8 hours was not mandatory. That is why there are differences between the number in the Participant Flow and Outcome.</description>

For efficacy analysis, on the other hand, several subjects were excluded from the analysis according to the statistical analysis plan. For example, subjects without IOP after administration were excluded. In addition, IOP measurement at 8 hours was not mandatory. That is why there are differences between the number in the Participant Flow and Outcome.</description>
