  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive Bladder (OAB) is a chronic condition defined as urgency with or without
      incontinence usually associated with frequency and nocturia. It is a common condition
      affecting 15-45% of adults and constitutes a significant proportion of patients attending
      urogynaecology clinics. OAB is known to have a significant impact on the physical, social and
      emotional quality of life and sexual function in women. The treatment of OAB is initially
      conservative with bladder training followed by pharmacotherapy.

      Evidence from a recent Cochrane review on treatment of OAB suggests that the efficacy of
      anticholinergics in treatment of OAB is enhanced when combined with BT. Women who fail to
      improve with these initial measures are offered Intravesical Botox or neuromodulation in the
      form of Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) or Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS).

      PTNS has also been shown to more effective than pharmacotherapy with anticholinergics. In
      2010 National Institute of Clinical Excellences (NICE) issued guidance stating '&quot;PTNS for OAB
      demonstrates effectiveness without major safety concerns&quot;

      We hypothesise that the outcome of PTNS will improve if the PTNS sessions are combined with
      bladder training (BT).

    <description>A needle electrode insertion site is located on the inner aspect of either leg approximately three fingerbreadths (5 cm or 2&quot;) cephalad to the medial malleolus and approximately one fingerbreadth (2 cm or ¾&quot;) posterior to the tibia. The needle electrode head is gently tapped to pierce the skin, maintaining a 60° angle, and insert to a depth of approximately 2cm. The electrode is then connected to the stimulator and the current setting needed is determined by the test mode on the stimulator. Once the current setting is known, the stimulator is started on the therapy mode which delivers the current for 30 minutes and shuts off automatically after 30 minutes. The needle is then removed and stimulator disconnected. The treatment involves twelve weekly sessions of 30 minutes each.</description>
