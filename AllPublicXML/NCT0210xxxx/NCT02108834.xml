  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For more than 25 years, Regional Anesthesia has challenged anesthesiologists to determine
      whether it offers real benefits in terms of patient outcome from major surgery, compared with
      general anesthesia. Although it is clear that regional analgesia in association with general
      anesthesia substantially reduces postoperative pain, the benefits in terms of overall
      perioperative outcome are controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect on
      short and long-term postoperative outcomes of adding regional analgesia to general
      anaesthesia in thoridetomic patients.

      Patients who are divided into two treatment groups: (a) a bilateral superficial cervical
      plexus group (group S) and a control group (group C).We performe bilateral superficial
      cervical plexus block (BSCPB)with 0.25-0.75% ropivacaine10 ml to group S and 10ml NaCl 0.9%
      to group C. All BSCPB is performed by experienced anesthesia doctor after a standardized
      induction of general anaesthesia.eneral anaesthesia was induced by using intravenously with
      midazolam,propofol, fentanyl, cisatracurium is injected IV to facilitate orotracheal
      intubation. After a standardized induction of general anaesthesia, patients receive Regional
      Anesthesia at the discretion of the experienced anesthesiologist who was blinded to
      treatment.

      The patient is placed in a supine position with the head turned away from the side to be
      blocked, and then the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) is identified by slight head
      elevation. SCPB is performed with a 26-gauge needle that is inserted at the midpoint of the
      posterior border of the SCM muscle and the needle is advanced just past the SCM muscle.
