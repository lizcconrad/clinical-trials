      The purpose of this study is to carry out a high-level treatment efficacy study on children
      with speech sound disorders with motor speech involvement (SSD-MSI) using a well-controlled
      Randomized Controlled Trial design.

      The intervention of choice is the Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets
      (PROMPT) approach, which has been effective in treating motor speech disorders in adults and
      in children with autism and cerebral palsy.

      The results of this study will allow us to determine if there is a causal relationship
      between PROMPT treatment and outcome measures and predict how much improvement can be
      expected from this therapy. This study is being conducted as a part of a multicenter clinical
      trial in the province of Ontario, Canada with three sites: The John McGivney Children's
      Centre in Windsor, The ErinoakKids Centre for Treatment and Development in Mississauga, and
      The Speech and Stuttering Institute in Toronto.

      The study integrity will be monitored by an arms-length, external agency, The Applied Health
      Research Centre (AHRC) at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. The study is coordinated by the
      Department of Speech-Language Pathology at the University of Toronto and funded by the PROMPT
      Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

    <description>The PROMPT approach utilizes a motor-speech hierarchy (MSH) to guide speech language pathologists (SLP) in selecting speech movement goals for treatment. PROMPT treatment generally proceeds systematically in a bottom-up fashion starting with the lowest subsystem in the hierarchy where a child has control issues. Furthermore, in the PROMPT approach specific techniques are used to stimulate sensory input that are assumed to facilitate the formation of sensory-motor pathways required for the acquisition and accurate production of speech movement patterns. As the speech motor behaviors are established, the clinician reduces the number of cues and the frequency and immediacy of feedback and practices transfer and generalization activities.</description>
