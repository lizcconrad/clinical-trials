  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative intravenous fluid management practice varies greatly between
      anesthesiologists. Postoperative fluid based weight gain is associated with major morbidity.
      Postoperative respiratory complications are associated with increased morbidity, mortality
      and hospital costs. The literature shows conflicting data regarding intraoperative fluid
      resuscitation volume. No large-scale studies have focused on intraoperative fluid management
      and postoperative respiratory dysfunction.

      Hypotheses:

      Primary - Liberal intraoperative fluid resuscitation is associated with an increased risk of
      30 day mortality Secondary - Liberal intraoperative fluid resuscitation is associated with
      increased likelihood of postoperative respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, reintubation,
      atelectasis, acute kidney injury and peri-extubation oxygen desaturation.
