  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop and test Customized Care, an intervention to help
      patients dealing with depression and/or anxiety in the context of multiple chronic
      conditions. Customized Care is designed to help patients communicate about important issues,
      such as financial and safety concerns, with their primary care providers (PCPs). The
      intervention will be delivered in patient waiting rooms prior to a routine follow-up visit
      with the PCP. Phase 1 of the project will ensure that the main components of Customized Care
      are acceptable to patients and PCPs. Phase 2 will include a pilot study to test the effects
      of Customized Care on patient-PCP communication.

      Participants aged 40 years or older who have a diagnosis of two or more common chronic
      medical conditions will be recruited from primary care clinics. Patients screening positive
      for either depression or anxiety will be randomized to Customized Care vs. an active control.

      The investigators hypothesize that the Customized Care will improve patient-Primary
      Care-Provider communication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with depression or anxiety in the context of multimorbidity (2 or more chronic
      conditions such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Arthritis, COPD, Asthma) are often preoccupied
      with day-to-day concerns related to issues such as finances, safety and functional ability.
      Determining which issues to discuss, and when to discuss it, is always difficult in the
      15-minute primary care visit, but it is especially challenging when patients have multiple
      diagnoses, symptoms and concerns.

      In this application the investigators will develop and test the feasibility of Customized
      Care, an intervention that capitalizes on decision technology and will be deployed in primary
      care waiting rooms. The investigators will assess whether customized care will improve
      outcomes among patients with depression and/or anxiety in the context of multimorbidity.
      Customized Care consists of two different components designed to improve health outcomes by
      improving patient-provider communication. The first component is a computer-based discussion
      prioritization tool (DPT). The DPT forces patients to make trade-offs between competing
      concerns to help them determine which are the most important to discuss. The second component
      is a customized question prompt list (QPL) to help patients communicate their priorities to
      the PCP. The QPL will be generated after patients use the DPT, and consists of question
      prompts tailored to the patients' priorities.

      When patients express their day-to-day concerns, and PCPs become aware of these concerns, the
      patient-provider alliance can deepen. In addition, patient motivation (perceived autonomy,
      competence) to manage those everyday concerns and engage in care for chronic disease and
      associated mental health conditions will increase. This project will lay the ground work for
      a larger randomized trial to assess whether customized care can improve mental health
      outcomes among patients with multimorbidity.

      The specific aims are:

        1. To assess usability of the Customized Care components (the DPT and QPL)

        2. To assess feasibility of Customized Care in primary care settings

        3. To conduct a pilot study of the effects of Customized Care on patient-PCP communication

    <description>Before the office visit with the PCP, patient participants in the intervention group will interact with the computer based components of the customized care intervention while in the waiting room. The research staff will help the participant use an iPad in the waiting room and direct them to the Discussion Prioritization tool (DPT). After participants use the DPT, the program automatically generates a customized questions prompt list (QPL) which will be printed out in the office. Study staff will hand the QPL to intervention patients to bring to their office visit with the PCP. Consented patient-participants will be told that the subsequent office visit with the PCP will be audio-recorded to assess patient-PCP communication.</description>
